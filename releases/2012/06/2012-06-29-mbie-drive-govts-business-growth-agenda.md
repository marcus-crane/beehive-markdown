The new Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment commences operations on Monday and will ensure New Zealand has clear, co-ordinated and focused government policy leadership with a commitment to economic growth and innovation, Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce says.

“A more efficient and effective single Ministry focused on lifting overall productivity and supporting the growth of competitive businesses is a crucial element in the Government’s Business Growth Agenda to create more jobs and higher wages, and boost our standard of living," Mr Joyce says.

MBIE will absorb the functions of the Ministry of Economic Development, the Department of Labour, the Ministry of Science and Innovation, and the Department of Building and Housing.

The new Ministry will initially be a ‘federation’ of the four existing agencies, under Acting Chief Executive David Smol and the previously announced senior leadership team. A detailed organisational design and implementation plan is being developed by 30 September.

“The Government’s comprehensive Business Growth Agenda aims to make it easier for businesses and companies to access the innovative ideas, markets, capital, skilled workers, resources, and the supporting public infrastructure they need to grow and create jobs.

“A single focused business-facing ministry will help lift momentum on our agenda as well as reducing the complexity and duplication involved in working between government agencies, and between multiple agencies and business.

“MBIE will help the Government deliver integrated policies that allow business to do business and build a more competitive and internationally-focused economy.”
