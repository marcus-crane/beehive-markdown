Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples says he is pleased to hear that the Chinese buyers of the former Crafar farms, and representatives of Maori trusts with ancestral links to two of the farms, have confirmed they are in negotiations.

“I had heard informally that discussions were taking place, and I understand that has now been confirmed.

“Any agreement is a matter between the parties, and the Government is not involved in negotiations.

“It is up to the parties to decide when and how they might release details of their agreement, and I will not be making any further comment.

“Having just come back from China, I can say that there is mutual interest in business dealings between Maori and China.

“Both sides see opportunities arising out of relationships of respect and understanding based on the shared cultural values of Maori and Chinese people.

“These enhanced relationships are something that will benefit not just Maori, but all New Zealanders, as well as Chinese interests wanting to do business in New Zealand” said Dr Sharples.
