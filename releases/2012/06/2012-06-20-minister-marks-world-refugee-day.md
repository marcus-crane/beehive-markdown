Immigration Minister Nathan Guy has acknowledged World Refugee Day and says New Zealand can be proud of its humanitarian contribution.

This year, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) theme is ‘one refugee without hope is too many’.

“It is a tragedy that the work of the UNHCR is still necessary for so many families and individuals, but we can be proud of the role New Zealand plays in helping people who have had their lives torn apart.

“New Zealand began resettling Polish refugees in 1944, and since then has given around 33,000 refugees the opportunity to seek a better future.

“Through the annual quota of 750 refugees, our refugee and protection determination processes, and our family reunification policies, we continue to give refugees an opportunity to start a new life, to put down roots, and to make New Zealand their new home.

“I am proud of our good record and this is well recognised internationally. When the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, António Guterres, visited New Zealand in February this year he said that he remains very impressed with our on-going commitment to refugee protection.”

World Refugee Day is recognised by over 100 countries, and a range of community events will be happening around New Zealand, including cultural performances, fairs, soccer matches and movie screenings.
