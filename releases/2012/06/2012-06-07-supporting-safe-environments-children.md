New funding announced in the 2012 Budget, to provide $3 million each year to help create safe and nurturing environments for children, was launched today by Associate Social Development Minister Tariana Turia in Hastings.

Mrs Turia said, “Te Punanga Haumaru aims to assist whānau and communities to create safe environments”.

“Providing safe and nurturing environments from an early age will support children to develop skills and build healthy relationships. It is about ensuring that our tamariki have the best start in life and are provided with positive supports”.

We know that bullying behaviour and aggression can have a serious impact on brain development and learning. It can also impact later in life through learning and behavioural problems, mental health issues and drug and alcohol issues”.

“If children grow up in environments where aggression and bullying is accepted, they have less chance of having positive relationships with their own partners or children. This funding will support communities to create a safe and nurturing environment for all whānau members, especially children”.
