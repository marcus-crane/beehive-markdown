Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Steven Joyce and Minister of Education Hekia Parata today announced five Vocational Pathways to support young people progressing from school into tertiary training and a career.

“The Vocational Pathways bring together the standards and skills recommended by five broad sectors of industry and link these to study and employment possibilities. They show young people how their skills and knowledge will be valued in the ‘real world’ when they look for a job and start their career,” Mr Joyce says.

The new Vocational Pathways have been developed for five broad sectors of industry, covering a significant proportion of the current and future workforce. They are: Construction and Infrastructure, Manufacture and Technology, The Primary Industries, The Service Industries, Social and Community Services.

“Many young people need a clearer sense of direction about how to get to where they want to go.  We’ve worked with industry and educators to bring together new and clear pathways to give learners a wide range of work and study options,” Ms Parata says.

*“*Vocational Pathways use the existing NCEA framework and standards to provide new ways to structure and achieve NCEA level 2, which is recognised as the passport for success in further study and employment.

“Lifting student achievement and ensuring that all young people leave school with the skills they need to reach their potential is vital to families, communities and to the economy.”

Mr Joyce says educators and employers have been asking for a clear and consistent framework for vocational education.

“The Vocational Pathways identify the real knowledge and skill requirements of a number of key industry sectors, providing certainty to learners and their families that their subject choices are relevant and connected to employment opportunities,” Mr Joyce says.

The effective implementation of Vocational Pathways will contribute to achieving the Better Public Services education targets announced this week of 85% of young people attaining NCEA level 2 or equivalent and 55% of 25 to 34 year olds gaining a level 4 or above qualification.

“We want to make sure that young people are achieving qualifications, and being given every opportunity to progress to higher levels of education, whether that is in a polytechnic or through industry training and apprenticeships.  Vocational Pathways will ensure that young people have the right mix of skills to get a job or undertake higher level vocational training at a polytechnic or PTE,” Mr Joyce says.

The Vocational Pathways are being released in draft to allow for feedback.  The final Vocational Pathways will be published in November 2012.
