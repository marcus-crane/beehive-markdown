Education Minister Hekia Parata has today announced the appointments to the inaugural board of the new Crown-owned company to operate and manage the Network for Learning.

Helen Robinson has been appointed as Chair and Mark Yeoman Deputy Chair.

Martin Wylie, Rick Shera, Linda Tame and Humphrey Wikeepa have been appointed as directors of the board of Network for Learning Limited.

Ms Parata says she is confident that the mix of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), commercial, governance and education skills and experience on the board will ensure the Network for Learning is delivered to schools progressively from mid 2013 as planned.

Network for Learning Limited will be established on July 2, 2012 as a separate entity with its own chief executive but will have an on-going relationship with the Ministry of Education.

“The first task for the new board will be to identify a chief executive and together they will lead the negotiations to finalise a contract with a network services supplier by the end of the year,” says Ms Parata.

“With a board and chief executive in place we will be even closer to delivering an online network for schools that will enable improved access to education resources for learners and help lift student achievement.’’
