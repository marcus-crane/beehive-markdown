Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee has welcomed today’s green-lighting of the Transmission Gully project, saying the project is an exciting and important milestone not only for the Wellington region but also for New Zealand’s national state highway network.

“An alternative state highway route into the capital through Transmission Gully has been talked about for decades, and the Board of Inquiry’s final decision to approve the regulatory consent applications will allow the NZ Transport Agency to take the project to the next stage,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The Wellington region has been waiting for this day since early last century when the project was first floated, so I’m thrilled to hear a route through Transmission Gully is now set to become a reality.”

Wellington is currently reliant on a two-lane highway that has trouble coping in peak times, and is vulnerable to closure in the event of crashes and natural disasters.

“Our capital city deserves better if it’s to reach its full economic potential, and the Transmission Gully route will help to unlock that potential.

“The new highway will not only provide a safer, more secure strategic route into and out of Wellington, it will also dramatically improve travel times between the Kapiti Coast and Wellington as well as providing a more direct link to State Highway 58, the Hutt Valley and Porirua.”

Mr Brownlee noted that Wellington’s population was expected to increase by around 65,000 between 2010 and 2030, largely on the Kapiti Coast and Wellington City.

“Transmission Gully will provide a crucial improved link that would cater for the increased traffic and freight demands that come with a growing city.

“I want to thank the NZ Transport Agency and Porirua City Council for their extensive work in investigations, refining the design of the route and preparing for the Board of Inquiry.

“This hard work had helped to reduce the expected cost by around $170 million, from $1.1 billion in today’s dollars to $930 million.

Mr Brownlee says the current highways programme is one of New Zealand’s biggest ever infrastructure investments and is a key part of the Government’s National Infrastructure Plan and recognised in the Government Policy Statement on Land Transport Funding. The Government intends to invest nearly $11 billion in new State Highway Infrastructure over the next 10 years.

Transmission Gully is part of the Wellington Northern Corridor Road of National Significance, which stretches from Wellington Airport and up the Kapiti Coast. The Wellington Northern Corridor is one of seven roads of national significance which the Government has identified as essential state highways which require upgrading to reduce congestion, improve safety and support economic growth.
