Minister for Disability Issues Hon Tariana Turia, and Internal Affairs Minister Hon Chris Tremain are encouraging marae to utilise an excellent resource for enhancing accessibility on the marae, Te Whakaāheitanga Marae Kua Wātea te Huarahi.

This marae accessibility toolkit was put together by people from CCS Disability Action Waikato, Community Waikato, Hauraki Maori Trust Board, and Waikato District Health Board.

Mrs Turia said “Our marae are a cornerstone of our identity as Maori. They are the place we go to meet and gather, a place to mourn those we have lost, and a place which connects us to our wider hapu, iwi, and whanau”.

“Many people with disabilities face difficulties participating in activities on the marae, and I know that many marae across Aotearoa are working hard to increase the accessibility of their facilities, to ensure that every member of their community is able to take part in hapu affairs.

“This marae accessibility toolkit provides information on how to make marae accessible for everyone, regardless of whatever impairment they may have. In addition to checklists for different areas of the marae, the toolkit provides useful references and links.”

“It is a wonderful resource, that will assist marae to ensure that all whanau can participate in hui and other important marae-based activities,” says Minister Turia.

Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain hails the toolkit as a positive step forward.

The Lottery Marae Heritage and Facilities National Lottery Distribution Committee, administered by the Department of Internal Affairs, distributes funding towards marae capital works and conservation initiatives. Accessibility to marae is a top priority for the Committee.

“I commend the accessibility toolkit for marae planning to improve facilities, or build new facilities. Application of the toolkit’s principles will certainly help them to demonstrate commitment to accessibility when it comes to applying for funding support from the Committee,” says Mr Tremain.

Te Whakaaheitanga Marae Kua Wātea te Huarahi is now available through two government websites, as well as the Waikato District Health board:
