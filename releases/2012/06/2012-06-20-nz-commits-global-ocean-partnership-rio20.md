New Zealand has signed up to a global partnership on oceans at the Rio+20 conference in Brazil, Environment Minister Amy Adams announced today.

New Zealand joins nine other countries in the partnership, including Australia, South Korea and Norway.

The partnership also includes 63 other organisations, including fishing and seafood companies and non-governmental organisations such as WWF.

“The concept behind this partnership is exciting - looking for new ways for states, business, researchers, and conservationists to combine their expertise to support healthy and productive oceans,” Ms Adams says.

The partnership has three themes; better management of fisheries, protecting marine environments and addressing pollution.

“Fishing and tourism are major sectors of our economy which rely on healthy oceans.

“Sustainability is central to our ability to harness the economic potential of the oceans now and in the future. We led the world in creating tradable quotas for fishing, which give secure access rights while managing the overall size of the catch, based on sound science.

“Marine protection is an important part of the partnership's focus with an international target of having 10 per cent of oceans in a network of marine protected areas.

“New Zealand is continuing to create marine parks, and we have introduced new legislation to manage the environmental effects of activities in our Exclusive Economic Zone.

“It is pleasing to see that globally, sustainable oceans are getting a high level of focus, and we are pleased to see concerted global action on marine pollution.”
