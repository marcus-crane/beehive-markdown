Civil Defence Minister Chris Tremain and Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew have announced they will be hosting a volunteers’ forum in Christchurch on 25 June. This will enable volunteers to discuss the challenges they faced providing assistance during the earthquakes.

“Some volunteers have expressed concern about the way in which they were dealt with by authorities involved in emergency management,” says Mr Tremain.

“The forum is a response to those concerns and provides the opportunity for authorities to listen to what volunteers have to say.

“There are some valuable lessons to learn from the Canterbury earthquakes and this forum aims to find ways for volunteers and authorities to work better together.”

The information gathered during the forum will be used by the Ministry of Civil Defence to revise and develop guidance provided to councils about how they can work better with volunteers.

“The Government recognises the vital role volunteers play in responding to civil defence emergencies and building stronger communities. We are working to reduce barriers to volunteering and make it easier for people to participate. This forum is an important step in that process,” says Mrs Goodhew.
