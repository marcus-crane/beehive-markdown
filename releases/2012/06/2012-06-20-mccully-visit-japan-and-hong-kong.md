Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will travel to Tokyo on Sunday to mark 60 years of diplomatic relations between New Zealand and Japan.

In Tokyo, Mr McCully will hold discussions with Foreign Minister Gemba on the bilateral relationship, including developments in the defence, aviation and double taxation arrangements, regional economic and security issues, and development cooperation in the Pacific and Afghanistan.

Mr McCully will meet a range of other influential ministers, political figures and opinion leaders.

He will also visit Toyama for the dedication of a memorial sculpture by New Zealand artist Annabel Menzies-Joyce for the 28 Japanese who lost their lives in the Christchurch earthquake. A matching sculpture was unveiled in Christchurch in February.

“I am looking forward to discussing diplomatic, trade and business opportunities relating to the 2019 Rugby World Cup with the President of the Japan Rugby Football Union, former Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, and announcing a 60th anniversary scholarship for a rugby player or coach from the tsunami-affected Tohoku region,” Mr McCully says.

On June 26, Mr McCully will make a brief stop in Hong Kong where, as the guest of honour at a New Zealand Chamber of Commerce luncheon, he will give a speech on New Zealand’s relationship with China.
