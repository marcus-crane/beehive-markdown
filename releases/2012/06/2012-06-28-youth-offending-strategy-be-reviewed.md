Associate Justice Minister Chester Borrows today announced an extensive review of the 2002 Youth Offending Strategy.

“If we are going to deliver the reduction in youth crime the Government has committed to in our Better Public Service Targets, we need to drive practical and co-ordinated change across the youth justice sector.

“While we already have a youth justice system among the best in the world, we know there are some areas we can do a lot better.  This review will identify those areas, and give realistic solutions to improve the way we deliver youth justice,” says Mr Borrows.

Key areas which the review will consider include:

- How to get young people out of the youth justice system sooner, and keep them out;
- Ways to address the overrepresentation of Māori in youth offending;
- Improving the way Government agencies involved with youth justice work together and share information; and
- How to encourage and support whānau and community groups in providing local solutions to youth offending.

“The review will also link in with other work around youth justice, such as improving Youth Offending Teams, Family Group Conferences, and responses to child offending.  With the multifaceted problems faced by many youth offenders, we need a unified and consistent approach across the sector if we want to see real gains.

“None of the issues in youth justice are easy fixes – issues like turning young lives around and Māori overrepresentation in youth justice are a real challenge.  But the Government and the sector are up for the challenge, and these issues are too important to put in the too-hard basket,” says Mr Borrows.

The review will be completed by early 2013, and full terms of reference will be available later this year.
