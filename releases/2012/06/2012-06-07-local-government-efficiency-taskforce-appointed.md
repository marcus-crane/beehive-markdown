Local Government Minister David Carter has announced an independent taskforce to help build greater efficiency within the local government framework.

The eight-member taskforce is one of the initiatives outlined in the *Better Local Government* reform programme announced earlier this year.

“The Local Government Efficiency Taskforce will focus on improvements to local government consultation, planning and financial reporting requirements and practices,” says Mr Carter.

“This will feed into the broader reform programme which aims to provide clarity around the role of councils, stronger governance and improved efficiency and financial management.”

The Taskforce will be chaired by Auckland environmental and public law specialist, Michael Holm. Other members are Kerry Prendergast, former Mayor of Wellington; Michael Barnett, Chief Executive of Auckland Regional Chamber of Commerce & Industry; Bill Bayfield, Chief Executive of Environment Canterbury; Stephen Parry, Chief Executive of Gore District Council; Pamela Peters, former Mayor of Whangarei; Debbie Packer, former Deputy Mayor of South Taranaki District Council; and Vanessa van Uden, Mayor of Queenstown Lakes.

“The wealth of experience of the Taskforce members, as elected representatives and at governance level, will be an asset in building a more efficient local government sector and helping to improve the legislative framework for New Zealand’s 78 councils,” says Mr Carter.

The Taskforce will report to the Minister at the end of October.
