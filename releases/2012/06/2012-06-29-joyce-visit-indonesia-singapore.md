Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce will travel on Sunday to Indonesia and Singapore to highlight New Zealand as a destination for quality international education and science and research.

Mr Joyce’s visit includes attending the first formal meeting of the East Asia Summit Education Ministers in Yogyakarta on 5 July.

“Countries in East Asia represent 55 per cent of the world’s population and more than half of global GDP. These countries are pouring huge resources into education and tapping into this market is a massive opportunity for New Zealand,” Mr Joyce says.

In Yogyakarta, Mr Joyce will also hold bilateral meetings with the Indonesian Minister of Education Mohammad Nuh, Chinese Vice-Minister of Education Hao Ping, and Australian Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research Senator Chris Evans.

In Singapore, the Minister will profile New Zealand’s science, education and trade sectors, including meetings with Singapore’s Deputy Prime Ministers Teo Chee Hean (Chairman of the National Research Foundation) and Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Finance).

“New Zealand has a strong reputation for innovation and for delivering high quality education. This trip provides the opportunity to highlight our strengths to these growing economies and help double the economic contribution of international education to New Zealand to $5 billion by 2025,” Mr Joyce says.
