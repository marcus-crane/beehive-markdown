Consumer Affairs Minister Simon Bridges has today welcomed the signing of the voluntary wheel clamping code of conduct.

“This code clearly sets out what people can expect from the parking enforcement industry. It includes strong requirements for clear signage, a cap on fees and details the situations when clamping can and cannot occur.”

Comprise Group, Egmont Security, Tournament Parking, Valley Parking and Wilson Parking have all signed up to the code.

“I’m pleased that these operators, representing the bulk of the clamping industry, have committed to this set of standards and best practice. I wish to thank them for their constructive and proactive approach to this process.”

The code comes into effect on 1 October, to give companies time to ensure they are in full compliance.
