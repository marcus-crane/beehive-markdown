Local Government Minister David Carter has today announced the members of a review team to assist the Kaipara District Council.

The team is to be chaired by Northland businessman and farmer Greg Gent, and he is joined by two people with considerable local government experience, Leigh Auton and Peter Tennent.

“Kaipara District Council is dealing with a number of serious issues. It sought help from the Government and the wider local government sector which has led to the appointment of this review team,” says Mr Carter.

“The team will assist the Council with its consideration of critical issues, including setting appropriate rating levels for Kaipara ratepayers. It will review the Council’s governance and financial management processes and systems and make recommendations for a way forward.

“I am confident the combined expertise of the team members will greatly assist the Council in working through its issues.”

Mr Carter says that under the current Local Government Act, there are limited options for the Government to intervene to assist councils.

“The situation in Kaipara illustrates why the Government has embarked on its *Better Local Government* programme of reforms,” he says.

The review team will report to the Minister at the end of October.
