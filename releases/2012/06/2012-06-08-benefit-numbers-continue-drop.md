Social Development Minister Paula Bennett is delighted the number of people on Unemployment Benefits has dropped to 49,219 in May.

“Work and Income staff worked hard to help beneficiaries into jobs throughout the recession and beyond, and their efforts have made a real difference.”

Overall benefit numbers have declined to 317,397, which is a drop of more than 3,500 in the last month.

“The number of young people on unemployment benefits have fallen from the peak of 23,545 in January 2010, to 13,134 in May,” says Mrs Bennett.

Over the last twelve months Unemployment Benefit figures have fallen by more than 7,800.

“Almost 9,000 New Zealanders went off all types of benefits into work in the last month alone, a fantastic and determined effort,” says Mrs Bennett.

“This Government has continued to invest in support and initiatives to help prepare people for work and so it is pleasing to see that this investment is paying off.”

The number of people on benefits now is the lowest it has been since July 2009.

Note to Ed: When welfare changes come into effect this year, reporting on benefit numbers will change to reflect the new categories.
