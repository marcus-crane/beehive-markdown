A new South Auckland community dialysis house, officially opened today by Health Minister Tony Ryall, will enable more people receiving dialysis to treat themselves outside of hospital.

In the past four years five community dialysis facilities have opened throughout the country and another one will open in Gisborne later this year. There are also plans for two more dialysis units in Auckland and one in Wanganui.

The new community dialysis house in Mangere, named Calvert House, can accommodate up to 20 people using 10 dialysis machines. It is the third dialysis house in South Auckland and has been established by Kidney Society Auckland in partnership with the Counties Manukau DHB renal service.

“There are more than 2300 people in New Zealand using dialysis to treat renal disease. Slightly more than half of these people manage their own dialysis at home or in the community,” said Mr Ryall.

“Self-treatment at home or in the community means people can have a more normal life by fitting in the long treatments – up to six hours three times a week - into their routine, rather than having to attend set times at a hospital dialysis unit. It also frees up space in the hospital dialysis unit for people unable to manage at home or in the community.

“A community dialysis house enables people who don’t have suitable houses for a dialysis machine and equipment to treat themselves outside of hospital.

“Calvert House is unstaffed and patients have their own key to come and go as they please, any time of the day or night, giving them flexibility in the time they have their treatment and more control of their lives.
