Minister for Racing Nathan Guy has announced that 22 projects to improve safety at New Zealand racecourses will be receiving grants totalling $508,826.95.

“The Racing Safety Development Fund provides $1 million a year for projects that improve on-course health and safety, with matching dollar-for-dollar contributions from racing clubs.

“This year’s second funding round has supported a wide range of infrastructure projects including power supply upgrade, replacement greyhound kennels and parade ring fencing.

“All of these projects will help build a safer industry for everyone involved, from the animals and jockeys through to spectators and customers.

“It’s become clear that there is a lot of deferred safety and capital maintenance work that racing clubs are now finally addressing, with the help of this fund.”

These projects all upgrade the standard of facilities at racing venues. Congratulations to all the successful clubs that have benefited from the Fund to date.”

Application forms for the next funding round will be sent to all racing clubs by 1 August 2012. Applications for this round will close on 30 September 2012.

“I would encourage New Zealand’s racing clubs, and the respective code bodies, to take a serious look at the state of their facilities and make use of this funding,” says Mr Guy.

A full list of the successful projects is below.
