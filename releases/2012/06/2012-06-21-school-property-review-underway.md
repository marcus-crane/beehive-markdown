Budget 2012 announced a nationwide school property review to help improve student achievement through a world-class education system.

Associate Education Minister Craig Foss has announced that New Zealand company Beca has been selected to conduct the review.

School property is the second-largest publicly owned estate, comprising more than 2,300 schools, 8,000 hectares and a replacement value of more than $19 billion.

“The first $1 billion from the Future Investment Fund will support the creation of 21st century learning environments. This investment will help to strengthen the delivery of education and improve student achievement,” says Education Minister, Hekia Parata.

“We need modern school property that provides the physical infrastructure, ICT and environments that support the learning needs of all students,” says Mr Foss.

The review will consider how 21st century teaching spaces can be provided in the right locations at the most efficient whole of life cost.

The review will not make recommendations about properties at individual schools.

“The focus is on supporting modern teaching and learning, and strengthening the delivery of education,” says Ms Parata.
