Police Minister Anne Tolley today awarded graduation certificates to this year’s first intake of police recruits in Porirua.

74 recruits graduated to become frontline officers following the eighteen- week course. Another eighty recruits are currently in training and two further intakes are planned for July and August.

“I want to congratulate each of the successful graduates from Wing 272,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Guided by excellent trainers, they have proved themselves worthy of becoming frontline police officers.

“I also want to thank their proud families for the support they have given, and will continue to give in the years ahead.

“These graduates will need to show leadership and bravery on a daily basis, and will be rewarded with the trust and confidence of the New Zealand public.

“Recorded crimes are at a fifteen-year low, and today’s recruits will continue the great work being done in crime prevention to make our communities safer.”
