Foreign Minister Murray McCully will next week visit Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to attend the 20th Session of the African Union Executive Council on 25-26 January.

“This summit provides New Zealand with an opportunity to engage with ministers from nearly all of the 54 African Union states and convey our excellent credentials for United Nations Security Council membership in 2015-16," Mr McCully said.

Mr McCully will also meet with Ethiopian Government ministers while in Addis Ababa.

Before arriving in Ethiopia, Mr McCully will visit Kuwait and Qatar on 24 and 25 January. New Zealand enjoys friendly relations with both countries, and growing rates of trade. Two-way trade between New Zealand and Qatar in the year ended June 2011 exceeded NZ$839 million while trade with Kuwait approached $590 million.

“Kuwait and Qatar are both countries which – as major energy suppliers - have high growth rates and strong economies. But they are situated in the middle of a region beset with tension and unrest. I am looking forward to discussing these issues with senior ministers in the two countries,” added Mr McCully.
