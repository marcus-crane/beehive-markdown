Foreign Minister Murray McCully will travel to the Solomon Islands today to meet with the Prime Minister and Cabinet members, and to visit key aid projects.

"This will be my first chance to meet with Gordon Darcy Lilo since he became Prime Minister in November," Mr McCully said.

"New Zealand and the Solomon Islands have a close and longstanding relationship. We will be discussing a range of issues including regional matters, New Zealand's development assistance programme and the RAMSI transition.

"New Zealand is investing in a range of projects in the Solomon Islands to create economic opportunities as we look for drawdown from the RAMSI commitment. As part of the Joint Commitment for Development signed between our countries in September last year, New Zealand will invest up to $25 million in the redevelopment of key infrastructure in the Western Province including the Munda runway, Noro-Munda road and the runway at Gizo. I will be visiting these projects during my trip.

"As Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum this year, New Zealand is committed to meeting regularly with Pacific leaders."
