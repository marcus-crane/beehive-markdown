Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced that New Zealand will make an initial $350,000 available to support the response to the floods in Fiji.

"Sadly six lives have been confirmed as lost and over 1,500 people have been evacuated because of floods and bad weather affecting most parts of the country," Mr McCully said.

"The Western Division, including Nadi, Lautoka, Ba, Tavua and Rakiraki have been worst hit by flooding and many areas have been left with no power or water.

"New Zealand’s funding will be made immediately available to the Fiji Red Cross for the distribution of essential relief items to those in need, followed by other agencies identified as best placed to meet immediate needs.

"Assessments are on-going and New Zealand stands ready to consider additional assistance as further information comes to hand."

New Zealand is coordinating closely with authorities and relief agencies on the ground, as well as with Australia and France under the FRANZ arrangement.

Currently there are no reports of New Zealanders in need of urgent assistance in Fiji. New Zealanders in flood affected areas should follow the advice of tourism operators and the local authorities, stay in touch with friends and family in New Zealand and register their details with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade on [www.safetravel.govt.nz](http://www.safetravel.govt.nz).
