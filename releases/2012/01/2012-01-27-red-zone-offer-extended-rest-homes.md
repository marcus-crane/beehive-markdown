Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has today announced the extension of the Government’s buy-out offer to owners of rest homes and retirement villages in Christchurch’s residential red zone.

Mr Brownlee said he was very pleased to be able to make the announcement, as the issue had caused understandable concern to the residents affected.

"This complex matter has been a focus for the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority’s policy team for a number of months, so it's great news that a solution has been found.

"Extending the scheme was complicated by the fact that rest homes and retirement villages are, strictly speaking, commercial businesses and our focus has been on making offers to private residential property owners in order to help people move on with their lives.

"However, it was obvious the residents of rest homes and retirement villages fell into a category other than commercial business, and a solution had to be found to assist those residents as well."

The extension is to four developments - Kate Sheppard Gardens, Kate Sheppard Lifecare, Avonview Retirement Village, and St Ives Rest Home. Letters have been sent to the four business owners advising them of the change.

A letter of offer to each owner will follow shortly, and CERA will work with the rest home and village owners as quickly as possible to ensure the residents are assisted.

CERA is responsible for coordinating and leading the rebuild of Canterbury and supporting the welfare of its residents. For more information visit [www.cera.govt.nz](http://www.cera.govt.nz)
