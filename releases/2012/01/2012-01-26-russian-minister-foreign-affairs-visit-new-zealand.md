Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov will arrive in Auckland next Monday (30 January) for a two day visit to New Zealand, Minister of Foreign Affairs Murray McCully announced today.

“I am pleased to welcome Sergey Lavrov to New Zealand, particularly as his visit comes at a high point in New Zealand-Russia relations. We have completed three rounds of Free Trade Agreement negotiations and a number of other bilateral initiatives are in the pipeline,” Mr McCully said.

“The New Zealand-Russia relationship has strengthened over the past few years. Visitor numbers are at their highest levels; business interest has increased and the Russian rugby team recently came to New Zealand for their first ever Rugby World Cup competition.”

While in New Zealand, Minister Lavrov will hold a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Key and Foreign Minister McCully. The two foreign ministers will sign a Consultations Plan to formalise increased cooperation between the New Zealand and Russian Foreign Ministries over the next two years.

Minister Lavrov will also meet with the Leader of the Opposition as well as Russian community leaders and businesspeople.

Minister Lavrov will depart for Australia on 31 January.
