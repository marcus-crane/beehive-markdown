Pacific communities in Wellington have a lot to be proud of including this weekend’s annual Pasifika Festival, says the Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, Hekia Parata.

"In the five years since it was inaugurated Wellington’s Pasifika Festival has gone from strength to strength,’’ says Ms Parata.

"This year’s event showcases seven Pacific cultures - Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Tokelau, the Cook Islands, Niue and Tuvalu - offering crafts, food and drink and performance.

"I will be participating in the official opening and wandering around the festival and I look forward to Wellingtonians and visitors to our capital coming along too,'' says Ms Parata.

While Pasifika is an opportunity to showcase Pacific cultures, it is also a chance to celebrate New Zealand as a truly Pacific nation.

Thirteen percent of New Zealand’s Pacific peoples lived in Wellington when the last Census was completed in 2006. Many of them young people. The Census showed that more than one in three Pacific people in New Zealand was younger than 15.

“Most of our young Pacific people are born in New Zealand. That means events like this are significant and provide an opportunity for them to connect with their culture and heritage.''

Ms Parata says being the Minister of Pacific Island Affairs and the Minister of Education presents some wonderful opportunities to help young Pacific people reach their potential.

“Our Government’s goal is to create the conditions that grow strong, vibrant, capable Pacific communities. A critical part of that is a successful educational experience and raised achievement.

“We want to see Pasifika children participating in quality early childhood education, transitioning happily into primary school, with teachers who actively monitor how well they are doing and report to parents on their progress, their needs, and what the school is doing to meet those needs.

“We then want those students to go on to secondary school and to subject choices that will set them up well for good qualifications and career pathways that lead to strong employment prospects.''

The Wellington Pasifika Festival is being held at Waitangi Park tomorrow from 10am.
