Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson, on behalf of the Government today congratulated Sir Peter Jackson on the Golden Globe awarded for the film ‘Tintin’, which Sir Peter produced.

“The award for ‘Tintin’ as best animated feature is another well-deserved milestone in Sir Peter’s already illustrious career,” Mr Finlayson said. “The film’s state of the art animation produced another wonderful and distinctive fantasy world, and also served as a reminder of the immense contribution he continues to make to the art of motion pictures.”

“Sir Peter has given back a great deal to the arts in this country. He authored a review of the New Zealand Film Commission that is a basis for ongoing policy work, and in November bought the BATS Theatre building and granted the theatre company a long-term lease. His successes have been good for New Zealand.”
