The announcement by the Fiji administration that the Public Emergency Regulations will be lifted on 7 January has been welcomed by the New Zealand Government.

Foreign Minister Murray McCully says the New Zealand Government has been calling for the lifting of the regulations as an important step towards the holding of free and fair elections.

"We therefore welcome the announcement that the regulations are to be lifted and the announcement that public consultations will commence on a new constitution in February. While there are a range of steps that will be required before free and fair elections can be held, these are important moves in the right direction," said Mr McCully.

"The international community will want to see these changes improve the lives and freedoms of ordinary Fijians."
