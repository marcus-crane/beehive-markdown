Prime Minister and Tourism Minister John Key has congratulated Air New Zealand on again being named Airline of the Year by ‘Air Transport World’ magazine.

“Air New Zealand was named Airline of the Year in January 2010, and to gain this honour twice in three years is an outstanding achievement,” says Mr Key.

“The award is for Air New Zealand’s industry-leading innovation and motivation of its staff, which has resulted in exceptional performance in many areas, such as customer service, operational safety, and financial performance.

“The award is an acknowledgement of the hard work the airline’s staff and management have put into the company.

“Air New Zealand is a vital part of our tourism infrastructure. Often, the first experience incoming visitors have of New Zealand is with the national carrier, and those first impressions count.

“Like all New Zealanders, I am very proud of Air New Zealand, and I congratulate the airline and its staff on this achievement.

“I am sure all staff and management at Air New Zealand will be proud of this well-deserved honour,” says Mr Key.
