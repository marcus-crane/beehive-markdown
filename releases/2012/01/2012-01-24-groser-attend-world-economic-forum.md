Trade Minister Tim Groser will today depart for Switzerland, to attend the 2012 World Economic Forum (WEF) which will be held in Davos from 25-29 January.

The theme of this year’s conference is ‘The Great Transformation: Shaping New Models’. The programme will focus on issues arising from the rebalancing of the global economy.

Mr Groser will also participate in the Informal Gathering of World Economic Leaders.

“This is a unique opportunity for New Zealand to engage with some of the world’s top economic decision-makers on how we should respond to the shifts now taking place in the world economy, and on the implications for New Zealand,” Mr Groser said.

In Davos, Mr Groser will also attend a meeting of Trade Ministers to discuss the future of the multilateral trading system following the 8th WTO Ministerial Conference.

“In the wake of the most severe downturn in 70 years, the binding commitments made in the WTO provide us with a clear safeguard against the rise of protectionism. It is vitally important that political leaders reaffirm these commitments and maintain their resolve to continue moving forward on trade liberalisation, keeping us on the path towards global economic recovery,” Mr Groser said.

In addition to the formal sessions, Minister Groser will take the opportunity to meet with some of his counterparts to discuss progress on New Zealand’s trade agenda.
