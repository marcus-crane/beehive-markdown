The opening of a new $10.5 million high-tech water ride in Rotorua is a further commitment to the local economy and an investment in New Zealand tourism, Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce says.

Mr Joyce today opened the “Big Splash” ride at Rainbow Springs conservation park developed by Ngai Tahu Tourism. Around 300 people were involved in its construction.

“Tourism plays a vital role in Rotorua’s economy. It is estimated to account for 25 per cent of total employment and 13 per cent of the city’s GDP. Rainbow Springs is a key part of that,” Mr Joyce says.

“This new development represents Ngai Tahu’s ongoing commitment to investing in New Zealand’s tourism”.

“It is this sort of commitment to innovation that is needed right across the economy; not just in tourism”.

“I have no doubt the “Big Splash” will be popular with both domestic and international visitors and be another part of the exciting New Zealand tourism experience.
