The Government will deliver Budget 2012 on Thursday, 24 May, Finance Minister Bill English announced today.

“It will focus on implementing the Government’s clear and comprehensive plan to build a more productive and competitive economy,” he says.

Within that plan, the Government has set out its priorities. They are:

- Responsibly managing the Government’s finances.
- Building a more productive and competitive economy.
- Delivering better public services within tight financial constraints.
- Rebuilding Christchurch.

“We’re on track to return to budget surplus in 2014/15,” Mr English says. “This was always going to be a challenge, requiring tight control over spending for the foreseeable future.

“There will be no big surprises from the Government. We have laid out our economic plan and Budget 2012 will focus on implementing that plan.

“That’s important if New Zealand is to grasp its opportunities and withstand the global challenges that will continue to come our way.”
