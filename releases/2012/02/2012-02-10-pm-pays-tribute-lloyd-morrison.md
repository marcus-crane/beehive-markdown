Prime Minister John Key has paid tribute to businessman Lloyd Morrison, who died this morning in Seattle.

Mr Morrison was made a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2009.

“It was with much sadness that I learnt of Lloyd's passing this morning,” says Mr Key.

“I had been in regular contact throughout his illness and last spoke to him a few weeks ago.

“Lloyd was a very successful businessman and, as a friend, I can say that he was also known for not being afraid to voice strong opinions - but he did this because he was totally passionate about New Zealand.

“He led the campaign to change the flag, was a strong supporter of the arts, and will be remembered for his part in saving the Phoenix.

“Lloyd threw everything he had at his illness, as he threw everything he had at his life.

“I will miss him and my condolences go out to his family, his friends, and his colleagues at Infratil.”
