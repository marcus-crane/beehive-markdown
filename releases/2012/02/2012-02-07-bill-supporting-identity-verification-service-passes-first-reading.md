Internal Affairs Minister Amy Adams has welcomed the first reading of a bill that will make it easier for people to verify their identities to government agencies.

The Electronic Identity Verification Bill will provide people using the Internet with the option of an easy and secure way to verify their identities to access a range of services from government agencies.

The service works in combination with the igovt log-on service, which allows people to use one log-on to access secure online services across multiple government agencies.

“Using the service will allow people to avoid repeatedly having to provide physical documents to multiple agencies in order to use online services,” says Ms Adams.

“Currently, for these kinds of interactions, agencies usually require people to provide several documents as evidence of their identity, but this bill ensures that the process is much easier, while still having appropriate controls and safeguards.”

The identity verification service has been operating successfully, but in a limited form, since December 2009. People have been able to use the service for online ordering of certificates and copies of records from the Births, Deaths and Marriages registry.

“It is now time to expand the service to allow for a greater range of uses, so that people, government and businesses can realise the benefits that Internet technologies offer.”
