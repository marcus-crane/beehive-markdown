Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson on behalf of the Government today congratulated actor and musician Bret McKenzie for winning best original song in the Academy Awards.

He won the award for penning the song Man or Muppet, from The Muppets Movie, and joins fellow Wellingtonians Sir Peter Jackson and Sir Richard Taylor as an Oscar winner.

“This is another outstanding achievement for a talented New Zealander,” Mr Finlayson said. “As one-half of Flight of the Conchords, Bret McKenzie had already done a great deal to put New Zealand on the map through his Emmy-nominated HBO series, and winning a Grammy Award for best comedy album in 2008. He remains an active contributor to the local arts scene.”

“He has been a positive ambassador for New Zealand’s unique culture of creativity, and the Government congratulates him on his latest success.”
