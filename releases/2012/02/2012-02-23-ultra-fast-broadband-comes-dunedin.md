The Government’s ultra-fast broadband (UFB) initiative is now underway in Dunedin, bringing future gains to schools, medical facilities, businesses and residents.

This morning Chorus deployed the first UFB-enabling network past Dunedin Hospital.

“I am delighted that this work has started in Dunedin. Together with the UFB build occurring in Ashburton, Christchurch, Rangiora and Blenheim this year, this will provide a real opportunity to boost economic growth and increase productivity in the South Island. These are very exciting times,” says Ms Adams.

The UFB will pass about 1400 homes and businesses, and connect 14 schools in the North Dunedin area by July this year. This is in addition to Chorus’ existing 270km fibre network already in place.

The schools are:

- Arthur Street School
- Balmacewen Intermediate
- Bayfield High School
- Carisbrook School
- Columba College
- George Street Normal School
- John McGlashan College
- Kavanagh College
- King's High School
- Maori Hill School
- Otago Boys’ High School
- Queen's High School
- Sawyers Bay School
- St Hilda's Collegiate

“Overseas experience tells us that the greatest benefits are to be gained from encouraging early uptake by schools, health providers, government agencies and businesses, and that is why these sectors are the focus of the Government’s five point broadband action plan and are a priority for deployment,” says Ms Adams.

“UFB will revolutionise the way Kiwi firms do business, the way our kids learn and the way our health services deliver to us as patients.”

The Dunedin rollout is supported by a Government contribution of more than $46 million.
