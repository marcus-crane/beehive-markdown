A new project designed to attract highly skilled workers to New Zealand is a great example of collaboration between the Government and the private sector, Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce says.

Speaking at the Medical Technology conference in Auckland today, Mr Joyce said 12 New Zealand health technology companies – including Fisher & Paykel Healthcare and Orion Health – have been working with government agencies such as New Zealand Trade and Enterprise and Immigration New Zealand to recruit hundreds of skilled employees for roles in the New Zealand health technology sector.

“The health technology global attraction project, launched on 28 December last year, followed the 2011 Medical Technology Industry Blueprint which identified that one of the key constraints to growth is a lack of access to appropriately skilled talent,” Mr Joyce says.

“This is the first time a collaborative, industry-wide approach has been taken to create a talent pool for New Zealand health technology companies. The project which has used LinkedIn, Google and Facebook, has been successful with around 1000 people now registered from around the world with a range of skills and experience that our health technology companies need.

“New Zealand exports around $800 million a year in the health technology sector with exports expected to double in the next five years. It’s an industry where New Zealand companies such as Fisher & Paykel Healthcare have carved out a niche internationally and earned our country a reputation as a breeding ground of medical technology innovation and excellence.

“This project is helping to ensure we attract world-class talent to fill highly specialised roles that can be the critical factor in terms of product development and immediate international growth.”
