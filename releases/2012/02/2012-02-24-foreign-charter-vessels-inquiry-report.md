Primary Industries Minister David Carter and Labour Minister Kate Wilkinson today received the report of the Ministerial Inquiry into the use and operation of Foreign Charter Vessels (FCVs).

The Inquiry was initiated by the Government last year to consider key issues relevant to the use of FCVs in New Zealand waters.

A Ministerial Inquiry was regarded as the appropriate course of action as a number of ministerial portfolios have an interest in FCV engagement and operation, including fisheries, labour, immigration, transport and foreign affairs and trade.

The Ministers say the Government will now consider the Inquiry Panel’s report and recommendations before announcing any decisions.

Mr Carter and Ms Wilkinson thank the Panel members Paul Swain (chair), Sarah McGrath and Neil Walter for their work in preparing the report.
