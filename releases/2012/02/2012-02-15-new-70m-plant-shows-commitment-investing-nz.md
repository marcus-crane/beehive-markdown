Construction of a new $70 million gas plant to supply New Zealand Steel is another strong sign of confidence in the New Zealand economy, Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce says.

Mr Joyce today marked the start of work to construct the new BOC gas facility at a ground breaking ceremony at New Zealand Steel’s site at Glenbrook. The construction will create 120 jobs over two years.

“The new contract for BOC Gases to build a plant to supply air gases to New Zealand Steel for at least another 20 years is excellent news,” Mr Joyce says.

“It shows the confidence the companies have in investing in our economy and recognises the importance of having a strong manufacturing industry in New Zealand. The 120 new jobs are clear evidence that nothing creates sustainable employment more than business confidence and growth.”

Once operating in early 2014, the new plant will enhance reliability of supply to the steel plant and allow increased quantities of liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon to the broader New Zealand air gases market that can be used in hospitals, food production and metal fabrication.

“By boosting gas supply, this new plant will have the potential for greater export growth for New Zealand Steel,” Mr Joyce says.

“The Government is absolutely focused on providing a strong platform for competitive, productive New Zealand-based businesses like New Zealand Steel to trade and succeed in the world today.”
