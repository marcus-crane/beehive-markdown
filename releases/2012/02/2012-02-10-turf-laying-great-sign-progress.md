Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee today inspected construction progress at the new Christchurch Stadium, joined by members of the Crusaders rugby franchise who pitched in to help lay recycled turf harvested from AMI Stadium.

“It’s a very tight schedule to build an entire stadium in four months but the efforts and outstanding cooperation of the roughly 400 workers on site has this project on track for completion at the end of March, just 43 days away,” Mr Brownlee said.

“Already this week over 200 truckloads of concrete has been delivered to provide platforms under the north and south stands, which together will hold 13,000 fans and are being constructed with earthquake risk in mind.”

Stabilising gravel rafts have been dug a metre into the ground to strengthen the stands’ foundations. The rafts contain layers of geotech matting, which when combined with gravel creates a rigid platform beneath the stands. This also serves to prevent liquefaction from penetrating beneath the foundations.

“It’s great to see seating being installed, the recycled tower lights from Carisbrook in Dunedin on site and ready for installation, and the Portacoms from Carisbrook and Auckland’s Eden Park being retrofitted,” Mr Brownlee said.

On hand to view progress with an eye to June’s All Blacks’ test against Ireland was NZRU chairman Mike Eagle. Mr Brownlee unveiled a drawing of the stadium in test-match mode, with an additional west stand that will enable the ground to accommodate 25,000 fans.

Also present was newly appointed trustee of the Christchurch Stadium Trust, Hon Jim Anderton. Mr Anderton will work with Sir John Hansen, whose appointment as the trust chair was announced in December 2011.
