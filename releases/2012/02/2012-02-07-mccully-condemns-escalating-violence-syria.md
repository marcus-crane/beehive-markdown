Foreign Minister Murray McCully has condemned the escalating violence in Syria and described the killing of 50 citizens in Homs by regime forces yesterday as “reprehensible.”

Mr McCully called for renewed attempts to secure agreement on a UN Security Council resolution on Syria.

“New Zealand is dismayed by the escalating violence in Syria," Mr McCully said.

"The situation appears to have worsened since the failure of the Security Council discussions last week. The killing of 50 Syrian citizens by regime forces yesterday in a bombardment of the western city of Homs deserves the strongest condemnation.

“We again urge Security Council members to work together to find a way to address the Syrian crisis,” said Mr McCully.
