Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee says new air services arrangements with Japan build on the already strong relationship between the two countries.

“The arrangements New Zealand and Japan have negotiated will remove many of the current restrictions on services by the airlines of the two countries,” says Mr Brownlee.

“New Zealand has close ties with Japan, and it is an important trading partner. This should help strengthen these links, by making it easier for the airlines of the two countries to introduce new services.”

For New Zealand airlines, limits on operations to and through airports in Japan outside of the Tokyo region have been removed. Reciprocal rights will be available for Japanese airlines.

In addition, for New Zealand airlines, the right to operate a daily service to Narita Airport has been confirmed (restrictions will be removed in 2013) and an understanding has been reached on the possible future use of Haneda Airport. Airports in the Tokyo region have limited capacity for additional operations.

For the airlines of Japan almost all restrictions on services to and through New Zealand have been removed, although they too will initially be limited in any operations to New Zealand from Narita.

New understandings were also reached on tariffs regulation, and aviation safety and security.

“These new arrangements come as New Zealand and Japan celebrate 60 years of diplomatic relations.”

The air services negotiations were held in Tokyo on 15-16 February. New Zealand's air services relationship with Japan is one of our oldest, the current treaty-level Agreement which will remain in effect having been signed in 1980.
