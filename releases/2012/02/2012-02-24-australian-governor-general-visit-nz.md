Prime Minister John Key says that Australian Governor-General, Her Excellency Quentin Bryce AC CVO, will visit New Zealand later this month.

Ms Bryce will be accompanied by her husband, His Excellency Mr Michael Bryce, on the five-day visit and will have engagements in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Queenstown.

“It will be my pleasure to welcome Her Excellency to New Zealand and I look forward to seeing her again.

“The New Zealand/Australia relationship has never been stronger, and that was reaffirmed with the warm welcome we received when I visited Melbourne with seven Cabinet Ministers last month,” says Mr Key

Ms Bryce last visited New Zealand for the Christchurch Earthquake Memorial Service in March 2011.

The Prime Minister will call on Ms Bryce on Tuesday 28 February and both will attend a State Dinner at Government House Wellington that evening where she will be formally welcomed to New Zealand by Governor-General Lt Gen Rt Hon Sir Jerry Mateparae.

Ms Bryce arrives in Auckland on Sunday 26 February and returns to Canberra on Thursday 1 March.
