Trade Minister Tim Groser is pleased to announce the appointment of Vangelis Vitalis as New Zealand’s new Lead Negotiator for the FTA with the Customs Union of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan.

Vangelis Vitalis is currently New Zealand’s Ambassador to the European Union in Brussels – a role which he will continue to undertake in addition to his new responsibilities. He has an extensive trade background. Vitalis concluded the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand FTA as well as the New Zealand-Malaysia FTA.

Before taking up his assignment as Ambassador to the EU, Vitalis worked at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) as an economist. Prior to that he was posted to the New Zealand Embassy in Moscow. Most recently, Vitalis was New Zealand’s Deputy High Commissioner to Canberra.

Vitalis replaces Crawford Falconer who recently took up a senior position at the OECD.
