Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today announced the appointment of Canterbury University Professor Juliet Gerrard as the new Chair of the Marsden Fund Council.

Professor Gerrard replaces Professor Peter Hunter who is stepping down at the end of February when his term expires.

“Since 2009 Professor Gerrard has been a highly effective Marsden Fund Council member with a reputation for supporting fresh ideas. She is a hugely capable and experienced scientist, and will bring leadership, passion and a dedication to enhancing the quality of research in New Zealand,” Mr Joyce says.

“I’d also like to take this opportunity to thank Professor Hunter for his excellent service as Chair since 2009 and for nearly seven years on the Council.”

The Marsden Fund was established by the Government in 1994 to fund excellent fundamental research. It is a contestable fund of $53 million administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand on behalf of the Marsden Fund Council.

The Marsden Fund Council is responsible for developing the strategic direction of the Fund and for choosing the proposals to be funded. The Council is made up of 11 eminent researchers spanning a range of disciplines who are appointed by the Minister of Science and Innovation.
