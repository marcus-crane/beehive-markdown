The Government will increase the minimum wage from $13 to $13.50 an hour, Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson announced today.

The training and new entrants’ minimum wages will increase from $10.40 to $10.80 (or 80% of the adult minimum wage).

“Those working full time on the minimum wage will earn an extra $20 a week or more than $1000 a year,” Ms Wilkinson said.

“This increase strikes the right balance between protecting low paid workers and ensuring that jobs are not lost during these tough economic times.”

“The Government is focused on growing the economy, creating jobs and boosting incomes for all New Zealanders.”

The new minimum wage rates will come into effect on April 1, 2012.
