Police Minister Anne Tolley has congratulated the Police after significant drugs busts in the Waikato.

The raids, in which a methamphetamine laboratory was uncovered, led to the seizure of substantial amounts of methamphetamine, chemicals and cash, along with a number of firearms.

“This is a great result, and I want to thank the police officers from Waikato, Auckland and the Bay of Plenty who worked together on this significant operation,” says Mrs Tolley.

“The Government will not tolerate methamphetamine in our communties.

“This is yet another example of the fantastic work being done by Police to stamp out the manufacture and supply of this hideous drug.

“Time is running out for the criminals involved.

“They need to get the message that the Police will soon be knocking on their door to lock them up and seize the proceeds of their crimes.”
