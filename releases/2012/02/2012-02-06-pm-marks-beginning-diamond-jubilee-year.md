At Waitangi today to commemorate the 172nd anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, Prime Minister John Key paid tribute to Queen Elizabeth II, whose Diamond Jubilee year also commences today.

“The Queen took the throne on 6 February 1952,” says Mr Key. “She has reigned for 60 years, and hers has been a reign of commitment and service to her realms and territories, including New Zealand.

“On behalf of all New Zealanders, I would like to thank the Queen for her dedication. We wish her well in this Diamond Jubilee year, which begins on the same day as we commemorate the signing of our nation’s founding document.”

As part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, New Zealand will host the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall later this year.

“I can now confirm this visit will take place in November,” says Mr Key. “I look forward to joining with all New Zealanders in welcoming the Prince and the Duchess to mark this important occasion.”
