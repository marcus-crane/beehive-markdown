Associate Health Minister Hon. Tariana Turia  has announced that the Hauora Maori Scholarships 2012 are now open for applications from Maori students seeking support to either start or finish their studies in health related courses.

“These scholarships have been established to support Maori to enter into health related fields of study, while also recognising their contribution to their community,” said Hon. Turia

“They are funded through the Maori Provider Development Scheme to achieve greater participation by Maori in the health and disability workforce, ensuring the delivery of health services relevant and culturally appropriate for Maori.”

Students can apply under one of the eleven categories; Community Health Workers, Dieticians, Dentistry, Health Management, Medicine, Midwifery, Nursing, Pharmacy, Physiotherapy, Postgraduate and Undergraduate.

"Our Maori health workforce is facing great pressure and I am pleased that this new putea will help to start meeting the demand" said Hon. Turia

“As part of the Hauora Māori Scholarships, one Excellence Award is granted in each category and two scholarships for each of the John McLeod and Te Apa Mareikura awards.”

Applications can be completed online via the Ministry’s Māori Health website ([http://www.maorihealth.govt.nz](http://www.maorihealth.govt.nz/)) from 28 February to 6 April 2012.
