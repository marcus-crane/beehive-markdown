Consumer Affairs Minister Chris Tremain opened a brand new weights, measures and product safety testing facility in Auckland today.

The new building and laboratory will support testing of petrol pumps, supermarket scales, and other measuring devices to ensure they are accurate. It will also be used to test whether products meet safety standards, and to help monitor fuel quality.

“The work done in this building will affect every single New Zealander,” says Mr Tremain.

“Consumers have a right to know that when they buy 40 litres of petrol, they receive that exact amount. They also have a right to know that the scales at their local supermarket are accurate.

“Product safety is also hugely important. The sale of unsafe goods exposes consumers to unacceptable risk, and it is unfair on the businesses which do invest in testing to make sure their products are safe.”

The building replaces the previous Measurement and Product Safety Service site in Panmure. It has been fitted out with innovative new systems and equipment to better meet current needs.

“This new facility will provide the space and tools to carry out a wider range of checks. Product Safety Officers can test whether products are meeting safety standards, and carry out research into potential harm to determine whether the current standards are sufficient,” says Mr Tremain.

“It will also give enforcement officers more tools to carry out compliance activities, surveillance audits and accreditation to strengthen New Zealand’s already robust weights and measures regime.”
