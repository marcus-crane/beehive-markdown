The Government is providing $6 million to support Pacific peoples enter into trades training in 2012 and 2013 to assist with the Christchurch rebuild, Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Steven Joyce and Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Hekia Parata announced today.

The initiative, part of the Government’s wider Skills for Canterbury contingency package of $42 million, is providing up to 300 fees-free places in trades training throughout New Zealand.

Eighty-four Pacific Trades Scholarships have been awarded in Wellington, 105 scholarships in Auckland, and 56 in Christchurch; with further places to be awarded as required.

“This initiative enables us to reach Pacific students who may not normally consider entering into trades such as carpentry, joinery and plumbing,” Mr Joyce says.

“It is important we ensure these young people are given every opportunity to learn new skills that will be vital in the rebuilding of Christchurch.”

Ms Parata says: “A significant proportion of the Pacific population go to church and it’s great to see Pacific church leaders mobilising large numbers of Pacific young people to get them involved in this initiative.

“The support of the church ministers, particularly in the area of pastoral care, will be a key ingredient in the success of students involved in this initiative.”
