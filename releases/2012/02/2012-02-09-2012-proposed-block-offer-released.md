Energy and Resources Minister Phil Heatley has welcomed the latest “block offer” process for awarding oil and gas exploration permits in selected areas, released today by the Ministry of Economic Development. The 2012 proposed block offer covers 25 areas.

“While we don’t necessarily expect exploration to be undertaken in all the blocks on offer this year, this is an important step in developing New Zealand’s significant resource wealth,” the Minister said.

“A competitive system for allocating permits for oil and gas exploration is one of the actions identified in the Government’s Economic Development Action Plan,” he said.

The Ministry of Economic Development is consulting with iwi and local authorities before confirming the block offer for 2012.
