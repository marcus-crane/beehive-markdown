Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples says the formalisation of a collective of Maori tradesmen in Christchurch today shows ‘whanaungatanga in action’ – and the value of traditional cultural bonds to meet a modern crisis.

Speaking at the launch at Rehua Marae this afternoon, Dr Sharples said: “These guys forged strong bonds when they came together on the old Maori Affairs Trade Training Scheme thirty, forty or fifty years ago – and now those links will give extra value to the people of Christchurch as they rebuild after the earthquakes.

“The Kaihanga Collective is made up of trainees who lived at the Kaihanga hostel, next door to Rehua Marae, and who stayed on in Christchurch after they graduated as tradesmen,” he said.

“Now that Christchurch needs urgently tradesmen for the rebuild, and training programmes for young people, these guys have got together to pool their knowledge and experience to offer it to their communities.

“As a collective, they can achieve more for Maori and for Christchurch by working together and brokering larger contracts to secure work for smaller operators. And as an umbrella body, they want to advocate and promote the contribution of Maori tradesmen to the rebuilding of Christchurch.

“They also want to partner with government agencies to design trade training programmes to suit Maori trainees, drawing on their own experience.

“The Kaihanga Collective is well placed to dovetail in with ‘He Toki ki te Rika’, a trade training programme initiated by Te Puni Kokiri and delivered by the Canterbury Polytechnic Institute of Technology together with Ngai Tahu, employer and ITO partners,” said Dr Sharples.

“Since July last year ‘He Toki’ has recruited and trained around 200 Maori trade trainees, and placed around 40 graduates in full-time jobs, apprenticeships or further training,” he said.

“Opportunities for work and apprenticeships in the trades have been affected by continuing earthquakes and delays to the rebuilding programme, but they are expected to take off towards the end of this year.

“On the anniversary of the destructive February earthquake, it’s great to be able to celebrate this initiative, and I look forward to the Kaihanga Collective making a real contribution to the Canterbury rebuild, by drawing on their cultural strengths and the experience they gained on the old Maori Affairs scheme, and working with other Maori, training and employer networks,” said Dr Sharples.
