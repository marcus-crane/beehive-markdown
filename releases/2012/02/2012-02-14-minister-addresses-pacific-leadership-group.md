Pacific Island Affairs Minister, Hekia Parata, told a group of Pasifika leaders at a breakfast in Wellington this morning not to be afraid to put their names forward for senior management roles.

The group of 27 is the second intake for the Pasifika Leadership Course, set up by the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs in conjunction with the Leadership Development Centre last year to help increase Pacific public servants in senior roles in the state sector.

“I would like to congratulate the participants in this year’s course. We know that many Pacific New Zealanders are already leaders in the arts and sports sectors. We want to see that success flow into all areas of our society.

“Research shows diversity on boards and in senior management roles can lift productivity and with this in mind, I encourage you to put your name forward for senior management and leadership positions," Ms Parata says.

Of the 21 graduates from last year's course, several have taken on significant leadership roles in the private sector, senior roles in the public sector, and leadership within the United Nations.

Ms Parata, who held many senior roles in both the public and private sectors, before coming to Parliament in 2008, says continuing education is paramount.

“Early and continuing education has been the springboard for my professional choices, and I believe successful education experiences can transform the lives of individuals, their families, their communities – and their nation.

"That's what we want for our Pasifika communities.''
