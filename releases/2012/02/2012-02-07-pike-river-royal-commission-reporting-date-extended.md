On Cabinet’s advice, the Governor-General has extended the reporting date for the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Pike River mine tragedy to 28 September 2012, Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson announced today.

The Commissioners were originally due to report back by 31 March 2012, but approached Government requesting an extension late last year.

“The request for an extension was made by the commissioners, who are best placed to report on progress in light of the hearings to date and the availability of certain evidence,” Mr Finlayson said.

“It is important the inquiry is completed in a timely fashion to help provide closure for the miners’ families and the surrounding community,” Mr Finlayson said. “The Royal Commission is looking both at what happened in the Pike River mine, and also important policy questions that arise from the completed hearings, including recommendations for the future. We cannot rush these deliberations, which have been the subject of very wide-ranging and comprehensive evidence to date.”

“The revised reporting date meets both these objectives, and ensures we will have answers before the end of the year.”

While administrative costs of extending the deadline will be largely covered within the Department of Internal Affairs’ existing budget. Cabinet has allocated extra funding of $2.7 million for departmental and non-departmental expenses associated with reporting extensions for the Pike River and Canterbury earthquake Royal Commissions.
