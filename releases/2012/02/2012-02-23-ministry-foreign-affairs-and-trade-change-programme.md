Minister of Foreign Affairs Murray McCully has described the changes proposed by the Ministry’s consultation document for staff as “a far-reaching and genuine attempt to create a Foreign Ministry that can meet New Zealand’s current and future needs.”

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has today released a comprehensive set of proposed changes for consultation with staff following months of work by senior management, led by Chief Executive John Allen.

“We are a small trading nation that earns $58b per year from selling goods and services to over 170 countries. Over recent years we have seen dramatic changes to the location and profiles of our markets, and we can expect those changes to continue. The consultation document prepared by the Ministry leadership is a constructive attempt to develop a Ministry that can serve New Zealand’s interests in a changing world.

“This is an internal staff consultation process led by senior management of the Ministry. It will be critical that when the final decisions are made the Ministry is able to maintain its talent base, in which New Zealand taxpayers have made a substantial investment. That underlines the need for a consultation process that is open and genuine.

“At the same time the Government will have discussions with the Ministry to ensure that its priorities are taken into account in the final decisions. For that reason I do not intend to engage in detailed discussions about the proposed changes until the process of consulting staff is completed,” said Mr McCully.
