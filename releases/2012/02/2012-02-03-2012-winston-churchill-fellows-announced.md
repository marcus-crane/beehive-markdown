Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew today announced the recipients of the 2012 Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Fellowships.

Fellows are granted up to 80 per cent of travel costs and can spend between three weeks and three months overseas. The average value of the grants awarded is $5000, and the Trust will provide a total of $75,000 to 15 people.

“This year’s Fellows will learn more about other people and cultures across a wide range of topics such as community welfare and health, disaster preparedness and issues relating to history, commerce, the arts and the environment,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“They will bring back new insights and understanding that will enrich their communities, and ultimately, New Zealand.”

New Zealand’s Winston Churchill Memorial Trust was formed in 1965 with funds from both the government and the public. Since then, net income earned from investments has been used to fund up to 20 fellowships each year.
