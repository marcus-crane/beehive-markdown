The fall in unemployment from 6.6 per cent to 6.3 per cent in the December 2011 quarter is further evidence the economy is heading in the right direction, Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce says.

The results from Statistics New Zealand show that 3000 more people were employed in the quarter.

“Over the past year 34,000 jobs have been created and the number of unemployed has fallen. The latest results are encouraging given the challenges the country has had to face over the past few years with the Global Financial Crisis and Canterbury earthquakes,” Mr Joyce said.

Mr Joyce said the Government was committed to sensible management of its own finances and was determined to create the right environment to encourage competitive businesses to grow and create sustainable jobs.

“If we want more and better paying jobs, then we have to have increased business investment in New Zealand. That’s why the Government is implementing a comprehensive 120-point plan that will help build a stronger, more competitive economy.

“We have to be prepared to remove costs and roadblocks that discourage good businesses from investing and expanding. Nothing creates jobs better than successful, growing, competitive businesses.”
