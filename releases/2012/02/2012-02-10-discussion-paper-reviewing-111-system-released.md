Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams today released a discussion paper reviewing the 111 emergency calling system.

The review considers the performance of the 111 system through to the point where calls are handed over by Telecom to emergency service providers. It does not cover the response of emergency service providers to 111 calls.

About three million 111 calls are made each year, 25 per cent of which are genuine calls needing to be transferred to emergency service communication centres.

“Having a reliable and efficient 111 service is critically important for public safety and community well-being,” says Ms Adams.

“This review will ensure the framework for the service is robust and is able to accommodate changing technologies, practices and structures.”

The paper looks at whether current governance arrangements and call-answering processes are satisfactory. It concludes that the 111 service works well and has a high level of resilience.

However, the review raises questions about whether current governance arrangements are well-suited for considering improvements to the service, and the impact of new technologies.

Two options are suggested to manage the future direction of the 111 service:

• Setting up a small, dedicated group in a government agency; or

• Strengthening the joint industry-government advisory board which currently oversees the 111 service

The paper was prepared in consultation with both the Telecommunications Carriers’ Forum and emergency service providers.

The discussion document is available from the Ministry of Economic Development's website at [www.med.govt.nz/sectors-industries/technology-communication/communications/emergency-call-services/111-review](http://www.med.govt.nz/sectors-industries/technology-communication/communications/emergency-call-services/111-review).

Submissions are due by 5pm on Friday 30 March, 2012.
