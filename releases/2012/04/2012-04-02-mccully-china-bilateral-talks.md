Foreign Minister Murray McCully will travel to Beijing tomorrow for an official bilateral visit.

The 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between New Zealand and China and the launch of the New Zealand China Strategy are two key subjects Mr McCully will discuss with his counterpart, Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, during the three-day visit.

"The 40th anniversary is an opportunity to celebrate the goodwill between China and New Zealand, and to further build on trade and other links between our two countries," Mr McCully says.

"New Zealand was the first developed country to negotiate a Free Trade Agreement with China, with our exports to China tripling since the agreement came into force in 2008.

"The NZ Inc China Strategy and the appointment of Sir Don McKinnon to lead the establishment of the New Zealand China Council this year are further steps in enhancing the relationship and building trade, education, tourism and cultural links."

Mr McCully will meet with Minister Yang, Vice Premier Li Keqiang and the head of the International Department of the Chinese Communist Party, Wang Jiarui. He will also address students at the China Foreign Affairs University.
