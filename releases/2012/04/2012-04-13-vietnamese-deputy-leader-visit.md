Vietnam Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc will visit New Zealand for bilateral and business meetings over the next few days.

Mr Phuc, who arrives in New Zealand on Saturday, is to meet with the Governor General, Lt Gen The Rt Hon Sir Jerry Mateparae, Acting Prime Minister Bill English, Justice Minister Judith Collins, Education Minister Hekia Parata, Attorney General Chris Finlayson, and Foreign Minister Murray McCully.

"This visit is a valuable opportunity to discuss two-way trade, education and other opportunities for further cooperation between our two countries," says Mr English.

Vietnam is a member of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), which is New Zealand’s fourth-largest trading partner – accounting for 10 per cent of New Zealand’s exports and 16 per cent of our imports.

"New Zealand enjoys a strong and growing relationship with Vietnam. I look forward to comparing experiences on domestic issues, such as governance and economic reforms, as well as regional issues."

This is the first visit to New Zealand by Mr Phuc, who is one of four deputy prime ministers appointed in Vietnam for a five-year term in 2011. He is accompanied by a delegation of ministers and senior officials.
