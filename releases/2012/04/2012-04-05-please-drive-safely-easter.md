Associate Transport Minister Simon Bridges urges everyone to drive safely during the Easter holidays.

“Easter is one of the busiest holiday weekends in terms of traffic on our roads.

“Let’s stay focused, drive to the conditions and be aware of the risks that driver fatigue and distraction can cause,” Mr Bridges said.

Police will again be reducing speed tolerances over this period, sending a clear message that unsafe speeds are unacceptable. Over last year’s Easter break five people were killed on our roads and 202 people were injured.

“Please be careful, patient and respectful of other motorists,” Mr Bridges said.

The official Easter holiday period for 2012 runs from 4pm today, Thursday 5 April, until 6am on Tuesday 10 April.
