Youth service providers connecting young people to education, employment or training will ensure fewer become welfare dependent says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

“More than 150 providers have applied to provide services that wrap support around 16 and 17 year olds, giving them every opportunity to succeed.”

The Youth Services tender process which closed yesterday is the first step to ensure fewer disengaged young people end up trapped in the welfare system.

“I applaud every single provider who has decided to step up and do what’s needed to help these vulnerable young people,” says Ms Bennett.

“Claims that delivering what is a new and clearly signalled Government priority will result in funding cuts are mischievous and just plain wrong.”

“The new Youth Services are not about reducing funding to young people but targeting it better to those who need it most. We’re also not stopping providers from offering services to a wider age range.”

“The reality is more funding is going into this area. We have always said welfare reforms are likely to cost more, not less.”

“This Government is managing the economy and reducing debt. We must target our spending to where they’re most needed, which is what we’re doing.”

“We know that 90 per cent of disengaged 16 and 17 year olds are likely to go on to a benefit if we do nothing,” says Ms Bennett.
