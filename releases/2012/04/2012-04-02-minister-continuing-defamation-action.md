ACC Minister Judith Collins today announced she is to continue defamation action against two Labour Party MPs, Trevor Mallard and Andrew Little, and Radio New Zealand, under the Defamation Act.

“Last week I sent a letter to each of the parties who have defamed me giving them an opportunity to respond.

“Mr Mallard and Mr Little have chosen not to respond, and Radio New Zealand has responded accordingly.

“The defamation occurred in relation to me carrying out my duties as Minister for ACC.

“Even though I am fully entitled to do so, I have not asked Cabinet for funding.

“I trust that Mr Mallard and Mr Little are prepared to fund their own defence.

“Alternatively, there would be no cost and no case to answer if Mr Mallard, Mr Little and Radio New Zealand told the truth and presented their evidence.

“If they cannot do so, they should apologise and retract their comments,” said Ms Collins.
