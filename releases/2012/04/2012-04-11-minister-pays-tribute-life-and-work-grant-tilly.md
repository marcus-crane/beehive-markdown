Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson this afternoon expressed his sadness at the death of Grant Tilly, a founding member of Wellington’s Circa Theatre.

“Grant had been unwell for some time and his passing is very sad,” said Mr Finlayson. “It is impossible in a press release to list all his achievements in the theatre. He was one of a small group of people who formed Circa Theatre in 1976 and built it into its pre-eminent position today.”

“Grant was a wonderful actor who entertained generations of Wellingtonians in New Zealand plays such as Middle Age Spread and Foreskin’s Lament.”

“My thoughts are with his family, his old friends at Circa and the theatre community.”
