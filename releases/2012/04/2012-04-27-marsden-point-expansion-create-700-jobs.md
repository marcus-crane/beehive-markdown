Energy and Resources Minister Phil Heatley today welcomed the announcement of a $365 million refining expansion at Marsden Point in Whangarei that will create 700 new jobs.

“This is great news for the industry and the local community,” Mr Heatley said.

“Spending $365 million on this upgrade will mean 700 new jobs, higher energy efficiency and fewer carbon emissions. That’s fantastic news for Whangarei and for the energy industry in New Zealand.”

Refining New Zealand’s shareholders voted to support the Continuous Catalyst Regeneration Platformer (CCR) at its annual meeting today. This will replace the refinery’s 1960s processing unit, increasing capacity by three million barrels of crude a year.

“At the moment Marsden Point produces 55 per cent of the petrol and oil we buy at the service station and the like. That will rise to around 65 per cent. The refinery will also be able to process a broader range of crudes to meet New Zealand’s rising energy demands.

“As our energy needs grow we have to make sure our facilities keep up. Refining at Marsden Point accounts for 40 per cent of New Zealand’s overall energy production and needs to expand to protect our energy supply,” the Minister said.

“The Government is encouraging much more 21st century infrastructure in this country. When completed, this expansion will be an important step down that road.”
