Australian Defence Minister Stephen Smith and New Zealand Minister of Defence Dr Jonathan Coleman today reaffirmed their commitment to ANZAC Defence cooperation with the release of the Review into the Australia-New Zealand Defence Relationship.

Anzac Day marks the anniversary of the first major military action fought by Australian and New Zealand forces during the First World War. Close security cooperation continues to this day with combined operations in the Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste.

This joint Australia-New Zealand document outlines the new Defence Relationship Framework, announced by Minister Smith and Dr Coleman on 29 January 2012.

“ANZAC Day is a solemn reminder of the sacrifices made by Australian and New Zealand military personnel over many generations”, said Mr Smith.

“The Defence Relationship Framework will enhance the already strong and enduring defence partnership with our ANZAC partner”.

“The Review builds on the ANZAC tradition by strengthening bilateral engagement structures; promoting greater bilateral cooperation in Asia and the Pacific; and encouraging the development of more complementary and cost effective military capabilities,” said Dr Coleman.
