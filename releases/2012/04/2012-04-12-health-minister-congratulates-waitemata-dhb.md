Health Minister Tony Ryall is in Auckland today to congratulate Waitemata DHB on its major achievements in the national health targets, especially the shorter stays in emergency departments target. He will also visit Torbay Health.

“For the first time, Waitemata DHB has exceeded the national target of having 95% of emergency department patients admitted, discharged or transferred in six hours or less for an entire quarter" says Mr Ryall.

"This is a dramatic change from the winter of 2007 when numerous patients waited on trolleys in corridors for admission to hospital wards, sometimes for days on end.

"Just three years ago Waitemata used to be the poorest performing DHB, meeting only 61% of the ED waiting time target.

"This latest improvement is set against a rise in the number of patients. Last year the EDs saw 102,261 – 31% more than in 2009.

"This is of huge benefit to the sick and injured of Waitemata and I'd like to congratulate the staff at Waitemata DHB for their commitment and hard work."

Mr Ryall says Waitemata's staff have made great progress in improving other key hospital and community services.

"Over the past three years the Government has invested $1.5 billion of new money into the pubic health service, including over $153 million extra funding to Waitemata DHB. We've also funded the new emergency care centre, new dialysis centre and a new elective surgery centre.

"The DHB has invested its extra funding into more services supported by 149 more frontline doctors (junior and senior) and 189 more nurses (excluding health care assistants).

Mr Ryall is also visiting Torbay Health. The large general practice includes a skin clinic and an operating theatre for minor surgery. A pharmacy, midwifery service, laboratory, physiotherapist and counselling service are also on site.

The health complex recently underwent a $1 million revamp that included new systems enabling patients to communicate directly with their doctor, request prescriptions on line, and share information with other health services.

"There's a lot of positive change happening in general practice, and it's great to see health professionals leading this. Patients are the big winners."
