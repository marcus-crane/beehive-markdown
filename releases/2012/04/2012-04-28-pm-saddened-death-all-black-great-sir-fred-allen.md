Prime Minister John Key says he is saddened to hear of the death of All Black legend Sir Fred Allen, who was knighted in the 2010 Queen’s Birthday Honours List.

Sir Fred was born in Oamaru, educated in Christchurch, and served overseas with the 2nd NZEF during World War 2. After the war he played for Auckland, and then the All Blacks from 1946 to 1949.

He went on to coach Auckland and then the All Blacks from 1966 to 1968, winning all 14 tests during that period.

Sir Fred was 92 when he died, and was the oldest living All Black.

“I would like to take the opportunity to express my sincerest condolences to the family and friends of Sir Fred,” says Mr Key.

“He was a great New Zealander, and one who richly deserved the honours bestowed on him.”
