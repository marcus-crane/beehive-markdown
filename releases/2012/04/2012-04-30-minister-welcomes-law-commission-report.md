Consumer Affairs Minister Simon Bridges has welcomed the Law Commission’s report on repossession laws.

The Law Commission has recommended a range of changes to the Credit (Repossession) Act. It has also suggested incorporating changes to repossession law in the Government’s current review of credit legislation.

“An overhaul of credit laws is a top priority and this timely and thorough analysis of repossession laws is an invaluable contribution to that.”

Mr Bridges says the Government is currently consulting on a draft bill aimed at tightening credit law to crack down on loan sharks.

“I will give serious consideration to the Law Commission’s report and, in particular, its suggestion that the two laws covering repossession and consumer credit be combined into a single piece of legislation.

“I have already made it clear that loan sharks must be reined in. I also believe the Commission’s ideas have real merit, and I will be discussing how to progress them with officials and Cabinet.

“I congratulate the Law Commission for providing a thorough analysis on what is a complex area of law.”
