The Ministry of Education has entered into a contract for New Zealand’s first school property public private partnership (PPP), Associate Minister of Education, Craig Foss announced today.

Learning Infrastructure Partners will be responsible for the design, construction, finance and maintenance of Hobsonville Point primary and secondary schools for the next 25 years.

Hobsonville Point Primary School will open at the beginning of 2013 and Hobsonville Point Secondary School will open early 2014.

“This is an exciting development for Hobsonville Point and its future learners,” says Mr Foss. “The Board of Trustees and school leadership will not have to worry about maintaining school property as that will be the responsibility of the private partner”.

“Having a private partner managing school facilities will give the school Board and teaching staff more time to focus on student learning and achievement”

“Under this PPP, the Crown is no longer exposed to design and construction risks. These become the responsibility of the private partner who must fix them promptly or face financial penalties,” says Mr Foss.

Learning Infrastructure Partners is a consortium of firms with significant experience in designing, building and maintaining New Zealand schools.

The design work has been carried out by ASC Architects and Perumal Pedavoli Architects, the schools will be built by Hawkins Construction and maintained by Programmed Facility Management.
