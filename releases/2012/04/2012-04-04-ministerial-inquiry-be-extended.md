The Ministerial Inquiry into the employment of a convicted sex offender in the education sector will now report back on 15 June 2012, Education Minister, Hekia Parata, said today.

The inquiry was to report back to Ms Parata by 30 April 2012 however with the case before the court it has been difficult for inquiry head, Mel Smith, to speak to key witnesses prompting him to seek an extension.

Ms Parata says she was happy to grant Mr Smith more time to ensure the investigation was thorough however she has asked for an interim report by 30 April 2012.

Ms Parata also announced that former chief executive of the Education Review Office, Dr Judith Aitken, has been appointed to help Mr Smith with the inquiry, which was initiated after it was established that a convicted sex offender had been working in the education sector breaching the conditions of his release.
