Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew today visited Middlemore Central, also known as MMC, the nerve centre of one of New Zealand’s largest hospitals.

Counties Manukau DHB is well into the first year of operating the centralised communications hub. MMC serves not only Middlemore hospital but also various other units associated with the hospital including Manukau Surgery Centre, Otara Spinal Unit, Franklin Memorial hospital and Papakura, Pukekohe and Botany Maternity Units.

Staff can visit MMC or access information any time of the day or night and get a real sense of what is happening around the entire hospital. This lets staff easily identify vulnerable patients. Using devices such as electronic tablets also ensures the information is available at the bedside.

“By bringing together key staff and activities in one location and centralising communications, the hospital’s services can operate more efficiently and responsively,” Mrs Goodhew said.

Mrs Goodhew acknowledged the contribution initiatives such as MMC make to achieving national health targets.

"This is the sort of innovation that is driving big improvements. For example we have seen the best ever nationwide result against the target for 95 per cent of patients to be seen in emergency departments within six hours. Counties Manukau DHB continues to be a standout performer, exceeding the national goal with 97 per cent of patients seen within the target time.”

Mrs Goodhew, whose responsibilities include aged care and the Health Quality and Safety Commission, was also shown Counties Manukau DHB’s positive ageing initiatives and how its “Saving 20,000 Days” campaign works to prevent acute admissions.

The Government has put in an extra $1.5 billion of new money into public health services over the past three years, including over $180 million extra funding to Counties Manukau DHB.
