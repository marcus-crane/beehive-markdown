Consumer Affairs Minister Simon Bridges has announced a new wheel clamping code of conduct is in development.

Mr Bridges met with key leaders in the New Zealand parking enforcement industry in Auckland yesterday.

“This new voluntary code of conduct will set out the minimum standards and good practice that these wheel clamping companies will abide by.

“It will continue to protect the rights of private landowners while giving clarity to consumers about what they can expect from these wheel clamping operators.”

The parties will begin work on the draft code of conduct over the next month before meeting again with Mr Bridges.

“It was good to have a frank discussion about this issue that has been of growing interest and concern in recent months.

“I’m pleased to see that the parking enforcement industry has recognised those concerns and the need to develop a code of conduct.”
