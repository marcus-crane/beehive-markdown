The Minister of Defence, Dr Jonathan Coleman, says he is saddened to learn of the death today of a New Zealand soldier serving with the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Afghanistan.

The death was not the result of a combat operation and does not appear to involve the actions of another party.

The government offers its condolences to the man’s family and loved ones.

Dr Coleman says the New Zealand Defence Force will provide more information tomorrow.

The Minister says an appropriate investigation will be held into the matter.
