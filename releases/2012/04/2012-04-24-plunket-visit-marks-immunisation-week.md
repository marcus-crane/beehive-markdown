Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew visited a Wellington Plunket playgroup today, one of many community events occurring across the country to mark Immunisation Week.

“I want to thank Plunket providers for their support for immunisation. Parents tell us that one of the biggest factors in their decision to immunise their child is the conversation that they have with trusted health professionals about vaccination. Plunket nurses and WellChild/Tamariki Ora providers play a key role in that,” Mrs Goodhew says.

Immunisation Week from April 23-29 is a World Health Organization international event. This is the second time New Zealand has participated.

Protecting your child by getting them immunised on time is an important message this year as New Zealand currently has a whooping cough outbreak.

Babies are particularly vulnerable to diseases like whooping cough – more than 100 babies under the age of one have been hospitalised with this disease since the current whooping cough outbreak began in August last year.

Babies aren’t protected from whooping cough until they have had all of their free immunisations against this disease at six weeks, three months and five months.

“From July the health sector will focus on the new immunisation Health Target that 95 percent of eight-month-olds fully are immunised by December 2014. This is to make sure we get our youngest children protected against whooping cough as soon as possible.

“I hope the activities, displays and promotion of vaccination during Immunisation Week prompt parents to make an immunisation appointment for their child or talk through any concerns or questions they have with their Plunket nurse, WellChild/Tamariki Ora provider, GP or practice nurse.”
