Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee says a new understanding between China and New Zealand triples the number of passenger flights that may be operated between the two countries. The understanding comes following a visit to New Zealand from His Excellency Jia Qinglin, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference.

“The market for travel between China and New Zealand is growing rapidly. Within the next few years China is forecast to become New Zealand’s second largest source of visitors after Australia,” says Mr Brownlee.

China Southern has recently started operating a daily service to Auckland from Guangzhou, reaching the maximum number of flights provided for Chinese airlines under the previous air services arrangements between New Zealand and China. A total of 42 return flights per week may now be operated, with 21 return flights for the airlines of each country.

“This is a positive step for the New Zealand tourism industry.”

“This understanding will also give Chinese airlines the capacity to serve other international airports in New Zealand in the future.”

“I particularly look forward to China Southern scheduling flights to Christchurch,” Mr Brownlee says.

In addition to a greater number of flights between both countries, the airlines of New Zealand and China may now fly to three more third-country airports en-route between New Zealand and China or beyond. The two sides also agreed to liberalise the treaty provisions relating to tariffs regulation.

Part of the new understanding will also enable the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority to cooperate more closely with its Chinese counterpart, the Civil Aviation Administration of China, on technical matters.

“This will facilitate the developing aviation trade relationship between our two countries.”

New Zealand and Chinese officials also discussed the constraints on airport capacity in China as the airline industry there enjoys rapid growth. Mr Brownlee noted the efforts that China is making to increase the capacity of its aviation infrastructure.

The Chinese and New Zealand officials have committed to meeting again in 2014 to discuss opportunities to further liberalise the air services arrangements.

The bilateral air services negotiations which led to the new agreement were held in Wellington on 10-11 April 2011.
