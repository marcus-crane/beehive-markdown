Work will begin to connect all of New Zealand’s remaining schools, including our most remote, to faster broadband, Education Minister Hekia Parata and Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams announced today.

Ms Parata says 57 remote schools and 193 provincial schools are included in the latest Rural Broadband Initiative contracts.

The remote schools, which includes schools in Haast, Stewart Island and Great Barrier Island, will receive faster broadband (10Mbps or more) using point to point wireless technology.

Ms Parata says improving broadband for remote schools will break down the barriers imposed by distance and isolation.

“Many of these schools have relied on using satellite broadband and have had to manage with small data caps and slow speeds, but this project will make a massive difference for students and teachers at these schools,” she says.

“The schools will now have access to the best online resources from anywhere in the world, and they will also be able to connect to the Network for Learning.”

Ms Adams says many of the communities surrounding the schools will also benefit, as the providers have agreed to make available wireless and fixed-line broadband services to many of the communities.

“The improved broadband services will be light years ahead of where they are today.  This will mean that students will be able to use tools that were not very effective using satellite broadband, such as video conferencing. “

The four service providers are Inspire.net, Gisborne.net, Chorus and Araneo.

In addition to the 57 remote schools, the Government has previously announced a special grant to improve telecommunications services on the Chatham Islands. A condition of this special grant is that the three schools located on the islands will receive enhanced satellite broadband.

“The Government promised that no school would miss out on faster broadband and I’m delighted that we are delivering on that promise,” Ms Adams says.
