The Government has received the Productivity Commission's final report on international freight services and will provide a thorough response once it has considered it in detail, Finance Minister Bill English says.

“International freight issues are vitally important to New Zealand as a nation of exporters, located a long way from major world markets," Mr English says.

“Increasing our export competitiveness is a critical part of achieving better productivity growth and ensuring New Zealanders maintain and increase their standard of living.

“The Government will look at the Productivity Commission's recommendations and carefully consider its response over the coming months," Mr English says.

The report, which was tabled today, looks at the effectiveness and efficiency of the existing infrastructure and regulatory regimes for international freight transport services.
