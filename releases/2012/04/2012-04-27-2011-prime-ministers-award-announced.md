Jade Fai Leung from Auckland’s St Cuthbert’s College was named today as winner of the Prime Minister’s Award for Academic Excellence.

Education Minister, Hekia Parata, presented the Top Scholar Awards, on behalf of the Prime Minister, at Government House.

The Prime Minister’s Award for Academic Excellence recognises the highest achieving student in the annual New Zealand scholarship examinations.

“Jade has achieved an extraordinary six Outstanding Scholarships in Chemistry, Geography, Painting, Physics, Science, and Statistics and Modelling,’’ says Ms Parata.

“This is an amazing achievement as Outstanding Scholars are the top 1 per cent of the cohort for each subject.

“On top of this, Jade has also achieved Scholarships in Biology, English, and Spanish. This makes for an impressive nine Scholarship

awards in total.”

It is the second year the Prime Minister’s Award for Academic Excellence has been presented. The Award encourages and motivates students to achieve the very highest academic levels.

The Top Scholar Award ceremony also recognised the achievements of 10 Premier Award winners. Premier Awards are limited to the top 5 to 10 Scholarship students in New Zealand, and the 35 Top Subject Scholars.
