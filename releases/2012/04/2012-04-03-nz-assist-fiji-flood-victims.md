Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced that New Zealand will make $500,000 immediately available to agencies assisting flood victims in Fiji.

"In addition to the reported deaths thousands have been forced from their homes and into evacuation centres," Mr McCully says.

"The situation is severe as Fiji is still recovering from January’s floods and many response agencies will not have fully replenished their supplies.

"New Zealand’s funding will be provided to the Fiji Red Cross, and other non-government agencies well positioned to respond. New Zealand always stands ready to help the people of Fiji when disaster strikes.

"We will continue to monitor the situation closely and will consider further support based on the needs of relief agencies who are working with flood-affected communities," Mr McCully says.

New Zealand provided $350,000 to the Fiji Red Cross to support the response to severe floods in January and a further $1.5 million to the Fiji Natural Disaster Management Office and to refurbish evacuation centres.
