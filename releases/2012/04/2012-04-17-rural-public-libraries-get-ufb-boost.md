Rural public libraries to get UFB boost

Public access to broadband has received a big boost, with 183 rural public libraries included in the Rural Broadband Initiative, Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams and Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain have announced.

Ultra-fast broadband (UFB) will be available at libraries throughout the country, including in Winton, Waimate, Darfield, Hokitika, Te Kuiti, Opotiki and Ngaruawahia.

Ms Adams says having UFB available at rural libraries will make a big difference to local communities.

“It means communities will have better and faster access to information, education and job-seeking tools.”

Mr Tremain says libraries are the hub of many small communities and their roles will become even more important in the future.

“The RBI creates sustainable connectivity options for library users who do not have access to UFB in the home.

“Today’s announcement ensures the benefits of the Government’s investment into fibre will be widespread throughout the communities.”
