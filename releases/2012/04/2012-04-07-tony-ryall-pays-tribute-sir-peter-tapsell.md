Health Minister and Bay of Plenty MP Tony Ryall has paid tribute to Sir Peter Tapsell who has passed away.

"Sir Peter Tapsell had very high standards, and great ambition for Maori.

"As Speaker and as an MP he was prepared to work with MPs of all parties who wanted to work positively.

"As a local MP, I often met Sir Peter in all far corners of the electorate. He, the late Mrs Margaret Tapsell and I shared many events in the Eastern Bay of Plenty and East Coast. He was always courteous and generous to all.

"The people of the Bay of Plenty - and Te Arawa in particular - have lost a great leader" said Mr Ryall.
