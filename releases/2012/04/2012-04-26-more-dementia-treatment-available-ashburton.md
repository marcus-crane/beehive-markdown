More local Mid Canterbury people suffering from dementia will be cared for in their local community following an extension and refurbishment to an aged care hospital unit officially opened today by Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew.

“This community investment adds another 10 bed dementia unit to the existing 12 psychogeriatric and 15 long stay hospital beds already in the Tuarangi resthome and hospital,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“We are living longer and sadly that also means that the number of older New Zealanders with dementia is increasing.

“A loved one living with dementia is a challenge faced by many families, but there is much that we can do. These additional dedicated beds mean that local people with dementia can, if they choose, remain closer to home should they need residential care.”

Providing care for individuals with dementia is a growing issue for our country. The 2010 aged residential care services review identified the most pressing need as expanding dementia units, beds and services.

The Government responded last year with an additional $44 million over four years to look after people living with dementia. This includes $40 million for residential dementia services and $4 million for respite care for full-time carers of individuals with dementia.

The Government is committed to ensuring all older people in residential care, including those with dementia, receive quality services and care.

The Tuarangi Home is owned and operated by the Canterbury District Health Board. This refurbishment and extension has been funded thanks to donations from the Moule and Twigger estates.
