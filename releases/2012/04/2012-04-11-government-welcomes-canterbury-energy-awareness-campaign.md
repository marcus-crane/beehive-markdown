Energy and Resources Minister Phil Heatley today welcomed the launch in Canterbury of a campaign to raise energy awareness.

The Christchurch Agency for Energy (CAfE) has launched EA12, a public awareness programme for 2012, starting with events in April and May.

“I applaud CAfE’s initiative, which will help Cantabrians use energy more efficiently and encourage them to look for opportunities to use renewable energy.

“It is important to have this kind of information top of mind especially as residents and businesses are rebuilding and re-establishing themselves after the earthquakes. Many of the decisions being made as part of the re-build will lock in energy use for decades to come,” Mr Heatley said.

The awareness campaign will include community forums, advertising, and events. It builds on CAfE’s work on a District Energy Scheme, its development of ongoing comprehensive city energy figures and work with the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority on a programme to improve the energy performance of commercial buildings.

Better energy use is a critical factor for growing the economy, as well as helping households and businesses manage their energy bills.

“The Government has set targets for increasing renewable energy use, and improving energy efficiency as part of the New Zealand Energy Strategy. Initiatives such as EA12 will help the people of Canterbury understand where opportunities lie, and how they can make the best of them.”
