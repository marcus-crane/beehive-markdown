Former Minister Georgina te Heuheu has been appointed to the Board of Māori Television, Māori Affairs Minister Hon Dr Pita Sharples said today.

“Mrs te Heuheu has been appointed to the Board for three years, effective immediately, and she will replace the current Chair of the Board when his term expires on 30 April 2012,” said Dr Sharples.

“Mrs te Heuheu has extensive experience in central government, public accountability, and recent experience with the Māori broadcasting industry as Associate Minister of Māori Affairs with delegated responsibility for Māori broadcasting.

“This mix of skills and experience will complement those of the existing members of the Board. The Chairperson of Te Putahi Paho, the Māori broadcasting electoral college, has agreed to Mrs te Heuheu’s appointment.

“Mrs te Heuheu has also had a distinguished career in law, having been the first Māori woman called to the bar in 1972. She was a member of the Waitangi Tribunal for ten years, a member of the Courts Consultative Committee, and Minister for Courts in two governments,” he said.

“She has also been a director of the Māori Development Corporation, the Midland Regional Health Authority and Te Papa Tongarewa, and a Council member of the University of Waikato.

“I would like to thank Garry Muriwai for his outstanding contribution as Chair. He has provided strong leadership for Māori Television and the service has gone from strength to strength during his five years at the helm,” said Dr Sharples.

“With a Crown appointee becoming Chair, Te Putahi Paho has chosen Tahu Potiki to become Deputy Chair. Mr Potiki has been reappointed for a third term, in recognition of his strong performance as a board member, and I welcome him to his new post.”

The Board of Māori Television is made up of three members appointed by the Minister of Māori Affairs and the Minister of Finance, and four members appointed by Te Putahi Paho, an electoral college representing Māori language and broadcasting interests.

The other members are Ian Taylor, Donna Gardiner, Garry Muriwai (outgoing Chair), Tahu Potiki, Rikirangi Gage and Cathy Dewes.
