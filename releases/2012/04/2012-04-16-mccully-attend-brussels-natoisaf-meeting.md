Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will attend a NATO/ISAF Foreign and Defence Ministers' meeting in Brussels this week to discuss the ongoing transfer of security responsibility from the international coalition to the government of Afghanistan.

"New Zealand has a good story to tell about the provincial reconstruction team in Bamyan. The province was one of the first to begin transition over to full Afghan authority and I plan to update coalition members on our progress," Mr McCully says.

While in Brussels, Mr McCully will also hold a series of bilateral meetings with senior NATO and ISAF political and military figures.
