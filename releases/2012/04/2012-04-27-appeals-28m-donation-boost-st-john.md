The Christchurch Earthquake Appeal's donation of $2.8 million to St John has enabled the charity to rebuild its emergency response resources after the series of earthquakes which damaged Christchurch, Prime Minister John Key said today.

On a tour of St John's new South Island headquarters in Orchard Road, Mr Key was shown the vehicles and equipment - including ambulances, defibrillators and medical supplies - the donation has helped the charity to purchase.

"St John has touched the lives of hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders over the course of its 127-year history,” says Mr Key.

“Its staff played a vital role in the aftermath of the Christchurch earthquakes, being among the first emergency services to respond to the devastating and life-threatening situations which shook the city.

"Since the first earthquake in September 2010, St John has suffered about $3 million worth of damage to its equipment and technology, so the grant from the Appeal goes a long way to bringing the emergency service back up to full operational capacity."

St John is using the grant to replace and repair equipment lost or damaged during the earthquakes, which will ensure it is well-placed to respond if another large emergency event strikes the region.

The Christchurch Earthquake Appeal was launched by Mr Key, and is the Government’s official, global fundraiser for the recovery effort for Christchurch and the Canterbury region.

The Trust has committed funds of around $42 million to a variety of projects, including the Re:Start container mall in Cashel Street, the new Christchurch Stadium and the Court Theatre. Over $50 million remains to be allocated, with the Trust intending to disburse the majority during 2012.
