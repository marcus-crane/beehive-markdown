Social Development Minister Paula Bennett says more than 8,000 people cancelled their benefit last month because they found work.

“More than 5,000 people who were on Unemployment Benefits around New Zealand went off welfare into work last month,” says Ms Bennett.

The number of people on Unemployment Benefits is now 53,479. This is the lowest level in the month of March since 2009.

“We’re particularly focused on young people so it’s pleasing to see more than 2,800 young people found jobs last month and cancelled their benefit.”

There are now 15,023 young people on Unemployment Benefits.

“The National Government has shown real leadership with initiatives for youth employment, including the recently announced Job Ops with Training.”

“Already, about 2,000 young people have benefited from a subsidised job which includes a training component so they can up their skills while in work,” says Ms Bennett.

The original Job Ops programme and Community Max introduced in 2009, benefited more than 17,000 young people altogether.

The total number of people on benefits in Canterbury has decreased by 4,412 since the February 2011 earthquake to less than 30,000 today, a 13.2% drop.

The number of people on Unemployment Benefits in this region fell 363 in the last month to 4,719. Prior to the February quake, there were 5,380 on this benefit.

The total number of people on benefits fell by 6,698 last month to 322,951.

Note: when welfare changes come into effect later this year, reporting on benefit numbers will change. This will be clearly signalled in advance.
