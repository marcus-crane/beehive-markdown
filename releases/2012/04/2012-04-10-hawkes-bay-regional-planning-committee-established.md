“The planning committee is an excellent example of tangata whenua and local government working together. I applaud the vision and leadership of tangata whenua and this Council in establishing the Planning Committee.

Through the committee, iwi will be able to contribute towards planning for the use of natural resources and environmental outcomes through regional plans and regional policy statement.

“Initiatives like this are about agreeing to a better future for all. But this is not just about engagement, it is a practical measure that will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of planning processes in the Region.
