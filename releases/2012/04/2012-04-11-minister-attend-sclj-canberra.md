Justice Minister Judith Collins will travel to Canberra today to attend a meeting of the Standing Council of Law and Justice (SCLJ) on 12-13 April.

The SCLJ is comprised of the Attorneys-General of Australia, its states and territories, and New Zealand's Minister of Justice. Norfolk Island has observer status at SCLJ meetings.

Ministers will hear presentations and discussions on law and justice related issues and have the opportunity to put forward their representation’s perspective.

“I am looking forward to attending my first Standing Council of Law and Justice meeting. This forum provides a great opportunity to meet with my Australian counterparts and to discuss topics of interest that will benefit both our countries,” Ms Collins said.

SCLJ provides a forum for Ministers to discuss and progress matters of mutual interest, including projects to align laws across jurisdictions and simplify legal transactions across state and trans-Tasman boundaries.
