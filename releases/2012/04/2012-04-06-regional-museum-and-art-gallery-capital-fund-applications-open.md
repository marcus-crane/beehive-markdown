The government is calling for applications for 2012/13 to its regional museums policy fund for capital Construction projects, Arts Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson announced today.

The fund assists regional museum and art galleries that house collections of greatest national significance to improve access to and care of these collections through major construction projects.

About $3 million will be available for allocation to qualifying museum and art gallery redevelopment projects.

The Regional Museums Policy for Capital Construction Projects was established in 2000/01. It recognises that national significant collections are held by key regional museums.

Past recipients have included the Auckland Art Gallery ($30 million); Otago Settlers Museum ($6 million); Rotorua Museum and Art Gallery ($7.5 million); The New Dowse, Lower Hutt ($1.75 million) and most recently the Len Lye Centre ($4 million).

Applications close 5pm Friday 4 May 2012.
