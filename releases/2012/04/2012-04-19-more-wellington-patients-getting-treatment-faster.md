Capital and Coast DHB patients are benefiting from the extra $188 million the government has invested in the DHB since 2009.

Health Minister Tony Ryall is visiting Wellington Hospital today to personally congratulate Capital & Coast DHB teams for stepping up and providing more patients with faster treatment.

“I’d like to thank all staff throughout the DHB for this great effort. It just shows what can be done with determination,” says Mr Ryall.

The Minister will thank the oncology team for regularly achieving the national health target for faster cancer radiation treatment. In the past year they provided cancer radiation treatment to 403 more people than in 2008 - the largest increase in the country (800 to1220), and they’re providing the care faster.

“Last year nationally, more than 7,800 New Zealanders, ready for treatment, received their cancer radiation within the world gold standard of four weeks. That’s a 16% increase since 2008, when only around 6,700 people received their treatment on time.

"Only three or four years ago, some patients were waiting up to 15 weeks to start their radiation treatment and many had to travel to Australia. Today all patients ready for treatment start their treatment within the gold standard.”

The Minister will also be spending time with Capital and Coast Emergency Department staff where preliminary results show a remarkable 13% jump in the percentage of patients seen within the six hour national health target over the past year.

88 per cent of ED patients were admitted, discharged, or transferred from the ED within six hours in the past quarter compared to 75 per cent a year ago.

“Emergency department waits are a barometer of how well the whole hospital is doing. This latest information shows Wellington’s doing better and better and that’s great for patients.

“This Government has invested an extra $1.5 billion into the public health service over its first term, including over $188 million extra for CCDHB enabling them to provide more services with over 100 extra doctors(junior and senior) and 240 extra nurses (excluding health assistants).

“And we will continue to invest more and deliver better health services to New Zealanders.”
