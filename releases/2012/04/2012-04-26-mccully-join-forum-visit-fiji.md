Foreign Minister Murray McCully will travel to Suva on Monday as a member of the Pacific Islands Forum Ministerial Contact Group on Fiji.

Mr McCully today thanked the Fiji administration for its agreement to the MCG visit.

“This visit will enable the MCG to resume direct dialogue with Fiji after a significant interval,” Mr McCully said.

“New Zealand as Forum Chair has placed high importance on the maintenance of dialogue and engagement with Fiji.

“Next week’s meeting comes at a pivotal time for Fiji and following a number of positive developments. This includes the decision to commence voter registration, the establishment of the Constitutional Commission, and the commencement of a public dialogue on the shape of the constitution on which elections can be held. These are all constructive moves which I have welcomed on New Zealand’s behalf.

“The MCG discussions will give us an opportunity to see how we can assist in achieving further progress.”
