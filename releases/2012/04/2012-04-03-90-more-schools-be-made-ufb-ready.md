Associate Education Minister, Craig Foss, today confirmed a further 90 schools will receive government-subsidised internal network upgrades, in readiness for ultra-fast broadband.

The Ministry of Education’s School Network Upgrade Project (SNUP) has so far upgraded internal school networks in more than a third of eligible state and state-integrated schools, with more underway.

“This approach is a key part of ensuring that the Government’s significant investment in providing 97.7 per cent of schools with ultra-fast broadband access, delivers the expected benefits for our young people” says Mr Foss.

“It will make more schools ready for the teaching and learning benefits to be delivered via the Network for Learning, when this becomes progressively available from 2013.”

Mr Foss says that this latest SNUP announcement is part of the Government’s commitment to keep pace with the fibre roll out as schools are being selected for SNUP in smaller groups, more frequently.

The 90 new schools confirmed for a SNUP upgrade, and SNUP selection criteria can be viewed at [www.minedu.govt.nz/networks](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/networks).
