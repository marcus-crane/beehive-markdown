Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully has joined the widespread international condemnation of North Korea’s satellite launch today using ballistic missile technology.

"Despite North Korea’s claim that the satellite launch is for peaceful purposes, this action violates UN Security Council Resolutions, aggravates tensions and undermines efforts to build peace and stability in the region," Mr McCully says.

"It is a major disappointment following their recent agreement with the United States to put a moratorium on long-range missile launches.

"The New Zealand government strongly urges North Korea to abide by its obligations under UN Security Council resolutions, cease its provocations, and take steps to denuclearise," Mr McCully says.
