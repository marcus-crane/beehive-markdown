Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee says a new national airspace policy will give the aviation industry clarity on future development and modernisation of the country’s airspace.

“This updated policy will future proof the airspace and air navigation system to ensure the safe and efficient movement of air traffic,” Mr Brownlee says.

The National Airspace Policy of New Zealand sets out principles to be applied to the classification and design of airspace, the funding of air traffic management and air navigation services, and the resilience of the airspace system.

The policy also states the desired attributes of New Zealand’s future airspace system as efficient, environmentally responsible, integrated, and interoperable.

“The government’s expectation is that these attributes will be pursued as much as possible, while ensuring that safety is not adversely impacted,” Mr Brownlee says.

“This policy will provide the impetus for system-wide coordination of planning through the National Airspace and Air Navigation Plan, which is currently being developed by the Civil Aviation Authority.

“It will also provide opportunities to improve the safety and efficiency of aircraft operations, integrate airspace planning with decisions on land use and ensure the appropriate regulatory requirements are sound, coherent, and stable.”

Worldwide, there are significant changes being made in how aircraft navigate between airports, and how air traffic will be managed in the future. These changes will impact the full spectrum of airspace and air navigation related services in New Zealand.

The policy has been developed by the Ministry of Transport with the Civil Aviation Authority and an Advisory Forum, which included representatives of major airlines, commercial industry associations for airlines, airports and general aviation, recreational aviation interest groups, the Airways Corporation of New Zealand Ltd, the New Zealand Air Line Pilots’ Association and the New Zealand Defence Force.
