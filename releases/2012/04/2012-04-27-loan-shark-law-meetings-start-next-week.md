Consumer Affairs Minister Simon Bridges will begin a series of meetings on Monday to discuss tougher loan shark laws.

The Minister will meet with community and industry groups in Wellington on Monday, followed by meetings in Auckland and Christchurch on 7 May, to discuss the draft Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Amendment Bill.

“There are too many unscrupulous lenders, operating in some of our poorest communities and leaving families trapped in a spiral of debt. The Government has put together a comprehensive package to crack down on these loan sharks and give borrowers much greater protection.

“This draft law represents the biggest change to consumer credit legislation in a decade and it’s important to get it right. I’m looking forward to a frank discussion with community and industry representatives on the issues we face and the proposals this Government has put forward.

“I’m also pleased to announce that I have extended the consultation timeframe by two weeks to give people more of a chance to have their say. Consultation will now close on Friday 25 May, and I urge anyone interested to make a submission to the Ministry of Consumer Affairs.”

Key changes in the draft law include:

- Making it illegal to lend money to someone whose loan repayments would be likely to result in substantial hardship;
- Requiring more timely and complete disclosure of loan terms, and extending the ‘cooling off’ period for borrowers to cancel their loan;
- Obligating lenders to properly consider applications by borrowers for hardship relief, and provide reasons for their decisions;
- Better controls against misleading, deceptive or confusing advertising;
- Introducing a new Code of Responsible Lending – and allowing for lenders to be banned from the industry for non-compliance;
- Providing that borrowers won’t have to pay the cost of interest or fees if their lender is not a registered financial service provider.
