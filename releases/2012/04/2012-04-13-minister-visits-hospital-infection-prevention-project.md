Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew is seeing first-hand today the work being done in the fight against health care-acquired infections.

A national programme is being run by the Health Quality and Safety Commission to reduce central line blood-stream infections as part of its focus on infection prevention and control. These infections can lead to longer hospital stays and associated costs.

“This is a great illustration of how the Commission working with the health sector can mean less complications and reduced stays in hospital for patients and also ease hospital workloads,” says Mrs Goodhew, who has delegated responsibility for HQSC.

Dunedin Hospital is one of a number of centres working with HQSC on improving the use of central line catheters in order to reduce the number of infections.

Mrs Goodhew will be visiting the hospital’s intensive care unit to see the project in action. She will also receive an update on the ongoing investigation into breast-screening issues at the Breast-Screen Healthcare Service.

During her visit Mrs Goodhew will take the opportunity to congratulate the Southern DHB on their continued excellent results against the cancer waiting times national health target and their improvement in access to elective surgery. In addition, the DHB has made gains against the targets for shorter stays in emergency departments and better help for smokers to quit.

“Over the past three years the Government has invested $1.5 billion of new money into the public health service, including over $71 million extra funding to Southern DHB.

“The DHB has invested its extra funding in more services supported by 45 more frontline doctors (junior and senior) and 93 more nurses (excluding health care assistants).”
