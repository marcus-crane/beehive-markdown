Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced New Zealand will provide a further $1 million for recovery and reconstruction work following the severe floods in Fiji this month.

Today’s announcement brings New Zealand’s total flood support to $2.25 million.

“The devastating floods forced the evacuation of 14,000 people and destroyed homes, business and crops,” Mr McCully says.

“Those living in the flood-affected areas need housing, medical services and access to clean water and sanitation. As a vital source of food and income, crops also need to be replanted.

“New Zealand is always ready to assist our Pacific neighbours recover from natural disasters - we want to see flood-affected communities rebuild their homes and lives as quickly as possible,” Mr McCully says.
