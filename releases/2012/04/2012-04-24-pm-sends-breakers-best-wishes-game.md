Prime Minister John Key is sending his best wishes to the Breakers for their ANBL grand final tonight.

“At one game each it will be a battle of epic proportions, particularly with the history between the two teams,” say Mr Key.

After the Breakers won the first game of the three game series, the Perth Wildcats levelled the series last week with an 87-86 win

“That one point loss last week in Perth is powerful motivation.”

The New Zealand Breakers tip off against the Perth Wildcats at 7.30 tonight in Auckland.

“While I can’t be at Vector Arena I will make sure I am kept up to date with the score during the evening.

“Good luck and play hard. Thousands of cheering Kiwis will be doing their best to encourage you to keep the trophy on this side of the Tasman.”
