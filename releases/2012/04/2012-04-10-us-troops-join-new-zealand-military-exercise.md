Defence Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman has announced that the New Zealand Defence Force is hosting United States military personnel in an exercise to be held in the central North Island later this month.

35 US Marines and 41 US Army personnel will participate alongside New Zealand forces in Exercise Alam Halfa starting on 26 April.

The US personnel will exercise with members of the New Zealand Army's 1st Brigade.

"This cooperation builds on a pattern of exercises involving New Zealand and US personnel since the signing of the Wellington Declaration in November 2010," says Dr Coleman.

Exercise Alam Halfa will begin in Linton and Napier on 26 April and conclude on 6 May.
