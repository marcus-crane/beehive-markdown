Associate Transport Minister Simon Bridges is thanking Kiwi drivers for helping to achieve an historic fatality-free Easter Weekend on New Zealand roads.

"For the first time since authorities began keeping records in 1956, the Easter weekend has finished up with no road deaths. Police have reported that by and large drivers have been patient and courteous, keeping their speeds down and just taking their time to get to and from their destinations safely.

"Ultimately road safety is everyone’s responsibility, and New Zealand drivers deserve a pat on the back for doing their part this weekend."

This is the first zero toll for any holiday period since records began in 1956. The previous lowest road toll for Easter was in 2003, 2002 and 1998 when three people died.

Mr Bridges said while the weekend results were encouraging, the challenge going forward would be to keep the momentum up and achieve a long-term reduction in death and injuries on the road.

"Through the Safer Journeys strategy the government is focused on creating a safe road system increasingly free of death and serious injury, but improving road safety is something that everyone can contribute to and I urge all New Zealanders to play their part."
