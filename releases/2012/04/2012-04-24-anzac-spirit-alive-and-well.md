The Minister of Defence says tomorrow’s Anzac Day commemorations will acknowledge the courage and sacrifices forged by New Zealand and Australian defence staff stretching from Gallipoli 97 years ago to the present day.

This is Dr Coleman’s first Anzac Day as the Minister of Defence and he is especially focused on the ANZAC legacy and the link to the men and women serving New Zealand today.

The Minister has recently returned from visiting NZ Defence Force troops based in Afghanistan and says 400 NZDF personnel will be serving overseas on operations, UN missions or participating in exercises during Anzac Day.

“New Zealand will be represented by NZDF staff all around the world as well at the many commemorations at local memorials,” says Dr Coleman.

“What is remembered is the bravery and endurance of those who did their duty at Gallipoli. The determination of those original ANZACs in the face of such adversity is quite rightly a source of on-going pride for New Zealanders and Australians.”

“Anzac Day is really about the values we hold dear as a nation, ideals like courage, loyalty and service. These qualities are alive and well in the New Zealand Defence Force today,” he said.

“We saw these in the Defence Force’s response to the Christchurch earthquake, and we see it in the contribution they make in places as diverse as Antarctica, Afghanistan, Timor Leste and the Solomon Islands.”

“This Anzac Day New Zealanders will remember the past, and the contribution of all our personnel in the years since the Gallipoli landings. I know they will also be mindful of the commitment and service to New Zealand being shown by the current generation of ANZACs,” said Dr Coleman.

The Minister of Defence is attending the dawn service at the Auckland War Memorial and Anzac Day services in Northcote, Birkenhead, and Glenfield.
