Prime Minister John Key today announced that Tauranga MP Simon Bridges is to be appointed a Minister outside Cabinet.

Napier MP Chris Tremain, who is currently a Minister outside Cabinet, will move up to become a Minister in Cabinet at number 20 on the Ministerial list.

Mr Key also announced a minor reshuffle of portfolios with the departure of Dr Nick Smith.

David Carter will assume the role of Local Government Minister in addition to his current portfolio of Primary Industries.

“The local government reforms announced recently remain an important part of the Government’s agenda. Mr Carter is an experienced Minister and I’m confident he will drive these reforms along,” Mr Key says.

Amy Adams will take over as Environment Minister and hand the Internal Affairs portfolio to Mr Tremain.

Tim Groser will also become the new Minister for Climate Change Issues.

“Mr Bridges will be the new Consumer Affairs Minister and Associate Minister of Transport, taking over from Mr Tremain. Mr Bridges will also be Associate Minister for Climate Change Issues,” Mr Key says.

Mr Bridges will be sworn in at 11am tomorrow by the Governor-General.

“I look forward to welcoming Mr Bridges to the Executive. He has proven himself an able member of the National Party Caucus,” Mr Key says.
