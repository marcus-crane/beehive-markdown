Veterans’ Affairs Minister Nathan Guy will represent New Zealand at the 97th anniversary of the Gallipoli campaign in Turkey tomorrow.

“This is a time to remember those thousands of New Zealanders who stepped ashore on Gallipoli 97 years ago and who never returned.

“8556 New Zealanders landed at Anzac Cove. Nearly a third - 2721 – were killed, with thousands more injured.”

Mr Guy says between 5000 and 7000 people, including many young New Zealanders, are expected to attend the commemorations.

“Anzac Day commemorates loss but also celebrates our ties of friendship with Turkey, which lost 87,000 men during the Gallipoli campaign – double the number of allied forces.

“We are especially grateful to the Turkish authorities for the significant effort and resources they dedicate to ensuring the Gallipoli heritage park is preserved and well cared for, and that ANZAC commemorations run smoothly and safely.”

Mr Guy has formally met the Governor of Canakkale Province, Mr Gungor Azim Tuna today and thanked him on behalf of the New Zealand Government for the Turkish Government’s significant contribution.

Mr Guy will speak at the Turkish International Service and attend the Turkish 57th Regiment Memorial Service on April 24th. On April 25th he will address the Dawn Service at the Anzac Commemorative Site, the New Zealand Memorial Service at Chunuk Bair, and attend the Australian Memorial Service at Lone Pine.

The official New Zealand contingent at Gallipoli includes the Vice Chief of Defence Force, Rear Admiral Jack Steer, Don McIver, President of the RSA, representatives from Veterans' Affairs and the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) personnel including an Army chaplain, catafalque guard, and members of the NZ Army Band.

“Anzac Day is a time to remember not just Gallipoli, but all those veterans who have served New Zealand in the name of peace and freedom.

“We are eternally grateful to these men and women, and we owe it to them to honour their commitment not only today, but in the future. Lest we forget.”
