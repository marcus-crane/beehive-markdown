Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today announced the appointment of three new convenors to the Marsden Fund Council.

The Marsden Fund was established by the Government in 1994 to fund excellent fundamental research. It is a contestable fund administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand on behalf of the Marsden Fund Council.

The new appointees are Dr Ian Ferguson, who will convene the Cellular, Molecular and Physiological Biology Panel; Professor Jari Kaipio, who will convene the Mathematical and Information Sciences Panel; and Professor Robert Hannah, as convenor of the Humanities Panel.

The Minister has also appointed Dr Grant Scobie for a second term as Convenor of the Economics and Human and Behavioural Sciences Panel.

“I’m pleased to confirm the appointments of these leading academics, who will provide valuable leadership, governance experience and excellent knowledge of research and evaluation methodologies,” Mr Joyce says.

Council members are appointed for a term of up to three years, and members usually serve a maximum of two, three-year terms.

“I’d also like to take this opportunity to thank the outgoing Convenor of the Mathematical and Information Sciences Panel, Professor Rod Downey, and the outgoing Convenor of the Humanities Panel, Professor James Belich, for their outstanding service to the Council,” Mr Joyce says.
