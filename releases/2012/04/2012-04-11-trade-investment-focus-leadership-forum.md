Acting Prime Minister Bill English will lead New Zealand’s ministerial delegation to the annual Australian New Zealand Leadership Forum in Sydney, which starts tomorrow.

He will be accompanied by Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce, Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully, Trade Minister Tim Groser and Commerce Minister Craig Foss.

The eighth Forum, which brings together senior politicians and business leaders from both countries, starts tomorrow night and concludes on Friday.

“The theme of this year’s Forum is ‘Australia and New Zealand – together in the Indo Pacific century’,” Mr English says. “Along with other ministers, I’m particularly keen to discuss how we can work together under CER to develop trade and investment markets in third countries.

“With the 30th anniversary of CER coming up next year, it’s important that we work together to take our already close relationship further on important issues such as trans-Tasman investment.

“Our two productivity commissions are working on their first joint study, looking at the impacts and benefits of further economic integration. This is a valuable opportunity to shape the next steps in our relationship and consider how to take advantage of the expanding opportunities in our wider region.”

The Forum will consider recommendations on freeing up capital flows and investment – including through mutual recognition of imputation credits - streamlining trans-Tasman travel, and promoting Pacific development.

While in Sydney, Mr English will also speak at an Infrastructure Partnerships Australia function tomorrow, and the other ministers will hold meetings with political and business leaders.
