Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced Rugby World Cup-winning All Blacks Coach Sir Graham Henry and All Black Victor Vito will take the Webb Ellis Cup to Samoa for Friendship Week – a 50th anniversary celebration of the Treaty of Friendship between New Zealand and Samoa.

“During their two-day visit, Sir Graham and Victor will lead training sessions with coaches and students from Apia colleges, and national provincial club coaches. They will also take the Cup to Savai’i,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand went to great lengths to ensure Rugby World Cup 2011 reflected our place in the Pacific and presented opportunities for our Pacific neighbours.

“Rugby is the national game of Samoa, and this special All Blacks visit acknowledges the warmth and depth of the relationship between our two countries, and the bond we share through the game of rugby,” Mr McCully says.

Sir Graham and Victor Vito will be in Samoa from 23 to 25 July.

A festival of New Zealand films featuring Samoan directors and performers is showing on Samoan television in the two weeks leading up to Friendship Week. Celebrations also include a wine and food festival and a variety of cultural performances.
