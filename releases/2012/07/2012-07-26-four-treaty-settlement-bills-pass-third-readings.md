The House today unanimously passed four bills giving effect to historical Treaty of Waitangi settlements for the Maraeroa A and B blocks, Ngāti Mākino, Rongowhakaata and Ngai Tāmanuhiri.

“The government is committed to fixing the injustices of the past through negotiation with claimants,” Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson said. “This is the end of a long journey for these claimants. Passing legislation today will enable the people of the Maraeroa A and B blocks, Ngāti Mākino, Rongowhakaata and Ngai Tāmanuhiri to enjoy the benefits of settlement and look forward to a stronger future.”

“The speed at which the government is progressing Treaty settlement legislation is unprecedented, with only a week between the second and third readings of these bills’” he said. “This is possible with the agreement of iwi, and the constructive bipartisan support of all parties in this House to sit extended hours this morning by leave of the Business Committee.”

“The bills were passed unanimously, showing the broad support of the whole House for Treaty settlements between the Crown and Māori to right the wrongs of the past. It further shows the benefits of the Crown and iwi negotiating settlement of past grievances in good faith as Treaty partners.”

“Once the bills are enacted, the people of Maraeroa A and B blocks, Ngāti Mākino, Rongowhakaata and Ngai Tāmanuhiri will join other settled groups in building a platform for economic growth that benefits their members and the wider community.”

“Treaty settlements make a positive contribution to the growth of our country. This government has successfully increased the speed at which Treaty grievances are resolved and we look forward to passing more legislation in the coming year,” Mr Finlayson said.

Māori Party co-leader and Minister for Whānau Ora Tariana Turia moved all four of the government’s bills, as well as the Maraeroa A and B Blocks Incorporation Bill. a Private Bill.

The Maraeroa A and B Blocks are located on the volcanic plateau to the east of Te Kūiti. The beneficiaries of the settlement are the descendents of the original owners of the Maraeroa A and B Blocks including individuals from Ngāti Rereahu, Maniapoto, Raukawa, Ngāti Tūwharetoa and other iwi. This one is not a comprehensive settlement.

The Maraeroa A and B Blocks Incorporation Bill is a private member’s bill, sponsored by Hon Tariana Turia, to establish a Māori Incorporation to form part of the post settlement governance entity. The Māori Incorporation was unable to be established through the Maraeroa A and B Blocks Settlement Bill.
