The House sat today in extended sitting hours today to progress four Treaty settlement bills through their second readings, demonstrating the benefits of the Crown and iwi negotiating settlement of past grievances in good faith as Treaty partners.

The House unanimously passed the second readings of the Maraeroa A & B Blocks Claim Settlement Bill and Maraeroa A & B Blocks Incorporation Bill, the Ngāti Makino Claims Settlement Bill, the Rongowhakaata Claims Settlement Bill and the Ngai Tamanuhiri Claims Settlement Bill. The Ngāi Tamanuhiri Claims Settlement Bill also finished its Committee of the Whole House stage.

The House sat between 9 am and 12.30 pm this morning, outside normal sitting hours, by leave of the Business Committee. This is the third time this year the House has sat extended hours in order to progress Treaty settlement legislation, which enjoys bipartisan support.

“The second readings of the Rongowhakaata, Ngāti Makino and Ngāi Tamanuhiri claims settlement bills take us closer to the just and durable settlement of those iwi’s historical claims,” Treaty Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson said. “That means iwi will be able to benefit from the resolution of their claims, and create an economic base for their members, and we can put these grievances behind us as a nation.”

“The unanimous support for these bills shows the support for the Crown’s position, regardless of who is in government, that negotiated Treaty settlements of historic breaches between iwi and government in good faith spirit are the right way to address historical claims.”
