Small Business Minister John Banks today congratulated the 51 entrepreneurs who have made it to the next stage of the Business.govt.nz Flying Start Business Plan Competition, sponsored by ANZ.

“More than 750 small and start-up business owners submitted their business plan proposals for a chance to win a share of $82,000 in prizes. Three finalists have been selected from each of the 17 regions,” Mr Banks said. 

“It’s fantastic to see so much innovation amongst New Zealand’s small business.  The judges had an extremely difficult time selecting the regional finalists and I know it will be even harder choosing a national winner.”  

The Business.govt.nz Flying Start Business Plan Competition seeks out the best business plan from new or fledgling New Zealand enterprises, and helps them put their plans into action. Each regional finalist must now submit a more detailed business plan.

The competition includes a $56,000 national prize package, $10,000 exporter prize package and 16 $1000 regional prizes.  The winners will be announced on August 23 2012. 

“I wish all the regional finalists the best of luck as they now work to turn their visions into viable business plans,” Mr Banks said.

“I also urge the hundreds of entrepreneurs who entered, but did not make it to the next stage, to stick with their ideas and ambitions to grow and own their own business.

“ANZ’s Business Banking and the Government-funded Regional Business Partners will provide continued support to unsuccessful applicants to help them with their business proposals.
