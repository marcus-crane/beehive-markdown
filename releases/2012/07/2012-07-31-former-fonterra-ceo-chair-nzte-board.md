“Mr Ferrier has a wealth of experience in international business, and brings strong governance and strategic capability to the NZTE Board. He is well placed to take up the role of Chair for the Board,” Mr Joyce says.

Mr Joyce and Mr Groser also announced the reappointment of businesswoman Julie Christie, consultant Charles Finny and Canterbury Employers’ Chamber of Commerce Chief Executive Peter Townsend for a second, three-year term.
