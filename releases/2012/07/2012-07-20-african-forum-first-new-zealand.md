Ethnic Affairs Minister Judith Collins says New Zealand’s African communities have a great contribution to make to our country, ahead of tomorrow’s inaugural African Forum in Auckland.

The forum, hosted by the Office of Ethnic Affairs, will identify and explore issues affecting African communities in Zealand – including our nation’s economic and trade connections with Africa.

“New Zealand’s African communities bring a great deal of energy and diversity to our shores,” Ms Collins says.

“The majority of African people migrate here because they want to make better lives for themselves and their families – but also because they want to make a positive contribution to New Zealand.

“Tomorrow’s forum will give African communities the opportunity to connect with each other and share ideas about how to best harness their potential and build a successful future for all African people in New Zealand.”

At the 2006 Census there were more than 40 African nationalities represented in New Zealand.
