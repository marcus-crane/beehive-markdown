Courts Minister Chester Borrows today welcomed moves to open, adjourn and close the District Court in Te Reo Māori as well as English.

The initiative has been led by the District Court Heads of Bench, supported by the Ministry of Justice, and launched today to coincide with Māori Language Week.

“These changes are an important way of recognising New Zealand’s cultural heritage. Using a small amount of Te Reo in the administration of the Court will encourage people to understand and use one of our national languages,” says Mr Borrows.

“I want to congratulate the District Court Heads of Bench on this initiative, which will help to socialise Te Reo into day to day court sittings. I also want to thank court staff for the enthusiastic and diligent way which they have approached these changes – no reira, tēnā koutou he mahi pai rawa atu.”
