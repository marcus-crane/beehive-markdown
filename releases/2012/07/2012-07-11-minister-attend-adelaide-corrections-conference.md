Corrections Minister Anne Tolley is in Adelaide from 11-13 July to attend a Corrective Services Ministers’ Conference.

The Conference is held annually, to allow Ministers from New Zealand and Australian States and Territories to exchange ideas and information.

Issues to be discussed this year include the management of sexual offenders in the community, emerging technologies, and the prevention of self-harm and suicide in prisons.

“The sharing of experiences with other jurisdictions is extremely worthwhile,” says Mrs Tolley.

“This year we have been asked to deliver a presentation on the successful implementation of a smoking ban in New Zealand prisons, as there is interest in adopting a similar policy from our Australian counterparts.

“I will also be outlining the Government’s targets of reducing reoffending by 25 per cent by 2017, leading to 18,500 fewer victims of crime every year from 2017.”
