473 health graduates have applied to join the Government’s Voluntary Bonding Scheme this year – and more are expected with registrations open until this Friday.

“If you are a new health graduate I encourage you to register for this great scheme and join the doctors, midwives, nurses, radiation therapists and medical physicists who have already applied.” says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“For the fourth year in a row, the scheme continues to attract great interest from graduates and is improving access to health services in vulnerable communities and isolated areas.”

“The scheme encourages health graduates to establish careers in hard to staff specialties and communities in New Zealand by offering student loan write offs or cash incentives over three to five years.

"Over the first four years, 1773 nurses, 262 doctors, 213 midwives, 13 radiation therapists and 1 medical physicist have applied to take part.

"We want more of our doctors, nurses, midwives, radiation therapists and medical physicists to stay in New Zealand after graduation and the voluntary bonding scheme is helping to achieve that."

The full list of hard to staff communities and specialties, terms and conditions of the scheme and the online Registration of Interest  is available at [www.healthworkforce.govt.nz/our-work/voluntary-bonding-scheme](http://www.healthworkforce.govt.nz/our-work/voluntary-bonding-scheme)
