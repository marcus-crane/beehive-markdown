Health Minister Tony Ryall has today announced 100 per cent of pharmacy businesses have accepted the new community pharmacy service agreement.

“With all 947 pharmacy businesses accepting the new contract, it shows there is agreement across the pharmacy sector of the need to move from the current dispensing focused model to a patient focused model,” says Mr Ryall.

“Pharmacists are expert in medicines management and this new agreement encourages them to make better use of their clinical skills and expertise.

“Under the past agreement, pharmacies were funded based on the number of medicines they dispensed. This new agreement, which will be phased in over three years, rewards pharmacists for providing support and advice so patients can better manage their medicines and medical conditions.

“Pharmacists are an important part of community health services and the new agreement also promotes pharmacists working closer with other health professionals including GPs, midwives and dentists. This will benefit patients, especially those with long term conditions.

“There are around 200,000 New Zealanders with long term conditions who have difficulty managing their medicines. By working closely with patients and health professionals, pharmacists can ensure these patients are getting the best health benefit from the medicines prescribed for them.

“The new agreement was developed by district health boards and the pharmacy sector with involvement from key stakeholders.

“This agreement marks a significant step forward in the delivery of pharmacy care for patients and pharmacists. It is another example of this National led government’s commitment to providing New Zealanders with better, sooner more convenient health services.
