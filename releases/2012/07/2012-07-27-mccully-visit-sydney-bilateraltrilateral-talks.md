Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will travel to Australia this weekend for six-monthly foreign ministers’ consultations with Foreign Minister Bob Carr.

These discussions will be followed by a joint meeting with their Fiji counterpart, Ratu Inoke Kubuabola.

“New Zealand and Australia have an extremely close relationship. We benefit from sharing perspectives on global trends and regional matters affecting both countries,” Mr McCully says.

“I am pleased that alongside our regular bilateral consultations we will have the chance to engage with our Fijian counterpart, and to reiterate our support for the important transition underway there.”

The meetings will take place in Sydney on Monday 30 July.
