Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today announced the appointment of Dr John Hay as the new Chair of the Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment Science Board with effect from 1 July.

Dr Hay replaces Professor Sir David Skegg who has resigned from chairing the Science Board following his appointment as President of the Royal Society of New Zealand. He is currently an independent director with Dr John Hay & Associates.

“I’m delighted to welcome Dr Hay, whose considerable experience and expertise in the science community will be a valuable addition to the Board,” Mr Joyce says.

“He’s widely respected in the sector, and will bring a fresh perspective to the Board as it transitions into the new MBIE.”

From 2000 until 2011 he was the Chief Executive of the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR). Prior to this, he was General Manager of AgResearch’s Grasslands Division.

In 2006 Dr Hay was awarded the New Zealand Royal Society’s Thomson Medal for outstanding and inspirational leadership in the management of science.

“I’d like to take this opportunity to thank Sir David for his stewardship, and the excellent shape he leaves the Board in. Sir David is an outstanding academic and leader, and I wish him well for his future with the Royal Society,” Mr Joyce says.
