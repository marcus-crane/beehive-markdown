Associate Transport Minister Simon Bridges says rule changes for passenger service vehicles remove unnecessary regulation and ensure New Zealand requirements are in line with those overseas.

The Land Transport Rule: Passenger Service Vehicles Amendment 2012 updates requirements for doorways, aisles, seating and other features of passenger vehicles so they reflect the needs of users, operators and manufacturers.

“Better regulation and less regulation is an important goal for this Government. The Passenger Service Vehicle Rule achieves this by removing overly prescriptive requirements while still maintaining safety,” says Mr Bridges.

“Officials have worked with industry and consulted more widely to ensure that this Rule is up to date and practical.

“Furthermore, most of the requirements in the Amendment Rule will result in cost reductions or greater flexibility for industry.

“The Rule maintains safety requirements where they are most needed. A key provision is the enhancement of the requirements for wheelchair areas to ensure they are safe for users.”

The Amendment Rule will come into force on 1 October 2012.
