Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today announced new appointments to the boards of Education New Zealand and the Tertiary Education Commission.

John Spencer has been appointed as the Chair of the Tertiary Education Commission. Mr Spencer replaces Sir Harawira Gardiner who is standing down from his role on the Tertiary Education Commission.

“Mr Spencer is a highly capable individual who brings a wealth of experience in governance, finance and business”, Mr Joyce says.

Philip Broughton and Richard Leggat have been appointed as members of the Education New Zealand Board. An existing member of the Board, Jill Tattersall, has been appointed for a further term.

Education New Zealand was established in 2011 to support and encourage international education. International education is New Zealand’s fifth largest export earner, contributing more than $2 billion to the economy and supporting about 32,000 jobs.

“The appointees to the Education New Zealand Board contribute an extensive range of skills and experience in international business, education, marketing and governance”, Mr Joyce says.
