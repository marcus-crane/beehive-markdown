New Zealand Members of Parliament (MPs) are among official observers of Timor-Leste’s Parliamentary Election this weekend.

New Zealand responded to a request from Timor-Leste for international observers for the election, which follows the Presidential Election earlier this year. Twenty four political parties are expected to contest the election.

The MPs are Phil Goff, Lindsay Tisch, Dr Kennedy Graham, Jacqui Dean and Barbara Stewart. Mr Goff and Mr Tisch are part of an ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Regional Forum observer mission.

“We support free and fair elections that will help improve conditions for the people of Timor-Leste and promote security in the region,” Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully says.

“The participation of MPs from across the political spectrum demonstrates our multi-partisan commitment to Timor-Leste’s future as a stable democracy.”

New Zealand has provided observers to previous elections in the troubled Southeast Asian nation - complementing the work of peacekeeping deployments and a recent bi-lateral community policing programme.

“In November we hosted two officials from Timor-Leste’s electoral office to observe our general election processes,” Mr McCully says.

“A successful election will help Timor-Leste join ASEAN – a move New Zealand supports as an opportunity for closer economic ties.”
