The first purpose-built health facility to be constructed post-earthquake, the new Canterbury DHB outpatients department, was opened today by Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew.

The new department will see 70,000 patients each year and its completion is a significant first step in increasing Christchurch Hospital’s capacity to meet the increased demands placed upon it.

“We know that new models of care and treatments mean patients are back on their feet more quickly and their main point of contact in a hospital is often the outpatients department,” said Mrs Goodhew.

Mrs Goodhew paid tribute to DHB staff at the opening.

“I am very aware of the difficulties facing Canterbury DHB and those who have kept it running despite the earthquake and aftershocks. To do so has required dedication and professionalism of all the staff, from the doctors, nurses and orderlies to the facilities staff who inspect and make necessary repairs after every shake.”

The new outpatients department is one part of the jigsaw of comprehensive services that Canterbury DHB is putting together after the earthquakes and is a good example of how the DHB has had to adapt to all the challenges that the earthquake and aftershocks have placed upon it.

“This new facility is only part of the Government’s commitment to rebuilding Canterbury DHB’s infrastructure,” said Mrs Goodhew.

“A new 36 bed acute medical assessment unit is currently under construction. The DHB is also working through the business case process for the redevelopment of Christchurch Hospital - likely to be the largest ever capital investment in the New Zealand health sector.”
