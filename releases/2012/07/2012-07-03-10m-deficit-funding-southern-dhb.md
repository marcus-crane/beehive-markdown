The Government has approved a $10 million cash injection for Southern District Health Board (DHB) for the 2011/12 financial year.

"This is a one-off payment so the board can pay its day to day bills without always going into overdraft,” says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

"This Government has lifted the Southern DHB annual operating funding to a record $743 million in the 2012/13 year – $89 million more than four years ago.

"On top of this we have now added an additional $38.6 million over three years of deficit support. This means Southern DHB has received more than its population based share of health funding.

“The DHB are changing how they do things to improve their financial performance and provide better services for patients. This includes more work with primary care networks around increasing care in the community and establishing common clinical pathways throughout the district.

Southern DHB has been in deficit for a number of years. Last financial year they received $6.6 million deficit support funding and $22 million in 2009/10.
