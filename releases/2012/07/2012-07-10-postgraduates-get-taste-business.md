Seventy postgraduate students will have the opportunity to work as interns in some of New Zealand's most innovative businesses under funding decisions announced by Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today.

Funding of $2.1 million from Vote Science and Innovation will allow 70 businesses to employ graduate students for a minimum of six months to undertake innovative research and development (R&D) work. Last year, 50 businesses were approved for funding.

“The Government’s postgraduate intern programme is highly effective for the students. They get valuable work experience in a commercial environment that will help them find suitable employment after their studies. This fits in with other work the Government is doing to improve the career opportunities of young people with an academic degree in New Zealand,” Mr Joyce says.

“Businesses tell me they greatly appreciate this support. The programme is also highly effective for companies as it helps speed up the R&D work due to the contribution of a bright, young mind with the latest knowledge and a fresh outlook.”

The programme has been altered this year in response to the skills and experience businesses are looking for to grow through R&D.

“On top of science, technology and engineering students, we now also fund students with design or marketing degrees or commercialisation experience,” Mr Joyce says.

The programme is administered by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. Each company receives funding which covers the cost of hiring a postgraduate student for the first six months, up to a maximum of $30,000 (plus GST).
