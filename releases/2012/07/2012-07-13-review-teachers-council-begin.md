Education Minister Hekia Parata has today announced the chair and members of the committee that will review the role and functions of the New Zealand Teachers’ Council as part of the Government’s programme of work to lift student achievement.

“The goal is to ensure that the Teachers’ Council is a strong, professional body that will set and enforce high standards, promote effective teaching practice, develop the professional community of teachers, and lead public discussion on education issues,” Ms Parata says.

“The Teachers’ Council Review Committee will investigate the council’s current capability to focus on these roles, and on what structural and legislative arrangements might be needed to ensure effectiveness.”

Pauline Winter has been appointed chair of the committee and Dr Judith Aitken, John Morris, Robyn Baker and Jonathan Krebs members.

“The committee has skills and expertise right across education, business, the State Sector, and professional bodies. They’ll seek input from a wide range of stakeholders, and report to me at the end of October.

“This Government is determined to lift student achievement, and we know that quality teaching has the biggest in-school impact on achievement,” Ms Parata says.

“Strong professional leadership, distinct from government or industrial organisations, will achieve a great deal in lifting the status and profile of teaching as a career for the 21st century.”
