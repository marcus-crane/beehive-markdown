Arts Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson today congratulated the Wellington East Girls‘ College choir, Cantala, for their first-equal placing in the treble choir category of the prestigious Summa Cum Laude international youth music festival in Vienna.

“This is an outstanding achievement for the 31 young women involved and choir director Brent Stewart,” Mr Finlayson said. “They have done their school and New Zealand proud.”

Cantala was judged best of 23 choirs in the category.

“I attended a fundraiser for the choir at Park Road Post earlier this year,” Mr Finlayson said. “The fundraising efforts of the group are a testament to their determination and dedication, to say nothing of the hours of practice and hard work to perfect a huge repertoire of work including a haka, a waiata, songs by NZ composers, and pieces ranging from the classical to the avant garde.”

“I look forward to hosting them at Parliament on their return.”
