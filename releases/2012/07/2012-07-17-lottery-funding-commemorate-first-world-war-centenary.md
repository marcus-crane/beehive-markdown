Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain today announced that $17 million in lottery funding has been allocated by the Lottery Grants Board to commemorate the centenary of ANZAC landings at Gallipoli and the First World War.

“The Lottery Grants Board recognises the importance of this centenary event to our nation. This money will be available to fund community events and projects marking the centenary of World War One with $10 million going towards one or more large scale commemoration projects of national significance,” says Mr Tremain.

“I am looking forward to activities and events which will bring New Zealand communities together.  The centenary gives us the opportunity to remember those who fought and served in all wars, conflicts and peace operations in the past one hundred years.

“Increased attendances at ANZAC services show a growing interest and understanding of the sacrifices made in all armed conflicts. This funding will enhance commemorations for everyone regardless of where they live in New Zealand.

The first application for grants associated with World War One Commemorations can be made from August 2012 to the rebranded Lottery World War One Commemorations, Environment and Heritage Committee.

The Minister also announced that around $200 million in lottery profits from the proceeds of games such as Lotto, Instant Kiwi and Daily Keno would be returned to the community this year.

“This is approximately $26 million above the amount forecast, which is an excellent result.

“In addition to funds to support World War One Commemorations an increase in allocations for 2012/13 to lottery distribution committees will provide a huge boost for community projects throughout New Zealand.”

The 11 regional community committees have been allocated approximately $30 million and the national committees a total of approximately $84 million.

“The Lottery Grants Board will continue its support for arts, culture, heritage and sport through allocations to Creative New Zealand, Sport New Zealand and the NZ Film Commission (including the NZ Film Archive),” says Mr Tremain.

“This provides much needed support to creative initiatives and enables New Zealanders to participate and support sport and physical recreation. 

“Congratulations must go to the team at New Zealand Lotteries for an outstanding year, and my thanks to the Lottery Grants Board and the associated distribution committees for their hard work in supporting community initiatives and projects.”
