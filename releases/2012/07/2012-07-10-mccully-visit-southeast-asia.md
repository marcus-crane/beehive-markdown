Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will travel to Southeast Asia today for a series of meetings with the region’s leaders.

Mr McCully will attend the East Asia Summit Foreign Ministers Meeting and ASEAN Regional Forum in Cambodia before heading to Thailand and the Philippines.

“These meetings are an important opportunity to profile New Zealand’s growing relationship with ASEAN and to share our views on key political, security and economic issues affecting the region,” Mr McCully says.

In the Philippines, Mr McCully will meet President Aquino and Foreign Affairs Secretary del Rosario to discuss improved air services and progressing a proposed working holiday scheme.

The second Thailand/New Zealand Joint Ministerial Commission will be the centrepiece of Mr McCully’s visit to Bangkok. Discussions with Thai Foreign Minister Surapong will address trade, education and tourism issues.

Mr McCully will invite Prime Minister Yingluck to make her first visit to New Zealand since her election late last year. He will also witness the signing of a police cooperation agreement between Thailand and New Zealand.
