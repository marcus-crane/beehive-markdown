Primary Industries Minister David Carter today paid tribute to Hawke’s Bay businessman Graeme Lowe who has passed away following a long illness.

“Graeme was a true pioneer of the meat industry, leading Lowe Corporation from its inception in 1964 to become a major animal by-product processor and exporter.

“He was a hugely respected figure whose contribution to the industry was recognised just a fortnight ago when he was inducted into the New Zealand Business Hall of Fame.

“As an entrepreneur, Graeme was not afraid of taking risks and his innovative ideas brought a new level of business thinking and technology to the modern meat industry.

“Graeme was also a very generous supporter of Hawke’s Bay charities and organisations.

“I would like to extend my condolences to Graeme’s wife, Jenny and their family,” Mr Carter said.
