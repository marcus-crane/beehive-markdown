Prime Minister John Key travels to Australia this Thursday for a two-day visit to Sydney and Melbourne to meet with financial and business leaders.

During his visit, Mr Key will give an address to a Trans-Tasman Business Circle luncheon and will also deliver this year’s John Howard Lecture in Sydney.

The John Howard Lecture is an annual event that was established by the Menzies Research Centre in 2009 as a way of honouring former Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who held the office from 1996-2007.

Mr Key will meet with representatives from the four major Australian banks in Sydney and Melbourne as well as business groups with interests in New Zealand, including the Business Council of Australia, Origin Energy, Rio Tinto and BlueScope Steel.

“This will provide a valuable opportunity to share thoughts on the latest global economic developments and their impact on the New Zealand and Australian economies.

“Australia is our largest trading and economic partner so it’s important that we continue to work closely together on issues that affect both our countries,” Mr Key says.

Mr Key’s programme concludes on Friday afternoon.
