Retailers are being reminded to make sure that all tobacco products are out of view from the public when stores open on Monday next week.

The legal prohibition on the display of tobacco products at any sales outlet comes into force on 23 July 2012.

Under the Smoke-free Environments (Controls and Enforcement) Amendment Act 2011, sellers of tobacco will need to ensure that tobacco products are not visible to the public, either inside or outside their premises, except to the extent necessary to make a sale or receive new stock. Failure to comply with the new law is liable to a fine of up to $10,000.

“The Government is committed to achieving a smokefree New Zealand by 2025 - and removing tobacco from public view is another important step in reaching this goal,” says Associate Minister of Health Hon Tariana Turia.

“Removing tobacco displays from stores means the products won’t be visible to the public – this will help to protect our children and those who are attempting to quit smoking from being confronted with tobacco marketing when they do their everyday shopping.”

“We need to drive home the message that smoking is not our future – and that we are committed to supporting the vision of healthy families and communities in Aotearoa”.

The responsibility for enforcing the new retail display law will sit with District Health Board Smoke-free Officers who will ensure that retailers understand their obligations and comply with the law. Initially the focus will be on educating retailers who may unwittingly be in breach. Those that choose to flout the law will be liable to prosecution.
