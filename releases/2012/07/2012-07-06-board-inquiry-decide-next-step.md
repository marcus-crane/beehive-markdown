Environment Minister Amy Adams has announced that the proposed MacKays to Peka Peka Expressway is to be referred to an independent board of inquiry under the Government’s national consenting process with the Environmental Protection Authority.

The application by the New Zealand Transport Agency relates to a proposed four-lane, 16-kilometre stretch of road through mainly urban land between MacKays Crossing and Peka Peka.

The options for the application were that it be considered by the local authorities, referred to the Environment Court, or referred to a board of inquiry.

In accepting the Environmental Protection Authority’s recommendation to refer the proposal to a board of inquiry, Ms Adams says the proposal involved significant natural and physical resources.

The ecology of the region, as well as its communities and cultural landscapes, had the potential to be affected.

“This process will enable affected people to have their say but will deliver a decision within nine months.”

The MacKays to Peka Peka Expressway is one of eight sections of the Wellington Northern Corridor considered to be a road of national significance.

The board of inquiry will be chaired by retired High Court Judge Sir John Hansen. Also on the board are Environment Commissioner David Bunting, Glenice Paine and Mark Apeldoorn.
