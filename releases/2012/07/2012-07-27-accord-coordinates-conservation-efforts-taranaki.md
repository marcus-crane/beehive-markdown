Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson was in Taranaki today to witness the signing of an historic accord.

The Taranaki Biodiversity Forum Accord is a regional response to protecting native plants, animals and habitats.

Signatories include the Department of Conservation, Taranaki Regional and District councils, as well as community groups including the East Taranaki Environment Trust, Taranaki Kiwi Trust, Forest and Bird and the Rotokare Scenic Reserve Trust.

“Altogether 19 agencies have come together to sign this accord, each adding a different perspective, a wealth of experience and far reaching networks,” says Ms Wilkinson.

“Their common interest in safeguarding what makes Taranaki special has brought them together, and by working collaboratively they will have the best chance of protecting and improving the biodiversity of the region.”

“One of the key elements of the accord is an increased focus on monitoring and research to help groups gather information on the state of biodiversity, and the effectiveness of management efforts.”

The Department of Conservation has been looking at ways to involve more people in conservation and build partnerships with local authorities, NGOs, businesses and communities. The accord is recognised as a way to promote a collective community effort to improve biodiversity in the Taranaki Region.

“I congratulate all signatories on this initiative,” says Ms Wilkinson. “To be successful, to slowly restore the rich biodiversity we have lost, will take time and dedication from everyone. This accord is a firm step in the right direction.”
