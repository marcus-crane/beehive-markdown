Environment Minister Amy Adams has announced that more than $1 million has been awarded to 10 projects that will reduce the amount of rubbish going into landfills, under the latest round of the Waste Minimisation Fund.

“These projects will make a significant difference to our environment by encouraging individuals and businesses to reduce, reuse and recycle rather than putting their waste straight into the rubbish,” Ms Adams says.

Funding recipients include the Glass Packaging Forum, which will introduce a public place recycling programme.

The Forum receives $200,000 to install 190 permanent recycling bins at garage forecourts, shopping malls, retail outlets and other public buildings around the country. The bins will be serviced by the private sector.

CID Resource Recycling receives $370,000 to create a facility in Auckland that will sort both treated and untreated waste wood and process it into material that can be used as bio fuel.

The Kaikoura Enhancement Trust will use $52,000 to design and build a glass-sorting facility, which will turn about 425 tonnes of glass into glass products each year.

RVP Resource Group will receive $67,000 to set up a project that collects food waste from businesses for composting, increase public awareness of the importance of composting and provide educational resources for schools.

“The grants announced today are examples of organisations working with their communities to develop ideas that will benefit the environment by reducing waste and recycling,” Ms Adams says.
