Minister for Small Business John Banks today announced that new members are being sought for the Small Business Advisory Group (SBAG).

“Small and medium business are the foundation of the New Zealand economy.  The Government needs to hear what SME owners think so that we can make decisions that help, and not hinder their growth,” Mr Banks said.

“The Small Business Advisory Group was set up in October 2003 to give small business a greater voice in policy development.  Over the past nine years, it has done this by identifying issues impacting the growth and development of small business, suggesting priorities for action, and exploring solutions. 

“The term of the current Advisory Group is coming to a close at the end of 2012.  The Government would like to hear from people with the qualities to make a difference to small business in New Zealand,” Mr Banks said.
