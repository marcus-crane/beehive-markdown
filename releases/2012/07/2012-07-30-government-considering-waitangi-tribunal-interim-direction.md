The Government has this afternoon received the Waitangi Tribunal’s interim direction on a Māori Council claim regarding fresh water and geothermal resources, State Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall says.

“In the coming days, ministers will receive advice from officials to help them carefully consider the Government’s position,” he says.

“We have also undertaken to meet the Māori Party’s co-leaders as we develop our respective positions.

“The Government will consider the report and make decisions in due course.

“In the meantime, ministers are not in a position to comment on the Tribunal’s direction further at this time,” Mr Ryall says.
