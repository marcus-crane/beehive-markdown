Health Minister Tony Ryall today announced Wairarapa DHB Chair Bob Francis has been appointed as a member of the Capital & Coast District Health Board (DHB).

“Mr Francis has a strong background in business and governance, together with extensive community experience,” said Mr Ryall.

“Cross appointments to DHB Boards signal a push for greater regional collaboration in the planning and delivery of health services. Capital & Coast, Hutt Valley and Wairarapa DHBs are working together on a significant range of joint issues in order to improve patient services.”

Mr Francis has been Chair of Wairarapa DHB since 2006 and fills the vacancy left by the passing of Dr Donald Urquhart-Hay last year.
