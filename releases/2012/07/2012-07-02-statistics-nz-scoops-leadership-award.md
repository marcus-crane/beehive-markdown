Statistics New Zealand’s win of the leadership category at the Public Sector Excellence Awards is a fantastic achievement for the department, Statistics Minister Maurice Williamson says.

The department’s leadership programme ‘Leading from where you stand’ won the Improving Performance through Leadership Excellence category at the 2012 IPANZ (Institute of Public Administration NZ) Public Sector Excellence Awards.

“This is a wonderful endorsement of the department’s positive approach to building leadership skills right across the organisation,” Mr Williamson says.

"The next challenge for Statistics NZ is to do even better. The Government wants to improve access to information and to get more value out of official statistics. One way Statistics NZ is doing this is in building their leadership."

Statistics NZ was also a finalist in three other categories; the New Professional of the Year, the Networked Government for the digitising of New Zealand’s Historic Yearbooks and a special category related to the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery.

The Public Sector Excellence Awards recognise and award outstanding performances and work achievements of organisations in the New Zealand public sector.
