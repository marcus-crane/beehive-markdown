Finance Minister Bill English has appointed Rod Carr to the board of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.

“Dr Carr has extensive experience, both in the banking industry and as a director,” Mr English says. “I’m confident he will make a strong contribution to the board of the Reserve Bank.”

Dr Carr is the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Canterbury and holds a number of governance positions including the chairmanship of the National Infrastructure Advisory Board.

He was previously the managing director of Jade Software Corporation Ltd, following roles as Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank and senior positions with the National Australia Bank.

Mr English also appointed Craig Ansley to the Government Superannuation Fund Authority and reappointed director Toni Kerr for a further term.
