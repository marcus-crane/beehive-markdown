Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will today meet the Second Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Brunei, Pehin Lim Jock Seng.

Minister Lim is chairman of the Brunei National Petroleum Company and former chairman of Royal Brunei Airlines.

The ministers will discuss the bilateral relationship and Brunei’s priorities for its chairmanship of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) next year.

“Brunei is one of our most valuable partners within ASEAN,” Mr McCully says.

“Our bilateral relationship is built on close cooperation in many areas including trade, investment, education and defence, and we look to work closely with Brunei when it holds the ASEAN chairmanship.”

Mr McCully says Brunei has partnered with New Zealand in several Free Trade Agreement initiatives and is currently a participant in the wider Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations.

“We have also just launched scholarships for Brunei under the NZ/ASEAN Scholars Awards programme. I am confident this will help raise New Zealand’s profile in Brunei as a study destination.”

Minister Lim was formerly Brunei’s non-resident High Commissioner to New Zealand.
