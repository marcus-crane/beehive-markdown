Civil Defence Minister Chris Tremain says the earthquake centred off the Taranaki Coast is a timely reminder for New Zealanders to be earthquake prepared.

“The Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management has just upgraded its ShakeOut website with a link that now provides information about regional earthquake hazards. [http://www.shakeout.govt.nz/whyparticipate/](http://www.shakeout.govt.nz/whyparticipate/)

“While earthquake hazard varies from region to region, there is no room for complacency.   All of New Zealand is earthquake prone.  A major earthquake could happen anywhere and people need to know what to do when that happens.  Understanding a hazard helps in any emergency situation.

“I would urge all New Zealanders to participate in the New Zealand ShakeOut earthquake drill at 9:26am on Wednesday 26th September (9:26-26:9). 

“The message is very simple “Drop, Cover and Hold,” says Mr Tremain.
