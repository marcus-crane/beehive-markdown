Primary Industries Minister David Carter has welcomed immediate action on the recommendations of an independent review of import requirements and border clearance processes.

“I asked the Director-General of the Ministry for Primary Industries to commission an independent review of the relevant import health standards and border clearance processes in light of the outbreak of the kiwifruit vine disease, Psa,” says Mr Carter.

“The findings released by MPI today have identified where improvements are needed, and I welcome the immediate action being taken by MPI to implement the review’s recommendations.”

Mr Carter says he will be monitoring the work closely and expects a progress report within three months.

“When Psa was first discovered here in 2010, the Government moved rapidly to support the kiwifruit industry, committing $25 million in a dollar-for-dollar partnership to help manage the disease.

“This partnership has proved a valuable example in the development of Government Industry Agreements (GIA) which will see government and industry working more closely together to improve biosecurity readiness and response.

“I note that a call for better connectedness between government and industry groups is a key finding of the report.

“The GIA initiative is part of the Biosecurity Law Reform Bill which is currently before Parliament,” Mr Carter says.
