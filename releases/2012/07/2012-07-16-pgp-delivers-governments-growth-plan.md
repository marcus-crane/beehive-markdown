Primary Industries Minister David Carter has welcomed today’s announcement of a major investment partnership for New Zealand’s export beef sector.

The Government’s Primary Growth Partnership (PGP) is to fund half of a $23.7 million programme led by Brownrigg Agriculture and Firstlight Foods to produce high-value marbled beef for premium markets.

“The Government’s total investment so far of more than quarter of a billion dollars in PGP programmes demonstrates its firm commitment to boosting economic growth through primary sector research and innovation,” says Mr Carter.

“All New Zealanders stand to gain from the partnership announced today because alongside our internationally prized lamb, our beef sector is pivotal to the success of our economy.”

Today’s announcement lifts the total government-industry PGP spend to nearly $600 million.

Mr Carter says the latest proposal continues the impressive response by the primary sector to PGP since it was launched in September 2009.

“In less than three years, the Partnership has delivered close to $600 million dollars of investment in our world-leading primary, food and forestry industries.”
