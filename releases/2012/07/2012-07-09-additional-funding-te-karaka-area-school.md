Associate Education Minister Craig Foss has announced further funding of $2.66 million for the redevelopment of Te Karaka Area School, between Gisborne and Opotiki.

Te Karaka Area School opened following the merger of Waikohu College and Te Karaka School in 2011.

The roll of Te Karaka Area School has grown rapidly and several earthquake prone buildings on the Waikohu College have been identified.

The Ministry of Education has reassessed the options for the redevelopment and concluded that demolishing the earthquake prone buildings and replacing them with new ones will be most cost efficient in the long term.

“It makes sense to increase the scope of the redevelopment to include the extra teaching spaces required as a result of the increased roll,” says Mr Foss. “By providing this extra $2.66 million, the redevelopment will now be able to provide safe and inspiring learning environments for a roll of 219 learners.”

“I understand that space has been at a premium at the former Te Karaka School site, and appreciate the patience demonstrated by the Board of Trustees, teachers, learners and parents. The new school is experiencing increased attendance figures and higher levels of engagement with learners, which is a superb result. The new facilities will better support the great work the school is already doing,” says Mr Foss.

Construction is due to start on the new site later this year and the new facilities will open late 2013.
