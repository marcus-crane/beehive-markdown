Prime Minister John Key today expressed his sorrow at the passing of Margaret Mahy ONZ, one of New Zealand’s best-loved authors.

“Ms Mahy’s books, short stories and contributions to the *New Zealand School Journal* have been part of New Zealand children’s lives for generations,” says Mr Key.

“She is widely acknowledged as one of this country’s finest authors, and one of the world’s greatest writers of children’s and young adults’ stories.

“Ms Mahy’s stories resonated with children around the globe – her works were translated into a number of languages, and the accolades she received internationally illustrate her enormous contribution to children’s literature.”

Margaret Mahy was awarded the Order of New Zealand in 1993. She won the Carnegie Medal in 1982 and 1984, making her the first writer outside Britain to receive the award. In 2006 she was awarded the prestigious Hans Christian Andersen Award for her enduring work.

“I would like to extend my condolences to Ms Mahy’s family and friends at this sad time,” says Mr Key. “I am sure her stories will remain firm favourites among children here and overseas for years to come.”
