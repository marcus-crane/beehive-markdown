Enid Ratahi-Pryor has been appointed to the Housing New Zealand Corporation board for a three-year term, Housing Minister Phil Heatley announced today.

Ms Ratahi-Pryor is the Chief Executive Officer of Te Tohu O Te Ora O Ngati Awa, a Maori social and health service provider based in Whakatane. She has an extensive background in health and social services and is a former member of the Government’s Welfare Working Group.

Mr Heatley said her appointment came at an important time for HNZC.

“HNZC continues to focus on its core business of providing social housing to those most in need, for the duration of that need.

“Ms Ratahi-Pryor is a welcome addition to the board. She adds to the board’s excellent mix of skills and experience as it leads the efficient and effective delivery of social housing by HNZC, and adapts its portfolio to ensure it has the right houses that are the right size and are in the right place for people’s needs,” he said.
