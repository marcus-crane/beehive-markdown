More than 650 tonnes of plastic farm waste has been recycled nationwide during the past year thanks to a government-funded scheme, Environment Minister Amy Adams says.

Under the product stewardship scheme, Plasback supplies more than 1000 recycling bins to New Zealand farms, and collects agricultural plastics such as bale wrap, silage wrap and covers, agrichemical containers and crop bags.

The waste is recycled into plastic resin pellets and then reused in new plastic products.

“Many farmers have been frustrated by the lack of options for dealing with plastic farm waste and know that burning or burying waste is not a sustainable solution,” Ms Adams says.

“This voluntary scheme is about getting alongside farmers and providing an environmentally-friendly alternative.

“Thanks to the agriculture sector’s commitment, there is now 650 tonnes of plastic waste that is not being burned or buried.”

The programme received $130,000 from the Government’s Waste Minimisation Fund which supports projects that increase resource efficiency and decrease the amount of waste going to landfill.

“Under the Waste Minimisation Act, as Minister for the Environment, I have the ability to accredit product stewardship schemes which meet the criteria for reducing waste and environmental harm.

“Product stewardship schemes are an excellent way of getting all parties involved in the production and distribution of a product to take responsibility for its environmental impact at the end of its life.”
