Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain today announced the reappointment of Nicola McCully as the Deputy Chief Censor of Film and Literature for a further three-year term.

“The reappointment will maintain the organisational capability of the Office of Film and Literature Classification and is part of a long-term succession management plan. The Office is an independent Crown entity that classifies films, videos, books, magazines, and computer files and bans objectionable publications,” says Mr Tremain.

The Deputy Chief Censor is a statutory position requiring specialist knowledge of censorship issues, legal and judicial processes and the ability to deal with graphic or explicit depictions of crime, cruelty, sex, violence, and horror.

Ms McCully of Wellington has been the Deputy Chief Censor for nine years and provides the Classification Office with key technical knowledge and strategic expertise.

Ms McCully works closely with the Chief Censor Dr Andrew Jack who took up office in March 2011.
