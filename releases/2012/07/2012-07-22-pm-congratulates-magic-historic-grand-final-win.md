Prime Minister John Key says this afternoon’s win for Waikato-Bay of Plenty Magic against the Melbourne Vixens in the grand final of the ANZ Netball Championship was a well-deserved and hard fought victory.

“This is an especially sweet victory for the team. The grand finals in 2008 and 2010 may have slipped them by, but that was never going to happen in 2012,” says Mr Key.

“After suffering four losses at the beginning of the season, the team showed nothing but steely determination that this was their time. Eleven wins in a row later, they went into the grand final playing with skill and passion against a tough and experienced opponent.”

Waikato-Bay of Plenty Magic came back from behind to win 41/38 against the Melbourne Vixens at Hisense Arena in Melbourne. It is the first time a New Zealand team has ever won the trans-Tasman netball competition.

“To do this on the Vixens home court, in a sold-out arena filled with screaming Aussie fans makes the victory even better,” says Mr Key.

“I am very proud of them and congratulate them on behalf of all their New Zealand fans.”
