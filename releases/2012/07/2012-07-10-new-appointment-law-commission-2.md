Minister of Justice Judith Collins announced today that Principal Family Court Judge Peter Boshier has been appointed as a new member of the Law Commission for a period of five years, effective from 10 December 2012.

“Judge Boshier’s vast experience in many facets of the law and his extensive administrative experience will be significant assets to the Law Commission,” Ms Collins says.

Judge Boshier will join Sir Grant Hammond, Professor Geoff McLay and Dr Wayne Mapp as members of the Commission. He will divide his time between the Law Commission and his work as a District Court Judge.

**Background**

Judge Boshier was appointed as the Principal Family Court Judge in 2004, after serving on the District Court Bench since 1988. He has worked extensively in the management of the Family Court and judicial system. In 1993, he completed a review of the Family Court, which resulted in a number of changes to Court processes. Judge Boshier has a particular interest in Pacific youth justice and child offenders.

The Law Commission is an independent Crown entity established to undertake the systematic review, reform, and development of the law. The Commission investigates and reports to Parliament on how laws can be improved. It also reviews the law and processes in specific areas selected by it, or referred to it, by the Minister Responsible for the Law Commission.
