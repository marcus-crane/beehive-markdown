Civil Defence Minister Chris Tremain says that the latest Colmar Brunton survey on emergency preparedness shows that there is no room for complacency when it comes to hazards.

“The Get Ready Get Thru advertising campaign has been running since 2006 and has produced significant results in awareness and understanding,” says Mr Tremain.

“The good news is that the 2012 survey of national levels of preparedness shows 88 per cent of New Zealanders who have seen the ads have done something, or thought about doing something to prepare themselves in an emergency. In addition 55 per cent of all New Zealand residents say they have taken steps to prepare themselves or their household in the last 12 months.

“On the other hand the proportion of people in New Zealand who said they were fully prepared for an emergency has dropped from 18 per cent last year to 16 per cent this year on the back of a high spike in 2010/11 as a result of the Canterbury earthquake. However the multi-year trend shows an increase in the level of preparedness well up from seven per cent in 2006.

“All New Zealanders need to take steps to ensure they are prepared in an emergency. Research shows the very real need to continue an education campaign, as memories fade quickly and the need to act falls off the ‘to-do list’ in busy lives.

“I encourage everyone to take time out to consider how they and their family can “Get Ready - Get Through” by taking part in this year’s ShakeOut civil defence exercise. The campaign aims to have one million people do an earthquake drill at 9.26am on 26 September (9:26-26:9).”
