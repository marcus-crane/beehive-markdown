Immigration Minister Nathan Guy is representing New Zealand at the annual Bali Democracy Forum this week.

The two-day Forum in Nusa Dua, Bali, brings together Heads of State and Foreign Ministers from countries across Asia, the Middle East and the Pacific.

“This is an opportunity for countries to share their experiences and work together on strengthening democratic institutions throughout the region,” says Mr Guy who is attending on behalf of Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully.

“It provides a platform for engaging with other countries on a range of governance, security, economic and human rights issues, as well as an important forum for building closer regional ties.

“Democracy has contributed to New Zealand’s prosperity and quality of life. It’s in our interests to see that the Asia Pacific region, to which we are closely linked, fosters the same environment.”

The Bali Democracy Forum was established in 2008 and this year attendance has increased to 27 participant states and 36 observers.

Mr Guy will be in Indonesia from Wednesday 7 November to Saturday 10 November.
