The government has received the third and final part (comprising volumes 5 to 7) of the report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Building Failure Caused by Canterbury Earthquakes, Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson announced today.

Ministers will now consider the third part of the report. An announcement about the public release of the report and the government’s response will be made in due course.

The Chair of the Royal Commission, Hon Justice Cooper, presented the final part (volumes 5 to 7) of the Royal Commission’s report to the Governor-General in Wellington this morning. The Secretary of Internal Affairs received the report from the Governor-General, and has transmitted it to the office of the Attorney-General, who is the minister responsible for the Royal Commission of Inquiry.

Volumes 5 to 7 of the Royal Commission of Inquiry’s report covers the investigation into the collapse of the CTV building. They also deal with the roles and responsibilities in the building sector including the assessment of buildings after earthquakes; the training of civil engineers and the organisation and regulation of the engineering profession; the building consent process, and local government management of earthquake risk.

No further comment will be made at this time.
