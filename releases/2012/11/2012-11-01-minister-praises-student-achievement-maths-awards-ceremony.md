Education Minister Hekia Parata today praised the achievement of young mathematicians while guest of honour at a major international maths competition.

“I was delighted to accept the invitation to present awards at the Australian Mathematics Trust presentation ceremony. Maths is such an important subject. It develops problem solving and organisational skills.  Mastering basic maths helps learners manage personal finances and even their time,” says Ms Parata.

Ms Parata presented awards to budding number crunchers from New Zealand, at the awards ceremony in Wellington organised by Australian Mathematics Trust.

The Australian Mathematics Competition is in its 35th year and has attracted 325,000 entrants from 40 countries, including 20,244 students from 330 New Zealand schools.

“Getting to grips with figures helps us think logically, analytically and creatively.  Maths is not always as popular among students as it should be. It’s important to encourage the next generation of mathematicians to be the best they can.

“This competition is highly regarded by maths teachers here in New Zealand and I congratulate all the participants on their hard work and perseverance.”

Ms Parata presented Australian Mathematics Competition Medals to five winners, and a further 20 students from the wider Wellington region received other awards.

                            

**Note:**

Members of the Australian Mathematics Trust include representatives of the Australian Association of Mathematics Teachers, the Australian Academy of Science and the Australian Mathematical Society.

Entry for the Australian Mathematics Competition is open to students aged between 8 and 19, of all ability levels. Entrants are asked to solve a number of problems in a limited time period.
