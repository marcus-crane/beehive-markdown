Tena koutou

Tena koutou

Tena tatou katoa

Thank you for the opportunity to join you all here today to recognise the successful completion of the second Tauira Kaitiaki Taiao cadetship programme and celebrate the graduation of the nine participating cadets.

I remember with great fondness my attendance at the inaugural graduation celebration on 13 November 2010 at Waitetoko Marae – north of Turangi. It was a very special and moving occasion for me – made special by the amazing calibre of the graduates. You could see in their eyes that graduating was very meaningful to them and provided new opportunities for the future. It is great to hear that many of the graduates have secured work in conservation related fields.

I am told that the graduates today are following on from this proud tradition.

Today would not have been possible without the support of a number of parties.

So, on that note, I would like to acknowledge and thank te Ariki nui Kingi Tuheitia for supporting this special occasion.

I would also like to acknowledge Sir Tumu Te Heuheu for the leadership and support that he and the Nga Whenua Rahui Committee has contributed to the cadetship over the past four years duration.

This support is not only financial; it is also in-kind support provided to the cadets by way of direct hands-on operational experience.

I would like to take this opportunity to personally thank the Nga Whenua Rahui Committee for its important work over the last 21 years to protect biodiversity on Maori-owned land. It has been a quiet yet determined achiever having under its protection over 170,000 hectares of indigenous forests, wetlands, dunelands and tussock-lands nationwide. The Committee through the Matauranga Kura Taiao Fund has also completed 227 projects in support of the retention and use of traditional Maori knowledge in biodiversity management.

I am advised that a highlight of the cadetship has been the opportunity for the Department of Conservation and Nga Whenua Rahui to have their cadets work alongside each other, sharing knowledge with each other and supporting each other throughout their learning journey. This cross-fertilisation will stand conservation in good stead for the future.

Today is a celebration. In March 2011 this intake of the cadetship commenced their learning journey here at Hopuhopu.

We are proud to see this programme’s ongoing success with the graduation of these nine cadets today. They join the graduates of the initial intake of this initiative as potential conservation leaders of the future.

I have acknowledged key parties who have helped us arrive at this point in the journey. But, I also want to acknowledge a unique and special contributing feature that helped make this cadetship so successful.

Whanau, hapu and Iwi have been a key and vital ingredient in this journey. Through your support of the cadets they are now better placed to take up the mantle as the future leaders of conservation management for our Nation.

Thank you for nominating your whanau for this programme - and for trusting the Department of Conservation and Nga Whenua Rahui to support and nurture their development during their time with us.

The partnership between the Department and Nga Whenua Rahui originally set out with the purpose of building Mäori capability in conservation management however I believe we have achieved this and more.

Ensuring the protection and prosperity of our special places, from the mountains to the sea and the species within, is something in which everyone has a part to play.

Iwi as kaitiaki have always enjoyed a special relationship with their environment.

Through the Treaty of Waitangi Settlement process Iwi are now seeking and requiring formal recognition of their cultural interests and aspirations.

The quickening pace of Treaty settlements means that Maori will now have an even greater role in the conservation of their own resources.

Our Government is committed to successful and durable settlements with Iwi.

This requires us to invest in the capability for Maori to be well placed to lead and manage the cultural redress elements of their settlements.

For our graduates it is clear that with the skills and knowledge you’ve gained, you are well placed to have a career in conservation.

Your graduation from this programme is a great achievement and concludes the formal training element of this programme. But it is also a reminder.

This reminder signals the clear need to have Maori involved and employed in conservation related fields. This investment in your future is however, not unencumbered or without expectation.

There is a hope that other whanau, hapu, iwi and Maori entities will see you and believe that conservation is a viable career pathway for their rangatahi.

You are role models for the cadetship. As graduates you can help shape the future of the cadetship programme.

Just as your managers and colleagues have been there to support and mentor you, you will also need to assist other young people that follow in your footsteps.

I understand work is currently being progressed within the Department of Conservation to ensure the continuation of the cadetship programme which I fully support.

In closing, I acknowledge your achievements as graduates and challenge you to become role models for others by realising your potential as leaders of the future. I wish you well.
