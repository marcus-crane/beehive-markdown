Foster Care Awareness Week begins with excellence awards for foster carers today, culminating with the William Wallace Awards on Friday.

Social Development Minister Paula Bennett joined Governor General, Lt Gen Rt Hon Sir Jerry Mateparae in celebrating the achievements of ten foster carers who received excellence awards in a ceremony at Government House.

“Foster carers provide a safe home for children who need it most, usually in a time of crisis,” says Mrs Bennett.

“The ten foster carers being awarded today have provided a critical role in many children’s lives.”

New Zealand has around 3,900 children and young people living in state care and 4,000 foster carers who are available to care for them. 

“I have a huge amount of respect and admiration for foster parents. These remarkable people put other people’s children first and open up their heart and their home to vulnerable children.”

Clinical psychologist Nigel Latta also attended today’s award ceremony to help launch Child, Youth and Family’s new DVD for caregivers. 

The DVD includes advice from caregivers, child care professionals and young people and Mr Latta’s thoughts on the challenges and rewards of foster care.

The White Paper for Vulnerable Children, released in October, introduced changes to protect vulnerable children and better support caregivers.

“The White Paper recognises the complexity of offering a home for life to children in care and outlines new supports to help people manage the transition from caregiver to family member,” says Paula Bennett.

To ease this transition the Government will contract organisations to support those who permanently take in children through fostering or Home for Life.

Paid parental leave provisions to support adoptive parents and Home for Life families will also be reviewed, and parent child interaction therapy for caregivers of high and complex-needs children will be expanded.

“I am also determined to provide extra financial support to grandparents raising grandchildren and other kin carers,” says Mrs Bennett.

The National Government introduced Gateway Assessments for children in care which are making a significant difference to their health and wellbeing.

“We put $43.7 million towards getting all children in care a proper health and educational assessment so we can address any issues they may have and we’ve also covered the costs of more Early Childhood Education, mental health services and parenting support through the Children in Care Package.”

“The Gateway Assessments have picked up health problems in every single child and more than half were found to have emotional, behavioural and mental health issues which can now be addressed.”

“On behalf of New Zealanders I thank foster carers for the work they do,” says Mrs Bennett.
