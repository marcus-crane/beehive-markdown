Defence Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman has announced the new Vice Chief of Defence Force will be Major General Tim Keating.

Major General Keating, who is currently the Chief of Army, is replacing the current Vice Chief of Defence Force, Rear Admiral Jack Steer, who was recently appointed as Chief of Navy.

“Major General Keating is a respected officer with extensive command and operational experience spanning a 31 year career,” said Dr Coleman.

“He has the right blend of leadership and organisational management service to step into this role as the deputy to the Chief of Defence,” he said.

Major General Keating joined the NZ Army in 1982. He has held various significant positions within the Defence Force in his career including Commanding Officer 1st New Zealand Special Air Service Group; Commandant Officer Cadet School, Waiouru; and Commander 2nd Land Force Group, Linton Military Camp.

He was promoted to his current rank and assumed the role of Chief of Army in February 2011.

Major General Keating has had a number of operational deployments. He was the Commanding Officer of New Zealand’s Multinational Force, Sinai, in 1997; and was deployed to Afghanistan as the Commander of Task Group CRIB 6, in July 2005.

Major General Keating completed the Australian Command and Staff Course, Queenscliff, Australia in 1996. He also holds a Master of Strategic Studies from the United States Army War College, Pennsylvania. 

In June 2008 he was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the Queen’s Birthday honours list.

He starts his new job as Vice Chief of New Zealand Defence Force on December 1st for a three year term.
