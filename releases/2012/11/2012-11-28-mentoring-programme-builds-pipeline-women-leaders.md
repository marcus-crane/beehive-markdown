Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew today joined with the Institute of Directors in Auckland to celebrate the successful completion of its 2012 mentoring programme, and welcome a new intake of 27 women for 2013.

“The Institute of Directors is to be congratulated for its persistence and commitment to increasing the number of women on private sector boards,” Mrs Goodhew said.

The Mentoring for Diversity programme brings together experienced and skilled women interested in governance careers with senior chairs and directors as their mentors for a year.

“It is vital that we get more of our outstanding and talented women participating at the board table,” Mrs Goodhew said.

“Board diversity is needed to help maintain a competitive and vibrant economy. Research increasingly tells us that there is a positive relationship between women on boards and organisational performance, particularly bottom-line financial performance.

“The Mentoring for Diversity programme makes an invaluable contribution by building up a cohort of women ready to take on leadership roles.

“I understand that at least 10 percent of the 2012 mentees have already been appointed to large commercial boards.

“I wish all the Mentoring for Diversity mentees every success with their governance careers and look forward to hearing about their achievements.”
