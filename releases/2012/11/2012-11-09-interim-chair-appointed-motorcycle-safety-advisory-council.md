ACC Minister Judith Collins has today announced Mr Paul Searancke has been appointed to the role of interim Chair of the Motorcycle Safety Advisory Council (MSAC).

Mr Searancke replaces Dr Gareth Morgan, Chair of the Council since its inception in January 2011, who has stepped down to focus on other commitments.

“I would like to thank Dr Morgan, who is a passionate advocate for motorcyclists’ safety.  Dr Morgan was instrumental in establishing the Council’s objectives and processes for developing and recommending targeted projects to ACC,” says Ms Collins.

“Mr Searancke is an equally passionate advocate, who I’m sure will draw on his considerable experience and expertise to help guide appropriate projects to fruition,” Ms Collins says.

Ms Collins is also calling for nominations for the role of permanent Chair. 

“To register your interest, please contact the MSAC Secretariat at [info@motonz.org.nz](mailto:info@motonz.org.nz),” Ms Collins says.
