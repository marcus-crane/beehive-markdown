Veterans’ Affairs Minister Nathan Guy says the 94th anniversary of the end of the First World War tomorrow is a day to remember those who lost their lives while serving New Zealand in this conflict.  

The Allies signed an Armistice with Germany ending hostilities on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918.

“The First World War took an enormous toll on New Zealand, and this is a chance to remember the men and women who served,” says Mr Guy.

“More than 100,000 New Zealanders served overseas during the First World War, with more than 18,000 killed and a further 41,000 wounded.

“This was a terrible burden on a small nation, with New Zealand’s population at the time around one million. Nearly every family in the country was affected by the brutal battles in places like Gallipoli and Passchendaele.

“November 11 is a chance to reflect and honour those men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice. We will remember them.”

The New Zealand Government has developed WW100 New Zealand, an official programme to mark the First World War Centenary from 2014 to 2018. More information is available at [http://ww100.govt.nz/](http://ww100.govt.nz/).  

A centrepiece will be the redevelopment of the National War Memorial park in Wellington, in time for the commemoration the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli campaign in 2015.
