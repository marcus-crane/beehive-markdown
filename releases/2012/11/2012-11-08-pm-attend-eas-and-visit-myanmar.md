Prime Minister John Key will visit Cambodia later this month to attend the East Asia Summit, before travelling to Myanmar – the first time a New Zealand Prime Minister has visited that country.

Mr Key will join leaders from 10 ASEAN countries, Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea, and new members Russia and the US, at the EAS in Phnom Penh on 20 November.

"This is an important grouping of countries for New Zealand, and discussions will cover political, security and economic issues in our region,” says Mr Key.

"I also expect to take part in the launch of negotiations towards a Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, involving the 10 ASEAN countries and their six FTA partners."

Following the EAS Mr Key will travel on to Myanmar where he will meet President Thein Sein and Opposition Leader and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Aung San Suu Kyi.

"There has been historic political and economic reform in Myanmar over the past year. I look forward to seeing these developments first hand, and exploring how New Zealand can work with Myanmar to support its political and economic reintegration with the rest of the world," says Mr Key.

"My visit reflects New Zealand's commitment to building connections between our two countries. As well as our shared regional interests, I expect there will be real opportunities for New Zealand businesses over the next few years in Myanmar."

Mr Key is away from 19-24 November.
