The Crown Prince of Belgium, HRH Prince Philippe, accompanied by the Belgian Defence Minister Pieter De Crem, will lead a business delegation to New Zealand from 27 to 29 November, Arts and Culture Minister Christopher Finlayson announced today.

In addition to engaging in trade promotion, Prince Philippe will meet the Prime Minister and be guest of honour at a dinner hosted by the Governor-General Lt Gen the Rt Hon Sir Jerry Mateparae at Government House.

“A dominant feature of New Zealand’s relationship with Belgium is the World War One experience we shared on Belgian soil,” Mr Finlayson said. “With the centenary of that awful conflict approaching, this visit will be an opportunity to introduce to His Royal Highness and Mr De Crem our preparations for the commemoration of such a significant chapter of New Zealand’s history.”

Prince Philippe will lay a wreath at the National War Memorial on Wednesday 28 November.
