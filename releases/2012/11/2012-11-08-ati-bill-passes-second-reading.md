A bill to establish the new Advanced Technology Institute (ATI) – a new high-tech HQ for innovative New Zealand businesses – today passed its second reading in Parliament.

“The purpose of the ATI is simple: to help get New Zealand’s best ideas out of the lab and into the marketplace more quickly,” Mr Joyce says.

“An important part of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda is to ensure there are better linkages between business, science, engineering and design to ensure great ideas are commercialised and generate income and jobs for New Zealanders.

“The select committee process has shown wide support for the ATI to help high-tech firms become more competitive. The ATI will better connect firms with innovation and business development expertise and facilities that exist within the ATI and across New Zealand’s Crown Research Institutes, universities, polytechnics, and other research organisations.

“It will focus on industries with high growth potential such as food and beverage manufacturing, agri-technologies, digital technologies, health technologies, therapeutics, and high-value wood products.

“The ATI – which will be named after the late Sir Paul Callaghan – will help increase the number of R&D capable firms; lift New Zealand’s exports of high-value manufactured goods and services; and support economic growth.”
