Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew is congratulating Starship on reaching a milestone as the country’s national children’s hospital.

Starship is this month marking its 21st birthday.

Mrs Goodhew has told a gathering to honour the milestone that the hospital’s evolution in the past 21 years has been incredible.

“This is an achievement that everyone involved, and New Zealand, can be proud of. Starship means that we can be reassured that children in need will receive the specialist care they need.

“The hospital is now a full tertiary hospital and offers a range of paediatric services not available elsewhere. Starship is the only place in New Zealand performing paediatric liver transplants, cardiac surgery, ECMO, which is a form of intensive care, and paediatric intensive care.

“Many of those present today were part of the New Children’s Hospital Trust which worked hard to raise $250,000 in the early 1980s and secured government approval for a 188-bed hospital in 1982.”

Starship Hospital was completed on 18 November 1991. In 2010/11 Starship had 127,621 patients through its doors. There were 26,324 inpatient discharges and 30,855 visits to the Children’s Emergency Department. More than 57 per cent of inpatient children at Starship Hospital are aged six or under.
