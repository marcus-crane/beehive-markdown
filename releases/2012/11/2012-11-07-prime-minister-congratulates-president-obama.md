Prime Minister John Key tonight congratulated President Obama on a hard fought victory in the US Presidential elections.

“I will be sending President Obama a letter of congratulations tomorrow, and will also relay them in person when I see him at the East Asian Summit in Phnom Penh later this month.

“The relationship between our two countries is an enduring and close one, and I look forward to developing it further.

“With President Obama’s re-election, there will be many opportunities to enhance the relationship, which is built on shared values, and a commitment to improve the prosperity and well-being of our people through initiatives such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

“I have enjoyed working with President Obama during his first term as President and welcome the opportunity to continue our strategic partnership over the coming years.”
