Small Business Minister John Banks today congratulated Business.govt.nz for winning the Government category at last night’s AUT Excellence in Business Support Awards.

Hosted by the AUT Business School, winners across 13 categories were announced to an audience of over 700 business leaders. This year saw a total of 47 finalists - the highest in the award’s seven-year history.

“This award highlights the value Business.govt.nz provides New Zealand’s small and medium enterprises,” Mr Banks said.

“Business.govt.nz is the first-stop government website for small and medium businesses.  The site provides a variety of information, tools and resources to help small firms, and the people that advise and support them.

“The Business.govt.nz team have been talking to New Zealand’s small and medium enterprises, listening to their needs and using that to improve their site. This award is a fantastic recognition that Business.govt.nz is on the right track.

"The site is also a great example of how public-private sector partnerships can work effectively and for the benefit of all involved, including the partnership with ANZ to deliver the Flying Start Business Plan competition earlier this year which attracted more than 750 entries from entrepreneurial New Zealanders.

“This is the second major award for Business.govt.nz this year, with the site winning the NetGuide Award for Best Site for Small Business in September.   I would like to commend the Business.govt.nz team on a job well done,” Mr Banks said.
