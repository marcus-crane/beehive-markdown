Government initiatives underway to get more young people and the unemployed into work have the support of New Zealand employers, new research shows.

A survey of 2000 employers and in-depth interviews with 53 firms by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment found that improving education, training and skills for young people and the unemployed removed barriers and enhanced their chances of getting a job.

“Employers are clear that the key attributes they look for when hiring young people and those looking for work are whether they have the right skills, experience, attitude and work ethic,” Tertiary, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce says.

“The report notes that Government initiatives such as Job Streams and the $97 million Youth Guarantee scheme, which gives 16 and 17-year-olds fees-free vocational training, are supported by employers. Youth Guarantee is in high demand with 7345 places being taken up in 2012.

“Employers are in favour of the 90-day-trial period the Government has introduced as it reduces the risk of taking on young people and the unemployed while giving them the chance to demonstrate they have the skills an employer wants.”

Sixty per cent of employers said they had used a trial period and 70 per cent said they would in the future.

“Many employers are also in favour of a simple youth minimum wage. The Government’s new Starting Out Wage announced last month will be easy for employers to implement and will help give thousands of young people a much-needed foot in the door in a tight labour market,” Mr Joyce says.

“The Government has a comprehensive programme to ensure our young people have the necessary skills and training that employers are seeking. We are making good progress with NCEA Level 2 achievement up, tertiary results also up, Youth Guarantee achieving great results and the number of young people on benefits falling.”
