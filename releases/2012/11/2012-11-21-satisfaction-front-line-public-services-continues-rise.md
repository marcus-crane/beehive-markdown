Satisfaction with public services continues to increase according to the latest *Kiwis Count* survey says State Services Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman.

The survey, released today by the State Services Commission, recorded service quality improving to 74 points out of 100 this quarter, up from 72 points in the last survey. 

“This latest *Kiwis Count* report shows public service agencies are lifting their game at the front line and that New Zealanders are noticing the improvements,” said Dr Coleman.

“This has been achieved in a fiscal environment where there has been little new money available and when there’s been a cap on the number of core public service employees,” he said.

The survey recorded significant improvements for four services: road maintenance by local councils (11 points), obtaining family services or counselling (7 points), registering a birth, marriage, death or civil union (7 points), and enquiring about tax, tax credits, student loan repayments and Kiwisaver (5 points).

Increases across 24 services drove the overall increase.  No services recorded a significant decrease.

The survey also measured trust in the public service and 42% of respondents gave a four or five out of five. The rating for the private sector was at 40%.

This is this second survey of the *Kiwis Counts* survey since it started quarterly reporting.

The data was collected between April 2012 and September 2012 involving 1,161 participants.
