The Household Labour Force Survey for the September quarter released today confirms again that New Zealand is not immune to global economic headwinds, Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce says.

“The results show the on-going impact of tough economic times globally and their impact on New Zealand. Many of our trading partners continue to struggle with sluggish economies and too much debt.  Meanwhile necessary steps by households and the government in this country to save more are moderating domestic growth, Mr Joyce says. 

“Despite the latest data, New Zealand’s unemployment rate remains better than most OECD countries and is equal with Canada.

“It’s always difficult for people when they lose their job and we appreciate these are challenging times for many families.

“This data underlines the importance of removing barriers and delays for companies seeking to make productive investments in this country that create viable long-term jobs.

“Through our Business Growth Agenda the Government is working hard to give businesses the opportunity to grow and create jobs across a range of sectors such as in oil and gas exploration, the expansion of intensive agriculture, the development of aquaculture, investment in hi-tech innovation, supporting our film industry, encouraging foreign investment, and progressing an international convention centre in Auckland.

“We are also investing billions of dollars into the Christchurch rebuild and in upgrading our infrastructure across New Zealand, such as in the rollout of ultra-fast broadband, investments in transport bottlenecks, and upgrading the electricity grid.”
