Associate Transport Minister Simon Bridges has thanked the public and the transport sector for their excellent response to the Government’s call for feedback on proposed changes to vehicle licensing systems.

“Approximately 4200 submissions were made during the six week public consultation period which ended yesterday," says Mr Bridges.

“This is a huge response to the ideas and options presented in the discussion document, demonstrating how much interest there is in our vehicle licensing systems.

“I would like to thank every submitter for their thoughtful and considered views, which will be carefully considered and contribute to the final decision making process.”

Independent research about people’s attitudes to warrant of fitness inspections, vehicle maintenance and safety, and annual vehicle licensing has also been commissioned and will add to the information from submissions.  The results of this research and a summary of submissions will be publicly released in the coming weeks.

Decisions on a proposed way forward are due by the end of the year.
