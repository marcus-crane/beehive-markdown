Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain today announced the establishment of a new government IT panel to purchase Microsoft products.

“A Syndicated Services Panel has been set up to order and administer Microsoft licences. This will reduce the cost of purchasing licences, remove duplication and streamline the procurement process,” says Mr Tremain.

“Currently, agencies needing to purchase Microsoft services deal directly with a range of Large Account Resellers (LARs). This creates inconsistencies in service levels and the fees charged by various LARs.

“The service providers on the syndicated panel are Datacom, Dimension Data, Fujitsu, Gen-i and Insight.

“This initiative is in line with the Government’s ICT strategy which encourages shared approaches and solutions.  While the syndicated panel isn’t mandatory, I strongly encourage all government agencies to find out how the Panel can help save them time and money.”
