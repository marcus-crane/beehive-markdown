Education Minister Hekia Parata wishes all NCEA students in New Zealand the best during their examinations.

"As NCEA examinations begin on 9 November, it is a critical time for our students and I wish them the very best during their examinations. Our Government's education plan aims for five out of five students getting the qualifications they need to reach their potential. We want the best for all our students.

In September, the Ministry of Education released 2011 NCEA results for students leaving school with either NCEA Level 1 or Level 2 or above. The results showed increases of 2-6 per cent respectively.

"This is good news but we can do better. The Government has set a target of 85 per cent of 18 year olds school leavers attaining NCEA Level 2 in 2017, so we need all school leavers to be as successful as possible in their exams.

"I am encouraged by the great work principals, teachers and boards do to support our students in school, together with parents and communities out of school. It is this collective effort that is reflected in the increased results of NCEA students leaving school over the last three years.

"We want to see this positive trend increase and I wish all NCEA candidates the very best with their exams this year."
