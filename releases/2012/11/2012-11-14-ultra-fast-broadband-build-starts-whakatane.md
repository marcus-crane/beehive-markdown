Ultra-Fast Broadband will be rolled out to more than 1500 businesses, health facilities, schools and homes in Whakatane during the next 18 months, Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams says.

Chorus, one of the Government’s UFB partners, today began work to build a high-speed fibre broadband network in Whakatane.

UFB will pass more than 1500 premises by July 2014, and about 7000 premises in total by the end of the build period.

By July next year, eight schools will be covered by the network. They are:

- Allandale School
- Apanui School
- James Street School
- St Joseph's Catholic School
- Trident High School
- Whakatane High School
- Whakatane Intermediate
- Whakatane S D A School

Ms Adams says it is appropriate that work to build the UFB network in Whakatane coincides with New Zealand’s first ever Telework Week.

Highlighting the social, economic and environmental benefits of working from home, the initiative is also an opportunity for businesses to think about telework and the options a UFB workplace provides.

“There is no reason why skilled staff cannot live in Whakatane but still work for leading companies all over the world. Our businesses need to start thinking about how telework opens up new worlds of recruitment possibilities.

“Now it is up to Whakatane to ensure it maximises the opportunity this UFB network will provide.”

The UFB initiative involves Government investment of $1.35 billion – alongside private sector funding – to roll out fibre to schools, hospitals, and 90 per cent of businesses by 2016, and links to homes and remaining businesses completed by 2019.
