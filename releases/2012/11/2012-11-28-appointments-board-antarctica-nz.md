Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced three appointments to Antarctica New Zealand’s management board.

Carolyn Burns, Tony O’Brien and Rob Fyfe will serve three-year terms on the board responsible for managing New Zealand’s programme in Antarctica.

“Board members are required to successfully guide New Zealand’s activities in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. With these new appointments, I am confident the board has the right mix of skills and experience to do so,” Mr McCully says.

Professor Burns, a marine science expert, and Mr O’Brien, a media relations specialist, will begin their terms immediately. Mr Fyfe’s term will commence on 1 February 2013, once he steps down as CEO of Air New Zealand. 

Tenby Powell, a founder and director of Hunter Powell Investments, has been re-appointed for a second term.
