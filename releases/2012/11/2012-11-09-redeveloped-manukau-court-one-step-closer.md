Justice Minister Judith Collins today announced that Mainzeal Property and Construction Ltd has been appointed as the main construction contractor to carry out the $40.6 million redevelopment of the Manukau District Court.

“This is one of the largest single investments the District Court network has seen in some years and will provide a solid foundation for the future property needs of the Auckland region,” Ms Collins said.  

“One-third of the demand for court services nationally is from within the greater Auckland region and projections point to both population growth and changing need for court services.

“While crime is falling and has reduced significantly in the Manukau area, the redevelopment will ensure we have the right infrastructure in place to cope with growing demand for all court services both in Manukau and across the region over the next twenty years.”

The redevelopment will include a new four story extension as well as extensive alterations and a complete refurbishment of the existing court building. When complete, the redevelopment will provide four new jury trial courtrooms with provision for further expansion.

“The redeveloped court will improve safety for court users and staff and provide a better experience for those needing its services. 

“A key part of the Government’s efforts to create accessible modern courts is to target investment and resources where they are needed.

“This means investing in courts such as Manukau and ensuring they are fit for purpose, have good facilities and security, and provide the full range of services court users expect to receive.

“The redevelopment is a key part of improving how we deliver services in Auckland, alongside changes to how family and civil cases are managed, centralised calling and other projects to deal with the workloads and the increasing population in the region,” Ms Collins said.

Construction work will proceed in stages and will be carefully managed to minimise disruption to court users during this time. Construction will begin in late November and is expected to be complete by November 2014.
