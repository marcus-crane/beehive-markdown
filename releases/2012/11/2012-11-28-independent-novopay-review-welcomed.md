Associate Education Minister Craig Foss has welcomed confirmation that the Novopay payroll project will be the subject of an independent review.

“While the Ministry of Education’s new payroll project is still in its early stages, the number of issues resulting from the payroll transition has been unacceptable. The review will be comprehensive and thorough,” says Mr Foss.

The independent post implementation review will commence in early 2013.

“There are several key milestones coming up including end-of-year and start-of-year payments, it is important they are captured by the review.

“It’s also important that the review does not detract from the immediate focus of getting the payroll system running to its full potential. Right now the focus is on getting school staff paid accurately and on time,” says Mr Foss.

Novopay went live on 20 August 2012.
