Trade Minister Tim Groser today welcomed participants at the World Wine Trade Group (WWTG) annual meeting held in Auckland.

The WWTG is a grouping of trade negotiators, regulators and industry representatives from eight  ‘new world’ wine-producing countries: Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Georgia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United States, who together represent a third of global wine exports. 

“This group has been instrumental in facilitating the expansion of wine trade by its willingness to consider new approaches to regulation and labelling of wine and through the sharing of information and experiences on a range of wine-related issues,” Mr Groser says.

Since its formation in 1998 the WWTG has concluded two agreements on winemaking practices and labelling which have influenced international thinking on the regulation of wine trade. 

WWTG countries have almost doubled their share of global exports.  Work is continuing this week towards a further consolidation of labelling rules, which could save New Zealand producers several millions of dollars each year by reducing the costs to exports.

 

“This kind of international cooperation is crucial to ensuring that New Zealand continues to grow its primary exports and diversifies its overseas markets,” says Mr Groser.

New Zealand will continue to work actively in the WWTG to address potential issues where streamlined or harmonised regulation or cooperation with industry initiatives on labelling for sustainable production, will benefit consumers and producers.

**Additional Information**

Wine is New Zealand’s fastest growing primary export, growing from a $118m in 1998 to almost $1.2bn today. 

New Zealand is the ninth largest exporter by value and the third largest exporter of super-premium value wines globally.  New Zealand wines are a value added product, which enhance our tourism industry and our national brand.  More than 200 million bottles of high quality New Zealand wine are consumed around the world each year. 

Within the WWTG are some of New Zealand’s fastest growing markets.
