Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson has expressed his condolences on the passing of lawyer Greg King.

“Although young in years, Greg King had already achieved a huge amount in his career,” Mr Finlayson said. “He was a lawyer in the finest traditions of the criminal bar, of the same stature as the likes of Mike Bungay, Kevin Ryan and Roy Stacey.”

“He was a fine advocate and a very nice guy. His early death is very sad, and my deepest sympathies go to his family at this time.”
