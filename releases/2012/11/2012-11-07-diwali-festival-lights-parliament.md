Ethnic Affairs Minister Judith Collins is looking forward to hosting members of New Zealand’s Indian community at Parliament tonight to celebrate Diwali, the festival of lights. 

Ms Collins says the festival’s growing popularity in New Zealand reflects the appeal of Indian culture as much as it does our vibrant Indian population.

“Diwali showcases India’s colour and energy and allows members of the Indian community to share their story with us,” Ms Collins says.

“The festival carries significance all New Zealanders can relate to – it’s a time of festivity, goodwill, reflection and renewal and a time to acknowledge the importance of relationships, particularly with friends and family.”

Ms Collins says the Indian community continues to make a significant social and cultural contribution to New Zealand.

“Diwali is excellent opportunity for Indian New Zealanders to celebrate their heritage and for all New Zealanders to acknowledge the contribution the Indian community continues to make to the cultural landscape of our nation,” Ms Collins says.

“India and New Zealand have a very strong relationship, underpinned by the strong people-to-people links shared between our two countries. It is by sharing in events like Diwali that we will continue to make these connections even stronger.”
