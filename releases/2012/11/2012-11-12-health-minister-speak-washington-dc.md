In Washington Mr Ryall will speak at the Commonwealth Fund’s 2012 International Symposium on Health Care Policy where he joins a number of health ministers from Europe and North America.

A major theme of the symposium is how different health systems are responding to the tight financial times.

Mr Ryall will also have discussions with President Obama’s Secretary of Health Kathleen Sebelius. 

Mr Ryall also has discussions scheduled at the World Bank headquarters in Washington DC and a number of portfolio related meetings in New York.
