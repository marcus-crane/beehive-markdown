Justice Minister Judith Collins today welcomed the passing of the Lawyers and Conveyancers Amendment Bill to amend the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006.

Ms Collins says the principal set of amendments to the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006 restores the rank of Queen’s Counsel.

“I am very pleased the rank of Queen’s Counsel has been restored, recognising the special relationship with the Crown for New Zealand’s pre-eminent law practitioners.

“Future appointments to Queen’s Counsel will be restricted to barristers sole, except in recognition of extraordinary contributions to the field of law, preserving the necessary independence and objectivity of Queen’s Counsel,” Ms Collins said.

The legislation also makes several technical improvements to the processes of the Lawyers and Conveyancers Disciplinary Tribunal, and the Legal Complaints Review Office.

A separate amendment provides for the Dean of the Law School at the Auckland University of Technology to join the membership of the Council of Legal Education.

This will enable the Dean to contribute to the work of the Council in setting the qualification and educational requirements for candidates for admission as barristers and solicitors of the High Court of New Zealand.
