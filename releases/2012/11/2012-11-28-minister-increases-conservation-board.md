Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson is increasing the size of the Taranaki/Whanganui Conservation Board from eight members to ten.

“Two additional members will increase the current knowledge, experience and skill base the board,” Ms Wilkinson says.

“This region has some of our most diverse and stunning conservation areas in the country.

“By increasing the board by two members this will help with the significant work starting shortly on developing the Tongariro Whanganui Taranaki Conservation Management Strategy and the review of the Egmont National Park Management Plan.”

Nominations open on 28th of November 2012 and close on 25 January 2013.

Appointments will take effect from 1 July 2013 for a term of up to three years.

Appointees must have a genuine and proven interest in conservation. People who live within the Taranaki/Whanganui Conservation Board region will receive preference.
