Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will travel to Laos on Sunday for the 9th Asia Europe Meeting (ASEM) summit in Vientiane.

Discussions among the 51 ASEM nations will focus on pressing economic and political issues, and on ways to enhance cooperation between Asia and Europe.

Mr McCully will also attend bilateral meetings with ASEM counterparts.

Following the summit, Mr McCully will visit Hanoi to meet his Vietnamese counterpart HE Pham Binh Minh.

Mr McCully will also meet a number of other political leaders to discuss the bilateral relationship as well as regional and international issues.

"I look forward to again meeting with the Vietnamese leadership.  Viet Nam is an increasingly important regional partner for New Zealand and we share a wide range of bilateral political, trade and economic interests," Mr McCully says.
