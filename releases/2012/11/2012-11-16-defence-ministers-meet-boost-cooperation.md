Australian Minister for Defence Stephen Smith and New Zealand Minister of Defence Dr Jonathan Coleman met today in Perth for the Annual Australia-New Zealand Defence Ministers meeting.

The Ministers shared perspectives on regional and global security issues, identified areas of further practical Defence cooperation and acknowledged the ultimate sacrifice made by Australian and New Zealand defence personnel in Afghanistan.

Strengthening the Australia-New Zealand Defence Relationship

The Ministers considered the progress of implementation of the 2011 Review of the Australia New Zealand Defence Relationship which they endorsed in January 2012.

Ministers agreed to deepen practical cooperation by:

Increasing collaboration between the two Navies regarding sealift and afloat support. They agreed to a mutual sealift cooperation programme. This will allow for cross crewing of Royal Australian Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy vessels and afloat support to each other’s fleets.
