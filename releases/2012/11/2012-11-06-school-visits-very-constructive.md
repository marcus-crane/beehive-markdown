Education Minister Hekia Parata says her engagement with schools proposed for closure or merger in greater Christchurch has so far been extremely thoughtful and constructive.

Ms Parata has offered to visit all the schools proposed for closure or merger in greater Christchurch.  Of the 37 schools the Minister wrote to, 35 have taken her up on her offer.

Ms Parata visited 12 schools last week and will return to Christchurch today for the remainder of the week to meet with the other 23 schools.

“I would to like to thank parents, schools and their communities for taking the time to meet with me. The engagement so far has been extremely worthwhile in that it has been very thoughtful and constructive.

“I cannot stress enough that we want to get this right so if parents and school communities have other ideas about what they want to see for their children in their communities, then we want to hear them. This is genuine consultation.

“Our Government has committed $1 billion to rebuilding the education sector in greater Christchurch over the next 10 years.  It’s not simply about putting back what was there, but focusing on what can be done to achieve better outcomes for children.”;

Of the 215 schools across greater Christchurch, 13 schools are proposed for closure and 18 for merger.  It is also proposed five Aranui schools will form a new Year 1–13 campus and two Banks Peninsula schools will become attached to the Akaroa Area School while remaining on their own sites.  

“This is an opportunity for greater Christchurch to have better schools than they had before, to create brand new 21st century learning environments, to consider new ideas like shared facilities to ensure children get the best possible education.”

The Ministry of Education will be hosting a series of design forums over the coming month which will allow parents, children and school communities to come up with ideas around what proposed new schools might look like. The forums are scheduled for the week of November 19 and will be advertised in the Christchurch Press and on the Shaping Education website. The Ministry of Education will also have a stand at this year’s A&P Show where the community can discuss what a modern learning environment might look like and provide their comments.
