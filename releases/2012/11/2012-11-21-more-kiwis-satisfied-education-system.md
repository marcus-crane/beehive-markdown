Education Minister Hekia Parata says the Government’s unrelenting focus on raising achievement for all children has played a key role in the increase in New Zealanders satisfied with the New Zealand education system.

The latest *Kiwis Count* survey, released today by the State Services Commission, shows an improvement in the number of people satisfied with the education system.

The report shows that New Zealanders have given a satisfaction rating of 77 points out of 100 for the education provided by a state or state integrated public school, up five points from 2009.

Kiwis have also given a 77 out of 100 rating to the performance of kindergartens, up 4 points from 2007, and a rating of 70 out of 100 for satisfaction with the Education Review Office or early childhood reports.

“This Government is working to make sure all our kids get a better education and these results show we are heading in the right direction,’’ says Ms Parata.

“We have an education system that is among the best in the world.  Four out of five kids are successfully getting the qualifications they need from school and we must celebrate their success and the teachers who make that possible every day. But our Government’s education plan is about getting five out of five.  We want *all* our kids to leave school with the skills they need to reach their potential in the modern economy.

“We have set Better Public Service targets of 98 per cent of all schools entrants having participated in early childhood education by 2016 and 85 per cent of all 18 years olds having achieved NCEA Level 2 or an equivalent qualification by 2017 and are working hard towards achieving those.

“Education can make a two-fold contribution to our country.  It builds our social and cultural strength, and our productivity that’s why we are keen to see all children succeed.’’

The *Kiwis Count* survey measures New Zealanders’ satisfaction with 42 frequently used public services. The survey findings are based on the experiences of 1,161 New Zealanders who completed the survey between April 2012 and September 2012.
