Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew today announced the recipients of the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Fellowships for 2013.

The Trust helps New Zealanders from all walks of life to travel overseas and bring back new insights and understanding that will enrich their community and, ultimately, New Zealand as a whole. 

“I congratulate all of this year’s Fellows and wish them successful and productive trips,” Mrs Goodhew said.

“These fellowships are more than a travel grant. They widen an individual’s horizons in such a way that he or she grows in confidence, knowledge, authority and ambition. They return with inspiration and networks that support and develop their leadership in their chosen field.” 

For 2013, the Trust has awarded a total of $72,000 to twelve Fellows, including:

- Hilary Boyd, who will investigate how various international healthcare organisations use experience based co-design, an emerging methodology,  to improve patient experiences of health care and overall health service;
- Cathy Tracey, who will travel to the United Kingdom and Denmark to engage with women and groups in the construction industry. The insights Cathy gains will be used to develop programmes that support women already in the construction industry and encourage more women into a construction career in New Zealand; and
- Takerei Norton, who will travel to Norway, Sweden and Finland to learn from the Sami University College and the Sami Parliaments. Their innovative methods of distributing traditional Sami knowledge for place-names, flora and fauna provide opportunities for Takerei to investigate methodologies and processes that can be applied by iwi nationally.
