Five high-achieving young Pacific New Zealanders have taken out this year’s Prime Minister’s Pacific Youth Awards – an initiative which recognises outstanding achievement among young leaders.

Prime Minister John Key says the winners have all shone academically, and have made significant contributions to their schools and communities.

“Today’s awards recipients are young people all New Zealanders can be proud of – for their determination to succeed, their hard work and the roles they play as mentors and leaders of their peers,” says Mr Key.

“These awards consistently attract a high calibre of applicants, which shows just how talented this country’s young people are. I congratulate all of today’s winners and wish them all the best for their future endeavours.”

In addition to the four awards offered in 2011, this year sees the introduction of the Vodafone Mobiles4Good award – a $5000 prize, plus support from Vodafone, to undertake a research project focusing on using mobile technology for the benefit of a community.

The award winners are:

- University of Auckland Leadership Award – Karina Kaufusi, 20, Auckland
- Weta Workshop Creativity Award – Masuaga Pati AhSue, 23, Auckland
- Cogita Inspiration Award – Barney Koneferenisi, 18, Auckland
- Air New Zealand Innovation Award – Ranamila Joji Chute, 18, Auckland
- Vodafone NZ Foundation Mobiles4Good Award – Douglas Quensell, 23, Auckland.

“The winners all have bright futures ahead of them, and are great examples of the ambition and potential New Zealand’s young people possess,” says Mr Key.
