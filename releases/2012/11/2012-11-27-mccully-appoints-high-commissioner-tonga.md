Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced the appointment of career diplomat Mark Talbot as High Commissioner to Tonga.

“Tonga is New Zealand’s closest independent neighbour and we work closely on a number of key matters, especially in relation to the Pacific Islands Forum,” Mr McCully says.

“Mr Talbot’s trade negotiations skills and experience supporting two successful Pacific Islands Forums will prove invaluable.”

Mr Talbot is currently Counsellor at the New Zealand High Commission in Canberra. He has previously served at the New Zealand mission to the European Union and as Private Secretary to the United Kingdom Cabinet Secretary.
