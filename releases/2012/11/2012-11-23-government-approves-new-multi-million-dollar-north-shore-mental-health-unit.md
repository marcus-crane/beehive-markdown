The National Government has approved a new $25 million inpatient mental health unit at North Shore Hospital.

“The new mental health unit will be welcomed by the community and the new facility will provide better services for patients and their families,” says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“The current Taharoto unit is an old maternity hospital and is no longer fit for purpose. There are a number of issues with the building including a lack of space, poor layout, and no ability to properly segregate male and female patients.

“The new unit will not only be larger, with seven extra beds, the doctors and nurses working in the unit will be involved in the design to ensure it is more user friendly for patients and their families.”

Local MP Maggie Barry announced the project, on behalf of Mr Ryall, during a visit to the DHB yesterday.

Building is expected to begin middle of next year, and take around 18 months to complete.

The government is also about to request proposals to build and operate a new secure youth forensic unit as part of a $33 million investment over four years to improve mental health services for youth offenders.
