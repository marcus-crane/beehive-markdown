Investment in science and innovation will be a key focus of talks between senior representatives from six countries with small advanced economies this week, says Science and Innovation Minster Steven Joyce.

The two-day forum, which is being opened tomorrow morning by Mr Joyce, is being attended by representatives from Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Israel, Singapore and New Zealand.

“Participants will work on how our countries can best position themselves for growth, in particular by developing and harnessing the power of innovation,” says Mr Joyce.

“Small advanced nations like New Zealand face similar challenges and opportunities in an increasingly inter-connected and competitive global economy. This forum is an exciting opportunity for us to share experiences and strategies.

“New Zealand representatives will brief the forum on the Government’s work to increase investment in R&D and the work being done to better link businesses with scientists and help grow our high-tech manufacturing sector.

“New Zealand needs to make faster progress on commercialising our ideas. This is a great opportunity to learn from the experience of other small advanced economies,” says Mr Joyce.

The Small Advanced Economies meeting is being jointly led by the Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor Sir Peter Gluckman, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.
