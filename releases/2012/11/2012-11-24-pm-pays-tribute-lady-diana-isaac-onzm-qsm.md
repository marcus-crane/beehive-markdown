Prime Minister John Key says his thoughts are with the family and friends of Lady Diana Isaac, who died peacefully last night at home.

“Lady Diana’s contribution to Canterbury and New Zealand was truly remarkable. From her early philanthropic work with her late husband Neil, right up until the time of her death, she was an outstanding champion for Canterbury, the arts and conservation,” says Mr Key.

Lady Diana, who was born in Devonshire in England, met her New Zealand husband Neil when they both served in the British Army at the end of World War II. They married in India and settled in New Zealand in 1950 where Sir Neil and Lady Diana founded the Isaac Construction Company.

The plantings they made on their quarrying operations eventually became the 1100 hectare Peacock Springs Conservation Park.

“Lady Isaac was also a huge patron of the arts and her legacy will endure through the Isaac Theatre Royal, the Isaac Centre for Nature Conservation, and the creation of scholarships at both Lincoln and Canterbury Universities.

“It is difficult to imagine anyone who was more generous or worked harder for the people of Canterbury.

“Lady Diana will be missed immensely but her decades of philanthropy will be enjoyed for generations to come,” says Mr Key.
