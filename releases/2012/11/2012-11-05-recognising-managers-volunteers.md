Without people to manage and coordinate the many volunteers who work in New Zealand every day, volunteering would be harder to do and less effective, says Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew.

Monday 5 November has been set aside to mark the work of managers of volunteers and to recognise their skills in coordination, support, training, administration and recruitment.

“It is important that public and community sector organisations take time to recognise the contribution managers of volunteers make to the smooth running of their volunteer programmes,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“These people have a unique role in looking after volunteers’ needs and ensuring well-run volunteer programmes. They make sure volunteers have a valuable, rewarding experience and stay involved in their organisations. This takes a special set of leadership and management skills.”

Mrs Goodhew said she was enormously thankful that communities can benefit from the work of the skilled, dedicated, professional people who manage volunteers.

“They ensure that community support services, emergency services, sporting and cultural events, and environmental projects provided by volunteer organisations continue to happen.”

Mrs Goodhew also congratulated Volunteering New Zealand for publication of its *Best Practice Guidelines for Volunteer-Involving Organisations* which are to be launched to mark International Volunteer Managers Day.

“These guidelines are an important resource for all organisations that involve volunteers, including public sector organisations that run volunteer programmes. They will help organisations get the best out of their volunteering programmes and ensure their organisations are attractive and rewarding places to volunteer.”
