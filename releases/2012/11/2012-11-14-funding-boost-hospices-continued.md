Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew today announced that the current Boost Hospice Care funding will be rolled over for a further two years.

“The $15 million per year funding will now continue to 2015 to help hospices cover a shortfall brought about by a challenging fundraising environment, increasing demand for services and rising costs,” said Mrs Goodhew.

Introduced in 2009, the Boost Hospice Care funding gave hospices a badly needed additional $60 million over the four years to June 2013 to help them expand care and services and meet financial challenges.

Hospices are partly funded through District Health Boards, with additional funding sourced from community fundraising. The Boost Hospice Care funding increased the proportion of average hospice funding provided by the Government from 50 percent to 70 percent.

“That investment, which formed part of the Government’s election promises in 2008, has secured this vital service for our communities,” Mrs Goodhew said.

“Hospices provide terminally ill people and their families with the services and support they need. In many communities, hospices provide palliative care in the home, as well as at in-patient facilities.

“Rolling this extra funding over for a further two years will enable hospices to continue delivering high quality services to those who need them.  We are in fiscally constrained times, but it is critical we provide hospices with financial certainty.”
