Trade Minister Tim Groser will meet with his Australian counterpart at the annual Closer Economic Relations (CER) Forum tomorrow in Canberra.

The forum provides an opportunity for New Zealand and Australia to review and progress the bilateral trade and economic relationship. 

“On both sides of the Tasman there is a high level of political commitment to strengthening and deepening our relationship, and this meeting will be important in helping us progress the single economic market agenda.”

Mr Groser says ministers will be discussing a wide range of shared issues – domestic, as well as regional and global.

“Australia remains New Zealand's most important partner and we cooperate closely on many regional and global trade and economic issues. The forum provides a valuable opportunity to exchange views on topical bilateral trade and economic issues as well as look ahead to the 30th anniversary of CER in 2013.”

Australia will be represented at the forum by the Hon Craig Emerson, Minister for Trade and Hon David Bradbury, Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation.
