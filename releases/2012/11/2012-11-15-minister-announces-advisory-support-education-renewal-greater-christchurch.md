Education Minister Hekia Parata has today announced the appointment of Karen Sewell as an advisor and the membership of the three advisory boards, who will continue to engage with greater Christchurch on the Government’s education renewal programme.

Former principal and Secretary for Education Karen Sewell will work directly with school communities to ensure their concerns and aspirations are being heard.

“I am delighted that Ms Sewell has been appointed to this role. Her in-depth knowledge of the education system and strong relationships with the sector will be invaluable, ’’ says Ms Parata.

“Ms Sewell will provide independent advice to me as I consider schools’ proposals. Her focus will be getting the best outcomes for children.’’

Ms Sewell will report directly to Ms Parata and the Secretary for Education Lesley Longstone. The role will operate until the end of 2013.

Ms Parata also announced the members of the three advisory boards who will provide on-going community input and expertise to the renewal process.

“The three boards: the Education Advisory Board, Mātauraka Mahaanui – the Waitaha Advisory Board, and the Pasifika Advisory Board, bring together representatives from education and community organisations whom all have a high level of expertise and understanding of the needs of priority learners and different communities in greater Christchurch. They will provide expert advice on the renewal programme.’’

Today’s announcements follow the Ministry of Education’s appointment of Christchurch Boys’ High School Headmaster, Trevor McIntyre, as an executive advisor to the greater Christchurch Education Renewal Programme.

“On-going community engagement and detailed discussions with schools and other education services and bodies will be a key feature of the work ahead,’’ Ms Parata says.

“We want to get this right and achieve the best education for the children of Christchurch.’’
