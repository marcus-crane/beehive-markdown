Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today expressed disappointment that the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) deferred agreement on a proposal for a marine protected area (MPA) in the Ross Sea region.

Mr McCully says many of those interested in this topic have underestimated the challenge of securing agreement from 25 different countries with 25 different agendas.

"I have consistently said that it would be difficult to find a way of satisfying the range of interests represented around the CCAMLR table,” Mr McCully says.

“However, I very much welcome the fact that New Zealand and the US have managed to come together with an amended MPA proposal that holds a good chance of eventually finding acceptance.

"I am disappointed that some countries, which do not yet share our view on the priority that conservation interests should attract in the Ross Sea, have held out against agreement at this stage.

“But I am pleased that members have agreed to an additional meeting next July to give further consideration to the NZ/US proposal.  It is clear that we have considerable work to do before that meeting if the joint proposal is to get across the line, but New Zealand is now well placed to play a leadership role in advancing the proposal."
