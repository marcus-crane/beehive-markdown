Ethnic Affairs Minister Judith Collins has congratulated the Office of Ethnic Affairs (OEA) team for its innovative new website at  [www.ethnicaffairs.govt.nz](http://www.ethnicaffairs.govt.nz).

“The new website is an excellent example of how agencies can harness new technologies and social media to educate, inform and connect ethnic Kiwis,” Ms Collins says.

The OEA website builds on the foundations of the previous site and offers visitors an enriched social-media experience. The front page displays OEA’s latest Youtube video, Flickr photos and the most recent updates from the OEA Facebook page.

Ms Collins says users will find it easier to navigate information, keep up-to-date with cultural events and connect with members of their ethnic communities living in New Zealand.

“By making the most of the opportunities that new technologies offer, the Office of Ethnic Affairs is expanding its reach, doing more with less and ensuring better public services.”

Ms Collins will also contribute a monthly blog entry to the website.
