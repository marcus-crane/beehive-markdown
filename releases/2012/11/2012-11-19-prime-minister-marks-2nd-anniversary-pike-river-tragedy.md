Prime Minister John Key says his thoughts are with the people of the West Coast as New Zealand remembers the second anniversary of the Pike River mining tragedy.

“There is no comfort in my words for the families of those who died, as they are still living this tragedy day after day.

“However it is fitting and right that we remember that it was this day two years ago that 29 men lost their lives,” says Mr Key.

The explosion at Pike River Mine, northeast of Greymouth, occurred at 3.44 on the afternoon of 19 November 2010.

“I am thinking of the families and the people of the West Coast today. New Zealand has immense sympathy for their continuing grief.”
