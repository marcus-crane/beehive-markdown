The National-led Government is making it easier for disabled and older New Zealanders to live independently at home longer by increasing home and community support services.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says 14.4 million hours of home and community support were provided to disabled and older New Zealanders last financial year – 2.5 million more hours than four years ago.

“These extra support hours are used to help people with activities such as showering, dressing, and preparing a meal,” says Mr Ryall.

“Funding for home and community support services has also significantly increased from $271 million in 2007/08 to $359 million last financial year. 

“Ensuring elderly and disabled people receive the care they need at home and in their community helps reduce avoidable emergency department visits, hospital readmissions and early placement in long-term care,” says Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew.

“Increased home and community support services help to provide the right care, at the right time, in the right place which is a priority for this government.

“DHBs’ funding for home and community support has increased. DHBs however must manage local demand within this budget,” said Mr Ryall.
