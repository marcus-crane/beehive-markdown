Hon Kate Wilkinson has resigned as Labour Minister, effective today, following today’s release of the report from the Royal Commission on the Pike River Coal Mine tragedy.

“The Pike River Mine tragedy of 19 November 2010 happened on my watch as Minister of Labour,” says Ms Wilkinson.

“While reports from the former Department of Labour did not advise me of concerns about their ability to administer the health and safety legislation, 29 men lost their lives in this tragedy.

“I feel it is the right and honourable thing to do,” Ms Wilkinson says.

The Government’s response to the recommendations will be released shortly.

Hon Chris Finlayson has been appointed by Prime Minister John Key as acting Minister of Labour.

Ms Wilkinson retains her Ministerial warrant and other portfolios.

No further comment will be made at this stage.
