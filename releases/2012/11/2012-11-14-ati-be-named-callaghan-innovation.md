The name of the new institute set up by the Government to help firms in the high-tech manufacturing and services sectors will be *Callaghan Innovation*, Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce announced today.

Speaking at a function at Parliament, Mr Joyce said naming the new Advanced Technology Institute after the late Sir Paul Callaghan was recognition of his passion for commercialising scientific research.

“Sir Paul was one of New Zealand’s greatest scientists. He believed that science was not only about great ideas but about getting value from those ideas through innovation and commercialisation. His views reflect the ambition of the ATI and we are grateful to the Callaghan family for allowing us to name the new institute in his honour,” Mr Joyce said.

*Callaghan Innovation* will have operations in the Auckland, Wellington (including Hutt Valley) and Canterbury regions.

“*Callaghan Innovation* will be a one-stop shop for business innovation support whether it be in science, engineering, design or technology. It will be a high-tech HQ for New Zealand businesses,” Mr Joyce says.

“It will better connect firms with innovation and business development expertise within the organisation and across New Zealand’s Crown Research Institutes, universities, polytechnics, and other research organisations.

“We are right now going through both the detailed design and business case for use of the funding for the organisation. *Callaghan Innovation* will focus on growing innovation skills in business, providing innovation services to business – including technical services and shared facilities like the Auckland Food Bowl – providing research capability, national measurement and standards work, and managing of business R&D co-funding.

“It will focus on industries with high growth potential such as food and beverage manufacturing, agri-technologies, digital technologies, health technologies, therapeutics, and high-value wood products.

“*Callaghan Innovation* and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise will work together to ensure alignment, that there is ‘no wrong door’ for businesses to access Government support, and to provide an integrated suite of services from innovation to internationalisation.”

The ATI Establishment Board is preparing for a 1 February start and legislation establishing *Callaghan Innovation* is due to be passed by Parliament in December.
