Housing New Zealand has met its target of completing repairs to 212 earthquake-damaged houses in Christchurch by the end of October. 

“This is a huge achievement in just six months and I congratulate the corporation. They have done a fantastic job,” Housing Minister Phil Heatley said today.

“Many of these houses were severely damaged. It’s been a great effort by the corporation and its contractors and sub-contractors – the builders, plumbers, painters, gardeners, roofers and electricians.

“Even better, properties have already been matched to tenants, with 105 families placed in refurbished houses across the city. Another 30 families have accepted offers and a further 38 have been matched to prospective tenants.  This is great news for families who had to leave their homes last year,” Mr Heatley said.

The work was part of stage one of the corporation's programme to repair or rebuild a significant part of its housing stock in Canterbury and has been achieved not only on time but within the $19 million budget.

Other corporation projects in Christchurch include building 200-350 new houses on land it owns around Christchurch, the Minister said. The first round of tenders has closed and construction of the first homes through this programme is expected to start in mid to late 2013.

This is in addition to housing provided by the mixed tenure development initiative announced recently, which will start with the corporation's property at 399 Manchester Street. 

The corporation is also providing 17 of its houses on TC3 land for a series of trials to find quicker and more affordable options for repairing property foundations, to start within the next two months.
