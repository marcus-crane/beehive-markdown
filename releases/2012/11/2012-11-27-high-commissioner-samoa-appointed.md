Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today named New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to Samoa as career diplomat Jackie Frizelle.

“New Zealand and Samoa have a strong and unique relationship – one that was cemented 50 years ago with the Treaty of Friendship,” Mr McCully says.

“Ms Frizelle has extensive experience in the Pacific and will bring an impressive mix of strategic and practical skills to her new role.”

Ms Frizelle most recently served as Director of Strategy and Effectiveness for the New Zealand Aid Programme at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
