Climate Change Issues Minister Tim Groser has welcomed the passage of a Bill that will improve the operation and administration of the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), while supporting the Government’s economic growth priorities more effectively.

Mr Groser told Parliament that the Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading and Other Matters) Amendment Bill strikes the right balance between continuing to do our fair share and ensuring the cost of the ETS does not impact unreasonably on New Zealanders.

“Given the global economic climate, the Government needed to make tough decisions to not artificially inflate the short term cost of the ETS to households and businesses.

“These amendments will assist New Zealand in meeting its current and future international climate change obligations, ensure this is achieved at least cost to the domestic economy and provide the flexibility necessary to accommodate developments between now and 2015,” Mr Groser says.
