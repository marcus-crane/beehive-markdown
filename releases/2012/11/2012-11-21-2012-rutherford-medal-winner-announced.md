Professor Margaret Brimble has been announced the 2012 Rutherford Medal winner by Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce.

Professor Brimble, from Auckland University’s Department of Chemistry, was awarded the prestigious scientific honour during the New Zealand Research Honours Dinner at Auckland Museum tonight.

A medicinal chemist, who designs new chemicals for the treatment of disease, she is being recognised for her world-leading contributions to the synthesis of bioactive natural products and novel peptides.

Minister Joyce described Professor Brimble’s contribution to science in New Zealand as “truly immense”.

“Margaret’s work in the medical field has wide-ranging applications, from fighting cancer and treating Alzheimer’s, to the development of a new drug for traumatic brain injury funded by the US Army.

“She is widely respected in the international science community and is an important role model and mentor for many young Kiwi scientists. She established New Zealand’s first interdisciplinary Bachelor of Science Honours degree in Medicinal Chemistry, and has supervised more than 100 graduate students - including 45 PhDs.

“Margaret has a passion for New Zealand and is committed to ensuring our science and innovation system fulfils its potential and delivers real benefits for the country. She is the embodiment of what the Rutherford Medal represents, and it is my pleasure to award it to her.”

The Rutherford Medal was created in 1991 by the Government.  It acknowledges those who have made exceptional contributions across a lifetime of research to science and technology in New Zealand, both in the fields of research and the promotion of public awareness and understanding of science.

Following the creation of the Prime Minister’s Science Prizes in 2009, the Rutherford Medal is now awarded by the Royal Society, along with a $100,000 prize provided by the Government.
