Up to 30 Korean War veterans will be funded to attend the 60th anniversary commemorations of the Korean War Armistice in July next year, Veterans Affairs Minister Nathan Guy has announced today.

“This will be a chance for veterans to pay tribute to their fellow servicemen and women who served New Zealand in this conflict. It is an important way of honouring those who made the ultimate sacrifice.

“All expenses will be covered for those selected to attend the events in Korea, including medical care.

“Depending on the level of interest, a ballot may be needed to allocate places. This is the same policy as for 60th commemorations of the Second World War, and priority would be given to those who haven’t received Government support to attend previous services in Korea,” says Mr Guy.

As with other commemorative events, veterans will need to meet medical and fitness criteria to ensure they are well enough to travel as part of the delegation and take part in the events.

“We will also be holding a New Zealand-based commemoration for those unable to attend,” says Mr Guy.

New Zealand was one of the first nations to provide support for the Korean War (1950-53), with roughly 4,700 personnel serving in Kayforce, and a further 1,300 Naval personnel also involved.

Forty-five personnel lost their lives in the seven years New Zealand was involved in the conflict and its aftermath.

Veterans of the Korean War wishing to register their interest in attending should contact Veterans’ Affairs New Zealand by freephone on 0800 483 8372 or by emailing [veterans@xtra.co.nz](mailto:veterans@xtra.co.nz).
