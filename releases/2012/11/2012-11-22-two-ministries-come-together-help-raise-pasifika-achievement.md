A new initiative aimed at raising achievement among Pasifika students has been launched by the Government today in Auckland.

The Pasifika Education Plan 2013-2017, which has been developed by the Education and Pacific Island Affairs Ministries sets out how ministries can work together with other agencies, schools and communities to help raise achievement among Pasifika students.

Education Minister Hekia Parata launched the Plan while visiting schools, meeting parents, students and their families, and the wider Pacific community groups all of who participated in the Plan’s consultation engagement.

“By prioritising the improvement of Pasifika kids in both Ministries we can now have a Plan ultimately centred on the student. It embraces Government’s education and Pacific Island priorities to drive measureable gain in Pasifika education participation and achievement from early childhood \[89 per cent – 98 per cent in 2016] to NCEA 2 \[63 per cent – 85 per cent in 2017]. In early childhood in particular, we are keen to see Pasifika language and culture nurtured through linking with communities’ speakers and practitioners,” says Ms Parata.

“The Ministry of Education will be closely monitoring the implementation of the Plan with the support and participation of the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs. Achievements will be measured and transparent and I expect to see increased Pacific participation meeting the ambitious goals set by Government. We owe it to our kids to work together, and work harder, in lifting their achievement.”

Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce says, “This Plan puts Pasifika kids, their families and communities at the centre of the education system where they can demand better outcomes.

“By 2030, 25 per cent of Auckland’s job entrants will be Pasifika. Successful Pasifika people can make a significant contribution to our economy and education is the key to realising this potential,” says Mr Joyce.        

The Plan adopts a Pasifika ‘connected' way of working with the community and other educational agencies. This highlights the importance of Pasifika collective partnerships, relationships and responsibilities to improve results for Pasifika children.

“There is no one way of ensuring success because every child is different. I welcome parental and community involvement with their school – the evidence is really clear that where there is a strong two way relationship children will succeed,” says Ms Parata.

Implementing actions raised in the Plan will lift quality early childhood education, strengthening engagement in all areas of learning and raised achievement across the whole education system.

The Plan is the overarching education strategy from which all agencies will work to be held accountable for.

The Ministry of Education alongside the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs, Education Review Office (ERO), Tertiary Education Commission (TEC), New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA), Careers New Zealand, and the New Zealand Teachers Council (NZTC) are all working together on delivering results for all Pasifika learners.
