Further strengthening a primary industries relationship and boosting trade is the focus of a visit to India by Primary Industries Minister David Carter.

“India is a rapidly rising player in the Asia-Pacific region and New Zealand is keen to develop stronger economic and agricultural ties,” Mr Carter says.

The Minister will also travel to Indonesia and Sri Lanka.

In India, Mr Carter will hold discussions with the Agriculture and Trade Ministers and hold a series of primary industry meetings.  He will also be joined by leading representatives of New Zealand’s dairy, meat, horticulture and agri-tech sectors.

“These meetings further strengthen the New Zealand-India bilateral relationship and give our two countries the opportunity to canvass a range of primary industries issues,” says Mr Carter.

“India is one of our top trade negotiating priorities. A successful Free Trade Agreement will help expand businesses and create jobs.”

During the Minister’s visit to Indonesia, he will open the inaugural Joint Working Group on Agriculture in Jakarta and hold a series of trade and agriculture meetings.

“Indonesia is our 10th-largest export market, but there is a lot of room to expand this trade and to further develop the relationship between our two countries.”

Trade and agricultural opportunities will also be top of the agenda during Mr Carter’s visit to Sri Lanka. 

The Minister leaves tomorrow.
