Immigration Minister Nathan Guy has today announced a new agreement with China Southern Airlines to make it easier for high-value Chinese tourists to visit New Zealand.  

“Planned to start from 22 November, Gold and Silver frequent flyer card holders with China Southern Airlines will not have to produce evidence of sufficient funds to support themselves, as long as they can show their flight records over the previous two years.

“This will make the visitor visa process more streamlined. At the same time though, applicants will still require a visa and need to meet health and good character requirements, as well as evidence of onward travel.

“Immigration New Zealand will be carefully monitoring the arrangement and it can be suspended at any time if necessary.

“China is one of New Zealand’s largest tourist markets with around 160,000 visitors coming here last year, contributing around $555 million to the economy. However they tend to stay for shorter periods of time. The aim of this new arrangement is to encourage more high-value tourists to visit and stay here for longer, producing greater economic benefit for New Zealand.

“This group of travellers are considered to be low-risk as they travel regularly for business or leisure.

“This arrangement has similar features to the Approved Destination Status (ADS) scheme which facilitates the travel of organised tour groups from China to New Zealand. The ADS scheme has been in place for over a decade and has been a big success with around a million visitors from China coming to New Zealand on group tours under the ADS scheme so far,” says Mr Guy.

The waiver will not be available to non-Chinese nationals or to those who have never travelled overseas before.
