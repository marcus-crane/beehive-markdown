Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson is seeking proud New Zealanders to stand for their local conservation boards and make a difference in their community.

“Preserving our conservation estate is the responsibility of all New Zealanders, not just the government. Members of local conservation boards get to have a say to help protect their local conservation assets for future generations,” Ms Wilkinson says.

Nominations to all conservation boards are being sought. Vacancies on each board are as follows:

Northland (7), Auckland (6), Waikato (6), East Coast/Bay of Plenty (8), Tongariro/Taupo (5), Taranaki/Whanganui (6), Wellington/Hawke’s Bay (9), Chatham Islands (6), Nelson/Marlborough (4), West Coast Tai Poutini (6), Canterbury Aoraki (5), Otago (6), Southland (5).

Nominations open on 28th of November 2012 and close on 25 January 2013.

Appointments will take effect from 1 July 2013 for a term of up to three years.

Appointees must have a genuine and proven interest in conservation. Preference will be given to people who live within the board area they are nominated for.

Appointments also seek to achieve balance in experience, geographic spread, gender, age and representation of community interests on each board.
