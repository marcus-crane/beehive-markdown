Prime Minister John Key has met Myanmar’s opposition leader, and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi.

It follows a meeting between Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully and Aung San Suu Kyi earlier this year.

“For many years Aung San Suu Kyi led efforts to bring democratic reform to Myanmar, and she has made great personal sacrifices on behalf of the country’s people,” says Mr Key.

“Her ability to travel to Oslo in June to receive in person the Nobel Peace Prize was both a tremendous personal tribute to her, and reflected how far Myanmar has come since she was released from house arrest.

“I was pleased to reaffirm to Aung San Suu Kyi New Zealand’s support as Myanmar continues to promote the democratic and economic reforms she has dedicated so much of her life to achieving.”

The Prime Minister concludes his official visit to Myanmar today, returning to New Zealand on 24 November.
