Prime Minister John Key today announced a $7 million aid package to Myanmar.

Mr Key made the announcement following a meeting with Myanmar’s President Thein Sein in the country’s capital city Naypyitaw.

“Over the next five years we will be investing $6 million in building Myanmar’s dairy farming capabilities through our aid programme. This will complement the funding we already make available for scholarships, and the English Language Training for Officials programme,” says Mr Key.

“New Zealand will also provide a $1 million package of humanitarian assistance in the Rakhine province, where inter-ethnic violence has led to large numbers of people being forced from their homes.’

During the meeting with President Thein Sein the Mr Key reaffirmed New Zealand’s support for Myanmar’s reintegration into the wider international community.

“Myanmar is going through significant political and economic change to deliver a better future for its people,” says Mr Key. 

“President Thein Sein outlined the major reforms that have taken place in Myanmar over the past year, and the many challenges his country still faces.  He also briefed me on actions taken by the Myanmar government to address the extremely serious situation in the Rakhine province.”

New Zealand is looking to step up its political and diplomatic engagement with Myanmar by establishing a diplomatic presence in Myanmar next year.  The decision has also been made to use the name Myanmar, in recognition of the positive progress made to date in the reform process.
