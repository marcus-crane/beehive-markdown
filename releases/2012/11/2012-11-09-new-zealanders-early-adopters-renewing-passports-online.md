More than 1000 New Zealanders have opted to renew their passports on line since the Department of Internal Affairs launched the service a week ago, and Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain says this is a fantastic response.

“This shows people have confidence in the new technology and are also taking advantage of the lower fees. Thousands more citizens are going to the website to look at the new service and check their eligibility and so I’m confident that online applications will continue to increase as people become aware of the new service,” says Mr Tremain.

“New Zealand is the only country in the world where applicants can complete the entire passport renewal process online.  People can simply renew their adult passport at [www.passports.govt.nz](http://www.passports.govt.nz/).

“Take-up rates for the service are being measured as part of the Government’s drive to improve interactions with government and ensure that an average of 70 per cent of the most common transactions with government are completed electronically by 2017.”

The Passport Online Renewal Service is available for adults over the age of 16, who are renewing their passport at a cost of $124.50.  A full list of eligibility criteria can be found at [www.passports.govt.nz](http://www.passports.govt.nz/).
