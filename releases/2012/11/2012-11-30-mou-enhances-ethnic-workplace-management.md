Ethnic Affairs Minister Judith Collins has welcomed the signing of an MOU between the Office of Ethnic Affairs and the New Zealand Institute of Management (NZIM) to improve the management of our ethnically diverse workplaces.

Ms Collins says the agreement will help New Zealand businesses to manage and promote ethnic diversity in the workplace more effectively.

“New Zealand’s diversity is a very positive force. It has helped us create connections that span the globe, broadened our horizons and enhanced our entrepreneurial spirit,” Ms Collins says.

“This new initiative sets a framework for OEA and the NZIM to work together to improve New Zealand’s leadership and management of our increasingly diverse workplaces.”

Around one in four New Zealanders is now born overseas, with 60 per cent of New Zealand’s workforce growth coming from migrants. By 2021 a quarter of the workforce is expected to have been born overseas.

As part of the agreement, NZIM will work in partnership with OEA to deliver management and leadership workshops to its members.

“The MOU provides managers with practical tools they can use to get the best out of themselves and their staff,” Ms Collins says.

“The workshops will help business leaders manage a diverse workforce more effectively and international students and migrants to integrate successfully into New Zealand’s business environment.”

A number of leading New Zealand businesses have signed up to trial the workshops including Deloitte, Air New Zealand and International Airlines Group.
