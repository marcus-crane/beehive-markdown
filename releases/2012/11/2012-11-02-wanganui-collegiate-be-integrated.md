Education Minister Hekia Parata has today announced the integration of Wanganui Collegiate School into the state network of schools.

“This has been a difficult and drawn out process. Wanganui Collegiate has been working towards integration for the last two years and the Wanganui Collegiate community will be pleased to see a successful outcome.

“As one of New Zealand’s oldest schools Wanganui Collegiate holds an iconic place in the history of education in New Zealand, and integrating the school will ensure it not only continues to be a vibrant part of the Whanganui community, but also that a Collegiate education is available to a wider number of students.

“I trust that past students and families will support Wanganui Collegiate to ensure a strong future.”

From January next year, Wanganui Collegiate will be a part of the state schooling network.   It will continue to offer the same quality education that it is known for, but will have much reduced fees. As an integrated school, the only compulsory fees will be attendance dues. Wanganui Collegiate will also be responsible for its properties.

The school will offer day places, weekly boarding places, and full boarding places, as well as offering opportunities to a number of international students.

Ms Parata said the school was one of the top performing in the Whanganui region.

“One hundred per cent of Year 11 students achieved literacy and numeracy standards last year, and 96 per cent achieved NCEA Level 2.

“I will be expecting the school to share its expertise and facilities with other schools in the Whanganui area,” says Ms Parata.

Wanganui Collegiate School was established in 1852 following a gift of Crown land for a school in Whanganui.  Te Aute College in the Hawkes Bay was established at this same time.  Te Aute College was integrated in 1977.
