Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew today announced the opening of the new funding round for the Community Development Scheme. 

The scheme aims to support communities to build on local strengths and address local issues.

“Through the Community Development Scheme communities get the help and support they need to help themselves.  The fund enables organisations to employ a community development worker who can help communities work together to decide what kinds of projects they need and then bring people in the community together to identify how to make those projects happen,” Mrs Goodhew said.

Applications for the new funding round are invited from community organisations, hapū, and iwi based in Franklin; Gisborne; Greymouth and/or Westland; Mackenzie and/or Timaru; Meremere and/or Waikato and/or Matamata-Piako; Rodney; Rotorua; Stewart Island and/or Invercargill; and Upper Hutt City.

One project will be funded in each area.  During each funding round the specific areas are chosen to make sure funding is well distributed geographically over time.

“Organisations applying for funds must be community based, use a community or hapū development approach and have support from within the community to undertake the project,” said Mrs Goodhew. 

“They must also have the proven capability and procedures to deliver and manage the project effectively.”

Application forms and further information on the Scheme can be found at [www.communitymatters.govt.nz](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz). 

Applications will close on Wednesday 20 March 2013.
