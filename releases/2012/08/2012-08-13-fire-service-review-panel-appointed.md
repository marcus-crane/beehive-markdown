Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain has announced that former Cabinet Minister Paul Swain will head the four person panel to review New Zealand’s fire services.

Other panel members are:

- Jaimes Wood – recently retired Chief Executive of St John New Zealand;
- Peter Drummond – Chairperson of the United Fire Brigades’ Board;
- David Adamson – Chief Executive of Southland District Council.

“The panel was appointed for their mix of skills and experience in fire and other emergency services, financial and business skills, industrial relations and links to the voluntary sector,” says Mr Tremain

The panel will consult key sector organisations, including Police and other emergency services, health and local government and report to the Minister in December.
