Associate Minister of Education John Banks says that the addition of Partnership Schools/Kura Hourua creates another education option for parents to choose from.

"Of course they won't be for everyone but parents should have the opportunity to choose what works for their family,” Mr Banks said.

"This new model allows for a proportion of the staff not to be registered as a teacher.

"This is not the same as not being qualified.

“As it is, teachers registered with the Teachers’ Council are just one of many types of personnel in the existing system. There are already early childhood educators, volunteers, teachers under the Limited Authority to Teach category, tertiary educators, trade courses, and staff at Private Training Establishments that are teaching but are not registered with the Teachers’ Council.

"Our education system works for the majority of our students but not all. We must continue doing well what we have always done well while finding options for those students who are not achieving.

“In striving to aim for success for all we must recognise that one size does not fit all. Partnership Schools/Kura Hourua are simply another choice for parents and learners,” Mr Banks said.
