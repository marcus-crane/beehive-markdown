Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will today meet his counterpart from the Republic of Armenia, Foreign Minister Edward Nalbandian.

Mr McCully and Mr Nalbandian will discuss bilateral relations and issues affecting the Asia-Pacific region.

“This visit is an excellent opportunity to discuss further cooperation between New Zealand and Armenia,” Mr McCully says.

Mr Nalbandian will also meet Speaker of the House Lockwood Smith and Chief Justice Dame Sian Ellis, as well as members of the local Armenian community.

The Republic of Armenia gained independence from the former USSR in 1991, and in recent years has forged links with the European Union through the Eastern Partnership forum.
