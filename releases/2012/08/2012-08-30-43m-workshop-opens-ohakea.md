Another milestone in the upgrade of the Ohakea air base was reached today with the Defence Minister opening the new $43 million aircraft maintenance workshop.

The Air Force Maintenance Support Squadron workshops will house 140 staff in two main buildings and three small ancillary buildings, with a foot print of nearly 13 thousand square metres.

The facility will provide all the aviation engineering for the new NH-90 and A109 helicopters as well as providing engineering support for other Royal New Zealand Air Force aircraft for work such as structural maintenance and hydraulic component overhauls.

“The new workshop is an excellent facility which will serve the RNZAF well. It is further evidence of the government’s commitment to providing the infrastructure to support the new and upgraded aircraft coming into service,” said Dr Coleman.

Other developments at Ohakea, as part of Project Takitini, have seen the new No 3 Squadron Hangar and the Helicopter Simulation Centre constructed as well as a new duty centre, main gate and perimeter fence being built.

Design work is currently underway for a new Air Movements terminal and a new In-Flight ration store.

“The old work shops were no longer fit for purpose. The arrival of the new helicopter fleet served to highlight the need for such a purpose built workshop,” said Dr Coleman.

“This facility will also service the broader NZ Defence Force by performing some engineering functions for the Army and Navy,” he said.

The main workshop has been designed with a Five Green Star standard for including lighting efficiencies, solar water heating and water recycling.
