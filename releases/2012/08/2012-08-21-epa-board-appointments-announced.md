Environment Minister Amy Adams today announced a new appointment to the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) Board.

"I am pleased to announce that Dr Kevin Thompson has been appointed deputy chair of the board. Dr Thompson has a wealth of knowledge and experience that will be extremely beneficial," Ms Adams says.

Dr Thompson was chief executive of Opus, a New Zealand infrastructure consultancy. He is skilled in governance and has knowledge of New Zealand's environmental management system.

"I am also pleased to confirm that Anake Goodall has been re-appointed as a board member.

“Mr Goodall has already made a significant contribution to the board and I am keen that we continue to receive his guidance and leadership.”

Mr Goodall was the chief executive of Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu, and has extensive experience as manager of Ngâi Tahu’s historical settlement process and as an independent consultant to a number of Mâori tribes.

"I would also like to take the opportunity to thank Richard Woods, who is standing down from his role as deputy board chair.

Mr Woods was the chair of the Environmental Risk Management Authority (ERMA), one of the agencies that formed the EPA, from 2008 to 2011.

“He was a key influence during the transition of the ERMA to the EPA. The EPA has gained significantly from his experience and I am grateful for his valuable contribution.”
