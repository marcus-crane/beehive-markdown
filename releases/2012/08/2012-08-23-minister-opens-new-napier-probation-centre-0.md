Corrections Minister Anne Tolley has today officially opened the new Community Probation Centre in Napier.

Staff at the new centre will be responsible for managing around 680 offenders every year, who are serving community sentences and orders in Napier.

“Community Probation Centres play an important role in protecting the public and reducing reoffending,” says Mrs Tolley.

“We have a target of reducing reoffending by 25 per cent by 2017, leading to 18,500 fewer victims of crime every year, and the staff at the new centre will be at the very heart of this.

“Probation staff work with a wide range of offenders – from young first time offenders who might be doing community work through to high-risk offenders coming out of prison on parole after serving very long sentences.

“Officers not only make sure that these offenders comply with their sentences, they also actively work with them to improve their family relationships, get help for alcohol and drug problems, hold down a job and encourage them to turn away from a life of crime.

“I also want to acknowledge and thank the large number of community groups who attended today’s opening, and who play such an important part in reducing reoffending and making our communities safer.”
