A National War Memorial Park in central Wellington will be the Government’s key project to commemorate the Centenary of the First World War and the centrepiece of Anzac Day commemorations in 2015.

Prime Minister John Key announced the project at the National War Memorial today, along with Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee, Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Chris Finlayson, Veterans’ Affairs Minister Nathan Guy and Wellington Mayor, Celia Wade-Brown.

“The National War Memorial Park will be a significant legacy to commemorate the centenary of Anzac Day,” says Mr Key.

“This will be an enduring reminder to our children and their children, so they can better understand our past.”

The National War Memorial Park will combine the national memorial precinct, including the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior, the National War Memorial, the Hall of Memories and the National Carillion.

These are currently divided by State Highway 1 and will be brought together by undergrounding the state highway on Buckle Street between Tory and Taranaki Streets in Wellington.

“It will give this country the setting it deserves to commemorate more than 300,000 New Zealanders who have served their country.”

The Australian Government is also planning a memorial to Australian servicemen on this site and further memorials may be developed over time within the park space.

**Background information**

\- In 1919 the Government approved the erection of the National War Memorial on this prominent site in Wellington. It had been used as a pa by Te Ati Awa and for military purposes by the Government since 1847.

\- The original intention was to create a boulevard from the Memorial to the waterfront but the current precinct has become isolated over time and is now divided by State Highway 1.

\- The Government has established a WW100 project office to lead and coordinate commemorations for the centenary of the First World War. A Panel was announced in July 2012 of trusted New Zealanders to guide and inform Government activities. A website has been established at [http://ww100.govt.nz/](http://ww100.govt.nz/)
