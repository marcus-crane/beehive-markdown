Finance Minister Bill English leaves next Monday for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) annual meeting of finance ministers in Moscow later in the week.

The meeting, on 30 August, will include sessions on the global economic outlook and its impact on Asia and the Pacific, along with financial policy measures to address the impact of natural disasters.

Mr English will also hold bilateral meetings with several finance ministers, including those of Russia, Indonesia and Mexico, as well as the financial secretary of Hong Kong.

“Most of the Asia-Pacific region is generally in better economic shape than other parts of the world, where countries are facing significant ongoing challenges linked to too much debt built up over many years,” Mr English says.

“APEC is a valuable opportunity for me to discuss the global and regional outlook with finance ministers from across the region.

“In the current uncertain environment, I’m keen to share ideas about opportunities for small, open economies like New Zealand.”

On his way to Moscow, Mr English will visit Hong Kong, where he will meet Hong Kong Monetary Authority deputy chief executive Peter Pang, other government officials and business groups.

Following the APEC finance ministers’ meeting, he will travel to New York, where he will meet investor groups and representatives of credit ratings agencies Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s.

Mr English returns to New Zealand on 6 September.
