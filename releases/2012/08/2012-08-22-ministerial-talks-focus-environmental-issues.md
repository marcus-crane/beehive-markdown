Environment Minister Amy Adams leaves for Canberra today to attend the Council of Australian Government’s Standing Committee on Environment and Water (SCEW).

“We’re interested in the work Australia is doing in areas such as national water reform, waste policy, and a national plan for clean air. Taking part in the standing committee and its working groups will help us with our environmental policy and implementation work,” Ms Adams says.

SCEW is a Council of Australian Commonwealth, State, Territory and New Zealand Ministers with responsibility for environmental and water issues.

It meets every year to agree actions to address key environmental protection and water management issues. This is SCEW’s third meeting, and New Zealand has agreed to host the fourth meeting next year.

The meeting will provide an opportunity for Ms Adams to meet her Australian counterpart, Minister Tony Burke, as well as State Environment Ministers.

During the trip, Ms Adams will also meet the Australian Productivity Commission to discuss its water reform reports, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority regarding its work managing one of Australia’s largest and most important catchments, and Australia’s Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Stephen Conroy.
