Housing Minister Phil Heatley has congratulated Housing New Zealand on the smooth introduction this month of new core technology systems.

Housing NZ has replaced its outdated tenancy management system with a specialist social housing system, replaced its financial system and introduced new systems to support asset management and planning.

Mr Heatley saw the new systems in operation for himself during a visit to Housing NZ’s Manurewa office yesterday.

“I was very impressed. The new systems are up and running now and will improve processes and service delivery out of sight once fully bedded in. The staff I met on the front line at Manurewa are really happy.

“‘I congratulate Housing NZ on how well this has been done. It goes far beyond a new computer system: it will enable the corporation to give tenants better service, and taxpayers a better return on our $15 billion housing investment.

“Sophisticated new systems for managing assets mean Housing NZ can maintain houses more efficiently, and plan to have the right houses in the right places at the right time. They will be able to match people to houses more effectively and reduce waiting times.”

Mr Heatley said the new technology introduced earlier this month supports service delivery changes in April, when the Customer Services Centre was expanded to be the first point of contact with Housing NZ.

“The Customer Services Centre is now running very well, and call response times are right down,” he said.

The business transformation programme will provide annual benefits of $75 million from 2015.
