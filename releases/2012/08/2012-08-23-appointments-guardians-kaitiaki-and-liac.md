Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain today announced appointments to the two bodies that support the National Library of New Zealand.

“I am pleased to announce that I have appointed Helen Tait as the new Chair of the Guardians Kaitiaki of the Alexander Turnbull Library,” says Mr Tremain.

There are three other appointments to the Guardians Kaitiaki:

- Ms Robyn Kamira
- Professor Paul Tapsell
- Professor Raewyn Dalziel

“These appointments will ensure the Turnbull Library will continue to serve and develop in ways that are appropriate for the nation’s pre-eminent research library,” says Mr Tremain.

“I have also re-appointed Donald Hunn as a Commissioner and the Chair of the Library and Information Advisory Commission (LIAC) for a second term and Brian Flaherty has been appointed a Commissioner.

“LIAC is now well placed to handle the challenges ahead, especially around changes in the knowledge society.”

The terms of appointment and reappointment for all positions are three years.
