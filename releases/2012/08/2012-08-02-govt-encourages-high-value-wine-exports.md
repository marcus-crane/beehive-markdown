New Zealand Trade and Enterprise is to invest $2.1 million for projects in China, the United States and Northern Europe to build the New Zealand wine brand and add value to our exports, Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce announced today.

The programme includes $600,000 of Government support for the Complexity High End Wine Initiative project in the United States through to June 2014.

“The New Zealand wine industry is an important earner for the country, contributing more than $1 billion in export revenue each year,” Mr Joyce says.

The NZTE programme aims to maximise significant opportunities for New Zealand wine in China, the United States and Northern Europe. They will help build awareness of the New Zealand brand and take a collaborative and concerted approach to positioning New Zealand wine at the premium end of the market in these regions.

“In China, our Free Trade Agreement presents a window for New Zealand companies to benefit from tariff reductions that are not available to exporters from other countries, while Northern Europe is a large market where consumers don’t have pre-conceived ideas about our wines and are interested in premium brands,” Mr Joyce says.

“Last month there was a comprehensive roadshow in Beijing and Shanghai targeting Chinese wine trade, media and thought leaders, as well the showcase of New Zealand wines at the Vinexpo Asia Pacific trade show in Hong Kong which Minister David Carter attended.

“The goal is that within five years we will build a solid brand platform upon which New Zealand wineries and New Zealand Winegrowers can thrive. We are looking to see significant increases in wine exporters to China and to Northern Europe over time.”
