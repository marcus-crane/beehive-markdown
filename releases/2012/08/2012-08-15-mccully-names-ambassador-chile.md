Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced career diplomat John Capper as New Zealand’s new Ambassador to Chile.

Mr Capper will also be accredited to Peru and Colombia.

“Chile is New Zealand’s most long-standing partner in Latin America and key to the government’s Latin America Strategy,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand has important investments in the Chilean agriculture and energy sectors.”

Mr Capper has previously served as Deputy High Commissioner in Vanuatu. While there, he led the planning and implementation of the Recognised Seasonal Employer labour scheme.

Mr Capper has also held positions in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s Pacific, Europe and trade negotiation divisions. He most recently served as a foreign policy advisor in Mr McCully’s office.

A Spanish speaker, Mr Capper has international development experience with the Red Cross in Spain as well as private sector experience in the Middle East.
