The latest Household Labour Force Survey released today underlines the need for New Zealand to take up all our opportunities for productive growth, Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce says.

“The results show that it is important we allow businesses the opportunity to grow and create jobs across the economy,” Mr Joyce says.

“This includes the intensification of agriculture, the development of aquaculture, greater foreign investment, encouraging hi-tech industries, expanding oil and gas exploration, and progressing an international convention centre in Auckland.

“Those that oppose some or all of these things need to understand you can’t have more jobs without taking up these opportunities.

“It’s vital that we put out the welcome mat to businesses given the backdrop of the Global Financial Crisis and the on-going impact of the Canterbury Earthquakes.”

The HLFS show that the labour market in Canterbury continues to affect the overall figures. Excluding Canterbury, employment in New Zealand rose by 15,000 in the quarter, and unemployment fell.

“This shows the unavoidable impact the earthquakes have had on the New Zealand economy. It is crucial that the rest of the country takes up the opportunities for growth while the Canterbury region rebuilds,” Mr Joyce says.

Through the Business Growth Agenda the Government is working to create opportunities for companies to establish, grow and create jobs.

“Our focus is on ensuring businesses have access to the necessary innovation, capital, skilled workers, resources, supporting public infrastructure and markets they need to be internationally competitive,” Mr Joyce says.

“The good news is that in the past two years 55,000 new jobs were created in New Zealand despite some of the toughest economic head winds the World has seen. However, the reality is that if we want more and better jobs then we need to encourage more successful, growing and competitive companies to be based here.”
