The five communities in the community-led development scheme are now ready to start implementing their community plans, Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew announced today.

“The initial stages of the scheme involved each community deciding to take part, establishing a leadership group and agreeing on a community plan,” said Mrs Goodhew.

“All five communities have now signed funding agreements with the Department of Internal Affairs which means they can begin work on their local projects. This marks a significant milestone for the scheme.”

Mrs Goodhew today visited Mangakino and met with the community leadership group and members of the local community to discuss their experiences of the scheme and the vision set out in their community plan.

“It is very inspiring to see these communities taking on the challenges and opportunities of a new approach to community funding,” she said.

“This is a change in the way we work with communities. This Government wants to support communities to identify their own priorities and develop their own solutions.

“Under the community-led development scheme the people of these communities are able to participate fully. The scheme is not just a way of providing Government support for community projects – it is also about building leadership skills and community independence.”

**Background**

The five communities which have signed agreements with the Department of Internal Affairs are Whirinaki (South Hokianga), Mount Roskill (Auckland), Mangakino (Taupo), Cannons Creek/Waitangirua (Porirua), and North East Valley (Dunedin).

The scheme came about when a review of the Department of Internal Affairs’ Crown Funded Schemes in 2009 found that while the funding arrangements were meeting their objectives, better outcomes could be achieved through longer-term investment in community-led development.

The communities chosen for the initiative were selected because they had strengths to build on, current or potential leaders and multiple issues to address. The five include communities with a range of demographic and cultural profiles.

The community plans set out a vision for each community and how they will carry out their community projects and activities. The leadership groups in each community will monitor and report to the both the community and the Department on the progress of the overall initiative. The fund holders in each community will monitor and report on expenditure and other accountabilities in their funding agreements.
