On Cabinet’s advice, the Governor-General has given the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Pike River mine tragedy two extra months in which to deliver its report, Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson announced today.

The Royal Commission will now be required to report back by 30 November 2012, rather than 28 September 2012.

“The Royal Commission will be reporting on the events leading to the Pike River mine tragedy and recommendations on the policy questions that arise from it,” Mr Finlayson said. “However, preparation for a judicial review application involving the Royal Commission has diverted resources and delayed the drafting of the Commission’s final report.”

“Cabinet has agreed to extend the reporting date by two months to ensure the Royal Commission has the time necessary to complete this very important work.

“The extended reporting date ensures the report will not be compromised, and that families and the public will still have answers before the end of the year.”

The Royal Commission’s costs associated with the extension of the reporting date will be funded from within its existing appropriations, and so will be fiscally neutral.
