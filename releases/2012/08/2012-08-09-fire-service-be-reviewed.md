**I**nternal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain has announced a review of the functions and funding of New Zealand’s fire services.

“An independent panel will provide advice on how New Zealand can have a 21st century fire service which operates seamlessly with the roles performed by other emergency service providers,” says Mr Tremain. “This will include identifying any gaps or overlaps in emergency services and options for the future role of the fire service.

“The panel will also consider options for how fire services can be governed and structured to operate as efficiently and effectively as possible. This will provide value for money into the future, in line with the Government’s focus on delivering better public services.

“Finally, the review will assess future options for funding of the fire service. Funding needs to be stable, equitable and predictable. Improvements need to be made to the current model, which is based on an insurance-based levy.

“The review will not consider the industrial relations framework for paid professional fire-fighters or whether the management of fire on forest and rural lands should be provided by rural fire authorities.”
