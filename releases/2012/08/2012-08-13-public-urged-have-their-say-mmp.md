Justice Minister Judith Collins is encouraging all New Zealanders to comment on proposed changes to the Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) voting system, following the Electoral Commission’s Proposal Paper released today.

The Commission is reviewing the voting system following the vote at last November’s referendum to keep MMP, as required by the Electoral Referendum Act 2010.

“I’ve been delighted at New Zealanders’ input into the MMP review so far,” Ms Collins said.

“More than 4,600 submissions were received in response to the Electoral Commission’s public discussion document released earlier this year.

“It’s important that the public continues to engage and have their say on how MMP might work in the future.”

Submissions on the Proposals Paper close at 5pm on 7 September.

The Electoral Commission will then consider this feedback and report back to the Government by 31 October 2012 with final recommendations on whether any changes to MMP are necessary or desirable.

The Proposals Paper and more information about the review can be found at [www.mmpreview.org.nz](http://www.mmpreview.org.nz) or by calling 0800 36 76 56.
