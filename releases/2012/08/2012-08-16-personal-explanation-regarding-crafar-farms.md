Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson today sought to make the following personal explanation in Parliament about former Crafar-owned farms purchased by a consortium led by May Wang and Jack Chen without either Ministerial or Overseas Investment Office approval.

“Yesterday, in relation to the Hong Kong court case against May Wang and others, I said that the case had finished.

“I have today been advised that the court case has not yet finished and the Hong Kong restraint orders are still in force.

“As soon as legally possible the Overseas Investment Office will seek to have the ownership of the four farms involved regularised.”
