New Zealand’s 2010 suicide statistics are 23.6 percent down on the peak of the late 1990s, with youth suicides down on the previous year, Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne said today.

A total of 522 people died by suicide in New Zealand in 2010, or 11.5 deaths per 100,000 people.  As a proportion of population, this is 23.6 percent below the peak of 577 in 1998, but up slightly on the 510 deaths in 2009, he said in releasing the 2010 suicide and self-harm hospitalisation data.

“There can be small year-to-year variances either way, but what we look for are trends to get a sense of fundamental directions and overall that trend is heading down.”

Youth suicide rates continued to decline, from 19.5 deaths per 100,000 in 2008 to 18.1 in 2009, and 17.7 in 2010.

“Maori are overrepresented in suicide rates, particularly young Maori, and the youth suicide rate is still too high compared to other OECD countries. Rates among young women continue to fluctuate,” Mr Dunne said

For the first time, urban and rural suicide data is compared, showing a higher rate of male suicide in rural areas than urban areas.

“This is timely data we need to be aware of, so we can see what steps may need to be taken to address both specific issues and any ongoing incidence,” Mr Dunne said.

The 2010 suicide and self-harm hospitalisation data is being released just four months after the 2009 data, showing that data collection is getting quicker, he said.

He said the timely reporting of suicide data can only help with earlier awareness of trends.

Continuing improvements in coronial processes and data sharing between the Coroner’s Office and the Ministry of Health have returned the quicker data.

Getting the 2010 figures out in 20 months compares very favourably internationally, he said

Mr Dunne said new investment of $8 million over four years announced in June to strengthen communities to prevent suicide, alongside the Prime Minister’s $62 million Youth Mental Health Package, will assist more people at risk of suicide.

“The Government is currently developing a new four-year suicide prevention action plan, which will build on suicide prevention and mental health initiatives already in place, and which should be released early next year.

“Suicide is devastating. It has a profound impact on family, friends, colleagues and the wider community – we all have a role in helping prevent it,” he said.

The report, which can be found at [www.health.govt.nz/publication/suicide-facts-deaths-and-intentional-self-harm-hospitalisations-2010](http://www.health.govt.nz/publication/suicide-facts-deaths-and-intentional-self-harm-hospitalisations-2010), also shows 2825 intentional self-harm hospitalisations in 2010, or 66 per 100,000 people. Adjusted to population growth, this is down 23.1 percent since 1996.
