Wairoa people will receive better health services closer to home when their new $5 million Integrated Family Health Centre opens next year says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

Mr Ryall welcomed the Hawke’s Bay District Health Board’s (DHB) decision to give the project the go ahead, “I understand work could begin as early as next month.”

“This is a significant investment which will have primary and secondary health providers working more closely together to deliver better health services to Wairoa people closer to home.

“Health professionals lined up to work in the new integrated family health centre include GPs, district nurses, public health nurses and visiting hospital specialists running outpatient clinics.

“There’ll also be physiotherapists, community and Māori health workers and mental health services including drug and alcohol addiction, as well as inpatient and maternity beds, an emergency department, radiology and laboratory services and a diabetes clinic,” Mr Ryall says.

“I understand a lot of hard work by the DHB and the community has gone into getting the project to this stage and I congratulate them for their commitment to future proofing health services for the people of Wairoa.

“This is also an example of what can be achieved when a DHB focuses on getting its finances in order.

“Only four years ago Hawke’s Bay DHB was in financial deficit and getting worse. Today it has eliminated that deficit and is in a much better position to invest in improving health services for the people of Hawke’s Bay.

“Four years ago DHBs had combined – and rising – deficits of around $150 million. Turning around those deficits to near balance has been a major achievement of the DHBs under a National government,” Mr Ryall says.
