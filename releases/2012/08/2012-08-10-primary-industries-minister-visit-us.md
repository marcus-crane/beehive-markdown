Primary Industries Minister David Carter will travel to the United States tomorrow for a primary industries summit, and talks with agriculture sector political leaders and officials.

The Minister will meet with a range of agricultural organisations, including the Tri-Lamb Group and US Cattlemen’s Association to discuss common New Zealand–US primary industry interests.

“These meetings further strengthen the New Zealand-US bilateral relationship and give our two countries the opportunity to canvass a range of issues in the primary industries policy area. It is an opportunity to highlight the excellent collaborative work we already have with the US though the Global Research Alliance on agricultural greenhouse gases,” says Mr Carter.

“I particularly look forward to discussions on the mutual benefits that will be realised through the Trans-Pacific Partnership FTA currently under negotiation.

“The TPP is important to New Zealand’s trade future and this visit will provide the opportunity to take political level readings on its progress.”

Mr Carter will also travel to Stanford University, California, which is hosting a primary sector ‘boot camp’ for around 20 of New Zealand’s primary industry leaders.

“This is an excellent opportunity for the leaders of some of our most forward-thinking primary sector companies to collaborate on formulating a plan to leverage New Zealand’s competitive advantage globally.

“It’s not often that we can get a powerful group like this representing over 80 percent of New Zealand primary sector exports around the table, and I am confident of a positive outcome,” Mr Carter says.
