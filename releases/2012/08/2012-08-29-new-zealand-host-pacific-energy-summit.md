Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced New Zealand will co-host a Pacific regional energy summit designed to achieve “a quantum leap forward” in the implementation of clean and affordable energy and reducing reliance on fossil fuel.

Mr McCully says the conference will be a legacy of New Zealand’s year as Forum Chair, designed to translate renewable energy talk into action.

“At last year’s Forum in Auckland, leaders made a strong commitment to the promotion of clean and affordable energy through the Waiheke Declaration on Sustainable Economic Development,” Mr McCully says.

“In the past 12 months, Pacific countries have made considerable progress towards energy independence.

“To keep up this momentum and create opportunities for further investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy, New Zealand and the European Union will host a Pacific regional energy summit early next year. The World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and Australia have agreed to co-sponsor this event.

“The summit is designed to connect development partners, private sector investors and Pacific countries to help fast-track the region’s conversion to renewable energy sources.

“We are talking to other partners - such as the United States, United Arab Emirates and Japan - and welcome participation from a wide range of partners,” Mr McCully says.

The summit will be held in New Zealand in April 2013.
