Education Minister Hekia Parata has today expressed her sympathy to the board, staff, students, families and wider community of Spotswood College following the tragic incident at Paritutu Rock.

"My thoughts are with everyone in the Spotswood College community, especially the family and friends of Joao Felipe Martins De Melo, Stephen Lewis Kahukaka-Gedye, and Topec instructor Bryce Jourdain.

"I have been in contact with the school's Board of Trustees chair and have offered them any support they might need in this difficult time."

A Ministry of Education Traumatic Incident Team is with the school providing advice and guidance to the teachers, the Principal and the Board.

Counselling is being provided for the families of those affected by the incident and a resource centre has been established at the school to provide learners with a place to gather and receive support and counselling.

Ms Parata will be in New Plymouth this afternoon.
