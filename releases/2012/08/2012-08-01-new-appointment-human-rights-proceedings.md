Justice Minister Judith Collins today announced the appointment of Robert Kee as the Director of Human Rights Proceedings.

Mr Kee’s appointment follows the expiration of term of the incumbent Director, Mr Robert Hesketh.

“I would like to thank Mr Hesketh for leading the Office of Human Rights Proceedings for the last two terms, since 2002,” Ms Collins said.

“Mr Kee is an experienced criminal lawyer. I have every confidence that his strong litigation skills and judgement will ensure that he successfully leads the Office for the next five years.”

The Office of Human Rights Proceedings is an independent body within the Human Rights Commission. The Director heads the Office which is responsible for providing publicly funded representation to complainants in proceedings under the Human Rights Act 1993.

Mr Kee graduated with an LLB(Hons) from the University of Auckland in 1986. He is a barrister sole with extensive experience in criminal litigation involving human rights issues before the District Court, High Court and Court of Appeal. Mr Kee was recently the convenor of the Auckland District Law Society Criminal Law Committee and has been a member of other similar committees.

His appointment will commence on 15 October 2012.
