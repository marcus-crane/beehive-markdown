Justice Minister Judith Collins will tomorrow launch the expansion of the safe@home domestic violence prevention programme, committing $1 million over the next two years to the project delivered by Auckland charity, Shine.

Ms Collins says at least 300 extra homes will be strengthened with enhanced security, supporting women and children at risk of repeat victimisation.

“Safe@home helps keep vulnerable women and children safe from domestic abuse without them having to leave their own homes. Families can stay where their established support networks such as neighbours and school friends are.

“Safe@home provides safety tools like monitored personal alarms, escape plans and reinforced doors, and is in addition to a protection order imposed by a judge,” Ms Collins says.

The increased funding will enable Shine to expand the programme into Christchurch, South Auckland and Tauranga.

“We are committed to protecting victims and preventing repeat victimisation. By making homes safer and more secure we are giving these families tools to help keep them safe from continued abuse,” Ms Collins says.
