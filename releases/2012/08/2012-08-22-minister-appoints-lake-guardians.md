Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson has appointed a new Chair, re-appointed three existing members and appointed a new person to the Guardians of Lakes Manapouri, Monowai and Te Anau.

Ms Wilkinson has also extended the term of the Guardians from three to five years.

“Teresa McClelland of Invercargill is re-appointed to the position of Chair of the Guardians of Lakes Manapouri, Monowai and Te Anau,” Ms Wilkinson says.

“I am also very pleased to re-appoint to the Guardians, Fred Inder of Te Anau, Ian Welsh of Invercargill and Marc Schallenberg of Dunedin.”

Darryl Sycamore of Dunedin is appointed a new Guardian.

Ms Wilkinson says the role of the Guardians is to advise her on matters arising from environmental, ecological and social impacts of the power schemes on these lakes, as well as advising her on the operating guidelines for the lakes.
