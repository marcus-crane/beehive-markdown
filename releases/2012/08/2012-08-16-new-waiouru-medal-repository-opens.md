The new Medal Repository at the National Army Museum in Waiouru has been opened today by the Defence Minister, Dr Jonathan Coleman.

“This new Medal Repository is world-class and displays the medal collection in a fitting, accessible and secure way,” said Dr Coleman.

“It is a tangible memorial to the brave men and woman who served the country in times of war and at the same time tells the stories of the medal recipients,” he said.

The National Army Museum has ten thousand medals all of which have been donated by families of serviceman. A theft of medals in 2007 put into motion plans to improve the exhibit.

“It’s been a major project for the National Army Museum Trust Board to redesign the medal repository and they can be proud of the outcome. It will be a long term success and attract many interested New Zealanders”.

“The new database included with the displays also means visitors with family connections can locate the appropriate draw with the donated medal and information on their relative,” said Dr Coleman.

The 16th of August was been chosen as the date of the opening because it is a special anniversary for one of New Zealand’s most highly decorated heroes, Reginald Judson. He won the Victoria Cross, the Distinguished Conduct Medal, and the Military Medal between July and August 1918.
