Social Development Minister Paula Bennett has welcomed the draft report into child poverty released through the Children’s Commissioner today.

“The Expert Advisory Group has worked hard to address the complex issues surrounding poverty which cut across social development, health, housing, education and other areas,” says Mrs Bennett.

There are a large number of proposals and recommendations contained in the report which could be considered by a range of government agencies.

“I have asked my officials to work with the Expert Advisory Group to provide input into the White Paper on Vulnerable Children.”

“This Government is already moving in the same direction on many of the issues raised, though we can always do more.”

The Government deliberately protected Working for Families and ensured benefit levels increased with the cost of living despite tight fiscal constraints.

“I particularly welcome the report’s strong focus on the benefits of full-time work.”

As the report says, a parent obtaining full-time work is the most important event to lift children out of poverty.

Moving people off welfare into work is the primary focus of the Government’s Welfare Reforms.

National has a consistent approach to building a stronger economy, getting more people off welfare into work and protecting vulnerable children.

The Government will consider the final report through the Ministerial Committee on Poverty.
