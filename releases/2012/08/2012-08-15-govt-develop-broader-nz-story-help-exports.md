Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce and Trade Minister Tim Groser today announced Government agencies are working on a broader ‘New Zealand Story’ - an initiative to help New Zealand companies gain an advantage in international markets.

The ‘New Zealand Story’ is one of the initiatives outlined in the “*Building Export Markets*” progress report launched today as part of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda.

“Businesses have been telling us of the need to better tell the ‘New Zealand Story’ overseas. Smaller exporters particularly emphasise that it is New Zealand’s reputation that gives them their initial market entry point as they are too small individually to secure brand recognition for their product or service,” Mr Joyce says.

“New Zealand’s international profile focuses predominantly on our beautiful landscape, but our exporters also need to be recognised offshore for attributes like our high quality of goods and services, our innovation and fresh ideas, and our unique Māori culture,” Mr Groser says.

Tourism New Zealand, New Zealand Trade and Enterprise and Education New Zealand will proactively lead the development of the country story, jointly creating value with key public and private stakeholders.

The Government will engage with 40 to 50 senior New Zealand leaders across the private and public sectors that have experience with diverse international markets. A New Zealand-based agency with a strong understanding of brand strategy will then be engaged to develop the New Zealand story and the assets required to tell it.

“A tool kit will be developed for Kiwi businesses and the public sector to draw on to help tell the New Zealand story, including consistent branding, narrative, and photos,” Mr Joyce says.

“It’s not about replacing Tourism New Zealand’s 100 per cent pure branding. That has been a remarkable success and will continue to be at the heart of our international tourism brand.”

“To compete internationally, New Zealand has to differentiate itself and showcase what we have to offer the world, Mr Groser says.

“A compelling New Zealand story that pulls together all the elements of what makes our country unique is essential to assist the future growth of our businesses, jobs and our country.”
