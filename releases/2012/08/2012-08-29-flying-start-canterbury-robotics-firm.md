Minister for Small Business John Banks today congratulated Invert Robotics - an innovative Canterbury robotics firm - for winning Business.govt.nz’s ANZ Flying Start Business Plan Competition. 

Invert Robotics has created a world leading inspection solution for dairy factories and other users of stainless steel equipment.  Their remotely-operated climbing robots replace the existing abseil method, providing a fast, accurate and safer way of inspecting dairy equipment. 

“I know the judges had a tough time picking the best business plan from the 761 entries received.  But with a solid idea, an innovative product, and a business plan geared for growth, Invert Robotics is a deserving winner.”

Mr Banks also congratulated Sunil Vather from Wellington firm Im-Able Ltd for winning the $10,000 ANZ Exporter prize. 

“Im-Able develops and sells systems that accelerate the recovery of arm movements, balance and cognition for those affected by stroke.

“With a product that has worldwide potential, it is companies like Im-Able that will help us to reach the Government’s exports to GDP growth goal of 40 per cent by 2025.

“There were also sixteen regional winners who were each awarded a $1000 cash prize. 

“Business.govt.nz’s ANZ Flying Start Business Plan Competition has demonstrated the entrepreneurship that runs in New Zealand’s blood.

“I urge anyone with a business idea that they want to turn into reality to take that first step. Visit [www.business.govt.nz](http://www.business.govt.nz) for help with starting a business and working with government,” Mr Banks said.
