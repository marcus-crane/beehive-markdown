Justice Minister Judith Collins today appointed Dr Zoe Pearson and Ms Larissa Wakim as members of the Immigration and Protection Tribunal.

The independent tribunal was established under the Immigration Act 2009 to consider all immigration, deportation, refugee, and protection appeals in New Zealand.

Ms Collins said Dr Pearson and Ms Wakim are both highly respected legal professionals that will bring a great deal of skill and expertise to the Tribunal.

Dr Pearson is a lecturer at Keele University School of Law, UK and has 15 years experience in the area of human rights and international law. She holds a PhD in International Law and previously worked as a legal adviser for the Ministry of Justice, dealing with human rights issues.

Ms Wakim is an investigator at the International Criminal Court at The Hague. She worked in Cambodia, Egypt, USA, UK and Chad in various aspects of human rights law before commencing with the Office of the Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court.

Dr Pearson and Ms Wakim will return to New Zealand to take up their roles.
