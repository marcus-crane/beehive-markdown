Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain announced today the first round of funding to commemorate the centenary of World War One is now open to applicants.

“To recognise the importance of this war to our nation, the Lottery Grants Board has set aside over $17 million to fund commemorative projects,” says Mr Tremain.

“Funding for commemorative events is available through two pools: a $7.291 million general fund for community events and smaller capital work projects; and a $10 million fund for one or more large scale projects of national significance.

“New Zealanders are showing an increasing interest in wartime history and I am looking forward to the activities and events which will allow communities to pay tribute to those involved in armed conflicts.”

The first funding round opens today and will close on 28 November 2012 with decisions in mid April 2013.  A subsequent funding round closes on 29 May 2013 with decisions announced mid October 2013.
