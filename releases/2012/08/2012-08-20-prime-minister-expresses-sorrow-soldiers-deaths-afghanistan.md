Prime Minister John Key today expressed his sorrow on learning of the deaths of three New Zealand soldiers serving with the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Afghanistan.

The soldiers were killed following an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) incident in the north-east of Bamyan Province yesterday morning (local time).

“On behalf of New Zealanders, I extend my deepest condolences to the families of the three deceased,” says Mr Key.

“This latest tragedy brings the total number of New Zealand soldiers who have lost their lives in Afghanistan to 10. It also comes just two weeks after the deaths of Lance Corporals Pralli Durrer and Rory Malone, who died in an encounter with insurgents in Bamyan.

“Today’s events underscore the gravity of the situations New Zealand’s soldiers face daily in Afghanistan. The three brave soldiers paid the ultimate price for their selfless work, and my thoughts are with their families and friends as they mourn their loved ones.”

Mr Key will be holding a media conference at 11.30am on Monday 20 August in the Beehive Theatrette.
