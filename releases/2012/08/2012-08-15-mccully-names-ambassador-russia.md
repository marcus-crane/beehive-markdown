Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today named New Zealand’s next Ambassador to the Russian Federation as career diplomat Hamish Cooper.

“Russia’s decision to negotiate a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with New Zealand is a sign of the growing significance of our relationship, and our shared interests in the Asia-Pacific region,” Mr McCully says.

“The Ambassador’s role will be focused on expanding the relationship, particularly developing trade and economic links.

“Russia is a key global player as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, one of the G8 and G20 economies, and as a member of the BRICs grouping (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). It is the only nation with a stake and presence in both Europe and the Pacific rim,” Mr McCully says.

The position is cross-accredited to fellow Russia Customs Union and prospective FTA partners Kazakhstan and Belarus, as well as Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine.

Mr Cooper is currently director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s International Security and Disarmament Division and Co-ordinator for Counter-terrorism. He has previously served as Ambassador to Turkey and Consul-General in Osaka.
