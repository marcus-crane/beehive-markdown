Defence Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman says the death of three New Zealand Defence Force staff in Bamyan will come as a deep shock to the nation.

“My immediate thoughts are with the families of these three NZDF soldiers who lost their lives, and the wider NZDF community. It comes as a significant blow after the other casualties our Defence Force suffered on August 4th,” said Dr Coleman.

“The government expresses its sorrow on the deaths of these three soldiers who lost their lives while on active service in Bamyan.”

The three were travelling in a vehicle which was hit by a roadside Improvised Explosion Device in the North Eastern area of Bamyan.

“We are still receiving details from the scene and further information will be made available at a press conference later today.”
