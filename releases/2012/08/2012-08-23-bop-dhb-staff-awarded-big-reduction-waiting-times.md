Bay of Plenty DHB doctors, nurses and staff were awarded today for their ‘outstanding performance’ improving health services for the people of the Bay of Plenty.

Health Minister Tony Ryall, MP for the Bay of Plenty, presented staff at the DHB with a certificate recognising their work achieving major reductions in waiting times for elective surgery in the Bay.

“This is a remarkable achievement, and it just shows how hard the DHB doctors, nurses and staff have worked to improve frontline services for Bay of Plenty patients,” he said.

“Last year Bay of Plenty had 253 patients waiting longer than six months for either a specialist’s appointment to assess whether or not they needed treatment, or for the operation itself.

“This year they had no-one waiting longer than six months.”

“These improvements are very good for patients. Prompter treatment improves recovery and gets patients back to normal life sooner.

“I’d like to personally thank our theatre teams and staff for their hard work and dedication in improving health services for the people of the Bay of Plenty.

“Nationally, 17 out of 20 DHBs have reduced their waiting times to zero patients waiting over six months for surgical appointments.

“Over ten years ago there were around 45,000 people waiting over six months for a surgical appointment. Now, excluding Canterbury, there are just 150.

“This is also the fourth year of record increases in the number of elective operations under National. An extra 7,500 patients across the country received elective surgery in the last 12 months, meaning 153,000 people got the operations they need.

“Bay of Plenty is also to be congratulated for once again exceeding its elective surgery target. This year it performed 419 operations above target,” Mr Ryall aid.
