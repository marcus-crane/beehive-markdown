Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today congratulated Kiwi bioscience company LanzaTech for being designated a ‘World Economic Forum Technology Pioneer 2013’.

The company is to receive the award at the World Economic Forum meeting in Tianjin, China next month.

“LanzaTech is an innovative New Zealand company turning its smart ideas into a commercial reality,” Mr Joyce says.

“By converting waste gases into high-value chemicals such as ethanol, which can be used in the production of biofuel, LanzaTech has the potential to be a global pioneer in the production of cost-effective and sustainable fuels.

“The World Economic Forum award cements the strong international reputation LanzaTech has as a world leader in what is a highly competitive market for developing low-carbon fuel technology.

“Congratulations to LanzaTech founder Sean Simpson, Chief Executive Jennifer Holmgren and the team at LanzaTech for this international achievement.”
