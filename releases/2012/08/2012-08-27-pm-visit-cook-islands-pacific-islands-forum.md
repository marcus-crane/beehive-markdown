Prime Minister John Key will lead the New Zealand delegation to the 43rd Pacific Islands Forum in the Cook Islands this week.

“The Pacific Islands Forum Leaders’ Meeting is an opportunity for the region to come together and work on the issues we jointly face,” says Mr Key.

“It is also a chance to put the Pacific on the international agenda and meet with partners from outside the region.”

New Zealand hosted the 2011 Forum in Auckland, and this year Mr Key will formally hand over the chairing of the Forum to Cook Islands Prime Minister Henry Puna.

The theme the Cook Islands have chosen for the 2012 Pacific Islands Forum is “Large Ocean Island States – The Pacific Challenge.” Discussions will focus on how the Pacific’s significant marine resources can be protected, while also ensuring they contribute to the sustainable development of the region.

Mr Key will have bilateral meetings with many of his Pacific counterparts during the week.

“It has been an honour for New Zealand to lead the Forum in the year of its 40th anniversary and I look forward to discussing how we can further advance the region’s development in the next 12 months,” says Mr Key.

Prime Minister Key will fly Royal New Zealand Air Force to the Cook Islands, departing on Wednesday 29 August and returning on 1 September.
