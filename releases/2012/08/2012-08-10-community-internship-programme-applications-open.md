Applications for the Community Internship Programme are now being accepted, says Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew.

Applications close on Wednesday 26 September 2012. This will be the only funding round for the programme in 2012/13.

“This programme provides a chance for experienced professionals to take a break from their normal roles and help an organisation in their community to increase its capability, plan strategically and become more effective,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“Grants from the programme allow not-for-profit community organisations to pay the salaries of skilled staff from the public, private or community sector so they can work with their organisation for three to six months.

“The aim is also to increase understanding, co-operation and interaction between the private, central government, local government, community and voluntary sectors.

“For example, a member of the NZ Police is currently helping Te Rūnanganui o Ngāti Porou to develop a youth mentoring programme and iwi-led intervention process to support youth at risk. The goal is to build a stronger relationship between Te Rūnanganui and NZ Police, and ultimately work towards safer communities in Tairawhiti.”

Grants approved from this funding round will fund community internships beginning in January or February 2013.

The Community Internship Programme is administered by the Department of Internal Affairs. More information can be found by visiting [www.communitymatters.govt.nz](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz) or calling 0800 824 824 during business hours.
