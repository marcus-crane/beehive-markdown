Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced former Prime Minister Mike Moore will serve a second term as New Zealand’s Ambassador to Washington, and named Leon Grice as the next Consul-General in Los Angeles.

Mr McCully says he invited Ambassador Moore to serve a second term “in light of his impressive work strengthening this important relationship”.

“There is no one better placed to represent New Zealand in Washington as we get to the business end of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) process. I am delighted that Mike Moore has accepted my invitation to serve a second term.”

Mr Grice, who most recently served as Director NZ2011 at the Ministry of Economic Development, has experience in public relations, marketing and the commercial sector.

“California and other western states of America are major export markets for New Zealand and important investment partners, particularly in technology.

“As Consul-General, Mr Grice will be responsible for boosting our engagement with the technology and film sectors, as well as overseeing our leveraging of New Zealand’s participation in next year’s America’s Cup event in San Francisco,” Mr McCully says.
