Trade Minister Tim Groser will meet with visiting United States Senator Max Baucus this week.

Senator Baucus, of Montana, is Chair of the US Senate Finance Committee and influential in trade policy, especially in relation to free trade agreements.

“Senator Baucus’ visit presents an excellent opportunity to discuss a range of trade issues, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations,” Mr Groser says.

New Zealand and the United States are among nine countries currently participating in the TPP negotiations.

During his three-day visit, Senator Baucus will also meet with the Prime Minister, and Speaker of the House Hon Dr Lockwood Smith. He will also meet with industry, particularly in the renewable energy sector, and with representatives from Maori business.

Senator Baucus, a Democrat, was first elected to the Senate in 1978 and is currently the fifth longest-serving US Senator in office.

Note:

TPP participants include Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Viet Nam. Mexico and Canada will join the negotiations later this year.
