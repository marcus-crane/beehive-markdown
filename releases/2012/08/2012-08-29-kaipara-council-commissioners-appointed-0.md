Local Government Minister David Carter today released a report into the Kaipara District Council and announced the appointment of four commissioners to replace the elected councillors.

The review of Kaipara Council’s performance by the government-appointed Kaipara Review Team led to the Council requesting commissioners take over governance of the district. Appointing commissioners under the Local Government Act was also the review team’s central recommendation.

“The review team identified that the serious governance and financial challenges facing Kaipara District Council are beyond the current councillors’ ability to resolve,” says Mr Carter.

“The Government’s decision to appoint four commissioners reflects the significant workload ahead in rebuilding the relationship between the Council and the communities of Kaipara.

“It is likely the commissioners would be required until 2015. For this reason, the Government proposes to defer the 2013 election for Kaipara District Council until October 2015,” Mr Carter says.

The commissioners appointed are John Robertson (Chair), Richard Booth, Colin Dale and Peter Winder.

John Robertson (Chair) is a former Member of Parliament and a former Mayor of the Papakura district. An accredited company director and chartered accountant with his own business, he has served as Chair of a number of organisations including Infrastructure Auckland and the Auckland Mayoral Forum. He is a Companion of the Queen’s Service Order (QSO).

Richard Booth is a Whangarei-based business owner and farmer with considerable experience in the dairy industry. He is currently Chair of Delta Produce and the Northland Dairy Development Trust, a charitable trust that provides funding for dairy farm research projects in Northland. Richard is the farmer representative on the Northland Regional Council Environment Committee. 

Colin Dale has extensive local government experience, including as Chief Executive of Manukau City Council for 21 years. He has experience in developing iwi relationships and is currently an advisor to Watercare Services Limited. Colin worked on the formation of a mana whenua forum across Tāmaki Makaurau. He has also served as a Commissioner on the Local Government Commission and as President of the Society of Local Government Managers. Colin is a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit.

Peter Winder is a former Chief Executive of Auckland Regional Council and Chief Executive of Local Government New Zealand. As a Director of McGredy Winder & Co, his work with local authorities includes co-ordinating the national regional councils’ programme to implement the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management. Peter has served as Director of Transport at Auckland Regional Council.
