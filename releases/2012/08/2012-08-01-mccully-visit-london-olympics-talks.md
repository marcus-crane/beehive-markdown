Foreign Affairs and Sport and Recreation Minister Murray McCully will travel to London today for the 2012 Olympic Games, and talks with British Foreign Secretary William Hague.

“The New Zealand Olympic team has gone into the games in very good shape. In the next few days some of our feature sports will come into the spotlight,” Mr McCully says.

“I look forward to seeing many of our athletes on the Olympic podium.”

Mr McCully and Mr Hague will continue their pattern of regular meetings to discuss a range of bilateral, regional and global issues.

Mr McCully will also meet with a variety of other visiting dignitaries.
