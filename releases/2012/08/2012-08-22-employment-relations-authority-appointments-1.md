Labour Minister Kate Wilkinson today announced the appointment of two new Members of the Employment Relations Authority and the reappointment of two others.

The new members - each appointed to a three-year term - are Kerikeri lawyer Tania Tetitaha, to Auckland and Wellington lawyer Patricia MacKinnon to the Wellington office. These appointments fill vacancies in the Authority.

Two current members, Paul Stapp and Greg Wood have been reappointed to Wellington.

“The ERA has a statutory function to investigate and determine employment relations problems. It forms a crucial part of our employment relations framework,” Ms Wilkinson says.
