Prime Minister John Key has extended New Zealand's condolences to the people of Australia, who have suffered the loss of five brave soldiers in two separate incidents in the southern Uruzgan and the Helmand provinces in Afghanistan.

This news is particularly painful coming less than two weeks after the deaths of three New Zealand soldiers in an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) incident in the Bamyan province.

"The thoughts of New Zealanders are today with Australians, and in particular with the families who have lost loved ones and with the soldiers who have lost friends and colleagues," Mr Key says.

"I have sent a message to Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard to extend our condolences following these tragic events."

As a valued partner of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), Australia is supporting the Uruzgan province through the transition to Afghan security leadership.Prime Minister expresses sorrow at Australia’s loss
