Two Bills which amend 13 pieces of legislation to reduce the compliance burden on business and repeal 31 Acts that no longer have any effect or are out of date passed their third and final reading today.

Minister for Regulatory Reform John Banks says the passing of the Regulatory Reform Bill will improve the quality of specific regulatory environments, with these improvements flowing on to business and the economy.

“The Bill implements a number of regulatory fixes identified as a part of the Government’s on-going Regulatory Reform Programme. This programme reviews existing regulation, in order to identify and remove requirements that are unnecessary, ineffective or excessively costly for business.

“Combined, the changes are expected to result in compliance savings for businesses of approximately $3 million annually.

“Savings of $1.5 million are expected from the amendment to the Companies Act, while the amendment to the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993 is expected to result in savings of approximately $50,000 per week.

“The Regulatory Reform (Repeals) Bill also passed third reading today. It will help to clear up the statute books and remove unnecessary clutter by repealing 31 Acts that no longer have any effect or are out of date,” Mr Banks said.
