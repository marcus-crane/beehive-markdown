Trade Minister Tim Groser will travel to Asia tomorrow for a series of meetings aimed at boosting trade in the Asia-Pacific region.

Mr Groser will attend the East Asia Summit Economic Ministers meeting in Cambodia, visit Thailand for bilateral discussions and then head to the annual APEC Ministerial Meeting in Vladivostok.

“The continued economic dynamism in the Asia-Pacific region, and the significance of New Zealand’s trade links there, means that New Zealand must remain fully engaged in its rapidly evolving trade architecture,” Mr Groser says.

In Cambodia Mr Groser will attend meetings with Trade Ministers from the ASEAN and the East Asia Summit countries. The main item will be preparations for the launch of negotiations towards a Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership involving ASEAN countries and their FTA partners.

In Thailand the Minister will meet with the Minister of Commerce, Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance. Mr Groser will also meet with a number of industry groups to discuss business and investment opportunities.

Mr Groser will attend the 24th APEC Ministerial Meeting in Vladivostok from 4 September, along with Trade and Foreign Affairs Ministers from the other 21 APEC economies. Discussions will focus on trade and investment liberalisation, regional economic integration, strengthening food security and establishing reliable supply chains, cooperation to foster innovative growth and ways to support and further develop the multilateral trading system.
