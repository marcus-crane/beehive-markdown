Nathan Guy is heading to Australia today for a range of meetings covering the Veterans’ Affairs, Immigration, and forestry portfolios.

Mr Guy will be meeting with Australian ministers and officials in Canberra to discuss planning for the 2015 Anzac commemorations at Gallipoli.

“It’s important we work closely together on what is going to be a very important event for Australia, New Zealand and Turkey.”

Mr Guy will also be meeting with Australian Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.

“Australia has experience at dealing with mass arrivals of illegal migrants, so it is important to share information and learn from their experience.

“This is a timely issue with the Immigration Amendment Bill currently before a Select Committee in New Zealand, and the Australian Parliament also passing new legislation.”

As the Associate Minister for Primary Industries with responsibility for forestry, Mr Guy will also be meeting with Senator Joe Ludwig, Australian Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, to discuss illegal logging and other bilateral forestry issues.

Mr Guy will be in Canberra and Sydney from 21-22 August.
