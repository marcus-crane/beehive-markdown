Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman has offered his condolences to the families of two New Zealand Defence Force soldiers killed in action in Bamyan overnight.

A further six NZDF soldiers were wounded in a clash with insurgents in the North Eastern area of the province, which also involved local security forces.

"The NZDF was responding to local security forces coming under attack and it developed into a serious incident," said Dr Coleman.

"The thoughts of the government and the people of New Zealand are with the NZDF today. Our thoughts are especially with the families of those who died, and the families of those who were wounded."

"The work the NZDF undertake in this region is dangerous and they have been well trained to respond to these incidents," he said.
