Commissioners are to be appointed to run Kaipara District following a request from the Council, Local Government Minister David Carter has announced.

The Kaipara District Council resolved today to request the appointment of independent commissioners after being briefed by the government-appointed review team on an interim report due to the Minister this week.

The review team was appointed in June to consider a range of financial and governance challenges facing the Council, and options for addressing them.

"Kaipara District Council is facing a range of problems including the size of its debt, invalidity of previous rates, management of its infrastructure and loss of confidence amongst parts of the community," says Mr Carter.

"The Council’s request to appoint commissioners under the Local Government Act is made in the best interests of the district, and I applaud that.

Mr Carter says he will seek Cabinet’s agreement to appoint commissioners.

"In the meantime, the Mayor and Councillors will continue in office and the Government expects that they will continue to carry out their duties, including adopting Kaipara’s long term plan," Mr Carter says.
