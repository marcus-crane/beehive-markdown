Prime Minister John Key today congratulated young Kiwi golfer Lydia Ko on her historic win at the LPGA Canadian Women’s Open.

“This is a fantastic achievement. Lydia held off some of the world's best female golfers to become the youngest ever Open winner in the LPGA Tour history at just 15-years-old,” Mr Key says.

“I played with Lydia at a pro-am event in Queenstown earlier this year and was impressed by her poise, skill and absolute dedication to her sport.

“Today’s win tops off an amazing year for Lydia. She won the US Women's Amateur two weeks ago and the New South Wales Open in Australia in January, making her the youngest player to win a professional tour event at 14-years-old.

“Lydia is a delightful young woman who has a great future ahead of her and I will continue to watch her career with interest,” Mr Key says.
