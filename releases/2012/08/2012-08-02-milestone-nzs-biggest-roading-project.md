Prime Minister John Key today marked a significant milestone for the $1.4 billion Waterview Connection in Auckland, breaking the ground for a 30 metre deep trench needed for the construction of the project’s twin tunnels.

The Waterview Connection is New Zealand’s biggest and most complex roading project and is one of the National-led Government’s seven Roads of National Significance.

Mr Key was joined at the construction site today by Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce, Auckland Mayor Len Brown, iwi and local community leaders to mark the start of work on the project’s southern approach trench.

Mr Key says commercial transport operators, businesses, commuters and tourists will all benefit from the knock-on travel benefits this project will bring.

“The Waterview Connection will provide a direct motorway link between the CBD and Auckland International Airport, saving 15 minutes off the journey time between these two key locations,” he says.

The 30m deep trench will be the underground entry point for the project’s massive tunnel boring machine, and will later become part of the motorway for vehicles entering and leaving the southern portals of the twin 2.4km long three-lane tunnels.

“One of the National-led Government priorities for this term is to continue building a more competitive and productive economy and this project will help deliver on it.”

Mr Key says once it is completed in 2016, the Waterview Connection will complete the key link in the Western Ring Route, providing a 48km motorway alternative to ease pressure on SH1 and the Auckland Harbour Bridge.

It will also provide better connections and facilities for those who walk and cycle, and for those who use public transport.

“At the height of its construction activity, this project will employ more than 1500 staff, both at the site and at its precast facility in East Tāmaki,” Mr Key says.

“It’s a challenging project, but one that will deliver significant benefits for Auckland and New Zealand.”
