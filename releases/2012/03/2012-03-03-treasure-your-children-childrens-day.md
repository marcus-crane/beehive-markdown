Education and Pacific Island Affairs Minister, Hekia Parata, encourages parents everywhere to take time out to have fun with their kids on Children’s Day this Sunday 4 March.

“Children’s Day is important because it’s the day we stop to reflect on what our children mean to us, and what we can do for them, everyday,'' says Ms Parata.

The nationwide event has been celebrated for 11 years with events around the country. This year's theme is ‘treasure our children'.

“Our kids are our taonga – our greatest treasure. As adults we have the job of treasuring them so they can grow strong and well.

“Not just because they are our future, our leaders of tomorrow, but because they are our fellow human beings. They are growing people who should be nurtured with love and patience, and from whom we have plenty to learn,'' says Ms Parata.

“With hundreds of events happening around the country, there’s something for everyone on this special day, so I encourage parents and caregivers to check out what’s happening in their community.

“If you can’t make it to an event, I encourage you to have a special family activity at home to mark the day. What matters is taking the time to let your children know how special they are.”
