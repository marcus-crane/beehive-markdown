Minister for Sport and Recreation Murray McCully has paid tribute to rugby legend Jock Hobbs following the news of his passing after a long battle with leukaemia.

"Jock Hobbs was one of nature's gentlemen. He was an outstanding sportsman, one of our greatest sporting administrators, a passionate New Zealander and a thoroughly decent human being," Mr McCully said.

"It is literally correct to say that had it not been for the roles that Jock played at a critical time, that professional rugby would not be the sport it is today.

"More than anyone else, Jock was responsible for bringing the Rugby World Cup to New Zealand in 2011. He derived great satisfaction from our success both on and off the field.

"He has made an unparalleled contribution to New Zealand rugby for which he will always be remembered."
