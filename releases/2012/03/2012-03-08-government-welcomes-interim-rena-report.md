Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee has welcomed this morning’s release of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission’s interim report of its independent inquiry into the grounding of the container ship Rena on Astrolabe Reef on 5 October 2011.

“Today’s report shows good progress is being made investigating how this accident occurred.

“It establishes some verified facts that will enlighten ongoing investigations,” Mr Brownlee said.

Analysis, findings and recommendations stemming from the Rena incident will be subject to the Commission’s final report, which is due next year.
