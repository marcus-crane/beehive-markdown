Associate Justice Minister Chester Borrows today launched a new Government initiative with the New Zealand Retailers Association promoting the safe storage, display and sale of knives.

“This new initiative, called SAFE, is a voluntary initiative outlining to retailers four simple steps they can use to ensure knives are stored, displayed and sold safely in their shops. These are store and display knives safely, ask if concerned, focus on preventing theft, and educate employees,” says Mr Borrows.

“SAFE is a great example of how retailers and the Government can work together to reduce knife crime in New Zealand. It’s encouraging to see some of New Zealand’s biggest retailers on board with ensuring the responsible sale of knives.

“This Government is committed to reducing crime, particularly violent crime, as one of our ten key public service results. The SAFE initiative is part of a broader package targeting knife crime, announced by the Government in July 2010, which will help deliver this result,” says Mr Borrows.

The SAFE initiative has been developed in consultation with the New Zealand Retailers Association and its members. Materials, including posters, stickers, and pamphlets for both staff and store owners, will be distributed to participating retailers next week.
