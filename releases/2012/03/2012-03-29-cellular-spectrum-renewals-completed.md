Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams today announced the completion of cellular spectrum renewals that secure key rights for Telecom, 2degrees and Vodafone through to 2031.

Telecom has this week completed settlement, enabling it to renew the 850 megahertz (MHz) band rights that it uses for its XT network.

2degrees settled in January for the 900 MHz rights for its GSM network, while Vodafone choose to settle early, renewing its 900 MHz band rights in 2009.

“The Government welcomes the commitment of the three operators to the New Zealand mobile market,” Ms Adams says.

“The companies’ renewal of this spectrum through to 2031 means they can make long-term infrastructure investment decisions. Over time this will bring New Zealanders better mobile technology and services.”

The renewal of the cellular spectrum in the 850 MHz and 900 MHz bands will net the Crown $150 million.
