Trials are underway for a programme training child health and development professionals to support parents who want to improve their parenting skills.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says "we're spending nearly $4 million over three years to trial this programme, which is described as one of the world's most effective parenting programmes.

Four District Health Boards (DHBs) are trialling the Triple P Positive Parenting Programme: MidCentral, Bay of Plenty, Counties-Manukau and Waitemata.

“Research shows that providing parents with information and support reduces parental distress and social and health problems in children.

"This programme doesn't tell parents how to parent, it gives them practical advice and skills they can use to help them manage the challenges we all face when we're raising our children.

“Parents often talk to a range of professionals involved in the care of their children, such as GPs and early childhood teachers, about the stresses of parenting or concerns about their child’s behaviour. Once they have completed the Triple P training, these professionals can now offer support and information to parents.

As part of the programme, parents will be able attend free community workshops to discuss common parenting issues or have one-on-one sessions. If additional support is required, they can also be referred to specialist services.

To date, 56 professionals in MidCentral and Bay of Plenty DHB areas have completed the Triple P training. Training in the two other pilot areas will start soon.

Independent evaluation of the programme in Australia found more than 90 per cent of parents who took part are more confident in their parenting, and six months after parents had been part of the programme children were behaving significantly better.
