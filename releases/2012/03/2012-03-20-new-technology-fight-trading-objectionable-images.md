Investigators tackling the trading of child sexual abuse photos on the Internet will now find it easier to detect objectionable images, Internal Affairs Minister Amy Adams says.

Internal Affairs’ Censorship Compliance Unit has been working with Microsoft on the development of PhotoDNA, world-class technology designed to identify and remove images that exploit or endanger children.

The technology will allow investigators to detect and process objectionable images more efficiently as well as re-examine the methods they use to review the images.

“The trading of objectionable images of children is abhorrent to me and most New Zealanders, and as a government we will be doing what we can to stop it,” Ms Adams says.

“New Zealand is one of the first countries in the world to have access to this technology, which gives investigators another valuable tool to help us in the fight against this problem.

“Millions of objectionable images are circulating the internet and PhotoDNA could help rescue the victims of abuse and find the offenders.

“During the forensic analysis of a seized computer system, it is common for the Censorship Compliance Unit to review more than 100,000 image files. This technology will make the process much faster.

“It will also allow a greater level of information sharing with our international partners as more systems come online that use this technology.”
