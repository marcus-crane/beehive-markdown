Trade Minister Tim Groser departs for China today to help businesses open doors as part of the Government’s China Strategy. Mr Groser will travel to Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing.

He will lead a delegation of 17, mainly China-based New Zealand company representatives. The China-based representatives are mostly Mandarin speakers, which gives them an important advantage in the market. “This shows how New Zealand companies are becoming savvier and better prepared in their approach to China,” Mr Groser said. The companies represented are from a wide range of sectors, from tourism to clean-tech reflecting New Zealand’s growing diversity of business interests in China.

In Beijing, Mr Groser will hold a series of meetings with the Chinese Government, including his counterpart Minister Chen Deming. He will also address China’s pre-eminent economic ‘think tank’, the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges and give a speech at the Beijing University of International Business and Economics on international trade and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

In Shanghai, Mr Groser’s programme includes attending the launches of a New Zealand infant formula maker and a Southland sheep and dairy company. He will also attend a promotion of New Zealand seafood and wine – two priority sectors for growth identified in the Government’s China Strategy.

Following Shanghai Mr Groser arrives in Chongquin, a city of 32 million people, and a major industrial hub and transport centre linking China’s prosperous Eastern and developing Western provinces. Many are describing Chongqing as the new Shanghai: per capita income increased six fold from 2002 to 2009 and the region’s economy grew by 17 percent in 2010.

While in Chongquin, Mr Groser and the delegation will attend a business networking event, and a banquet hosted by Chongqing's Mayor, Huang Qifan.

Mr Groser will be accompanied on the visit by new National list MP Dr Jian Yang.
