A total of 9616 training places will be available in 2012 for 16 and 17 year olds under the Government's Youth Guarantee Scheme, Tertiary Education, Skills & Employment Minister Steven Joyce and Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

The Government is investing more than $100 million in the Youth Guarantee Scheme in 2012, which encompasses fees-free tertiary places at levels 1-3 for 16 and 17 year olds, and Trades Academies.

“In 2012 there will be 7345 fees-free Youth Guarantee places available through Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics, Wānanga and Private Training Establishments, including priority trade areas such as carpentry, engineering, horticulture, plumbing, gas fitting and brick and block laying,” Mr Joyce says.

“By amalgamating Youth Training into Youth Guarantee, an additional 4663 fees-free places in tertiary education courses have been created by the Government this year.”

Ms Parata says there has also been a significant increase in demand for places in Trades Academies.

“Enrolments have trebled this year with 1936 learners studying at 16 trades academies which is well up on the 625 who participated last year. Numbers are set to increase further with another five trades academies set to open later this year,” Ms Parata says.

“I’m delighted that different parts of the education community are pulling together to offer more choices for our young people. Over a third of all secondary schools are now part of a trades academy partnership.”

“The Youth Guarantee Scheme gives young people the opportunity to gain practical skills and a career, particularly those at risk of dropping out of school,” the Ministers said.

“The large interest in Youth Guarantee speaks volumes about how much they enjoy learning in this different environment.”
