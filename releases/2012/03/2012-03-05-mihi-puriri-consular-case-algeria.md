Foreign Minister Murray McCully has confirmed today that he requested late last week that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade internally review the events around the Mihi Puriri consular case in Algeria.

"I'm aware of some criticism of aspects of the Ministry's management of this case," Mr McCully said.

"It seems to me the best way to deal with these criticisms is for the Ministry to report to me briefly on the actions taken so that we can see if any further lines of enquiry are called for.

"In the meantime I can confirm that Ministry officials in Cairo are doing everything they can to support Mihi Puriri and to maintain contact with the family.

"I have seen media reports suggesting that Ministry staff might have breached Algerian law in certain respects in attempting to assist Mihi Puriri.

"I have no information which would lend support to those reports.

"While the New Zealand Government cannot interfere in the judicial processes of another country, the Ministry will continue to provide whatever consular assistance and support is possible to Mihi Puriri and her family."
