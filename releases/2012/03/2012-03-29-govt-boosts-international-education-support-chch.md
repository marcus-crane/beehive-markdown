The Government is boosting its support for the Christchurch international education sector with a dedicated $5 million fund that will promote the city overseas as an education destination over the next four years, Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Steven Joyce announced today.

“Christchurch is normally our second largest destination for international students and the city has an international reputation for very high-quality education,” Mr Joyce says.

“It has been a tough time for all providers of international education in Christchurch following the earthquakes with a 37 per cent drop in numbers in 2011. It is inevitable it will take time for confidence in the region to bounce back.

“The Government is working to assist international student levels in Canterbury recover to pre-quake levels. This extra $5 million will be additional to Education New Zealand’s nationwide marketing budget. It will go a long way to sending the message globally that Canterbury providers are back in business and students are welcome.”

“As Christchurch moves into its rebuilding phase, it is the right time to start encouraging more overseas students to study in the city’s schools, universities, polytechs and private training establishments.

“Education New Zealand has been working closely with these providers and industry to increase overseas enrolments again.

“The Government has an ambitious goal of doubling the economic value of New Zealand’s international education sector to $5 billion over the next 15 years.

“Having Christchurch back on its feet and growing again is a crucial part of this plan.”
