ACC Minister Judith Collins today announced she is taking action against two Labour Party MPs and one media organisation under the Defamation Act.

“Untrue and defamatory statements have been made about me and my conduct in relation to the handling of information I received concerning an ACC claimant.

“I value my reputation and take very seriously any accusations that I have acted improperly. This is not a course of action I take lightly.

“I have made myself extremely clear from the outset, that neither I, nor my office, has played any part in the release of the claimant’s name to the media.

“The Privacy Commissioner is now investigating the issue, which is the right thing to do.

“I fully support the Privacy Commissioner and welcome her report on the matter,” Ms Collins said.
