Australia’s Foreign Minister designate, Bob Carr, will arrive in Auckland on Friday for a two day visit, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

“I am delighted to welcome Bob Carr on his first overseas trip in his new capacity,” Mr McCully said.

“He is well known as a friend of New Zealand and brings a wealth of experience and expertise to his new role.

“The trans-Tasman relationship is a special one for both countries and is reflected in our close cooperation on the international stage.

"I look forward to sharing New Zealand’s perspective on developments in our Pacific neighbourhood, as well as challenges and opportunities emerging across the Asia-Pacific region and around the globe.”

Bob Carr was announced as Foreign Minister last week by Prime Minister Julia Gillard. He served as Premier of New South Wales from 1995 to 2005.

Mr Carr’s programme will include talks with Mr McCully and a meeting with Prime Minister John Key. He will also meet with the Minister of Defence and the Leader of the Opposition.
