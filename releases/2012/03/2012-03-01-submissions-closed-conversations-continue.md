Social Development Minister Paula Bennett thanks New Zealanders for responding to the Green Paper on Vulnerable Children and encourages continued discussion.

“A big thank you to everyone who joined me in this debate, submissions have closed but the debate goes on and that’s how it should be,” says Ms Bennett.

The Government, Green Paper Champions and Ministry of Social Development have held 68 Green Paper meetings since the Green Paper was launched in July last year.

"I personally fronted up at 17 public meetings from Kaitaia all the way to Invercargill."

Submissions to the Green Paper closed at midnight Tuesday 28 February and over 8,800 submissions have been received, with postal submissions still being counted.

Themes emerging from submissions and public meetings include the need for greater information sharing, support for parents, monitoring children from birth and mandatory reporting of suspected abuse and neglect.

“I brought the Green Paper debate to New Zealanders and they turned out in huge numbers with constructive ideas, delivered with attitude and passion,” says Ms Bennett.

“Some ideas were just good old fashioned Kiwi common sense, some were incredibly detailed, some require changes to legislation. All are being considered as part of the White Paper process,” she said.

Work will now begin on the White Paper and from that a ten year Children’s Action Plan will be developed to be released midway through this year.
