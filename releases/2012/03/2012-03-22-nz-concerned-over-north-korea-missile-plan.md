Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully says he has serious concerns about North Korea's plans to launch a satellite next month using a long-range ballistic missile.

"The government has been cautiously optimistic about North Korea's recent agreement with the United States to put a moratorium on long-range missile launches," Mr McCully says.

"This latest announcement from North Korea is therefore very disappointing. The use of ballistic missile technology to conduct the proposed launch is inconsistent both with that agreement and with UN Security Council resolutions.

"The government strongly urges North Korea to abandon its launch plan, work with the international community and stop its nuclear weapons programme," Mr McCully says.
