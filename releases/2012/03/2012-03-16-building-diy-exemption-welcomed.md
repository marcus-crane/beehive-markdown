A major step towards ensuring better buildings can be built faster has been taken with Parliament passing the Building Amendment Act 2012.

Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson says the Act is part of a package of reforms designed to lift standards in the building and construction sector and give homeowners added peace of mind.

The new law allows, among other things, for DIYers to continue to build or renovate their own homes while protecting future purchasers of the property. It also cuts red tape and speeds up the building process by introducing Risk Based Consenting which will come into force once the sector is ready.

The Licensed Building Practitioners regime has also started.

“At the end of February, 16,335 building practitioners had applied for 22,030 licenses - and that scheme has become the quality benchmark for the industry,” Mr Williamson says.

“People wouldn’t want an unlicensed pilot or an electrician. It’s just as important that we have tradespeople who are assessed as competent to undertake the critical design, structure and weathertight elements of what is often a New Zealander’s largest investment – their family home.

“The owner-builder exemption allows DIYers to continue carrying out building work but they must take responsibility for that work and this will be kept on the Council’s property records for future owners to see.”

Mr Williamson says the next step is the Building Amendment Bill No. 4, which includes a number of consumer protections and remedies.
