The Defence Minister, Hon Dr Jonathan Coleman, officially welcomed the first of the Air Force’s new medium utility NH90 helicopters at an event in Wellington today.

The NH90 helicopters will be the most advanced and capable helicopter the Air Force has ever had,” said Dr Coleman.

“The NH90s will considerably improve the Defence Force’s ability to conduct military, counter-terrorism, disaster relief, search and rescue, and other operations,” he said.

“This milestone illustrates that we are delivering on the plan laid out in the Defence White Paper. Like other defence forces around the world we are reprioritising our resources to provide up-to-date capability for a 21st century Defence Force. The NH90 is an outstanding example of the modernisation process so far,” said Dr Coleman.

In total eight NH90s have been purchased for operations, with a ninth to be used for parts. The first two of these new helicopters is now ready for training purposes within New Zealand.

The new helicopters can carry up to 18 passengers. They can lift an army Light Operational Vehicle (LOV), or up to 3,200kgs of cargo. The NH90s have twin engines for better safety over water.

The NH90s will eventually replace the fleet of 12 Iroquois, which have been in use for more than 40 years.

“We are delighted to have the NH90 helicopters as part of our new fleet. They are an important part of the Defence Force of the future,” said Dr Coleman.

**NH90 FAQs**

**1. What type of helicopter is the NH90?**

The NH90 is an advanced medium utility helicopter, capable of undertaking a wide variety of roles.

It was developed to meet a European requirement to replace a range of aging helicopters. The NH90 is a product of more than 10 years of development and testing to meet stringent capability and low maintenance requirements.

The helicopter incorporates new and sustainable technologies and will ensure greater compatibility with our security partners. The NH90 represents a substantial improvement on the Iroquois and will provide the NZDF with a contemporary, highly capable and deployable helicopter.

**2. What is the NH90’s role and what sort of tasks can it be used for?**

The NH90 will be used for frontline military and civil operations. It has the capability to support ground operations, counter terrorism, disaster relief, search and rescue and counter-drug operations.

It will be available to support other Government agencies, for example, Police, Customs, Maritime NZ, Civil Defence, and the Department of Conservation will all be able to make effective use of the NH90.

The fleet of eight NH90s will be acquired with a logistics and support package which includes a range of ongoing provisions for spare parts, project costs, training, software, publications support and equipment.

The total cost of eight NH90s and the full support and logistics package is $771million. The support and logistics costs represent over a third of this total.

The budget for the helicopter project has been allocated through the ten-year Defence Long Term Development Plan.

**6. Who makes the NH90?**

Nato Helicopter Industries (NHI) formed in 1992 through an inter-company agreement between four partner companies: Eurocopter (France), Eurocopter Deutschland (Germany), Agusta Westland (Italy) and Stork Fokker (Netherlands).

**11. When will the NH90 fleet be fully operational?**
