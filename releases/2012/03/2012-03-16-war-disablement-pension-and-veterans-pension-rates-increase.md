The War Disablement Pension and Veteran’s Pension payment rates will increase from 1 April as part of the annual cost of living adjustment, the Minister of Veterans’ Affairs Nathan Guy has confirmed today.

“A 1.77 percent increase will be made to the payment rates of War Disablement Pension and Veteran’s Pension, which reflects increases to the Consumers Price Index (CPI),” says Mr Guy.

“This adjustment is made every year to ensure that veterans are not disadvantaged by the rising cost of living.”

Examples of the increases are:

- A veteran, who is 65 years of age or over and in receipt of a 100 percent War Disablement Pension, will now receive a tax-free payment of $202.57 per week, in addition to the Veteran’s Pension or NZ Superannuation, or any other assistance such as a disability allowance.
- Those veterans who are aged over 60 and who suffer from severe disablement, may receive a War Disablement Pension of up to $356.52 per week in addition to the Veteran’s Pension and/or any other government assistance.
- A couple on Veteran’s Pension will receive $604.80 (gross), an increase from $588.16 per week.

In addition to the War Disablement Pension, a range of other allowances have also been increased. All of these payments are tax free and paid in addition to employment income or other financial assistance such as the Veteran’s Pension or NZ Superannuation.

As at 31 January 2012 there are 12,246 veterans in receipt of a War Disablement Pension and a further 5,981 Surviving Spouse Pension recipients who will benefit through the annual cost of living adjustment.
