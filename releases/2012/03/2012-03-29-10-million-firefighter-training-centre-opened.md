A $10 million state-of-the-art extension to the Fire Service’s National Training Centre in Rotorua was officially opened today by Internal Affairs Minister Amy Adams.

Ms Adams says the facilities will meet firefighters’ training needs well into the future.

“Firefighters are an integral part of our community and during a crisis we rely on them to protect and help us. We need to ensure our firefighters have access to the best training possible.

“Until now, some of the more specialised training had to be done in Australia, but this facility means that firefighters throughout the country now have access to world class facilities.”

The extension offers firefighters a number of training options, including replicating a house fire, a streetscape that includes a petrol station fitted with LPG containers, and a level crossing and tunnel to simulate train accidents.

“A three-storey tower has also been built, which can be used to simulate incidents on a ship, hotel or industrial building.

“The training centre will also be available for other emergency services including Police, the Defence Force and Civil Defence.

“We know from events such as the earthquakes in Canterbury and the Pike River tragedy the importance of emergency services working together effectively.”
