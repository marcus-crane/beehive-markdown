Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams has welcomed news that MediaWorks intends to utilise the early payment option in its contract for its broadcasting licences, more than two years ahead of schedule.

Nine broadcasters, including RadioWorks – a subsidiary of MediaWorks, chose to take up the Government's offer of a deferred payment scheme in 2010 for their 20-year spectrum licences.

"The purpose of the arrangement was to help take the financial pressure off broadcasters during what was a very difficult economic period," says Ms Adams.

"The Government recognised that some licensees may have had difficulty paying the one-off lump-sum renewal payments for their spectrum licenses and offered to provide the radio industry with some short-term flexibility of payment terms to assist it during the economic downturn.

"I look forward to the formal approach from RadioWorks. Once they have made the full payment, it will be the end of its arrangement with the Government.

“There are still another seven smaller licence holders on the scheme. They are all up to date with their payments, and final payments are due in October 2014."
