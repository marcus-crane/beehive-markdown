Civil Defence Minister Chris Tremain today launched New Zealand ShakeOut, the biggest earthquake public education campaign ever staged in New Zealand.

“The ShakeOut campaign will last for six months, and will include radio and television advertisements, a social media campaign, and promotional activities around the country. This will culminate in a nationwide earthquake drill on 26 September,” says Mr Tremain.

“New Zealand ShakeOut is for everyone. I encourage workplaces, schools and families to get involved. The Ministry of Education is supporting the drill by encouraging all schools in the country to participate. I was pleased to be able to launch the campaign at Owhiro Bay School in Wellington.

“The campaign includes a website at [www.getthru.govt.nz](http://www.getthru.govt.nz). People can visit the website to get information on earthquakes, preparedness, and the ShakeOut drill in September.

“Ensuring that we are prepared will help us to get through any future earthquakes. I encourage all households to make an emergency plan, assemble a survival kit, and identify safe places within the home.”

The nationwide “Drop, Cover and Hold” earthquake drill will take place at 9:26 am on 26 September (9:26-26:9). New Zealand ShakeOut aims to have one million New Zealanders taking part.
