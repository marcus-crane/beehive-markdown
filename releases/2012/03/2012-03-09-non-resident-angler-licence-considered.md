The Government is considering a proposal to establish differential fishing licences for overseas anglers, Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson announced today.

Last year the Minister asked Fish and Game NZ to provide a report on the rationale on for a non- resident fishing licence and charging a differential licence fee for visiting anglers fishing in Fish and Game New Zealand regions.

This report, which included input from the Department of Conservation, then went out for public consultation.

Ms Wilkinson says New Zealanders are understandably passionate about their trout and other sports fisheries and backcountry angling is a major tourism draw-card.

“Surveys by Fish and Game show that international anglers typically target these remote waters more intensively and over longer periods than New Zealand anglers.

“Fresh water fisheries are expensive to maintain and while visiting anglers use these waterways frequently they contribute less to their management than local anglers.

“A non-resident licence has been proposed as a means of developing a pricing structure that is both more equitable to the New Zealand anglers who helped create and maintain the fisheries, and consistent with other high-quality international fishing destinations.”

Approximately 70 submissions were received from the public, 66 per cent of which supported establishing a non-residents licence and charging a higher licence fee for non-residents.

“Such input will help ensure any new licence is well targeted and achieves the desired outcomes for the management of New Zealand's renowned recreational freshwater sports fishery,” Ms Wilkinson says.

The Fish and Game Council and DOC will consider the submissions and undertake further discussions with interested parties, including iwi.

A proposal for any new non-resident sports fishing licence, including appropriate fee level and other advice, will then be provided to the Conservation Minister for consideration.
