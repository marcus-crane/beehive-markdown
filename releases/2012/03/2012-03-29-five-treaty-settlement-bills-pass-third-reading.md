The House today passed five bills giving effect to historical Treaty of Waitangi settlements, the most Treaty bills passed in any calendar year since the settlement process began in the 1990s.

“Today marks the end of a long journey to settlement for Ngāti Manawa, Ngāti Whare, Ngāti Maniapoto, Ngāti Porou and Ngāti Pāhauwera,” Mr Finlayson said.

“It also shows the pay-off for accelerating the settlement process over recent years. Now we are seeing the end result of that hard work, which is settlement legislation being passed by Parliament so that iwi can benefit from the resolution of their claims and we can put these grievances behind us as a nation.”

Five bills received their third readings today, which is already a greater number than in any previous calendar year. In the ten years to 2009, on average only 1.4 Treaty bills were passed each year.

“This government has successfully increased the speed at which outstanding negotiations are conducted and concluded, through leadership and better resourcing and strategy,” Mr Finlayson said. “As the Human Rights Commission pointed out in a recent report, the rate at which we have reached negotiation milestones has increased dramatically since 2008.”

“However, all remaining settlements must be legislated by Parliament in order to ensure they are just and durable, and to demonstrate the Crown’s commitment to fixing the injustices of the past.”

“The members of this House are to be congratulated on their constructive approach – from the way parties have engaged in debate and select committee examination of the legislation, to the use of innovative methods to progress Treaty bills this year by sitting extended hours.”

Parliament’s Business Committee agreed to sit extended hours between 9 am and 1 pm today for the third readings of the Ngāti Manawa and Ngāti Whare settlement bills (which were debated as cognate bills) and the Maniapoto Waipa River settlement bill. The Ngāti Pahauwera and Ngāti Porou settlement bills were debated during ordinary sitting hours in the afternoon.

Copies of the deeds of settlement are available on the Office of Treaty Settlements’ website www.ots.govt.nz
