Energy and Resources Minister Phil Heatley heads overseas today to attend the 13th International Energy Forum Ministerial Meeting in Kuwait.

The IEF is the world’s largest gathering of Energy Ministers. Its 88 member countries account for 90 per cent of global oil and gas supply and demand. It is the world’s leading forum for producer/consumer dialogue within the global energy sector, and on energy issues affecting the world.

During the Forum the Minister will meet overseas counterparts and company representatives from the exploration and production and services sectors.

“The Forum is a golden opportunity to improve our understanding of the major issues and challenges facing the global energy market,” Mr Heatley said.

Mr Heatley will also make diplomatic calls in Qatar, on his way to Kuwait. He returns to New Zealand on 16 March.
