Prime Minister John Key says he is incredibly sad at the news Jock Hobbs has lost his battle with leukaemia.

“I have known Jock for a long time and have enjoyed his company on many an occasion. We have talked and laughed and discussed the country’s political and sporting problems. I will miss him very much.”

Jock Hobbs died this afternoon after a long illness.

He played 21 tests as a flanker for the All Blacks from 1983 to 1986.

“Jock was the man who convinced Dublin that New Zealand should host last year’s Rugby World Cup. This was possibly his finest hour. Winning the trophy was certainly one of New Zealand’s finest hours,” says Mr Key.

“Jock was a man whose determination drove him to many successes in his life. It was that determination that saw him wage war against his illness for a prolonged period.

“I know I join with Jock’s wife Nicky, his four children, and many friends in being very grateful for the time we had with him.

“I join with all of them in celebrating his life and knowing that ours will be the poorer without him.”
