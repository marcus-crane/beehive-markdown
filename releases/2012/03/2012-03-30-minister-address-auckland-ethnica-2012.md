Ethnic Affairs Minister Judith Collins will tomorrow acknowledge the contribution ethnic people make to our country at the first of four EthnicA conferences to be held around New Zealand.

Ms Collins said our migrants and ethnic communities bring an extraordinary amount of talent and skill to our shores, and we must harness their potential.

"The Government recognises the important role ethnic and migrant communities play in boosting our country’s reputation and economic performance.

“Unlocking that potential can benefit all of New Zealand, helping boost exports and create more jobs.

“We are continually looking for new ways to attract the world’s talent to our shores, and to retain those who are already here,” Ms Collins said.

Around one in four New Zealanders is now born overseas, with 60 per cent of New Zealand’s workforce growth coming from migrants.

Ms Collins said the EthnicA conferences will focus on how to best expand connections both with and between our ethnic communities.

“New Zealand’s diversity is a very positive force. It has helped us create connections that span the globe, broaden our horizons and enhance our entrepreneurial spirit.

“We will continue to welcome those migrants who want to work hard, get ahead and contribute to making a good country great.”
