Prime Minister John Key will travel to the Republic of Korea this Saturday to attend the second Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul on 26-27 March.

"The Nuclear Security Summit process is an initiative of US President Barack Obama and our objective is to work towards securing nuclear materials and reducing the global threat from nuclear terrorism," Mr Key says.

"As one of 50 countries invited to take part in the Summit, New Zealand is committed to playing its part in this important effort."

Mr Key’s visit will also coincide with the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between New Zealand and the Republic of Korea. He will hold a bilateral meeting with President Lee Myung-bak to discuss further strengthening the relationship between the two countries.

"When I last visited the Republic of Korea in 2010, I agreed with President Lee that 2012 would be designated the Korea-New Zealand Year of Friendship."

"We have strong and wide ranging ties with Korea. One of the aims of my visit will be to progress negotiations on a bilateral Free Trade Agreement. Korea is our fifth largest trading partner, with two-way trade worth around $3 billion.

"A free trade agreement between the two countries would unlock the potential for greater trade, investment and people flows between our two countries."

Mr Key also plans to use the opportunity to have a number of bilateral meetings with some of the leaders of the 50 countries invited to the Summit.

The Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul is the second of three Summits. The first was held in Washington in 2010 and the third will be held in 2014.

Mr Key arrives back in New Zealand on Wednesday 28 March.
