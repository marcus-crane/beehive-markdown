Associate Minister of Housing, Tariana Turia has congratulated Ngati Hine Health Trust for opening the Moerewa Housing Project today, and also Te Matapihi He Tirohanga mo te iwi Trust for hosting the National Maori Housing Conference, after attending both events this morning in Northland.

Hon Tariana Turia said “I am very excited by the housing developments and initiatives being undertaken by tangata whenua groups. The events I attended today, were inspirational, and I congratulate them both, for the work they are doing towards addressing Maori housing need, and also participation by Maori in the housing sector.”

“The Moerewa Housing Project shows how Ngati Hine, an iwi provider, can utilise their land base and their collective strength to provide housing for kuia and kaumatua, as well as whanau who cannot afford to purchase their own homes. It is a shining example of how tangata whenua can contribute to the social housing needs of their community” said Hon Turia

“The project also demonstrates how iwi and the Government are able to work in partnership to produce mutually beneficial outcomes. I congratulate Ngati Hine for their foresight and leadership in the area of Maori housing.”

Hon Turia added “the National Maori Housing Conference, also held today, provides a forum for tangata whenua to come together to vision, share knowledge, and plan their future in the housing arena.”

“I was pleased to be able to address the conference, and to signal my intentions over the next three years, which will be to further support iwi and Maori participation in social housing.”

“What I was most impressed with today, was the clear moves that Maori are making to not only support the strategic developments in housing, but also witnessing a practical example of what can be achieved through partnerships, relationships and through supporting iwi self-determination in these areas” said Hon Turia.

“I wish both initiatives well, and look forward to the progress made in this space for and by tangata whenua in the future.”
