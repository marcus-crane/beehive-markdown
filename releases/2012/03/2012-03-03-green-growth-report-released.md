The report of the Green Growth Advisory Group was released today at the annual Bluegreens Forum at Lake Pupuke, North Shore, with 26 recommendations for the Government to consider.

“This is a useful report for bringing together policies that will help the Government build a more productive and competitive economy, while meeting environmental objectives,” Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce says.

“We see real opportunities for New Zealand in industries covered in the report such as the food and beverage industry, tourism, high-value manufacturing and services, and the petroleum and minerals sector.”

“The Government agrees with the report’s conclusion that New Zealand needs a broad growth strategy where all sectors take into account their environmental performance rather than focusing on a few green industries.”

Dr Smith says: “There is significant national and international interest in how to achieve strong economic growth that delivers jobs with policies that improve the environment. This report reinforces the value of the achievements of our first term in areas like water, waste and climate change but also new ideas for us to consider in this term.”

“It will feed into New Zealand’s contributions to the OECD Environment Roundtable in March and the UN Rio +20 Conference, both of which are focused on green growth.”

“This report has a wide range of recommendations covering many portfolios that Ministers will need to now carefully consider. We thank the Advisory Group members, particularly Chair Phil O ’Reilly for his work and the many businesses and organisations that have contributed,” the Ministers say.
