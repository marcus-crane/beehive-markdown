The Minister of Māori Affairs, Dr Pita Sharples, is encouraging people to make submissions on a [*Māori Economic Development Panel: Discussion Document*](http://www.tpk.govt.nz/en/consultation/medp/) which was released today

“Māori are significant players in the New Zealand economy, with assets worth $36.9 billion, but when Māori realise our full potential, we can contribute so much more than we do already,” Dr Sharples says.

The independent panel have been asked to develop a Māori Economic Development Strategy and Action Plan to improve the performance and productivity of the whole Māori economy; including iwi assets and other collectively-held assets, Māori businesses, and whānau and households.

The panel, chaired by Ngāhiwi Tomoana, is seeking submissions on the *Māori Economic Development Panel: Discussion Document*. The document notes that the Māori and New Zealand economies are at an important crossroads with significant challenges and opportunities ahead.

“We need to lift economic growth generally in order to lift incomes and improve living standards for all New Zealanders,” Dr Sharples says.

“At the same time we need to improve Māori participation and contribution to the New Zealand economy and improve Māori socio-economic outcomes. To ignore this will add ongoing costs to the community and economy now and into the future.” 

The panel will also hold three engagement hui: Wellington on 22 March 2012, Auckland on 29 March and Christchurch on 30 March.

Written submissions are due by no later than 11 April 2012 and can be sent to: [MEDP@tpk.govt.nz](mailto:MEDP@tpk.govt.nz) or The Māori Economic Development Panel, c/o Te Puni Kōkiri, PO Box 3943, Wellington.

The panel will make recommendations on how to align the Government’s internationally-focused economic growth strategy with iwi/Māori economic priorities. It is expected to report back to both Ministers on their proposed Strategy and Action Plan by the end of July 2012.
