Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee has today launched the first of six new two-car trains for Wellington’s Johnsonville line.

“Today’s launch of the Matangi trains represents another chapter in the significant investment in the Wellington metropolitan rail network and is testament to the cooperation of local and central government,” says Mr Brownlee.

The government has committed $258 million through a Crown appropriation to the Greater Wellington Regional Council for the introduction of the Matangi trains on Wellington’s commuter rail network. It has also agreed a rail funding and ownership package for Wellington that fairly shares the costs and responsibilities for delivering any future improvements to Wellington’s commuter rail system.

“With the introduction of Matangi trains to the Johnsonville line, the number of Matangi trains commissioned for service in Wellington has risen to at least 25 two-car units. Three further two-car trains will be arriving by the end of the month and all trains are expected to be in Wellington within six months and operational by the end of the year.

“This is great news for commuters, and hopefully their arrival will go some way towards easing the frustrations they have experienced recently. These new trains have air conditioning, extra capacity and better access including for those in wheelchairs.”

Although the Johnsonville line is only 10.5kms long, over 100,000 journeys are made on it every month. KiwiRail has led infrastructure development on the line with funding from the government. This work has included enlarging tunnels and upgrading platforms.
