The Government welcomes the news of the sale of Pike River Mine to Solid Energy, Energy and Resources Minister Phil Heatley said today.

“This is a positive step towards a commercial re-opening of the mine. We expect Solid Energy to commit to use its best endeavours to recover the bodies of the deceased miners.

“Any plan for re-opening the mine and recovering the bodies will need to be safe and credible. The Government is not prepared to see any further lives lost at the mine,” says Mr Heatley.

The Government will work with the receivers and Solid Energy regarding the transfer of the Mining Permit and access arrangements, as well as the establishment of a trust to oversee efforts to enter the mine and facilitate body recovery.
