Associate Minister of Education, Craig Foss has today announced Learning Infrastructure Partners as the Preferred Bidder for the first school property public private partnership (PPP) in New Zealand.

Learning Infrastructure Partners was one of three consortia short listed. The proposals were reviewed by the Ministry of Education, Treasury officials and specialist advisors.

The Ministry has entered into negotiations with Learning Infrastructure Partners. If successful, the consortium will design, construct, finance and maintain the new Hobsonville Point primary and secondary schools’ for the next 25 years.

“This is an important step in the process towards the first school property PPP being completed in New Zealand,” says Mr Foss.

“I’m confident Learning Infrastructure Partners is up to the task of creating world class facilities for 21st century learners, this is important because the PPP model transfers all risk onto the private partner”

“The exact contract cost is still being negotiated, but it will be less than the public sector comparative” says Mr Foss.

“Having a private partner managing school facilities will give the School Boards and teaching staff more time to focus on student learning and achievement.’’

The Learning Infrastructure Partners consortium includes firms with significant experience in designing, building and maintaining New Zealand schools, including Hawkins (lead construction), ASC and PPA architects (design), and Programmed Facility Management (facilities management).

The new primary school at Hobsonville Point is scheduled to open at the start of 2013 and the secondary school is due to open at the start of 2014.
