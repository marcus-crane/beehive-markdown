Minister for Social Development Paula Bennett was saddened to hear news of the passing of Rev Dr Hone Kaa and sends her condolences to his whanau and iwi.

“Dr Kaa was a passionate New Zealander and strong community leader who will be dearly missed by all who knew him,” says Ms Bennett.

“My thoughts are with his grieving family and the wider Maori community who with Dr Kaa’s passing have lost an influential leader.”

“Dr Kaa was a respected member of the Independent Experts Forum on child abuse formed in 2009 to identify steps to prevent child abuse and neglect,” says Ms Bennett.

“I will remember him as a leader who worked to ensure the well being of Maori children and for his contribution to the Experts Forum which led to changes to better protect all New Zealand children,” she said.

As both a senior priest and kaumatua, Dr Kaa was a strong supporter of programmes that furthered Maori education and the protection of children and their families.
