The Minister for State-owned Enterprises, Hon Tony Ryall has reappointed three directors and appointed one new director to the Board of Mighty River Power Ltd (MRP).

"MRP will be the first company the Government wants to offer shares in, so it will be important that membership of the Board is settled well in advance of the listing process," said Mr Ryall.

Joan Withers is being reappointed as the Chair for a further three years.

Ms Withers is one of New Zealand’s most experienced and senior directors, whose current director roles include Chair of Auckland International Airport Ltd and Deputy Chair of Television New Zealand Ltd.

Keith Smith, also a highly experienced listed company director, is being reappointed for a further three years. Tania Simpson, who has served on the Board since 2001, is to remain as a director for a further 18 months to provide continuity through the listing process.

Mr Ryall also announced the appointment of James Miller as a new director of MRP. Mr Miller has a deep understanding of the electricity industry, combined with extensive skills in the capital markets space, which will assist MRP as it becomes a listed company. He is a director of listed companies NZX Ltd and Auckland International Airport Ltd and a member of the Financial Markets Authority. He has resigned as a director of Vector Ltd, as that role would be incompatible with membership of the MRP Board.

Mr Miller’s appointment as a director of MRP is subject to him gaining an exemption under the Electricity Industry Act 2010, to allow him to be simultaneously a director of both Auckland International Airport Ltd (a lines company) and MRP. If that exemption is forthcoming from the Electricity Authority, Mr Miller will be appointed to the MRP Board either on, or after, 1 May 2012.
