New Zealand will provide $1 million to a United Nations food relief programme in the Sahel region of West Africa, Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"Poor rains, crop failure and high fuel prices have led to food shortages and malnutrition across the Sahel region," Mr McCully says.

"Almost nine million people need immediate food assistance and the crisis could affect 23 million people if essential needs are not addressed.

"The UN's World Food Programme is providing urgent food relief to combat malnutrition among one million people in Burkina Faso - especially young children and mothers.

"There are indications that the crisis could deteriorate into widespread famine on the scale of that seen in the Horn of Africa last year, and New Zealand is committed to the international effort to build food security in West Africa.

"We will continue to monitor the situation as it develops and will consider further assistance if required," Mr McCully says.
