Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully is welcoming today's announcement of a constitutional consultation process in Fiji.

"I regard this as a real step in the right direction," Mr McCully says.

"Inclusive public consultations on the shape of a constitution are an important step toward holding elections in Fiji.

"The international community will take a close interest in this process and the New Zealand government intends to give the process every opportunity to demonstrate its value."

Commodore Frank Bainimarama announced the consultations between the Constitutional Commission and the people of Fiji would take place between July and September this year.

The new constitution is expected to be adopted in March 2013..
