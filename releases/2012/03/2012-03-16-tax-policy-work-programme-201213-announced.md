“A sound tax system is a good platform for Government to begin consolidating and strengthening the economy and getting on with rebuilding” says Revenue Minister Peter Dunne.

Mr Dunne was speaking at the International Fiscal Association’s annual conference today where he released details of the Government’s tax policy work programme for the next eighteen months.

The new tax policy work programme consolidates the reforms to the tax system of recent years. Mr Dunne says that after the tax reforms of Budget 2010, the tax system is in good shape.

The work programme also supports the Government’s plan to get back to surplus through the responsible management of Government’s finances, says Mr Dunne.

The tax policy work programme for 2012/13 aims to support the government’s priorities to:

- responsibly manage the Government’s finances and tax system
- build a more competitive and productive economy
- deliver better public services
- rebuild Canterbury

The new tax policy work programme has a strong focus on increasing efficiency and fairness in the system. Amongst a range of initiatives intended to improve efficiency and fairness, the work programme also includes work on items first announced in Budget 2011 and further work relating to Student Loan repayments from overseas-based borrowers.

“Now, more than ever, it is essential to have a good, cost-effective tax system – one that collects the necessary revenue efficiently – meaning low economic costs, low compliance costs and low administrative costs” Mr Dunne says.
