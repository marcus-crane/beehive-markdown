Associate Minister of Health, Hon. Tariana Turia is delighted by the Fonterra Milk for Schools programme, which will be piloted across 112 schools in the Northland region – meaning some 10,000 children will directly benefit from the scheme.

Minister Turia said “this is a really positive step taken by Fonterra, one of the largest companies in New Zealand. Fonterra is providing leadership in supporting health and social outcomes for our children. My congratulations and thanks go to Theo Spierings (Fonterra CEO) for this exciting new initiative, which was launched today in Northland.”

“The Milk in Schools initiative provides a daily box of milk, which is important for children’s nutritional needs; it also provides schools with refrigerators to ensure children are served their milk chilled. Milk is an essential building block for good nutrition” said Minister Turia.

“I am impressed with the measures Fonterra has put in place to mitigate the environmental impact of this programme, by developing a recycling process alongside the Milk in Schools initiative.”

“This is a fantastic programme for the schools involved. Fonterra should be commended for their action in working hard to give something back to our communities.”

Minister Turia said “I am particularly pleased that the pilot is taking place in Northland, which is an area of high need.”
