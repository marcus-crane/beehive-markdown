Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce has congratulated Orion Health for winning the Supreme Award at the New Zealand International Business Awards ceremony in Auckland last night.

“Orion is an internationally-recognised health information technology vendor and New Zealand’s largest privately-owned software exporter. Its major projects around the world have made it a significant global player in electronic health recording,” Mr Joyce says.

“It is important to acknowledge business people who have overcome often considerable challenges in offshore markets by taking risks, being clever and by sheer hard work and determination. They are the foundation on which our wealth rests.

As well as winning the Supreme Award, Orion Health won the Best Business Operating Internationally (over $50 million revenue) category. Vista Entertainment Solutions won the Best Business ($10m-$50m revenue) category, while Fastmount took out Best Business (under $10m revenue).

Westland Milk Products won the Best use of Research and Development in International Business category, Christchurch’s Energy Mad the Most Innovative Business Model in International Business and Auckland’s Everedge IP took out the Best Commercialisation of Intellectual Property in International Business category.

Two companies – Sistema Plastics and Triodent – shared the Best Use of Design in International Business category. Entrepreneurs Sarah Gibbs and Neville Jordan were named New Zealand’s Emerging and Outstanding Leader in International Business, respectively.

“The winners are all creating jobs and re-investing profits here, as well as developing new skills and technologies. Their stories show us how new ways of doing business internationally can reap rewards for New Zealand,” Mr Joyce says.

“And of course our companies wouldn’t succeed without inspired leadership. Sarah Gibbs and Neville Jordan are both passionate leaders prepared to go the extra mile for New Zealand globally and I applaud their enthusiasm and energy.”

The New Zealand International Business Awards are run by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise with the support of Strategic Partner ANZ. The special categories are supported by the Ministry of Science and Innovation, while KPMG supports the leadership awards.
