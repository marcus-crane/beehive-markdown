Associate Conservation Minister and UnitedFuture leader Peter Dunne today led legislation for a Game Animal Council to its First Reading in Parliament, delivering on a key provision of the party’s confidence and supply agreement with National.

“This Bill is a key part of UnitedFuture’s confidence and supply agreement and I am delighted we have been able to deliver on it so early in the parliamentary term,” Mr Dunne said.

The Game Animal Council will improve management of deer, tahr, chamois, and wild pigs, provide better hunting opportunities and advise the Conservation Minister on issues affecting the hunting sector.

It will also be able to inform and educate the hunting sector, promote firearms safety, education and training initiatives; raise awareness and advocate for the hunting sector; and conduct research into game animals and their management.

UnitedFuture has pushed for a Game Animal Council since its 2005 agreement with the previous Labour-led government.

“It has been quite a process, but we are just about there,” Mr Dunne said.

“The Game Animal Council will be a giant step forward in allowing hunters a greater stake in the management of their hunting resource.”

Mr Dunne said it should be noted that the Council would not change current free access for recreational hunter and will not dilute existing powers to manage wild animals to protect conservation values.

“New Zealand’s back country is a special place and part of our heritage as Kiwis. The Game Animal Council will be all about better enabling New Zealanders to use and enjoy it,” he said.
