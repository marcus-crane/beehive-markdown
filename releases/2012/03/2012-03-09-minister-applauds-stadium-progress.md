With just 15 days to go before the Crusaders take on the Cheetahs at the new Christchurch Stadium, Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has praised contractors for the remarkable feat of building a 17,000-seat facility in less than 100 days.

Mr Brownlee today toured the site and remarked on how much progress had been made since members of the media joined him to mark the first turf being laid three weeks ago.

“Over 400 workers have taken completion of this task on as a personal mission, and their effort really shows.

“All the turf has been laid, the light towers are up, two covered stands have been built, and corporate facilities are in place – it’s a stunning transformation,” Mr Brownlee said.

Next week the goal posts will go up and the pitch will be marked out.

“I want to thank those who live close to the construction site for their patience, especially when noisy work has been undertaken at night.

“Their wait and everyone else’s will soon be over, and with the return of the Crusaders to Christchurch, Cantabrians will have another part of their lives back,” Mr Brownlee said.

Tickets for the Crusaders versus the Cheetahs go on sale this Monday.
