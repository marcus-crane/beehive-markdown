Prime Minister John Key has announced that a high-level delegation led by the Governor-General will travel to Tonga for the state funeral of His Majesty King George Tupou V on Tuesday.

A Royal New Zealand Air Force Boeing 757 will depart New Zealand on Tuesday morning and return the same day.

“The Governor General, Lt General Right Honourable Sir Jerry Mateparae will be joined by Deputy Prime Minister Bill English, Minister of Foreign Affairs Murray McCully, Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Hekia Parata, Minister of Māori Affairs Pita Sharples, and Opposition Leader David Shearer,” says Mr Key.

Also on the flight will be Chief of the Royal New Zealand Navy, Rear Admiral Tony Parr, Auckland Mayor Len Brown, representatives of other parliamentary parties, heads of diplomatic missions, members of the Tongan community, and close friends of the late King.

“At this time the thoughts of the Government and the people of New Zealand are with His Majesty’s family, the people of Tonga, and the Tongan community in New Zealand,” says Mr Key.

Flags on government buildings in New Zealand will be flown at half-mast on the day of the funeral.
