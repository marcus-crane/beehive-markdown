Thank you for the opportunity to speak to your conference today about my government’s priorities for employment relations for the next three years.

I thought I should start by emphasising our Government’s driving goal – as articulated by the Prime Minister – which is to build a more competitive and internationally-focused economy with less debt, more jobs and higher incomes.

In particular, the Government has four priorities this term: To responsibly manage the Government’s finances; build a more competitive and productive economy; deliver better public services to New Zealanders, and to rebuild Christchurch.

In order to achieve these critical goals, it is important employment law is flexible and fair, that our health and safety system is working well, and that employment relations policy gives our businesses the confidence to take on staff, while ensuring the rights of employees are well-protected.

In the employment relations space, we have made good progress in our first term of government.

We’ve brought better balance to the workplace environment. This is through initiatives such as establishing the successful trial periods for new employees, raising the minimum wage, improving the Holidays Act, and streamlining the personal grievance system to help both employers and employees. Now employees also have the choice to cash up one week of annual leave or to transfer the observance of public holidays.

The introduction of 90-day trial periods alone is credited with creating 13,000 jobs in small business before we extended it to all employers.

I have also steadily raised the level of the minimum wage, maintaining a balance between the purchasing power of the low paid and the additional burden placed on employers.

Requirements around employment agreements have been strengthened and Labour Inspectors now have more tools to ensure that employees get their entitlements and there is a level playing field for employers.

Two new enforcement tools - Improvement Notices and Enforceable Undertakings - are proving very effective to ensure that workers in New Zealand enjoy pay and conditions as required under the law.

For example, the use of Improvement Notices has resulted in employers meeting obligations to provide a written employment agreement; while an Enforceable Undertaking ensures workers receive their proper pay entitlements.

These tools are an efficient middle step in the enforcement process through which Labour Inspectors and employers work together to improve the systems and practices of a business without needing to go to the Employment Relations Authority.  

**Priorities for this term**

[While the employment relations framework is generally working well, refinements are needed in some areas](). It is about increasing choice and flexibility for employers and employees and reducing compliance costs and unnecessary regulation.

We are keen to remove roadblocks to allow employers to grow their businesses, create jobs and contribute to New Zealand’s economic growth.

**Starting Out Wage**

Young people in New Zealand have been hit hard by the global recession and many are finding it difficult to get into work.

The removal of the Youth Minimum Wage in 2008 resulted in up to 9,000 fewer jobs, according to a study commissioned by the Department of Labour.

That’s why we are introducing the Starting Out Wage - which will give some of our youngest and most inexperienced workers valuable work experience and a much-needed foot in the door.

It will help employers give a young person a chance at work, in the same way our 90-day trial periods did last term, with great success.

The aim is to set the Starting Out Wage at 80 per cent of the adult minimum wage. Three groups of young people will be eligible:

- 16- and 17-year-olds in their first six months of work with a new employer.
- 18- and 19-year-olds entering the workforce after more than six months on a benefit.
- 16- to 19-year-old workers training in a recognised industry course involving at least 40 credits a year.

The Starting Out wage will complement other government initiatives to address youth unemployment, including the Welfare package recently announced by my colleague Paula Bennett.

Improving flexibility in collective bargaining

Some of the current rules around collective bargaining limit choice, flexibility and the effectiveness of the bargaining process.

We’re making a number of improvements to the Employment Relations Act this term to help provide a fair and flexible environment.

The first is to remove the requirement to conclude collective bargaining unless there are genuine reasons not to.

This requirement can lead to protracted negotiations in instances where agreement is clearly never going to be reached.

In many cases, it has resulted in workplace disruption and a deterioration of relationships between employers and unions – which is a damaging situation for both groups in terms of the success of the business going forward.

That is why we will return the Employment Relations Act to its original form in this respect – to keep the requirement to bargain in good faith, but not necessarily force the bargaining to end with a collective agreement.

In addition, I also intend to remove the rule whereby employers have to offer the terms of the collective agreement to a new employee for the first 30 days. This is currently a requirement regardless of whether the employee actually wants to become a union member or not.

Removing the 30-day requirement will enable employees to agree to the exact terms and conditions they want from the very beginning of their employment, whether on individual contract or union collective. 

Another planned change to collective bargaining will allow employers to opt out of negotiations for a multi-employer collective agreement (MECA), if it is not the right option for them. Currently they are forced to enter negotiations with their employees, their competitors and their competitor’s employees. DHBs may still choose MECAs but other businesses in competition with each other won’t be forced into them against their will.

Finally, in order to create a fairer bargaining environment, we intend to apply partial pay reductions for partial strikes or low-level industrial action.

Receiving full pay while on partial strike and not doing the full requirements of the job is not fair to employers. It can also mean low level industrial action, like not answering phone calls or doing any paperwork or training, can drag on with no end in sight.

Allowing partial pay reductions in these situations will create a fairer bargaining environment while giving parties a balanced incentive to reach agreement. It happens in other jurisdictions and should happen here.

These new policies, which require amendments to the Minimum Wage Act and Employment Relations Act, should be put before the House later this year.  

**Extension to flexible working arrangements**

We are also planning to improve flexible working arrangements.

At present the right to flexible working arrangements is only available to employees who are carers but we believe a much wider application can have benefits for communities, the economy and environment.

According to a survey by the Department of Labour in 2010, 74% of employers and 75% of employees said that the legal right to request flexible work arrangements should be available to all employees.

I want flexible working arrangements extended to all employees, allowing them to reach agreements with their employers. It’s about trusting them to reach agreement first without having to go through a formal process. 

As well as the changes I outlined briefly earlier, we have also made some changes to processes at the Employment Relations Authority (ERA) to improve its effectiveness, such as prioritising disputes that have already been to mediation. Members of the authority may now also make a written recommendation to the parties for consideration, and have the ability to dismiss matters that are frivolous or vexatious.

**Current industrial relations environment and mediation successes**

As you know, there has been some high profile industrial action taking place recently with the expiry of various collective agreements.

It is not my role to comment on the merits or otherwise of individual disputes – that is up to the parties to negotiate and resolve.

But, in contrast to what the headlines may make you think, I would like to point out that work stoppages continue to decrease. There were more than 53,000 work days lost in 1995 but that number had dropped to a little over 6,000 by 2010.  Today around 13 per cent of the workforce have collective agreements and less than 10 per cent in the private sector (figures as per 2010-11 Industrial Relations Centre annual report).

Parties in any industrial dispute over their collective agreement can of course access the mediators in the Department of Labour’s Mediation Service - which has had a good success rate. We have also appointed a chief mediator to deal with any complaints, ensure the service is run efficiently and effectively and liaise closely with the chief of the ERA.

The Service handles around 6000 requests for mediation on an annual basis, with parties resolving their issues in 80-85% of cases.  The disputes handled by mediators are wide ranging and include support for parties engaged in collective bargaining, early assistance mediation to assist in the preservation of employment relationships and to assist parties involved in grievances to achieve resolution in a timely and cost effective manner.

Mediation helped resolve some recent disputes where a small but key group of contract workers had issued a strike notice. Their planned complete withdrawal of labour had the potential to seriously disrupt production. Mediation successfully settled this dispute without the need for the strike action to occur.

**FCV Inquiry and protecting the rights of migrant workers**

The issue of labour standards on foreign charter vessels is one which our Government has taken strong action on, both by initiating

the Ministerial Inquiry into Foreign Charter Vessels and with our follow up action, after the inquiry panel reported.

The 15 recommendations touch on a wide range of ministerial portfolios, including fisheries, labour, immigration, transport and foreign affairs and trade.

The Government has already decided to accept in principle, and act on, the Inquiry Panel’s first six recommendations. These include updating the Code of Practice and strengthening the immigration approval process – both of which will help ensure better conditions for workers on FCVs.

There will also be closer inter-agency co-operation, to be overseen by an inter-agency steering group. This includes setting up a pilot programme for at-sea monitoring of compliance with fisheries, vessel safety and labour standards – targeting high-risk FCVs.

**Health and safety in the employment relations environment**

A major part of the labour portfolio and the effective operation of the employment and industrial relations landscape is ensuring employees work in environments that protect their health and safety.

Good health and safety practices are a fundamental element of a strong and positive employment relationship.

New Zealand has about one workplace death each week (although there were 41 work place deaths last year). On a per capita basis that is four times the rate of the United Kingdom. In farming alone, a farmer is killed every month and one is injured every 30 minutes.

To be blunt - it’s simply unacceptable.

So strengthening our health and safety system when it comes to workplaces is a major priority for me.

The Department of Labour is doing a huge amount of work in this area through its action plans targeting high risk sectors.

Firstly, in the aftermath of the Pike River tragedy, we have established the High Hazards Unit which is resourced to monitor and support operators of high-hazard facilities in the mining and petroleum industries to prevent major workplace accidents. This took the number of inspectors from two to eight – including a Chief Inspector Mines and a Chief Inspector Petroleum.

The Department has provided extensive information to the Royal Commission and we will be preparing and implementing the Government’s response to the Commission’s recommendations later in the year.

This tragedy, with the loss of 29 lives, has been devastating for the families and their community. We must ensure work place accidents like this never happen again.

The Government is also focused on reducing harm in priority sectors that have the high rates of injury and fatality – construction, agriculture, manufacturing, forestry, and fishing.

There are already industry-supported national action plans for construction and forestry, and I will soon be launching the manufacturing action plan.

The draft agriculture plan is currently out for sector consultation and is scheduled for release in April. The fishing plan (developed by Maritime NZ) is also being consulted with industry groups.  

The Department’s quad bike safety campaign is showing results, although, sadly, some have had their summer holidays ruined by quad bike deaths on farms and beaches. Realistically it will take time for the quad bike accident rate to come down, although we can already see indicators of changing behaviour:  More farmers are now purchasing and wearing helmets, increasing bike safety checks, and using safer alternative vehicles.

We will also be looking harder at occupational health with the Department of Labour’s recently released Occupational Health Action Plan. This gives priority to reducing exposure to five occupational health hazards – occupational cancer, respiratory hazards, noise, skin irritants, and psycho-social hazards such as stress. This will involve improving occupational disease surveillance, and monitoring dust exposure during the Christchurch rebuild.

**Christchurch Rebuild**

I’m proud to say there has been only one serious harm incident on the Christchurch rebuild in the last year, a testament to the work the Department of Labour has been doing with the local construction industry and the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA).

In addition to ensuring the demolition and reconstruction work is being carried out safely, the Department is also making a big contribution to solving the skills shortage.

They are working closely with CERA and the Canterbury Employment Skills Board on a skills strategy for the rebuild, providing research and labour market analysis, and working with businesses to ensure we have people with the right skills to get the job done.

The Immigration arm of the Department of Labour is also promoting the Skilled Migrant and Essential skills visas through expos and recruitment agencies. It’s likely we will need to attract some highly skilled migrants to fill reconstruction jobs, but only if they cannot be filled by New Zealanders.

The rebuild provides an opportunity to work closely with businesses and hopefully it will be able to respond nimbly to their needs where appropriate.

**Conclusion**

My priorities over the next three years will build on the solid foundation of changes we have implemented to date.

I do not want to see unnecessary change for change’s sake. Rather I am looking to put in place pragmatic solutions as we implement our manifesto commitments and let employers, employees and business focus on what they do best.

Altogether, these initiatives are part of our Government’s plan to give businesses the confidence they need to invest, grow and create higher-paying jobs.

Thank you for your time.
