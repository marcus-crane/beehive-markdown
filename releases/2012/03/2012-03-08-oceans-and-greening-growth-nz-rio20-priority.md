New Zealand’s priority at the United Nations Rio+20 Summit in June will be on improving environmental management of oceans and opportunities from greening growth, Environment Minister Nick Smith said when opening the United Nations Association New Zealand Conference in Wellington today.

“We are putting strong emphasis on oceans in New Zealand’s contribution to Rio+20 because it is so important for our part of the world and more needs to be done globally to protect the marine environment. Our concern is that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing continues unchecked and often supported by Government subsidy.”

“New Zealand will also be promoting its ideas around greening growth at the Rio+20 Summit. We have a real contribution to make noting our ranking as best performer in the 2011 Global Green Growth Index. The global community, in these difficult times, needs to focus on policies that enable improved living standards and incomes while ensuring better stewardship of natural resources.”

“We will be particularly active in advocating for reform of fossil fuel subsidies. The debate on carbon pricing to reduce emissions is undermined by global subsidies of $500 billion per year of fossil fuels. There is real opportunity for significant emissions reductions and saving for governments from removing these distorting subsidies.”

“Real gains were made at the original Rio Earth Summit with conventions on climate change, biodiversity and desertification. Our ambition for Rio+20 is for progress to be made on improving management of our oceans and on greening global economic growth,” Dr Smith says.
