Tim Groser, Minister Responsible for International Climate Change Negotiations, will travel to Paris today to attend the 29-30 March Ministerial meeting of the OECD Environment Committee, themed “Making Green Growth Deliver”.

The meeting will discuss future priorities for coordinated action that can deliver economic growth in an environmentally sustainable way.

Mr Groser will use his participation at the OECD meeting to emphasise the contribution that New Zealand is making towards addressing global green growth challenges, through initiatives such as forming the Global Research Alliance and spearheading efforts to reform fossil fuel, and fisheries subsidies.

The meeting will also consider progress towards the Rio+20 conference in June, which aims to secure renewed international commitment for sustainable development.

Issues that New Zealand will be concentrating on at Rio+20 include the sustainable use of oceans and marine resources and reducing fossil fuel subsidies.
