Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Gerry Brownlee today announced insurer AMI as the naming rights sponsor for the new, temporary Christchurch Stadium in Addington.

Christchurch Stadium is the first sporting venue built in the city since the destructive earthquakes.

“AMI’s sponsorship and continued backing of sport and entertainment in Christchurch is welcome, especially as the future of the quake damaged AMI Stadium remains in question.

“Built in less than 100 days, the new AMI Stadium is a symbol of the city’s recovery and will be a great asset for Canterbury.

“It will deliver some normality for Cantabrians who have not been able to enjoy large sporting and entertainment fixtures for more than a year.

“I want to again pay tribute to the over 400 workers who achieved a great result in only 14 weeks by treating the stadium’s construction as a personal mission.

“I thank the many people across the country who helped this massive logistical exercise come together,” Mr Brownlee said.

AMI’s sponsorship is not related in any way to the 2011 Government underwrite of the insurer, and is therefore not paid for by any taxpayer money. It has been made possible by international insurance group IAG, which is the conditional purchaser of AMI.

“IAG recognises the symbolism of supporting a venue identified as being important for the morale of the people of Canterbury, and I thank them for that,” Mr Brownlee said.

The new stadium officially opens on Saturday evening, 24 March 2012, with the Investec Super Rugby 2012 match Crusaders versus Cheetahs. The stadium will host rugby union, rugby league and football games, rugby union test matches, community and cultural events and music concerts, for the foreseeable future.

“I’m honored to be opening the new stadium tomorrow evening in the Prime Minister’s absence, as he is on official State business in South Korea, and look forward to watching the Crusaders getting their season on track with a sound victory over the Cheetahs,” Mr Brownlee said.
