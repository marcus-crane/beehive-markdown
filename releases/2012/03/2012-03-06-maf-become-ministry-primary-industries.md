The importance of the whole primary sector to New Zealand’s economy is recognised in the Government’s decision to rename the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, says Primary Industries Minister David Carter.

The new Ministry for Primary Industries will encompass all government work across the agricultural, horticultural, fisheries and aquaculture, forestry and food sectors, as well as biosecurity.

“The successful mergers of the Ministry of Fisheries and the New Zealand Food Safety Authority with MAF have paved the way for a new organisation to focus fully on the performance and integrity of all our primary industries,” says Mr Carter.

“The name change is a logical move. It recognises the broad role of the Ministry in growing and protecting the primary sector, the powerhouse of New Zealand’s economy.

“Importantly it provides the different parts of the organisation with a single, unifying identity,” Mr Carter says.

Existing brands for MAF, Biosecurity New Zealand, the Ministry of Fisheries and the New Zealand Food Safety Authority will be phased out. The Crown Forestry brand will be retained because it is a commercial forestry business that stands apart from the policy, regulatory and service delivery roles of the Ministry.

The new name will come into effect on 30 April.
