Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says the residents of 401 properties in Southshore West will need to wait a little longer before a decision can be made on the viability of rebuilding on their land.

“I know patience is running out in Southshore West, but we will soon have all the information needed to be confident of a final decision,” Mr Brownlee said.

Southshore West was subject to extensive lateral spreading in the February 22 earthquake, in some places up to a metre. Properties in Southshore East were zoned green last year.

Rebuilding in Southshore West requires the risk of lateral spreading to be addressed. Engineers are considering the options for achieving this.

The Department of Building and Housing (DBH) will soon advise the government on foundation solutions that may apply to Southshore West.

**Parklands East**

The government undertook to review the classification of 530 green zoned properties in Parklands East following the December 23 quakes, which resulted in major liquefaction in some parts of the suburb.

Officials have been in discussion with Parklands Action Group, geotechnical engineers, EQC and the Christchurch City Council to consider whether the area still meets green zone criteria.

“A decision on Parklands is expected in the very near future,” Mr Brownlee said.
