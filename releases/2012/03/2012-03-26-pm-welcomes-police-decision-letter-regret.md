The Police announcement today regarding the investigation into the freelance cameraman who made a recording of John Key and John Banks during the election campaign has been welcomed by the Prime Minister.

“I also welcome Bradley Ambrose’s letter of regret,” says Mr Key.

“I note that the Police statement today contains the comment that, while Mr Ambrose has been issued a warning, the Police are clear that his actions were unlawful.

“As the complainant in this matter, my views were sought by the Crown Solicitor on whether I thought Mr Ambrose should be prosecuted. In light of Mr Ambrose’s letter of regret, I indicated that I did not believe a prosecution was now necessary.

“I repeatedly said at the time that I was concentrated on the issues that matter to the New Zealand public, and that the secret recording wasn’t one of those issues. That remains the case.

“The decision announced by the Police today, and Mr Ambrose’s letter, allow all concerned to move on from the situation.”
