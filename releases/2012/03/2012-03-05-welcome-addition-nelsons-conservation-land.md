Public conservation land around Nelson has been given a boost with the Government purchasing 333 hectares of private land beside Kahurangi National Park.

The forested block on the coast between Big River and Kahurangi Point, north-west of Nelson, is home to the endangered land snail (Powelliphanta gillesi kahurangica) and one of the area’s last remaining lowland coastal populations of the great spotted kiwi (Apteryx haastii). The coast is also home to the nationally rare sand kanuka.

Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson says the addition, which was purchased through the Nature Heritage Fund, means a 55km stretch of coastal land from Big River to the Heaphy River mouth is now all public conservation land.

“This is a great purchase. Not only will it allow the Department of Conservation to better protect the indigenous native flora and fauna but it will also be a great getaway spot for remote campers.”

“Nearby Golden Bay is seeing increased visitor numbers and Kahurangi Point remains an iconic destination for back country trampers. This land purchase makes access to the point and its historic lighthouse easier.”

The newly purchased land will be protected initially as scenic reserve with the intention of adding it to the Kahurangi National Park.

**Background**:

- The block has an uninterrupted vegetation sequence that ranges from upland Beech and podocarp, like Rimu, down to coastal forest and nikau fronting the Big River estuary and beach (see Craig Potton picture attached). The rare känuka is in the coastal sand dunes.
- The Nature Heritage Fund is a separate government fund that helps meet the cost of protecting areas of high ecological value on private land by providing finance for projects that protect ecosystems either by direct purchase, or covenant.
