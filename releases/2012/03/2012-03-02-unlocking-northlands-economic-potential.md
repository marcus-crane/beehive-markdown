Energy and Resources Minister Phil Heatley today welcomed moves by the Ministry of Economic Development to consult on the exploration potential of the Northland region’s mineral resources.

The consultation process formally begins today on specific areas proposed to be included in a competitive tender for metallic mineral exploration permits. This is the first step of a new economic opportunity for the region, Mr Heatley said.

“A better and more productive economy is one of the Government’s four priorities this term. Northland can be a significant contributor to that growth.

“Down the track, safe, environmentally responsible mining to access our mineral wealth can provide job and growth benefits for Northland. It’s a really big opportunity for the region to get ahead,” Mr Heatley said.
