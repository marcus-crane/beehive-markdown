The contribution of renewable energy sources to total annual electricity generation increased to 77 per cent in 2011 from 74 per cent in 2010, Energy and Resources Minister Phil Heatley announced today.

“This is another positive step towards the Government’s goal of 90 per cent renewable generation by 2025,” Mr Heatley said.

Wind generation increased to 4.5 per cent total generation in 2011, and geothermal generation increased to 13.4 per cent of total generation.

“The development of renewables is a key part of the Government’s strategy for developing a diverse energy portfolio that balances economic and environmental goals for the country.

“Increasing renewable generation contributed to a 5 per cent drop in annual greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation,” he said.

The quarterly survey of domestic electricity prices has also been published today.

“Downward pressure on electricity prices arising from the Government’s reform of the electricity sector saw average residential electricity price increases slow over 2011,” said Mr Heatley.

Average electricity prices increased by just 0.1 per cent in the quarter to February 2012.

“The average residential electricity price increased 3.6 per cent in the year to 15 February 2012, compared with a 7 per cent increase for the previous year to February 2011.”
