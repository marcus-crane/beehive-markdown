Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew encourages New Zealanders to celebrate Neighbours Day Aotearoa this weekend.

“People can participate by having a neighbourhood barbecue, a bake-off, or by stopping to chat with a neighbour. They can go to the community activities being held.  Local papers or council websites will list times and places for events,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“Sometimes all people need is an excuse to say hello to the person across the street or next door. It needs just a little extra effort and it’s worth it.  Wherever they live, be it a suburb, city apartment or rural property, neighbours matter and knowing them can result in a safer, happier neighbourhood. 

“This government wants to strengthen communities and make them more resilient and that starts from the ground up, or in this case the neighbourhood up. This is a basic way of making where we live better for family and whanau.

“I commend all the organisations and businesses who work together to promote good, healthy, safe and supportive neighbourhoods,” she says.

Neighbours Day Aotearoa was started by Lifewise and Takapuna Methodist Church in 2009 as a way of supporting people in local neighbourhoods.  Last year it went nationwide.
