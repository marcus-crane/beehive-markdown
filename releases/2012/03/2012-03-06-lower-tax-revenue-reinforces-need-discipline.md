Lower than forecast tax revenue in the seven months to 31 January, reinforces the need for the Government to responsibly manage its spending, Finance Minister Bill English says.

Core Crown tax revenue was $946 million below the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Update forecast in the latest monthly Financial Statements of the Government. Revenue was $1.4 billion lower overall, but was offset by lower core Crown expenses of about $1.24 billion.

The operating balance before gains and losses was $470 million below forecast – mostly due to EQC recognising expenses from the December 23 earthquake.

"The reduced tax revenue is broadly consistent with the updated economic outlook presented in the Budget Policy Statement last month, but the Treasury has identified some clear downside risks to the tax take for the remainder of the year, including slightly weaker labour market conditions," Mr English says.

"That reinforces the need for the Government to be disciplined and stick to its plan to get back to surplus in 2014/15, so we can start repaying debt.

"Returning to surplus won't be easy, but it is one of the most important things the Government can do to ensure New Zealand can withstand future shocks and build a more competitive economy based on exports and new jobs.

"That is why we have made it one of our four main priorities, alongside building a more productive and competitive economy, delivering better public services and rebuilding Canterbury.

"Limiting our debt to overseas lenders also helps take pressure off interest rates and the exchange rate. In the current uncertain global environment, it's vital we continue to keep a tight lid on spending and debt and put in place policies that make our economy more competitive," Mr English says.
