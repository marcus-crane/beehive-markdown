Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew salutes the women and men who have fought for women’s rights and empowerment and who have achieved progress across all spheres of our society.

“On International Women’s Day, I am pleased to say that as a country, we have positive achievements. New Zealand is currently placed sixth out of 135 countries in the World’s Economic Forum’s Global gender Gap Index, almost two-thirds of our university graduates are women and, at 9.6 per cent, we have the second lowest pay gap in the OCED.

“Despite considerable progress, there is still much to be done.

“Women remain under-represented in leadership roles and we still have some way to go to fully eliminate the gender pay gap.

“I am pleased to announce this government’s commitment to increase the participation of women in governance to 45 per cent in the public sector,” said Mrs Goodhew. “There is strong evidence showing a positive relationship between women and boards and better organisational performance.

“More women in governance will help build a better future for women, their families and New Zealand. This government will work towards increasing women’s economic independence, increasing the number of women in leadership, and ensuring women are safe in their homes and communities.
