Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams has welcomed news that Australian movie and television service Quickflix has decided to enter the New Zealand market.

“This is one of the early signs that the market understands the new opportunities that will be available under the ultra-fast broadband initiative (UFB),” Ms Adams says.

“These are exciting times as UFB changes and challenges existing approaches. It brings considerable opportunities for new offerings in many areas."

Ms Adams says it falls on industry to take the lead in some areas, including developing and promoting new services to business and consumers.

“The Government is playing an important role in the roll-out of faster broadband but we can’t, and shouldn’t, be dictating how use evolves.

“The market is evolving rapidly and throwing up exciting challenges. Those who grab them early will flourish, but those who don’t may not survive.

“Having Quickflix enter the market means customers will have access to content that suits them on demand. It offers services in a more flexible way than traditional subscription and free-to-air broadcasters we are familiar with.

“This is an example of the sort of innovate approaches I expect to see as UFB is rolled out around the country.”
