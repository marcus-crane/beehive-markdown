Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew congratulates Trev’s BBQ and Denniston Heritage Trust on being named joint supreme award winners at the TrustPower National Community Awards.

Mrs Goodhew attended the awards dinner at Terrace Downs, Canterbury, on Saturday night. The supreme winners were announced from 25 regional finalists. Homes of Hope received the runner-up award.

The work of Denniston Heritage Trust has resulted in one of New Zealand’s largest producing coal fields becoming a unique visitor attraction that showcases the richness of the West Coast’s historic and natural heritage.

Ashburton-based Trev’s BBQ provided an immediate and significant response to the devastation suffered in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake by feeding and supporting people in the most affected areas.

Homes of Hope provides stable, loving, safe and nurturing care to children in Tauranga who have been traumatised due to abuse.

“These awards recognise the outstanding contributions these organisations have made to Canterbury, West Coast and Tauranga communities,” says Mrs Goodhew. “I commend all the regional finalists for their commitment and service to their communities and New Zealand.

“Volunteers are vital to New Zealand and the response to the Canterbury earthquakes was an example of the community and voluntary sector’s strength. I saw an incredible response from the community, both from existing non-profit organisations and newly formed voluntary groups. Volunteers gave an enormous amount of time and energy to assist affected people and clean up the city.

“The cleanup after the Rena shipping disaster in the Bay of Plenty was another example of the importance of volunteering. Again, thousands of people gave their time to make an invaluable contribution in a time of need.”
