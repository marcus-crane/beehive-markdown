Associate Justice Minister Chester Borrows today welcomed the resignation of Papamoa Justice of the Peace Martin Elliott.

“Justices of the Peace have always been people of high standing in our communities. The nature of their role means they must be people of unquestionable honesty and integrity,” says Mr Borrows.

Elliott, a former Hamilton high school principal, pleaded guilty and was convicted recently of two fraud charges relating to work done on his personal property which was invoiced as part of a school construction project being undertaken at the time.

“I have carefully considered a submission from Mr Elliott that his conviction should not prevent him continuing as a Justice of the Peace, and absolutely disagree. Mr Elliott defrauded the school he was entrusted to run, and to allow him to remain in office would bring disrepute to the office of Justice of the Peace.

“Last week I requested that Mr Elliott tender his resignation immediately, and am pleased that today the Secretary for Justice received and accepted that resignation,” says Mr Borrows.
