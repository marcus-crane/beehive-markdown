The roll out of ultra-fast broadband to more Christchurch schools will see thousands more students able to be connected by July, Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams says.

Enable, the Government’s ultra-fast broadband partner for Christchurch, today released details of the next 11 schools in the region that will be able to connect to the network by July this year.

This means there will be more than 37,000 students at 71 schools in Christchurch with access to UFB.

“This is fantastic progress. UFB provides a wider range of learning opportunities for both students and their teachers, and brings education into the 21st century,” says Ms Adams.

“The technology means students anywhere in New Zealand will be able to access specialised teachers and online resources.

“We are on track of achieving our objective of reaching all urban schools and 99.9 per cent of school students by 2015. The remaining students at schools in the most remote locations will receive a high speed wireless or satellite connection. No schools will miss out.”

The 11 Christchurch schools that will receive fibre by July 2012 are:

- Ferndale School
- Gilberthorpe School
- Halswell Residential College
- Halswell School
- Hornby Primary School
- Lyttelton Main School
- Oaklands School
- Roydvale Primary School
- Somerfield School
- St Michael's Church School
- The Cathedral Grammar School
