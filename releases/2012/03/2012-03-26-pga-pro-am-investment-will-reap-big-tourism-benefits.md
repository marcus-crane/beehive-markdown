Prime Minister and Tourism Minister John Key is welcoming participants in the inaugural NZPGA Pro-Am Championship tournament in Queenstown this week.

The event, which is now being run by a partnership between the NZPGA, Sir Michael Hill and The Hills Golf Course, has received $500,000 from the Government’s Major Events Development Fund.

132 professionals will play for the NZPGA Championship over four rounds starting on Thursday, but in a unique event format, 62 invited amateurs and celebrities will each be paired with one of the 62 professionals who make the cut, playing together as a team over the weekend for the NZPGA Pro-Am Championship and a total of $500,000 in prize money.

“The purpose of the Major Events Fund is to attract, retain, grow and deliver major events, and this tournament, which will be on a much larger scale than previous NZPGA tournaments, is expected to reap big tourism rewards and deepen business relationships, particularly in Asia”, says Mr Key.

The NZPGA Pro-Am aims to become one of the premier golf experiences in the Asia-Pacific region.

“This event will further cement New Zealand’s reputation as a world class events’ destination. It will attract players and supporters from key international markets and showcase Queenstown and New Zealand to global audiences.”

Mr Key will join the other invited amateurs and celebrities in playing a preliminary tournament at the Jack’s Point golf course on Friday.
