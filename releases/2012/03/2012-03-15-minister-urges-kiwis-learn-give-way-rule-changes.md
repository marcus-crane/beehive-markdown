Associate Transport Minister Chris Tremain is urging Kiwis to make sure they understand planned changes to two of the give way rules before they come into force on 25 March.

“Changes to the give way rules are not far away. Please take the time to learn what you need to do from 25 March,” says Mr Tremain.

The changes come into effect at 5am on Sunday 25 March 2012 and will affect drivers, riders, pedestrians and cyclists. Until then the current give-way rules apply.

“The NZ Transport Agency has kicked off an intensive public awareness campaign, so there is plenty of information available to help people understand the change. This includes a national advertising campaign starting today and a leaflet drop to all households.”

The two rule changes are:

- If you're turning right, you will need to give way to vehicles coming from the opposite direction that are turning left. (This only applies if you're both facing the same signs or signals or no signs or signals) Think: If you're turning right, give way.
- At a T-intersection or driveway, if you are on a terminating road (bottom of the T or the driveway), you will need to give way to all vehicles on the continuing road (top of the T). Think: Top of the T goes before me.

All other rules will continue to apply.

“The give way rule changes are part of the government’s Safer Journeys road safety strategy. It’s estimated that changing these rules will result in a reduction of about seven per cent of relevant intersection crashes,” says Mr Tremain.
