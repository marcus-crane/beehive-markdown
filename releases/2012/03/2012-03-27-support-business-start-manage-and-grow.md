Minister for Small Business John Banks today launched ‘Start, Manage And Grow Your Business’, an updated publication to help small business owners get the best value from government services.

“Having been a business owner for many years, I understand how difficult it can be to constantly grapple with government regulation or to know what help is available,” Mr Banks said.

“Keeping up with compliance information distracts business owners from what they do best – running their business and growing our economy.

‘Start, Manage And Grow Your Business’ provides business owners with information on the wide range of government services available to them.

“These are services like [www.business.govt.nz](http://www.business.govt.nz/) which provides information from across government all in one place alongside a range of online tools and resources to help business at all stages - from start up to expansion.

“I encourage all small business owners to pick up a copy from your local Regional Business Partner or view it at [www.business.govt.nz](http://www.business.govt.nz) to find out more about how government agencies can work with you,” Mr Banks said.
