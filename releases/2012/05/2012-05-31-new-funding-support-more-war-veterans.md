More New Zealand veterans will be acknowledged for their service in operations overseas as part of a new initiative in Budget 2012, Veterans’ Affairs Minister Nathan Guy says.

“The Budget provides new operating funding of $4.8 million over the next four years to extend war pension coverage to those who served in 10 additional military deployments.

“This means that veterans will be eligible for a War Disablement Pension for any disability that occurred as a result of service in these overseas missions.

“I am proud that this Government is showing our respect and thanks to men and women who have served in these operations overseas. Those who took part deserve to be recognised and supported,” Mr Guy says.

The 10 new deployments to be recognised are:

- Rhodesia - Operation Midford (1979 - 1980)
- Afghanistan – Mine clearing training team (1991)
- Iraq - United Nations Special Commission (1991 - 1999)
- Iraq - United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (2002 - 2003)
- Cambodia - United Nations Advance Mission (1991 – 1992); Mine Action Centre and Mine Clearance Training Unit (1991 - 1993); and United Nations Transitional Authority (1992 – 1993)
- Somalia - United Nations Operations (1993 – 1995)
- Haiti - United Nations Mission (1994 – 1995)
- Bougainville - South Pacific Peacekeeping Force (1994); Truce Monitoring Group (1997 – 1998); and Peace Monitoring Group (1998 – 2003)
- Sudan - United Nations Mission (2005 – present)
- Southern Lebanon - United Nations Mine Action Coordination Centre (2007 – 2008).

In total, this means an estimated 1,097 additional veterans will be eligible to receive assistance under the War Pensions Act 1954.

The change follows a reclassification of these deployments as ‘emergencies’ under the War Pensions Act and will take effect from 1 July 2012.
