A new toolkit to assist district health boards to further reduce waiting times and improve the quality of elective surgery has been launched by Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“District health boards have been making great progress increasing elective surgery for patients performing 27,000 more operations now compared to numbers in 2008. But there’s still room for improvement.

“Elective surgery, such as hip and other joint operations, cataracts and grommets, improves the quality of a person’s life by relieving pain and restoring ability.

“The Improving Patient Flow for Electives toolkit provides district health boards with strategies and support to make further improvements so even more New Zealanders receive elective surgery.

“The strategies are based on successful initiatives from around the country with clinicians and senior managers from district health boards providing valuable insight into the benefits and barriers in the case studies.

“Strategies include clinicians and management working together better, improving theatre scheduling and implementing enhanced recovery after surgery programmes.
