Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams tomorrow travels to Seoul for the 2012 Korea Australia and New Zealand (KANZ) Summit, and the World Information and Communications Summit.

The summits, in Seoul from May 14-16, bring together Government, industry, research and policy representatives to share insights into their experiences in broadband and to explore joint ventures and research partnerships.

“With the development of the National Broadband Network in Australia and Korea’s world-leading broadband network, it will be interesting to hear about their experiences,” Ms Adams says.

“The opportunity to discuss New Zealand’s ultra-fast broadband policy and industry issues allows us to make better, more informed decisions when planning for future investment.”

Ms Adams will also attend the Korea Communications Conference in Seoul, and visit the Electronics and Telecommunications Institute in Daejeon.

Topics at the summits and conference also cover areas such as next-generation networks, broadcasting and new media content, smart services such as e-learning, e-health and disaster management, new business opportunities and green ICTs.

Ms Adams will hold bilateral meetings with Australia’s Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Stephen Conroy, and Korea’s Environment Minister, Yoo Young-sook.

“In addition, the visit to Korea offers an opportunity to leverage business opportunities for New Zealand ICT companies by raising the profile of our country as a supplier of niche technologies to Korean companies and highlighting Korea as an ICT market for New Zealand companies.”
