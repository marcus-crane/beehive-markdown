The Government has approved a $4.5 million cash injection for West Coast District Health Board for the 2011/12 financial year.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says "This is a one-off payment so the board can pay its day to day bills without always going into overdraft.

“The district health board are changing how they do things to improve their financial performance and provide better services for patients. This includes sharing resources with Canterbury DHB to and reducing costs for outsourced personnel such as locums.

West Coast DHB has been in deficit for a number of years. Last financial year they received $7.2 million deficit support funding and $6.0 million in 2009/10.

"On top of the $17.7 million in deficit support funding over the past three years, this Government has lifted the West Coast DHB annual funding to a record $121 million in the 2011/12 year – $10 million more than when we took office.
