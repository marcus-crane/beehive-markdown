Work stoppage figures for last year reveal an encouraging downward trend, Labour Minister Kate Wilkinson says.

The Department of Labour today released statistics on work stoppages over recent years which are an indication of the state of industrial relations in New Zealand.

Ms Wilkinson says that 2011 saw the lowest number of stoppages since reporting began.

Total work stoppages have dropped from more than 200 in 1986 to 12 last year.

“A flexible and fair labour market is crucial for building a stronger and more competitive economy,” Ms Wilkinson says.

“While there have been some high profile disputes in recent months, what these figures show is that overall there is a positive trend with less disruption and fewer disputes.

“I believe this downward trend demonstrates a growing sophistication in the relationship between employees and employers, and an acknowledgement by both groups that they have a role to play in ensuring New Zealand’s economy is not unnecessarily damaged by work stoppages.

“The Department of Labour’s mediation service no doubt contributed to this.  The Service handles between 5,000 and 6,000 requests for mediation each year with parties resolving their issues in about 80% of cases.”
