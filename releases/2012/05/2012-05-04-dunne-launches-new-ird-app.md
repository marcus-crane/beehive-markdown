Revenue Minister Peter Dunne today launched Inland Revenue’s new mobile web application that will allow people to manage more of their tax and social policy entitlements on the move.

“The app will offer a faster and simpler service for accessing and maintaining contact details and viewing account information,” he said.

“For example, if you have a student loan, you can look up your balance wherever you are to help manage your loan, or you can use it for simple things like payment reminders or changing your contact or bank account details.”

Mr Dunne said people can view their current year tax deductions from their salary or wages, and those with Working for Families tax credits or child support arrangements can view their entitlements.

He said the mobile web app is a first step for Inland Revenue and further developments will be shaped by customer feedback.

“Inland Revenue is doing a lot of work to develop its online services because that’s how many customers want to manage their tax, just as they are used to doing with banking today.

“This app is a natural extension of that online work and reflects that as busy people with busy lives increasingly want to use their mobile devices to handle their personal and financial affairs,’’ he said.

“The app is a quick and easy way to deal with some of those common interactions Inland Revenue has with customers, but when it comes to matters like filing a return they will still need to use the usual online services.”

People will need to be registered for Inland Revenue’s online services to be able to use the app, and they will be able to do that through the app.
