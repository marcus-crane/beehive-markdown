A major project on the geology of Northland has come to fruition with today’s release of the 2011 aeromagnetic survey data, Energy and Resources Minister Phil Heatley said at a launch function in Paihia.

“The data will be a huge asset to Northland. It will give Northpland a real edge,” he said.

“We now have a rich database that will be invaluable for a wide range of engineering, scientific and public good science applications.

“Northland is the first area in New Zealand over which such a large and comprehensive survey has been conducted.”

For minerals exploration it provides valuable information on the subsurface geology and possible locations of mineral deposits, the Minister said.

“The information is expected to be used by mineral exploration companies interested in better understanding mineral prospects in Northland,” he said.

Over 13,590 square kilometres of the Northland region were surveyed and 80,710 kilometres of data collected by aeromagnetic survey between February and August 2011.

The survey was conducted as a partnership between the Ministry of Economic Development, the Far North District Council, the Northland Regional Council and Enterprise Northland.

GNS Science has interpreted the data to identify geological and structural elements in the survey area.

Apart from mineral exploration, the data has applications in fields such as geological mapping, geothermal exploration, forestry, agriculture, horticulture, geological hazard assessment, engineering and construction.

“In the minerals area, to manage the increased interest in exploring Northland, I will shortly be opening a competitive tender for exploration permits for metallic minerals,” Mr Heatley said.

The tender follows consultation with iwi and local authorities during March and April. The tender process will be finalised and announced once full consideration is given to the feedback received from submitters.

The data reports are available at no charge on New Zealand Petroleum & Minerals’ exploration database: [https://data.nzpam.govt.nz/GOLD/system/mainframe.asp](https://data.nzpam.govt.nz/GOLD/system/mainframe.asp)
