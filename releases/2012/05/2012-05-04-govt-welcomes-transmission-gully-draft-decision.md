Acting Transport Minister Steven Joyce today welcomed the draft approval of Transmission Gully by an independent Board of Inquiry under the Government’s national consenting process with the Environmental Protection Authority.

“The Board of Inquiry's draft decision to approve the regulatory consents applications for the nearly $1 billion Transmission Gully project is a very good step forward,” Mr Joyce says.

“This is a significant milestone towards progression of this nationally significant road, which will deliver reduced travel times and enhanced safety for road users between Linden and MacKays Crossing.

“Transmission Gully is part of the Road of National Significance highways programme and one of New Zealand’s biggest ever infrastructure investments. It is a key part of the Government’s National Infrastructure Plan and recognised in the Government Policy Statement on Land Transport Funding.

“The Government is investing nearly $11 billion in new State Highway infrastructure over the next 10 years.

“This decision bodes well for this important project and the Government is looking forward, as I’m sure the majority of residents in the Wellington region will be, to the release of the Board’s final decision in June.”
