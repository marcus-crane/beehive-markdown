Māori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples has opened a small office in Glen Innes to help tenants involved in the Tamaki Transformation Programme.

“This major urban renewal project is disruptive to some of the long-established communities there, while state houses are upgraded or reconfigured to meet current and future demands,” said Dr Sharples.

“I have arranged for Kaitoko Whanau workers to be based in the office, to make sure whanau get all the help they are entitled to. Any uncertainty creates anxiety, but residents can see there are friendly and familiar faces there to help them deal with issues that may arise,” he said.

“The wider purpose is to facilitate communication between residents and official agencies, so the work is carried on in a way that minimises any disruption to the community support networks that keep whanau strong and resilient. Already large numbers of Glen Innes residents are making use of this facility to progress their desired outcomes.

“Supporting the community as a whole helps the individual residents and their families through the process. Kaitoko Whānau are using their local knowledge to help achieve that.

“While protests have attracted media headlines, my office is making a real difference for those local residents who need practical support,” said Dr Sharples.
