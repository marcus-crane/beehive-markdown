Consumer Affairs Minister Simon Bridges says good progress is being made towards a wheel clamping code of conduct, following a meeting with industry operators today.

Mr Bridges says the key operators in the New Zealand parking enforcement industry have agreed on a draft set of minimum standards and best practices. 

Key provisions in the draft code include:

- Clear, visible signs about parking rules and possible wheel clamping
- Situations when clamping will/will not occur
- What provisions must be met if clamping occurs, including reasons why the vehicle was clamped and supporting photographic evidence
- Ensure fees displayed are accurate, GST inclusive and include all charges
- Ensure fees are fair and reasonable and capped at a maximum of $200
- Ensure complaints are resolved in a fair and reasonable manner
- Clear expectations for industry employees, including that they are lawful, professional and courteous in their work
- Ensure all signatories to the industry and their employees hold a certificate of approval by the Ministry of Justice
- Ensure, where signatories breach the code, all money paid will be refunded

The industry operators, with support from the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, will work through the finer points of the code of conduct over the next few days.

“I’m pleased that the industry is taking proactive steps to address an issue that has been of growing concern.  There is still some tidying up to be done, but it is great to see that real progress is being made.”
