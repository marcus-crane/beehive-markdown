Land Information New Zealand has received $800,000 in new operating funding for 2012/13 so vital re-surveying of the Canterbury region can continue, Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson says.

The funding, which comes from the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Fund, will go towards restoring the survey control network that was badly damaged in the Canterbury earthquakes.

The survey control network provides surveyors with accurate information about the topography of the land.

“Repairing the survey control network will allow infrastructure such as roads, water, waste-water, and sewerage networks to be confidently designed, located and built,” Mr Williamson says.

“The repairs will also enable property boundaries to be more confidently determined and therefore assist homeowners with rebuilding work.

“The Government is committed to rebuilding Canterbury following the devastating earthquakes. This funding will enable infrastructure to be rebuilt and help residents plan their future.”
