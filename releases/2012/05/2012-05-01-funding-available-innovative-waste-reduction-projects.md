Environment Minister Amy Adams today called for organisations developing initiatives that increase the reuse, recycling or recovery of waste material to apply to the Waste Minimisation Fund.

“This is a chance for organisations with an innovative project to apply for support from the Government to give their project a kick start,” Ms Adams says.

Since the first funding round opened at the end of 2009, the fund has awarded about $20 million to more than 60 projects.

“Many of these projects have gone on to establish themselves as businesses employing New Zealanders and supporting our economy. Other projects have been more community focussed and have involved action to spread the waste reduction message.”

To receive funding, projects need to increase resource efficiency or reduce the amount of waste sent to New Zealand’s landfills.

The current funding round opens today and applications are welcome until 19 June.

Money for the Waste Minimisation Fund comes from the waste levy charged on material disposed of at New Zealand landfills.
