Minister for Small Business John Banks welcomed the release of the Small Business Advisory Group (SBAG) report ‘Thriving and Surviving in a Seismic Environment’, which contains eight recommendations for the Government to consider. 

“Small and medium sized businesses (SMEs) have had a roller-coaster ride in the past few years with the 2008/2009 global recession, the effects of which were compounded for many in Christchurch with the series of devastating earthquakes,” Minister Banks said.

“The Government recognises that SMEs play a vital role in boosting New Zealand’s economic performance and has already made a number of changes to improve the regulatory environment for business. 

"This report recognises the value of these changes, and contains further suggestions to assist businesses to grow and prosper.  The need to get rid of onerous regulations that stifle growth and hold business back is reiterated by the Group. 

“We thank the Small Business Advisory Group members for their work in producing this report,” Minister Banks said.

This is the fourth SBAG report to be produced since SBAG’s inception in 2003.
