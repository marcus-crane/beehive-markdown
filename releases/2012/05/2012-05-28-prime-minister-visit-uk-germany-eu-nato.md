Prime Minister John Key will be visiting the United Kingdom, Germany and Belgium from 2 to 8 June.

The visit will include three days in London, as well as time in Hamburg, Berlin, and Brussels, where Mr Key will meet with European Parliament representatives and NATO.

While in London, Mr Key will attend the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Celebrations.

The Prime Minister and Mrs Key will have dinner with British Prime Minister David Cameron and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper on Tuesday 5 June (Wednesday NZ time). Mr Key will also be calling on the Governor of Bank of England, Dr Mervyn King.

In Brussels, Mr Key will meet NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, and European Parliament President Martin Schulz. Mr Key will also launch the Friends of New Zealand Group in the European Parliament.

In Germany he will visit Hamburg and Berlin. Mr Key will meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel, deliver two keynote speeches and attend an event run by Tourism NZ. He will also meet German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle.

“As well as representing New Zealand at the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Celebrations, the visit will mean New Zealand can advance its bilateral relationships with the European Union, NATO, and Germany,” says Mr Key.

“The trip will also be a valuable opportunity to give me first-hand information on the issues currently confronting Europe. The European Union remains the world’s largest economic bloc, and is our third largest export market for goods, worth $5 billion.”

Mr Key will be accompanied by his wife Bronagh. They will return to New Zealand on Sunday 10 June.
