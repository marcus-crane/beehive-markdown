Budget 2012 continues the Government’s commitment to making New Zealand schools among the most connected in the world, Education Minister Hekia Parata and Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams say.

The Government is providing $8 million in 2012/13 to help schools connect to the ultra-fast broadband (UFB) network.

Hundreds of schools will have access to government funding to cover the costs of the fibre connection from the school boundary into the school.

All state and state-integrated schools qualify for the free fibre connections, Ms Parata says.

By June 2013, the Government will have paid for connections to more than 1400 schools.

Total funding for this initiative is $17.8 million over the next three years and $11.5 million in 2011/12.

“This is a significant contribution, and it means our schools will be connected to the best online resources in the world,” Ms Parata says.

“Schools will also be able to connect to the Network for Learning, which will ensure e-learning resources are available to all teachers and students.”

Ms Adams says the education sector is a priority for the rollout of UFB.

“We know that UFB will make a big difference for students across the country.

“With the latest funding in Budget 2012, we are moving swiftly to implement our vision for New Zealand’s digital future.”

The Government’s $1.35 billion UFB initiative and $300 million Rural Broadband Initiative will see 97.7 per cent of schools and 99.9 per cent of students receiving UFB-enabling speeds of up to 100 megabits per second by 2016.

The remaining schools, which are in the most remote locations, will receive a high-speed wireless or satellite connection.
