Better performance in the ACC Non-Earners’ Account will free up $52.8 million of taxpayer funding in 2012/13, which will be returned to the Government, ACC Minister Judith Collins says.

The Non-Earners’ Account covers claims for injuries to people not in the paid workforce, such as students, beneficiaries, retirees, and children. This account is funded by the Government using money collected through general taxation.

“Lower unemployment than previously forecast, fewer claims, improved rehabilitation rates, and ongoing improvements to claims management have reduced the operating funding required in the Non-Earners’ Account by $52.8 million,” Ms Collins says.

“I am pleased that over the past three years the financial performance of the corporation has strengthened. At the same time, ACC’s focus on rehabilitation has increased, helping claimants return to independence earlier.”

The number of people who have been off work for more than a year has dropped from 14,000 to 11,000 in the past three years.

“Improved financial performance is just one of several responsibilities ACC has to New Zealanders,” Ms Collins says. “ACC must also focus on preventing injuries and meeting the highest standards of best practice and service.

"Results from a March 2012 claimant satisfaction survey show 75 per cent of claimants are satisfied or very satisfied with the overall quality of ACC’s service. This is up from 65 per cent a year earlier.

“This Government is focusing on delivering better public services – and ACC is making good progress.

“However, these results do not reflect ACC’s most recent privacy breaches. I believe privacy and information security are the biggest issues facing ACC at present.

“At this stage, I am not yet satisfied ACC’s privacy provisions and protocols are appropriate, or are being complied with to the level they should be.

“We want an ACC system that delivers world-class services to the people and organisations that use it, and to the people and organisations that fund it. I look forward to further improvements from ACC,” Ms Collins says.
