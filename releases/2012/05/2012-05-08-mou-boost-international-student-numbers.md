A Memorandum of Understanding signed by Immigration New Zealand and Education New Zealand will improve visa processing times for international students wanting to study in New Zealand.

International students who use a New Zealand Specialist Agent (NZSA) will have their visa applications processed within 10 working days. There will also be a dedicated point of contact within Immigration New Zealand branches for NZSA members – education agents recognised as New Zealand education specialists.

Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce says the MoU is a good example of government agencies working more closely together to support the international education industry to grow.

“The international education industry is worth just over $2 billion to New Zealand’s economy. It is a bridge between New Zealand and the world. We want to double the economic and social benefits that international education brings over the next 15 years,” Mr Joyce says.

“Only by the Government working closely with the sector, and developing initiatives such as this that support growth, will we achieve that goal.”

Immigration Minister Nathan Guy says the MoU will see an enhanced role for Immigration New Zealand in the operation of the NZSA programme.

“Immigration New Zealand plays a key role in facilitating the entry of around 100,000 international students who come here each year,” Mr Guy says.
