Pacific Islands Affairs Minister, Hekia Parata, welcomes the report of the Pacific Adolescent Career Pathways Report recently released.

“Matching subject choices at secondary school to your career hopes and dreams is critical for Pacific students,” says Ms Parata.

The research by the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs in 2010 found a significant mismatch between what students hoped to do, and the subjects they chose.

“Now a three-year follow-up study is looking at how Pacific students make their subject choices and who helps them with those decisions.

“Having this information will help us work with students, schools and their families to ensure that today’s subject choices are the right fit for tomorrow’s jobs.”

Ms Parata says that results from the first year of the Pacific Adolescent Careers Pathways study has reinforced the important role parents had to play.

“It also shows Year 9 Pacific students have confidence in their ability to do well at school, high levels of belonging and pride in their schools, and a good level of rapport with their teachers – all good bases for learning.”

Over half the students have chosen or investigated a career pathway, while a third hadn’t decided yet. Around a third of the students identified difficulties with setting career goals and found it difficult to marry their abilities to a specific career plan.

“This study will help inform policy-makers and education providers on how to best guide our young people make those critical education decisions that lead tertiary education, employment training and good jobs.

“It’s critical for their futures, and for the country’s future, that we equip them as well as we can for the next stage in their lives.”

The Pacific Adolescent Careers Pathways project will follow a group of over 900 Pasifika students from 27 secondary schools across New Zealand over three years from Years 9 – 11. It is jointly funded by the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs, the Ministry of Education, Career Services and the Educational Review Office.
