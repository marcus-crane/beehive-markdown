A single, combined board of trustees is to be set up to help raise achievement among New Zealand’s deaf and hearing-impaired students, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

Combining the boards of Kelston and van Asch Deaf Education Centres, will help drive a national strategy for deaf and hearing- impaired learners.

In addition to the strategy, the Government is investing nearly $10m redeveloping Kelston Deaf Education Centre.

The changes will create a more unified approach to boost student achievement at both schools located in different parts of the country.

The combined board will build on the good work already achieved by the two schools and will implement a co-ordinated national approach to raise achievement among deaf and hearing-impaired learners.

The announcement comes after an extensive consultation process.

“Deaf education has made considerable progress over the last ten years with most deaf and hearing-impaired students now in mainstream schools,’’ says Ms Parata.

“The new board will represent parents and whanau of all students receiving a service from the two schools, including those receiving an itinerant service.

“It will ensure a more coordinated and consistent approach to lifting achievement for learners who are deaf and hearing-impaired.”

This decision reflects the government’s commitment to deaf and hearing impaired learners, Ms Parata says.

“All learners, irrespective of their disability, should fully participate and achieve in our education system.

“Currently outcomes for deaf and hearing impaired learners are not as good as they could be. We will continue to work with schools, family and whanau and the deaf community to ensure students who are deaf and hearing-impaired get the best support possible to lift achievement.”

• The budget of $9.9779 million is for site works, design, construction, ICT and furniture and equipment for the rebuild of KDEC’s Archibald Campus.

• The proposed redevelopment will consolidate the number of buildings on the site which will be located closer together to assist with access.
