Youth week, a week of fun and informative community based youth activities begins today says Youth Affairs Minister Paula Bennett.

“Love the skin you are in is the theme of this year’s Youth Week and a good message for anyone young or old,” Mrs Bennett says.

“Around the country young people will be getting into some serious fun with a serious message about being true to yourself and being comfortable with who you are.”

Youth Week runs from Saturday 19 May to Friday 25 May with 131 events planned from song writing in Whangarei, to the official launch of youth focused radio Secret FM 107.2 in Upper Hutt.

“Speaking to groups of young people is a rewarding part of my job and so I wish I could make it to each event,” Mrs Bennett says.

“However I will be in Upper Hutt for the opening of Secret FM and I’m looking forward to fielding some curly questions on air from local budding DJs.”
