Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain has applauded the work of the Department of Internal Affairs censorship team for its latest worldwide sting tracking offenders trading in images of child sexual abuse.

Operation Laminar has caught 55 people distributing child sexual abuse pictures. Some were involved in the actual sexual abuse of the child victims.

At least 12 abused children have been identified and removed from harm – including one child in New Zealand.

“These horrific acts of abuse are being carried out all over the world and our investigators are playing a major role in bringing the perpetrators to justice,” says Mr Tremain.

“Since taking on the Internal Affairs portfolio I’ve been really impressed with how the team operates.

“It’s a small team of 12 highly regarded people who have proven to be integral to the world-wide effort to combat child sexual abuse. The Department has developed its own software and uses this to detect individuals exchanging pictures on open public forums and peer-to-peer networks.

“The fact that one of the team chairs an Interpol group of investigators tackling sexual predators demonstrates just how highly the New Zealand team is regarded internationally.”

Mr Tremain says child abuse is a global issue requiring a global response.
