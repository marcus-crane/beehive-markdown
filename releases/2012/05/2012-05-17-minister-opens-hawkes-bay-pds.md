Justice Minister Judith Collins says the Hawke’s Bay Public Defence Service (PDS) office will be part of the high quality legal aid system this Government is working towards.

At the office’s official opening today, Ms Collins said the PDS delivers quality defence services to some of the most vulnerable New Zealanders.

“The PDS is well regarded by judges, prosecutors and court staff, and it delivers great value for money.

“It is an important component of the cost-effective, high quality legal aid system this Government is working towards,” Ms Collins said.

The Hawke’s Bay office is the ninth PDS office to be opened nationwide.

Like the other PDS offices now operating in Wellington, Hamilton, Auckland and Dunedin, the Hawke’s Bay office will take part of criminal legal aid cases in the Napier and Hastings courts. It will also lead the Hawke’s Bay duty lawyer service.

“The PDS is being established at New Zealand’s busiest courts, where there are enough criminal legal aid cases to support both the PDS and viable private sector criminal law practices.

“Establishing the PDS in those areas allows for benchmarking in terms of both costs and quality of service provided to legal aid clients,” Ms Collins said.
