Associate Tourism Minister Chris Tremain will officially open the Hauraki Rail Trail today. This is the sixth great ride to be completed under Nga Haerenga, The New Zealand Cycle Trail.

“The Hauraki Rail Trail is an incredibly unique Great Ride. It stretches for 77 kilometres, much of it along an old railway formation. It is almost completely flat, making it ideal for cyclists of all ages and abilities, especially families,” says Mr Tremain.

“The journey is packed with lush bush, rich pioneering history and vintage railway lines. The breathtaking Karangahake Gorge, the site of the original gold rush back in 1875, is just one of many highlights along the trail.

“The cycle trail is located near three of our largest cities: Auckland, Tauranga and Hamilton. I predict this cycle trail will quickly become the weekend getaway of choice for many families. Its close proximity to major airports will no doubt also be an attraction for international visitors.”

Mr Tremain will open the Trail with Hauraki Mayor John Tregidga and New Zealand Cycle Trail Ambassador Sarah Ulmer. The opening ceremony will be followed by a short cycle ride and prize giving.

Mr Tremain says it’s great to see the New Zealand Cycle Trail gather momentum, as it works towards opening all the Great Rides by early next year.

“Most of the Great Rides now have sections open and the months ahead are packed with grand openings.

“Already trails across the country are realising the economic benefits of cycle tourism. Visitor numbers are up, jobs are being created and cafes, accommodation providers and bike hire stores are all reporting a growing number of cyclists entering their doors.”

The Government invested $4 million into the Hauraki Rail Trail, built in partnership with Hauraki, Matamata-Piako and Thames-Coromandel councils and the Department of Conservation.

“I congratulate these agencies and the many other supporters, including iwi, who have made this trail opening possible.”
