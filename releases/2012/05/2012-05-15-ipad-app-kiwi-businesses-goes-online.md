Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce today launched two new online products – including an iPad app for business – as part of the Government’s plan for delivering better public services.

The iPad app, available through the business.govt.nz portal, enables small businesses to access tools and tips for growth wherever and whenever they need it. The second product, business calendar B-Cal, provides businesses with technology features to highlight important business requirements.

“The new iPad app and B-Cal calendar are early examples of what we will produce as we build better online Government services for business,” Mr Joyce says.

“The iPad app is cutting-edge technology, allowing small businesses to access tools and advice at a time and place convenient to them. B-Cal is an interactive calendar providing reminders for key government dates for business, making it easier for them to work with government.

“Businesses are used to operating in a hi-tech environment where they can use a range of channels. As part of its commitment to better public service for business, the Government is developing a one-stop online shop where companies can access all government advice and support they need to run and grow their business.

“We will achieve this through closer integration across government, faster and better use of technology, and services designed with business needs in mind.

“Through our plan for delivering better public services, our Business Growth Agenda and establishing the new Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Government is making sure business is at the forefront of building a more competitive and productive economy.”
