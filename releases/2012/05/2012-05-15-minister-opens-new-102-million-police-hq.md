Police Minister Anne Tolley has today officially opened the new Counties Manukau East police station.

The new $10.2 million headquarters, at Ormiston Road in Botany, provides modern facilities for police staff and members of the community, and has been completed ahead of time and under budget.

“The new station is a real boost to the area,” says Mrs Tolley.

“It provides a better and more efficient workplace for staff, in an area which is at the forefront of policing in New Zealand.

“Counties Manukau police, aided by 300 additional frontline officers provided by the National-led Government, are leading the way in the Policing Excellence programme.

“They are preventing and reducing crime, with Neighbourhood Policing Teams providing visibility and working closely with local people.

“As a result, there are safer communities and fewer victims of crime, and I wish Counties Manukau Police continued success in their new premises.”
