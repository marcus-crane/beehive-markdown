An increase to parental leave payments will put more money in the pockets of young families, Labour Minister Kate Wilkinson says.

On 1 July the maximum parental leave payment available to eligible employees and the self-employed will increase from $458.82 to $475.16 a week.

The minimum parental leave payment for the self-employed will also increase, from $130.00 to $135.00 a week.

“Any increase in financial support for new parents is always helpful,” Ms Wilkinson says.

“The increase to parental leave payments matches the 3.6 per cent increase in the average weekly wage.”

Under the Parental Leave and Employment Protection Act 1987, parents eligible for the scheme are entitled to up to 14 weeks paid leave at a rate calculated on the basis of their average weekly earnings.

The maximum rate is adjusted every year to account for any increase in average weekly earnings.
