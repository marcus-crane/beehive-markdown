Justice Minister Judith Collins has today welcomed the Electoral Commission's report on the 2011 General Election and Referendum.

This is the first post-election report of the newly established Electoral Commission.

“The report addresses services provided to electors to facilitate voting, enrolment and voting statistics and any significant issues that arose during the election and makes necessary recommendations,” said Ms Collins.

The Commission’s report has now been referred to the Justice and Electoral Select Committee for consideration in its Inquiry into the 2011 General Election.

Many of the issues raised in the report will be directly relevant to the Justice and Electoral Committee’s Inquiry.

“This is also a good time to remind New Zealanders of the Electoral Commission’s review of MMP. I encourage anyone who wants their views to be considered to get their submission in before 31 May,” said Ms Collins.
