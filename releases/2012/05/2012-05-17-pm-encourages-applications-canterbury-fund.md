Prime Minister John Key is encouraging community organisations to apply to the second round of grants from the Vodafone Foundation Canterbury Fund, a $4 million joint project developed by the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal and the Vodafone Foundation.

“The Fund gives community groups a great opportunity to revive their activities in the suburbs they serve, as Cantabrians work to return their lives to normal,” says Mr Key.

Mr Key is visiting The Muse Community Music Trust at Wainoni School today - an after-school music programme which received $10,000 for new musical instruments in the Fund’s first round of grants.

“Grassroots organisations like The Muse are local hubs and bring communities together – and they’re particularly valuable for the children in Christchurch’s east, many of whom have had their homes and schools damaged and extra-curricular activities disrupted.

“Those community groups in Christchurch which work with young people, and want to keep making a difference, are encouraged to apply to the Fund during its second round of grants, which opens on May 28.”

The Vodafone Foundation Canterbury Fund will award grants ranging from $5000 to $50,000 to grassroots organisations, with an emphasis on youth-focused projects and capital or infrastructure projects.

The Christchurch Earthquake Appeal was launched by Mr Key, and is the Government’s official, global fundraiser for the recovery effort for Christchurch and the Canterbury region.

The Trust has committed funds of around $43 million to a variety of projects, including the Re:Start container mall in Cashel Street, the new Christchurch Stadium and the Court Theatre. Over $50 million remains to be allocated, with the Trust intending to disburse the majority during 2012.
