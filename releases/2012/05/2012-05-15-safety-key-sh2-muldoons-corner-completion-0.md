The completion of the SH2 Muldoon’s corner easing project near the summit of Rimutaka Hill in Wellington represents another improvement in the safety and efficiency of the country’s main transport routes, Associate Transport Minister Simon Bridges said at the completion celebration event today.

“This project greatly improves the alignment and design speed along the primary route that connects Wellington and the Wairarapa. Vehicles will now be able to travel on a straighter road at an average speed of 55km/hr. This is up from the previous speeds of 25-35km/hr and will make a big difference to daily commuters and tourists,” Mr Bridges says.

The improvements also enable commercial traffic and freight trucks, such as those carrying logs through to the port in Wellington, to navigate the road without encountering the ‘tight right’ Muldoon’s corner where they had to stop in order to pass safely.

Construction on the project started in September 2009. It received funding through the Government’s Jobs and Growth stimulus package and was bought forward 30 months ahead of programme. More than 200 people have worked on the $16.5 million project and as many as 80 were on site at any one time prior to completion, with 230,000 cubic metres of earthworks shifted.

“Road safety is one of the Government’s top transport priorities and projects such as the one we are celebrating today provide significant safety benefits to road-users. I commend all those involved with this easing project.”
