Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson and Environment Minister Amy Adams will consider a new report that challenges law makers to think about issues such as the trade-offs between renewable energy and wild and scenic rivers.

Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment Jan Wright has released a report titled: Hydroelectricity or wild rivers? Climate change versus natural heritage.

“Waterways play a key part in our native ecosystems and our economy. Dr Wright’s report shows that sometimes it is two positive environmental priorities – like conservation values and the obvious benefits of renewable energy – that can be in conflict,” the Ministers say.

“We would like to thank the Commissioner for her careful consideration on how to better protect our rivers. This is a complex area and Dr Wright has raised some important points. We will be considering her recommendations.”

The full range of environmental values and needs, including how to manage conflicting environmental priorities, are also being considered as part of the Government’s Fresh Start for Fresh Water reforms.
