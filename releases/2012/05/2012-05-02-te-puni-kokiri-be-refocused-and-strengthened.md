Māori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples has announced the membership and terms of reference for a working group to refocus and strengthen Te Puni Kokiri.

“I am looking for a more strategic influence and impact from Te Puni Kokiri, as was indicated in the Māori Party’s Relationship Accord and Confidence and Supply Agreement with the National Party,” said Dr Sharples.

“Māori and Iwi are increasingly seeking stronger relationships with the Crown, they are leading and coordinating themselves across multiple sectors, and moving into a post-settlement environment. Accordingly Te Puni Kokiri needs to refocus and strengthen itself for advising on and facilitating Māori interests,” he said.

“Cabinet has agreed to a working party of four people from outside the public service, plus officials from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, and the State Services Commission.

“The four outside members are Piri Sciascia as Chair, Parekawhia McLean, Naida Glavish and Ross Tanner. They bring together a strong mix of Māori and broader public policy knowledge, Māori community development experience and knowledge of the machinery of government.

“The officials on the working party will ensure that the government’s expectations for better public services are a core part of their brief. I also expect the working party to take full account of Whānau Ora, and how this fits with new arrangements for Te Puni Kokiri; and the Ministry’s four-year budget plan as well.

“The working party will report back to the group of Ministers by mid-July, and I expect to report back to Cabinet with formal recommendations by the end of July,” said Dr Sharples.
