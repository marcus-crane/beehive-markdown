Pacific Island Affairs Minister Hekia Parata encourages all to participate in the Samoan language week celebrations beginning Sunday 27 May.

“The theme this year, O le vāfealoa’i: strong and respectful relationships, is a fitting theme for this years’ Samoan language week, as Samoa also celebrates 50 years of independence and the signing of a Treaty of Friendship with New Zealand,” says Ms Parata.

“I congratulate the Samoan community for leading the way and taking charge of their language and heritage. This can only be led by the community which it serves, and Samoans do this very well with this initiative.

The Samoan population makes up almost half of the Pacific population in New Zealand. By 2026 it is expected that one in ten people in New Zealand will be of Pacific descent.

Samoan language is the third most commonly spoken in New Zealand, and the second most-spoken in Auckland.

“As a Government we support Pacific languages at early childhood level where our communities are well and truly engaged at the heart of these centres.

“Community-driven initiatives, such as this reflect how important identity, language and culture are. I encourage everyone to have fun and get involved. Ia manuia le vaiaso.”

The Human Rights Commission and FAGASA (the Association for the Teaching of Samoa in Aotearoa), lead the promotion of Samoan language week and associated activities.
