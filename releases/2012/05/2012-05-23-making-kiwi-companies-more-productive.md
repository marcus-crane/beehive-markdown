The 2012 EECA Awards winners prove that good energy use brings strong economic benefits, Energy and Resources Minister Phil Heatley said at the Awards ceremony in Auckland tonight.

Mr Heatley presented this year’s Supreme Award to national carrier Air New Zealand.

“Air New Zealand is a great exemplar of why New Zealand businesses have so much to gain from improving their use of energy,” Mr Heatley said.

“The airline has saved more than $540 million in fuel costs alone since 2005. It has strengthened its competitive position, and is taking the lead in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in global aviation.

“Good energy management makes Kiwi companies more productive and more competitive, and is a good way to demonstrate environmental responsibility,” he said.

“That’s why the Government is determined to help companies reduce their use of energy and fossil fuels ¬- for example, through initiatives like EECA’s business grants.”

The combined value of the projects to all EECA Award entrants was more than $600 million.

The EECA Awards celebrate organisations and individuals who have demonstrated excellence and innovation in energy efficiency or renewable energy.

This year, nearly 90 entries were received across the nine categories. Entrants ranged from small businesses to large corporates to outstanding individuals, spanning public and private sectors and community-based organisations.

“As we strive to improve New Zealand’s competitiveness internationally, I’d like to encourage businesses across all industries to follow the lead of tonight’s winners and look at where they can improve the way they use energy,” Mr Heatley said.
