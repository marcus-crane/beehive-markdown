Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee has applauded the hard work done over the past nine months which has seen the Manawatu Gorge reopen today, albeit with a limited one way service.

“I very much appreciate the efforts of lead contractor Higgins and all their sub-contractors who have been working day and night to clear the largest road slip we’ve ever seen in the country’s history,” Mr Brownlee said.

“Today’s re-opening is good news for motorists, especially coming in time for Queen’s Birthday weekend.

“I also want to thank the public for their patience during the gorge closure and ask for their continued support as the team works to return the road to full capacity.”

As the temporary gorge road is restricted to one lane in width, the reopening will initially apply only to traffic travelling east-west between Woodville and Ashhurst.

The NZ Transport Agency expects soon to allow two-way traffic at night when vehicle numbers are lower.  Vehicles travelling from Ashhurst towards Woodville and the Hawke’s Bay will need to continue using the Saddle Road during the day.

“I’d ask motorists planning to use the re-opened road to please heed all advice given by the NZ Transport Agency.  The temporary road will need to be monitored for safety, and there are likely to be some delays,” Mr Brownlee said.

Meanwhile work is underway to repair the bridge damaged in last August’s slip and return the road to two-way traffic.

“This would normally be at least a six month job, but as with work to date it is being expedited, once again with round the clock seven day a week efforts, so depending on weather and other factors it’s hoped the gorge road will be fully operational by September,” Mr Brownlee said.

Further detail on the partial reopen is available on the NZ Transport Agency website: [www.nzta.govt.nz](http://www.nzta.govt.nz).
