The Household Labour Force Survey released today underlines the gradual, steady growth in the number of jobs, Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce says.

The HLFS for March 2012 shows an increase in the number of people employed with 9000 new jobs in the quarter, the highest labour force participation rate in three years, but also the unemployment rate lifting from 6.4 per cent to 6.7 per cent.

“These figures continue to reflect a challenging job market as the country continues to deal with the impact of the Global Financial Crisis and Canterbury earthquakes,” Mr Joyce says.

“Despite these challenges, over the past year 20,000 jobs have been created and the number on the unemployment benefit has fallen by 6500.”

Mr Joyce says the Government’s business growth agenda is focused on providing opportunities for competitive businesses to establish and grow to create more jobs and higher wages.

“Nothing creates sustainable jobs and boosts our standard of living better than business confidence and growth,” Mr Joyce says.

“The Government is working hard to give businesses the opportunity to grow and create jobs across a range of diverse sectors such as the expansion of intensive agriculture, the development of aquaculture, backing the hi-tech industry, supporting our film industry, expanding oil and gas exploration, encouraging foreign investment, and progressing an international convention centre in Auckland.

“We are also investing billions of dollars into critical infrastructure across New Zealand such as the rollout of ultra-fast broadband, more roading and rail, and upgrading the electricity grid to ensure security of supply.

"If we want more and better jobs for New Zealanders then we need to keep working hard to encourage more businesses to be based here.”
