Civil Defence Minister Chris Tremain says that an initial milestone has been reached today with over 100,000 people registered to participate in the first nationwide ShakeOut earthquake drill.

“The Canterbury earthquakes have shown us that we need to be prepared for major earthquakes, and practise how to protect ourselves when they happen,” says Mr Tremain.

“New Zealand ShakeOut is an important Civil Defence initiative and I’m pleased to see workplaces, schools and families are getting behind it.

“The Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management has written to major government agencies and New Zealand’s 100 largest businesses about Shakeout this week, and I encourage them to get on board.”

New Zealand ShakeOut aims to have one million people Drop, Cover and Hold at 9.26am on Wednesday September 26th 2012 (9:26-26:9).

The drill is supported by a dedicated website, [www.getthru.govt.nz](http://www.getthru.govt.nz). People can visit the website to get information on earthquakes, preparedness, and the ShakeOut drill in September.
