Budget 2012 is delivering a further $68 million of operating funding over the next four years to maintain the record levels of elective surgery achieved under the National-led Government, and to further reduce waiting times for patients.

“This Government has achieved huge increases in the number of people getting the operations they need,” Health Minister Tony Ryall says. “District health boards are now performing 27,000 more elective operations a year – 500 extra operations a week – compared to 2008.

“We are investing a further $48 million over the next four years to continue to increase those record numbers by at least 4,000 each year.

“We also want shorter waits for important diagnostic tests, such as MRI scans, CT scans, colonoscopies, and angiograms. These tests help determine if patients require an operation.

“Over the next four years we’re also investing $16 million in new IT systems to facilitate faster access to these important tests, and $4 million for a national register of patients treated for heart conditions, to improve the quality of the care across hospitals.

“This was a key recommendation of the New Zealand Cardiac Network.

“Despite tight financial times, the Government is spending $14.12 billion in 2012/13 on health – the biggest investment ever. This demonstrates the Government’s commitment to protecting and growing public health services.”
