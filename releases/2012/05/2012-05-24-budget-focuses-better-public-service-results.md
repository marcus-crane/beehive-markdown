Budget 2012 includes further steps towards an innovative, efficient public sector delivering better results for New Zealanders within tight financial constraints, Finance Minister Bill English says.

“This Government is focused on getting better results, rather than just increasing inputs. It’s time to measure success by better outcomes, rather than by how much extra money we are spending, as was the case for much of the 2000s,” Mr English says.

“Two months ago, the Prime Minister set 10 challenging and specific results for the public service to achieve over the next three to five years, including difficult issues like reducing crime, reducing long-term welfare dependency, and reducing educational under-achievement.

“We’ve already announced one of the results targets – 85 per cent of 18-year-olds having NCEA Level 2 or equivalent in five years – and we are announcing more as part of Budget 2012.”

The targets are:

- Reducing prisoner reoffending by 25 per cent by 2017. Reaching this target would mean 18,500 fewer victims of crime every year.
- Increasing the rate of participation in early childhood education to 98 per cent by 2016, from 94.7 per cent currently.

“Achieving these results will be demanding and difficult, but we are determined to get better results for taxpayers and the users of government services,” Mr English says. “The other results targets will be announced by 30 June.

“Progress towards achieving these targets will be reported publicly so New Zealanders can judge for themselves how well we are doing.

“This is a fundamental shift that requires different thinking. We are not a government that thinks spending more money on something is an end in itself. We are a government that thinks getting results is what’s really important.

“If a programme can get results, we are much more likely to spend money on it. If it doesn’t contribute to better results, we are much more likely to reduce spending on it,” Mr English says.

Despite tight financial constraints, Budget 2012 contains a number of initiatives and decisions aimed at improving frontline public services and getting real results for New Zealanders, including:

- A $287.5 million up-front investment over the next four years in the first phase of the Government’s welfare reforms, which provide more support to help people off welfare and into work. These changes are expected to reduce an individual’s likelihood of becoming long-term welfare dependent.
- $65 million over the next four years, reprioritised from within the Department of Corrections, to boost prisoner rehabilitation and reintegration programmes and to support the Government’s target of reducing reoffending by 25 per cent by 2017.
- Almost $1.5 billion of new funding over the next four years for health initiatives, including faster cancer treatment, more elective surgery, and strengthened maternity and disability services.
- $511.9 million over the next four years, and some additional funding set aside in contingency, for new education initiatives. This includes supporting the development of quality teachers and principals, and targeting additional ECE funding where it is most needed.

“In many cases, new initiatives have been paid for by reprioritising funding from lower priority activities, consistent with the approach we have taken in previous Budgets to improve frontline services and get better results with little or no new money,” Mr English says.
