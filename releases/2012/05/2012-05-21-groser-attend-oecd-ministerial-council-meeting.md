Trade Minister Tim Groser will travel to Paris to join Ministers from over 40 countries at the annual OECD Ministerial Council meeting this week.

"The OECD Ministerial Council Meeting is an important opportunity to discuss trade and economic issues," Mr Groser says.

“The OECD’s expertise is particularly relevant for governments seeking to improve long-term growth as the global economy moves on from the financial crisis.

“Trade can provide an important stimulus to economies. The OECD is at the forefront of work redefining how we think about trade in the 21st Century, where growth is driven, in part, by integration into global supply chains.

“I am looking forward to conversations with other Ministers about the OECD’s work on the global supply chain as well as issues such as trade protectionism and fossil fuel subsidy reform,” says Mr Groser.

While in Paris, Mr Groser will also participate in an OECD Forum panel discussion on trade and jobs. He will also attend a series of business events and meetings to promote trade and investment links between New Zealand and France. France is one of New Zealand’s most important markets in Europe.
