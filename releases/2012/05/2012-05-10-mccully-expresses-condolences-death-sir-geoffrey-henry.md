Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully has expressed his condolences following the death of former Cook Island Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Henry.

“On behalf of New Zealand, I offer my thoughts to Lady Louisa, the Henry family and to the people of the Cook Islands who have lost a key figure in their recent history,” Mr McCully says.

Sir Geoffrey, who was 72, twice served as Prime Minister of the Cook Islands - in 1983 and from 1989-1999. In 1992 he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth.

“I met with Sir Geoffrey regularly over the years and appreciated his forthright views, his colourful personality and lively character,” Mr McCully says.

Most recently he served as Speaker of the House and President of the Cook Islands Olympic Committee.
