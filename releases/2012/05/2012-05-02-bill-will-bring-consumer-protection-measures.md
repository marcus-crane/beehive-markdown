Consumer protection measures for New Zealanders building or renovating their homes are closer after Building Amendment Bill (No 4) passed its first reading in Parliament yesterday.

The Bill is the companion to the Building Amendment Act 2012 which came into force on 13 March 2012. It provides a range of measures designed to help consumers hold building practitioners to account.

“These amendments form a package of changes to lift the performance and productivity of the building industry,” Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson says.

Changes include mandatory written contracts for all building work over $20,000, disclosure requirements for building contractors about their skills, qualifications, licensing status and track record, and rules making principal building contractors fix any defects in their work within 12 months.

“The proposed changes set the scene for an efficient and effective building and construction sector that stands behind the quality of its work,” Mr Williamson says.

It also includes amendments to the Dam Safety Scheme.
