Minister for Ethnic Affairs Judith Collins says New Zealand’s ethnic businesses have a significant contribution to make to our nation’s economy, ahead of tomorrow’s Ethnic People in Commerce New Zealand (EPIC NZ) Conference. 

The Conference is organised by the Office of Ethnic Affairs with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise. It will focus on ways to support and tap into the potential of our small and medium sized ethnic businesses.

“EPIC NZ brings like-minded business people together to exchange ideas, build important partnerships and pursue opportunities in both onshore and offshore markets,” Ms Collins says.

“Building on the strengths of our ethnic business people is essential for a more competitive and productive economy and expanding New Zealand’s access to Asia-Pacific markets.”

The Conference will promote [www.EPICNZ.co.nz](http://www.EPICNZ.co.nz) to help ethnic business people connect with each other, and the wider New Zealand SME sector.

“Sixty per cent of our workforce growth comes from migration.  Our ethnic and migrant communities are playing a growing role in our economy, helping us export more and creating more real jobs.

“Ethnic New Zealanders have the linguistic and cultural expertise, business acumen and experience to make valuable international connections and take our country forward.

“It makes sense to do all we can to unlock that potential to help create jobs and improve New Zealand’s trade opportunities,” Ms Collins says.
