- Total net new Government spending of just $26.5 million over the next four years, compared with a planned new operating allowance of $800 million a year.
- Spends $4.42 billion on improving frontline services by redirecting savings and new revenue to areas where it gets the best results.

- The forecast OBEGAL deficit falls to $7.9 billion in 2012/13, $2 billion in 2013/14, before a $197 million surplus in 2014/15.
