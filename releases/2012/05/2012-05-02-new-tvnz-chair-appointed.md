Broadcasting Minister Craig Foss today announced the appointment of Wayne Walden as the Chair of Television New Zealand (TVNZ).

“Mr Walden has been a member of the TVNZ Board since last year. He brings solid industry experience to the role, having also spent four years as the Chair of Māori Television,” says Mr Foss.

Mr Walden sits on the boards of Ports of Auckland Ltd and Arcos Investments Ltd. He was previously a Managing Director of the Farmers Deka retail chain and served as Chair of Tranz Rail.

Mr Walden received an Officer of The New Zealand Order of Merit (ONZM) Honour for Services to Business and the Community in the 2007 Queen’s Birthday Honours List.

Mr Walden was appointed to the TVNZ Board last year. His three year term as Chair runs from 1 May 2012 until 30 April 2015.

Joan Withers has been reappointed as Deputy Chair.

Mr Foss thanked the outgoing Chair, Sir John Anderson and retiring Director Anne Blackburn for their work over the last six years.
