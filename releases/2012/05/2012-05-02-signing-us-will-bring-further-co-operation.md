Today’s signing of a joint statement with the United States signals the start of a two-year work programme to ensure trade and travel with the United States is secure and efficient, Customs Minister Maurice Williamson says.

The Joint Statement between New Zealand and the United States to Strengthen Border Security, Combat Transnational Crime and Facilitate Legitimate Trade and Travel was signed in Wellington by Mr Williamson and the visiting Secretary of the US Department of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano.

The signing will mean more co-operation with the United States to target people and goods that may threaten our countries.

“Working with other countries to secure and facilitate trade was a key part of the New Zealand Government’s programme,” Mr Williamson says.

“Today’s joint statement enables the New Zealand Customs Service and the US Department of Homeland Security to work more closely together, not just to protect against threats but to continue and develop our work with businesses.”

New Zealand’s Integrated Targeting and Operations Center (ITOC) and the National Targeting Center (NTC) in the United States can co-operate in targeting processes and share intelligence on potential risk.

“These are exciting developments and we warmly welcome the benefits this partnership brings New Zealand,” Mr Williamson says.
