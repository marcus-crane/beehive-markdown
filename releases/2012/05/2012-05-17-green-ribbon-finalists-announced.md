Environment Minister Amy Adams has today announced 35 finalists for the 2012 Green Ribbon Awards, which honour outstanding contributions to protecting New Zealand's environment.

“The awards reflect the broad range of environmental challenges that New Zealand faces and the actions being taken to address them,” Ms Adams says.

“Tackling environmental issues is not easy. It takes initiative and dedication. “The awards pay homage to the incredible efforts being undertaken in homes, schools, communities and workplaces to address the environmental challenges we face.”

There are 12 award categories that recognise individuals, businesses, communities and youth, as well as larger organisations.

For the 2012 awards, 284 nominations were received, which is an increase from last year. 

The finalists will now attend an awards ceremony at Parliament Buildings on 5 June.  Winners will be announced in each category, and an overall supreme winner will be revealed.

“I am looking forward to meeting the finalists and learning first-hand about the great work they are all doing to improve the environment.”
