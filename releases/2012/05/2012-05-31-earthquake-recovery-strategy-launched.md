Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has today released the Recovery Strategy which sets out the directions and priorities for the region’s recovery.

Developed by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA), the Recovery Strategy is essentially a roadmap through the rebuild.

It has been developed following months of consultation and collaboration with the community and CERA’s key stakeholders, including Te Rünanga o Ngāi Tahu, the Christchurch City Council, Selwyn and Waimakariri District Councils and Environment Canterbury.

The public contributed through a series of community workshops and online submissions.

Mr Brownlee says the Recovery Strategy outlines how opportunities for investment, innovation and job creation can be maximised, while ensuring the wellbeing of the community is at the heart of the recovery.

“It is time to move Christchurch firmly on from the disaster response phase to the rebuild and revitalisation of the region.  This strategy is the how-to guide for every sector involved in the rebuild to follow.

“New Zealand has never needed a long term strategy for disaster recovery before, so this document has broken new ground.  The depth and breadth of the submissions from the general public and the hundreds of other groups that contributed has provided an excellent framework for the redevelopment of the key areas the Recovery Strategy concentrates on.”

The Recovery Strategy covers community wellbeing, the built environment, the natural environment, the economy and culture and heritage.  Other recovery plans will sit under this overarching strategy.

Developing a Recovery Strategy was a requirement of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011, which sets out CERA’s responsibility for rebuilding greater Christchurch and its surrounds, and supporting the welfare of its residents.
