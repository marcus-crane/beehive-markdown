Budget 2012 continues the Government’s support for foundation training for young people, with 3,000 more places funded over the next four years under the Youth Guarantee Scheme.

“With these extra fees-free places, there will be 8,750 tertiary-based Youth Guarantee places in 2013,” Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce says.

“Along with trades and service academies, the wider Youth Guarantee will offer a total of 12,930 fees-free places for 16- and 17-year-olds in 2013. That means the Government is a year ahead of its commitment to have 12,500 Youth Guarantee places by 2014.

“An additional $37.7 million operating funding over the next four years provides 3,000 more places at levels 1-3 for our young people in institutes of technology, polytechnics, wānanga, and private training establishments.

“This includes priority trade areas such as carpentry, engineering, horticulture, plumbing, gas-fitting, and brick- and block-laying,” Mr Joyce says.

It brings the Government’s total investment in the Youth Guarantee Scheme in 2012/13 to $117.4 million.

“The large number of young people signing up to the Youth Guarantee demonstrates how much they enjoy learning in this different environment,” Mr Joyce says.

“The scheme is giving young people practical skills and the opportunity for a career, particularly those at risk of dropping out of school.”
