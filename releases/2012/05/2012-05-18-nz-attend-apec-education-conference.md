Associate Education Minister, Craig Foss will attend the fifth APEC Education Ministers’ Meeting in Gyeongju, Korea next week.

The Korean Ministry of Education Science and Technology and APEC’s Education Network are bringing together Education Ministers, academics and senior officials from the 21 APEC economies.

The group will review progress on collaborative education projects and set the direction for a new four-year work programme.

“Like most economies, we are looking at ways that education can contribute to prosperity and 21st century economic development – development that is balanced, inclusive, sustainable, innovative and secure,’’ says Mr Foss.

A key focus of the APEC education network is to enhance regional integration and the interoperability of frameworks.

There is also interest in the development of standards-based curricula and assessment approaches where New Zealand has been identified as leader.

Mr Foss will also spend time in Seoul where he will meet with officials from the Korean business and finance sectors.
