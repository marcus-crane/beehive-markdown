Described by economists as a “sleeping giant”, New Zealand’s Māori Taniwha economy is “wide awake and hungry for business” says Māori Affairs Minister Pita Sharples. This week the Hong Kong Trade and Business Roadshow is touring the country, with Te Puni Kōkiri hosting hui targeting Māori businesses.

“While Aotearoa hosts Hong Kong’s business and political leaders – we have made sure they also get to meet the leaders of our Māori economy,” says Dr Sharples.

Valued in 2010 at close to $37 billion, tribal and private Māori enterprises in New Zealand and offshore span agriculture, property, telecommunications and tourism. BERL has predicted extra $12.1 billion in GDP by 2061 for NZ’s Māori economy effectively utilise science and innovation. The Hong Kong economy is seen as one of the world’s most dynamic, promoted as the natural gateway for entrepreneurs into mainland China.

Of huge economic significance, Hong Kong is equally significant in terms of culture and history says Dr Sharples.

“Māori can relate to our Hong Kong trading partners as we are both working to strengthen our economic base – while also celebrating our cultural and historical heritage.”

“Having the rangatira or chiefs of Hong Kong here is an honour and opportunity I hope NZ entrepreneurs will make the most of.”

“The dawn of the Year of the Water Dragon is behind us all, it is up to ourselves to make the most of this auspicious time.”
