The New Zealand and the United States governments have signed an agreement to do all they can to stop human trafficking in the Pacific.

The agreement was signed in Wellington by the Minister of Immigration, Nathan Guy, and the visiting Secretary of the US Department of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano.

Under the agreement the two countries have stated their intention to continue working together to detect, disrupt, dismantle and deter criminal enterprises which seek to profit from the exploitation of others in the Pacific region.

“As countries with a shared interest in the Pacific region, it is in our interest to protect all communities from falling victim to the horrific crime of trafficking in persons. We want to do everything we can to support the Pacific,” says Mr Guy.

The two governments have agreed to further develop Pacific Island regional partnerships and to enhance cooperation among enforcement agencies to target, disrupt, dismantle and deter criminal enterprises across international borders.

“We will work together to protect people in the Pacific so that they are better equipped to detect and identify victims of trafficking.

“We recognise that we need to strengthen support infrastructures in the Pacific so that countries are better equipped to rescue victims of trafficking and help them to recover. This agreement is an important step forward.”
