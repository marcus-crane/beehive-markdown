Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson has received a report into the reasons for the collapse of the Stadium Southland roof on 18 September 2010.

The detailed technical investigation was written by Hyland and StructureSmith. It explains the roof collapsed because of a combination of factors including heavy snowfall, construction defects and design problems.

“These are serious issues that have been properly investigated. The Department of Building and Housing has accepted the findings and recommendations of the report, which will be communicated to building owners and councils,” Mr Williamson said.

Mr Williamson said New Zealand’s building standards are among the best in the world and are continually refined and updated to reflect international best practice.

The Department has referred the investigation report to the NZ Police and the Department of Labour, and provided a copy to IPENZ – the body responsible for monitoring the competence of engineers.
