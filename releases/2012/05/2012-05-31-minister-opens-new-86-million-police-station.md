Police Minister Anne Tolley has today officially opened the new Otahuhu police station in Counties Manukau.

The $8.6 million facility is the second new station to open in Counties Manukau this month, closely following the new $10.2 million Police headquarters at Botany.

“This is yet another boost to the Counties Manukau area,” says Mrs Tolley.

“We needed more space after the National-led Government provided an additional 300 frontline officers, so staff and the local community will benefit from these new modern facilities.

“I also want to congratulate everyone involved in the project, as it came in well under budget.

“Nationally, recorded crimes are at a fifteen-year low, and Counties Manukau Police have made a valuable contribution to this.

“It was great to have the opportunity to thank local officers for all their hard work in making our communities safer.”
