Commerce Minister Craig Foss has congratulated the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand (IPONZ) on its world-leading online registration system.

“This new system is the best in the world. It removes the need for paper filing, cuts down on processing times, reduces compliance burdens and introduces much greater capabilities for Kiwi entrepreneurs,” says Mr Foss.

More than 4520 trade mark applications and 365 design applications have been lodged since the site went live three months ago.

“Tasks that previously took days can be done automatically and examination times can be reduced by more than eighty per cent.

“The system has been given the seal of approval by the World Intellectual Property Office, which says it provides comprehensive world-class features rarely seen in other countries,” says Mr Foss.

Further information can be found at www.iponz.govt.nz/cms.

“The new system gives trade-mark examiners more time to consider applications, instead of getting weighed down with administrative tasks,” says Mr Foss.

Mr Foss also congratulated IPONZ for winning the Grafton 2012 Driving Transformational Change Award earlier this week.
