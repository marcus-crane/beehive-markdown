The Government is investing another $13 million over the next two years to support the ongoing demand for Canterbury social services.

“Since the earthquakes, Canterbury social service providers have done an outstanding job meeting the needs of the community,” says Mrs Bennett.

“The Government has provided $20 million for community and non-government organisations (NGOs) in Canterbury since September 2010, but we see the need for more funding over the next year.”

This funding recognises the enormous and life changing impact of the Canterbury earthquakes is still being felt.

The funding will:

- Continue to support counselling services
- Assist NGOs to co-ordinate services
- Provide case management for families with complex needs
- Deliver workshops and training to NGOs and volunteers
- Support the continuation of the 0800 Government Helpline

There are hundreds of community based services working hard to support families and individuals in Canterbury and this funding will be good news.

The Government provided more than $214 million in wage subsidies following the earthquakes, helping businesses and individuals stay on their feet.

Despite predictions of an extra 24,000 on Unemployment Benefits, those numbers never rose substantially and in fact fell by 30 percent in the last year.
