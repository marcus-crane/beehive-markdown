Five bowel cancers and five cancerous polyps have been detected in the first few months of the four year bowel screening pilot at Waitemata District Health Board.

Health Minister Tony Ryall, who is visiting the Bowel Screening Coordination Centre in Takapuna today, says international evidence shows that a screening programme can significantly reduce the number of people who die from bowel cancer, through early diagnosis and treatment.

“Bowel cancer is the second biggest cause of cancer death in New Zealand, but if it is detected early, as can happen in a screening programme, there is a very good chance of long term survival.

“The pilot programme began at Waitemata District Health Board late last year, and to date more than 7,500 screening kits have been returned and tested. Of those around 490 people have been offered a diagnostic colonoscopy as blood was found in their sample - a possible sign of bowel cancer.

A colonoscopy can identify if a person has cancer or pre-cancerous polyps.

“These figures are encouraging. They indicate people are receptive to the idea of bowel screening, but it is still early days.

"Towards the end of the pilot the Government will analyse what's worked and what hasn't, and make a decision on rolling out a national programme.

"One of the big constraints will be the workforce to do colonoscopies and work is underway to better understand demand and capacity to ensure the current workforce is being used in the most efficient way.

People aged 50 to 74 years who live in the Waitemata District Health Board area are eligible to take part in the programme. They are sent a simple bowel screening test kit in the post that they can complete at home and post to a designated laboratory for analysis. They receive their results within three weeks.
