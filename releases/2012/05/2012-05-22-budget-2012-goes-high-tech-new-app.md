The Government will launch a smartphone and tablet app for Budget 2012 on Thursday, providing more ready access to Budget material and helping to reduce the need for printed documents, Finance Minister Bill English says.

“This is a good example of the Government’s focus on delivering better, more innovative, public services,” he says.

“It’s also in line with the Prime Minister’s expectation that New Zealanders will interact increasingly with the Government in a digital environment.”

The Budget App, called NZ Budget, will work on Android phones and tablets, iPhones, and iPads. It will allow users to read the Budget speech and key Budget documents, watch video coverage and read ministers’ public statements.

The cost of the new app was funded through reduced printing costs. It was developed in less than four weeks for the Treasury by Wellington company PaperKite.

“This is an example of a government agency resetting its priorities to keep up with changing public demand,” Mr English says.

“We will be updating and rolling out the Budget app each year, and looking to use it for other related government information, as the Government moves increasingly online,” Mr English says.

The Budget app will be available to download free from Apple and Android app stores from late Wednesday afternoon and further information and links will be available from the Treasury’s website [www.treasury.govt.nz/budget/app](http://www.treasury.govt.nz/budget/app). The app will go live at 2pm Thursday.

Printed copies of key Budget documents will still be available from selected bookshops. Full documents will also be available at the Treasury’s website from 2pm on Thursday, 24 May, when the Budget is delivered in Parliament.
