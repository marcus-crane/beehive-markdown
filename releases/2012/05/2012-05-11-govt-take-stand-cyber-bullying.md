Justice Minister Judith Collins has asked the Law Commission to fast-track its recommendations for reducing the harm caused by cyber-bullying.

Ms Collins says the Government is extremely concerned about the growing incidence of this abhorrent bullying and the devastating effects it can have on young people.

“Young people’s lives are increasingly enmeshed in social media and they are particularly at risk from the significant harm that can be caused by cyber-bullying.”

As part of its report, The News Media Meets New Media, the Law Commission is investigating potential changes to:

• introduce a new offence of maliciously impersonating another person on the web

• the Harassment Act 1997 to ensure its provisions apply to cyber-bullying and other online intimidation.

• extend the Telecommunications Act 2001 definition of misuse of a ‘telephone device’ to also cover computers and other electronic devices.

• amend the Human Rights Act to make it clear that publications likely to ‘excite hostility or invite contempt’ include digital publications and that cyberspace is a ‘public place’ from which people cannot be excluded as a consequence of significant and harmful sexual or racial harassment by others.

• investigate the need to make ‘incitement to suicide’ a criminal offence, regardless of whether a person actually commits suicide, or attempts to.

“I have written to the Commission and have asked that its work around cyber-bullying is given priority. I look forward to receiving their recommendations as soon as possible.

“I am concerned that we treat this as a priority, and take action to reduce the potential for harm where we can,” Ms Collins says.
