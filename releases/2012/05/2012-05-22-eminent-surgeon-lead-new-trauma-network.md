One of New Zealand’s most senior clinical leaders, surgeon Mr Ian Civil, has been appointed Network Clinical Leader of a new Major Trauma National Clinical Network.

The new network is a joint initiative between ACC and the Ministry of Health.  It aims to ensure that the very best level of care is provided consistently across New Zealand to severely injured people.

Mr Civil is a leading trauma and vascular surgeon with extensive national and international experience in both practice and education.  He is Director of Surgery at the Auckland District Health Board, and was previously the President of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons.

The Minister of Health Tony Ryall and the Minister for ACC Judith Collins, have welcomed the appointment.

Mr Ryall says: “Mr Civil will provide valuable clinical leadership and will work with clinicians and key stakeholders to implement service and quality improvements.”

“This Government has encouraged doctors and nurses to play a greater role in the running and future planning of our health services by leading clinical networks such as this.

Ms Collins adds: “ACC provides lifelong support to people with serious injuries, so it’s vital that they get the very best support.  This will help improve survival rates following major injuries, ensure the very best rehabilitation outcomes and provide important information to target effective injury prevention strategies.”

**Background**

The network will:

- provide clinical leadership and develop a national, strategic approach to the provision of major trauma services from pre-hospital emergency care to rehabilitation and injury prevention services
- coordinate major trauma service improvements
- provide expert advice on the monitoring and auditing of major trauma services
- provide leadership to develop training opportunities
