Health Minister Tony Ryall has congratulated Counties Manukau District Health Board for doing two and half thousand more operations a year than three years ago.

Minister Ryall has also given the DHB the official go ahead to build more operating theatres to provide even more services for patients.

"Counties Manukau is one of the fastest growing centres in the country, facing considerable population growth – and I am pleased to announce the Government’s approval for three new operating theatres at Middlemore Hospital and the replacement of eleven existing aged theatres.

"The planned new clinical services block is the third part of a $208.67 million development project towards future proofing Middlemore Hospital.

“This project began under the National Government in 2009, and we are contributing $100 million of the budget,” says Mr Ryall.

“The new clinical services block will also include a 42 bed Assessment and Planning Unit, an 18 bed High Dependency Unit, and replace the clinical sterile supply department.

“The other two parts of this major project included refurbishing the Edmund Hilary Block with 31 extra beds, and upgrading services and adding 33 beds in the Adult Medical Centre for Assessment, Treatment and Rehabilitation inpatient wards.

“Over the past three years, the Government has invested $1.5 billion of new money into the public health service, including over $180 million extra funding to Counties Manukau DHB.

"The DHB has invested this extra funding into more elective operations for patients, and more services supported by over 180 more frontline doctors (junior and senior) and 320 more nurses (excluding health care assistants).

“I would like to thank Counties staff for the tremendous job they’re doing.”
