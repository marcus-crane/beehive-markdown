The Government will fund 1,000 Māori cadetships over the next four years, Māori Affairs Minister Pita Sharples says.

“A total of $10 million allocated to the Māori cadetship programme over the next four years will enable 250 young Māori cadets a year to get paid jobs and training opportunities for at least six months,” Dr Sharples says.

“This means 250 people a year for four years will be on the road to success, through partnerships with private sector employers. This cadetship programme has a track record of exceeding targets in the past, and I am expecting great results from this investment in our young people.

“This decision also supports my vision for Te Puni Kokiri to focus on areas of critical importance to Māori communities – in this case jobs – through strategic influence and partnerships with other government agencies, industry, and local government,” Dr Sharples says.

“Māori Affairs has contributed to Corrections’ initiatives that support kaupapa Māori rehabilitation programmes, to education programmes for kaupapa Māori schools, to Māori health initiatives, and to Whānau Ora.

“Cooperation, coordination, and collective effort are how Māori Affairs achieves the best outcomes for Māori in the long term, and this Budget reflects that approach.

“The Government has also reallocated $2 million to maintain the Ma te Reo Fund until the new Māori Language Strategy is signed off and major decisions on funding for Māori language can be made,” says Dr Sharples.
