Small Business Minister John Banks today launched the Business.govt.nz second annual ANZ Flying Start Business Plan competition, with more than $80,000 worth of prizes up for grabs. 

“The ANZ Flying Start Business Plan competition seeks out the best business plan from new or fledgling New Zealand enterprises, and helps them put their plans into action,” Mr Banks said. 

“Small and medium businesses drive the New Zealand economy, making up 97 per cent of all enterprises and employing over 500,000 Kiwis. 

“This competition is a great chance to bring out our country’s entrepreneurial spirit and help New Zealanders turn their ideas into reality.”

The competition includes a $56,000 national prize package, $10,000 exporter prize package and 16 $1000 regional prizes.

“A business plan is vital for growing your business.  It gives your company direction and timelines to achieve your goals, and provides a guideline for your day-to-day operations and decisions,” Mr Banks said. 

“The ANZ Flying Start Business Plan competition is a great opportunity to encourage businesses to start that planning and reward them in the process.

“Business.govt.nz is a government website filled with useful resources to help businesses start, manage and grow their enterprises.

“I would encourage any New Zealander keen on starting a business to visit [www.business.govt.nz](http://www.business.govt.nz). Who knows, with a bit of business planning, your idea could be the next Trade Me,” Mr Banks said.

The ANZ Flying Start Business Plan competition is open to all businesses with sales of less than $2 million, including those with a business idea that they want to get off the ground.

The supreme winner will receive $30,000 for approved growth building opportunities, provided by ANZ.  In addition, they’ll win $10,000 for marketing consultation from the Marketing Bureau, $5,000 for legal advice from Lane Neave Lawyers, $5,000 in business education and training from Stellaris, $5,000 of advertising and editorial in NZBusiness Magazine, and $1,000 of MYOB products or services.

ANZ is also offering a separate prize which is open to all regional finalists with export potential. The winner receives up to $10,000 for airfares, accommodation and transfers for a business trip to meet potential trade partners.

Regional winners will receive $1,000 in cash provided by Ernst & Young and MYOB.
