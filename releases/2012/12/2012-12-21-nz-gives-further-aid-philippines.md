Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced New Zealand will provide further assistance to the Philippines to help with the recovery process following Typhoon Bopha.

Two weeks after Typhoon Bopha first hit the Philippines, the death toll stands at 1050, while 838 people remain missing.  Bopha affected 6.2 million people in 34 provinces, destroying thousands of homes and livelihoods.

“New Zealand will be making an additional $1.5 million available to support relief and early recovery efforts, taking our support so far to $2 million,” Mr McCully says. 

The New Zealand Government earlier provided $500,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross for essential relief items such as food, water and shelter.

New Zealand’s latest contribution will support UNICEF ($1 million) and New Zealand non-government organisations ($500,000) in meeting urgent water and sanitation needs.
