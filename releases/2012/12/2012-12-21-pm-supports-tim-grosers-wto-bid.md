Prime Minister John Key said the Government has nominated Trade Minister Tim Groser for the position of Director-General of the World Trade Organisation.

WTO members will need to agree by consensus on a new Director-General to replace Pascal Lamy by the end of May next year.

“Nominations have been called for by the end of December, and I can confirm that Mr Groser’s name has been put forward, with the New Zealand Government’s blessing,” says Mr Key.

“Given Tim Groser’s experience in trade, and the blend of both technical and political skills he brings to the table, I believe he is well-placed to advance the complex and challenging issues facing the WTO. The organisation has a vital part to play in the global economy recovery.

“Mr Groser’s work within the GATT and the WTO over several rounds of trade negotiations has provided him with a deep understanding of the importance of the multilateral trading system,” says Mr Key.

Mr Groser says he greatly valued being nominated by the New Zealand Government for the Director-General role.

“I have spent most of my professional life working to advance international trade issues and consider the WTO to be of fundamental importance to global economic development and prosperity.

“The past few years have placed great stress on the multilateral trading system and the next few years will be critical in maintaining the WTO’s relevance and value for its members,” says Mr Groser.
