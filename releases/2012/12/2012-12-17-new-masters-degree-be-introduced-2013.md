Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today announced that degree-awarding institutions will now be able to provide 180 credit Master’s degrees.

“The introduction of the new Master’s Degree will allow students to complete the necessary credits typically between 12 to 18 months instead of in two years,” Mr Joyce says.

“The new Master’s Degree is likely to be popular with graduates looking to enhance their knowledge and skills while they are working, and those that want to return to university full time for a year rather than two.

“It will also be attractive to students from overseas, which is important as we look to double the economic contribution of international education to New Zealand to $5 billion by 2025.

“The change to the Master’s Degree is consistent with international best practice and aligns with what is on offer in Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada.

“At the moment, 11,000 domestic students and 2,000 international students are enrolled in master’s degrees in New Zealand universities and polytechnics and the change we are making will allow our post-graduate sector to grow.

“New Zealand’s education system is highly regarded and the new Master’s Degree is designed to better meet the needs of all students, as well as institutions, while still providing the same quality education”.

The new Master’s Degree will be offered by institutions from 2013, conditional upon approval from NZQA or Universities New Zealand.
