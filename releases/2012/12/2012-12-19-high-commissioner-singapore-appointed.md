Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today named career diplomat Bernadette Cavanagh as New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to Singapore, with cross accreditation to the Maldives.

“Singapore is one of New Zealand’s closest partners in the region, but there is potential to do more,” Mr McCully says.

“The High Commissioner’s role is to champion the strengthening of the New Zealand/Singapore economic relationship, and increase cooperation with Singapore in ASEAN, APEC and other regional forums.

“Bernadette Cavanagh is well qualified to achieve these goals, with previous experience as head of the South East Asia Unit of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.”

Ms Cavanagh is currently the Deputy Permanent Representative at New Zealand’s mission to the United Nations in New York.
