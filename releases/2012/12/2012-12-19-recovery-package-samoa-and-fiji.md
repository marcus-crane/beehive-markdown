Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced provision of a further $2 million each for Samoa and Fiji to assist the next stage of recovery from Cyclone Evan.

The government has already provided $600,000 to Samoa and $400,000 to Fiji.

Mr McCully also announced that the P3 Orion that assisted Samoa with aerial assessment work in the early part of the week was moved to Fiji late yesterday to undertake similar work.

"While both countries continue to take stock of the cyclone damage it is clear that the cost is going to be substantial,” Mr McCully says.

“For this reason we have allocated a further $2m to each country to ensure there are no resource constraints over the coming days. In each case the funding will be administered by the Ministry in consultation with relevant agencies.”
