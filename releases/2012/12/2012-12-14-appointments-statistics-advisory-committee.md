Statistics Minister Maurice Williamson today announced one appointment and two reappointments to the Advisory Committee on Official Statistics (ACOS).

Professor Natalie Jackson, Director of the National Institute of Demographic and Economic Analysis, and Professor of Demography at Waikato University, will join the committee for an initial term of three years.

“Professor Jackson has expertise in demographic research and teaching. Her research is focused on the different drivers and patterns of population ageing across and within Australia and New Zealand,” Mr Williamson says.

Current members Kim Hill and Murray Bain have been reappointed to the committee for a further term, until June 2014.

Ms Hill is a broadcaster and host of Radio New Zealand’s Saturday Morning programme. Mr Bain was Acting Deputy Chief Executive, Science and Innovation, at the Ministry for Business, Innovation, and Employment, and is currently an independent consultant.

ACOS provides independent advice on official statistics and the official statistics system to the Statistics Minister and the Government.

“I'm pleased Professor Jackson is adding her considerable expertise to the committee, and glad both Ms Hill and Mr Bain are returning for another term," Mr Williamson says.
