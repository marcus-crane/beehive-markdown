Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced New Zealand will assist with the immediate response effort following Cyclone Evan in Samoa.

“At the request of the Samoan Government, New Zealand will provide a P3 Orion to undertake aerial surveillance and environmental health assessment expertise. We have also made available $50,000 to assist with the on-the-ground response,” Mr McCully says.

An initial assessment suggests there has been damage to outlying buildings, critical infrastructure and power lines, with flooding, many fallen trees and power outages.

Samoa Police have confirmed three fatalities and seven people missing, including a number of children.

“Our heartfelt condolences go out to the people of Samoa as they begin to come to terms with the loss of life and damage caused,” Mr McCully says.

Assessment of the damage is on-going and New Zealand will consider additional assistance if requested.

As Cyclone Evan heads towards Fiji, the Fiji Government is on high alert. New Zealand travellers are advised to contact their airline or travel agent regarding flight and accommodation bookings.

Members of the New Zealand public wishing to offer assistance should consider a cash donation to a humanitarian agency involved in the response.
