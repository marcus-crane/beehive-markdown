The Crown signed deeds of settlement for all outstanding historical Treaty claims with Ngāti Rangiwewehi and Tapuika at Ngati Moko Marae in Te Puke today, Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson announced.

Ngāti Rangiwewehi and Tapuika suffered greatly when the Crown brought war to the region in the 1860s. The Crown later established the Native Land Court which created unfortunate consequences for both iwi. These settlements will help right the wrongs of the past. Today Ngāti Rangiwewehi, Tapuika, and the wider community can look forward to a stronger future.

Ngāti Rangiwewehi and Tapuika will each receive financial redress of $6 million and specific cultural redress packages. This includes a co-governance arrangement over the Kaituna River for Tapuika and the return of culturally significant sites such as Hamurana Springs to Ngāti Rangiwewehi.

“The government is committed to resolving all historical treaty grievances in a timely and durable way,” Mr Finlayson said. “These settlements are an important step towards resolving historical claims in the Bay of Plenty region.”

The deeds were ratified by Ngāti Rangiwewehi and Tapuika members. The Crown has now signed nine deeds of settlement this year.

Legislation will be introduced into the House next year to give effect to the settlements.

Copies of the deeds are available on the Office of Treaty Settlements website [www.ots.govt.nz](http://www.ots.govt.nz)
