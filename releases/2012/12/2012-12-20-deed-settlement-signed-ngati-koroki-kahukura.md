The Crown has signed a deed of settlement for all outstanding historical Treaty claims with Ngāti Koroki Kahukura at Maungatautari marae near Cambridge, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson announced today.

“The actions of the Crown led to the economic, social, environmental and cultural degradation of Ngāti Koroki Kahukura and their physical and spiritual resources,” Mr Finlayson said.

The settlement includes financial and commercial redress of $3 million.

It also vests the Crown-owned Maungatautari scenic reserve in te hāpori o Maungatautari / the Maungatautari Community.

“Maungatautari is a sacred place to Ngāti Koroki Kahukura,” Mr Finlayson said. “This settlement recognises the aspirations of iwi as well as the importance of the maunga to the wider community. It also ensures that all New Zealanders can continue to use and enjoy the reserve as they do today.”

Waipa District Council will continue to administer the reserve and there will be no impact on the Maungatautari Ecological Island conservation project.

“Initialling a deed of settlement with Ngāti Koroki Kahukura is an important step towards settling all historical grievances in the Waikato region and New Zealand as a whole,” Mr Finlayson said.

This is the tenth deed of settlement signed by the Crown and iwi this year. The settlement will be given effect through legislation.
