State Services and Defence Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman has welcomed the release of two reviews in relation to the 2010 ANZAC Day helicopter crash.

The State Services Commission has released an independent review on the Air Force’s implementation of the Court of Inquiry safety recommendations, and also a review of the roles and functions for health and safety in employment in the military context.   

“The ANZAC Day helicopter crash was a tragedy with the loss of three lives. The RNZAF is taking every step it can take to ensure it never happens again.  As Minister of Defence my oversight role is to ensure the extensive safety recommendations laid out by the Court of Inquiry are adopted and that any other steps necessary are taken,” said Dr Coleman.

“I am pleased the first review has endorsed the significant progress the Air Force has made in adopting the safety recommendations.  It has found that 85% (23 out of 27) of the major recommendations and 98% (50 out of 51) of additional recommendations are complete. The outstanding recommendations will all be implemented by June 2013,” said Dr Coleman.

“The review has also recommended strengthening the governance role of the Air Force Leadership Board to help ensure operational safety management. Defence accepts this advice and is currently examining next steps in putting those measures in place,” he said.

The second review has addressed issues around the jurisdiction of government agencies to investigate the roles and functions for health and safety in employment in the military context.

Its main recommendation is for a dedicated capability within MBIE to focus on these issues. 

Acting Labour Minister Chris Finlayson has received a copy of the report for his consideration.

“I welcome the clarification of the roles and responsibilities of MBIE with regard to military aircraft incidents. We will further assess the full report carefully before it is considered by Cabinet,” said Mr Finlayson.
