Civil Defence Minister Chris Tremain says an interagency Corrective Action Plan released today will improve the strength of Civil Defence in New Zealand.

“An independent review of the response to the Christchurch earthquake on February 22 found overall that emergency services worked well. However a number of recommendations were made on how the process could be improved,” says Mr Tremain.

The Plan involves the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management, State Services Commission, Police, Fire Service, Defence Force and the Ministries of Social Development, Health, Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Business Innovation and Employment.

“The Corrective Action Plan is based around 10 themes, with coordinating agencies responsible for each theme and MCDEM coordinating the overall plan,” says Mr Tremain.

“While many of the actions are relatively straightforward some will involve work programmes which could take up to two years to complete. The Ministry will be reporting back to Cabinet in December 2013 on progress towards completing the Action Plan.”

The Corrective Action Plan and the independent review are available from the Ministry’s website.
