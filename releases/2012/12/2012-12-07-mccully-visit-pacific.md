Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will tomorrow travel to the Pacific for meetings in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Kiribati and Tuvalu.

"The Marshall Islands will host the Pacific Islands Forum in 2013 and we are keen to support them given our recent experience hosting and chairing the Forum,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand makes a significant investment in the on-going sustainable economic development of Kiribati and Tuvalu. In both counties I will be able to see first-hand the difference our aid dollars are making.”

Mr McCully will also pay respects at the New Zealand Coastwatchers memorial in Kiribati. It is 70 years since 17 New Zealand Coastwatchers were executed there during World War Two.
