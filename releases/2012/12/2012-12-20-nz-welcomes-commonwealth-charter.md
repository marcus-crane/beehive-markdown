Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today welcomed the adoption of a Commonwealth Charter - a document that sets out the history, objectives, values, and principles of the Commonwealth.

“New Zealand is an active member of the Commonwealth and a strong supporter of the values which bind the 54 member states,” Mr McCully says.

“Aside from our British heritage, Commonwealth countries share a commitment to democracy, the rule of law and human rights.

“The development of a charter that reflects these values is part of a wider reform process, aimed at ensuring the Commonwealth remains relevant and well-placed to meet the aspirations of its citizens.

“Importantly, the Charter also affirms the role of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group in responding to all instances of serious or persistent violations of Commonwealth values.

“We will continue to work with our fellow member states and the Commonwealth Secretariat to ensure the organisation delivers on its objectives and makes a positive contribution to international affairs,” Mr McCully says.
