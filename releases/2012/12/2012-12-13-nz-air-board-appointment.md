Kim Wicksteed’s current directorships include Learning Media, Equinox IT and Frizzell Wines. He is an accredited member of the Institute of Directors.

“Mr Wicksteed’s background in the media sector and his experience on a variety of boards will provide a strong contribution to NZ On Air,” said Mr Foss.
