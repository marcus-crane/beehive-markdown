The signing of the Wellington Harbour Islands (WHI) Management Plan sets the future vision and management of Wellington’s three harbour islands, Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson says.

Ms Wilkinson and Port Nicolson Block Settlement Trust Chair Hon Mahara Okeroa signed the plan at a ceremony in the Beehive this morning.

The Trust manages the Treaty settlement package from the Port Nicholson Block Settlement (PNBST) Act 2009 for Taranaki Whānui ki Te Upoko o Te Ika - the collective name of the four Wellington based iwi.

The WHI Plan was drafted by the Wellington Harbour Islands Kaitiaki Board with input from iwi and the Department of Conservation. It sets out a governance framework for vision, management and sustainability outcomes for Matiu/Somes, Makaro/Ward and Mokopuna Islands.

All three islands continue to be jointly managed by DOC and iwi. Public access to them is unchanged.

“The settlement will further progress the positive and productive partnership DOC has with the Wellington iwi,” Ms Wilkinson says.

“Everyone has a part to play in the care of our special places. With Tangata whenua as owners and kaitiaki of this land, working together with staff from DOC and the community, these islands have a positive future.”
