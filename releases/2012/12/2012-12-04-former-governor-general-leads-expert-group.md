Social Development Minister Paula Bennett is delighted to announce that former Governor General the Rt Hon Sir Anand Satyanand will lead the Expert Advisory Group on Information Security.

The Group will oversee implementation of the Vulnerable Kids Information System (ViKi) and new Risk Predictor Tool which have the capacity to better protect children from abuse and neglect.

“Information security is a critical aspect of these new systems and so I have asked some of the best experts in New Zealand to ensure they are secure and easy for frontline professionals to use,” says Mrs Bennett.

“These robust information systems will help professionals put all the pieces of the puzzle together so children don’t fall through the gaps,” she says.

As an experienced lawyer, judge and ombudsman, Sir Anand has the skills and expertise to lead the Expert Advisory Group.

Three other permanent members appointed to the group are Carl Davidson (Chief Families Commissioner), Dr Murray Milner (Chair of National Health IT Board) and Rob Laking (Senior Associate at the Institute of Governance and Policy Studies at Victoria University).

“These members bring a wealth of experience in knowledge management, risk management, governance, communications technology and research on families and whanau,” says Mrs Bennett.

“The Privacy Commissioner will also work with the Expert Advisory Group throughout the development of Vulnerable Kids Information System and the implementation of the Risk Predictor Tool,” she says.

The Vulnerable Children’s Board, which has responsibility for implementing the White Paper package of initiatives, is finalising the terms of reference and membership of the Group.
