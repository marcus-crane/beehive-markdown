Patients who need to travel outside their region for specialist health services or frequently to appointments are receiving more support than ever before.

Health Minister Tony Ryall said this government is committed to improving access to health services for New Zealanders.

“Last financial year, $38 million in travel and accommodation assistance was provided to over 33,000 patients – 40 per cent more funding than in 2008.

“The National Travel Assistance policy makes a real difference to patients by reducing their expenses during an already challenging time.

“Someone living in a rural area that has to travel frequently for cancer treatment or parents of a very ill baby in a neonatal intensive care unit may receive financial support under this scheme.”

In 2009, the National led Government increased the mileage allowance and accommodation rate – the first increase in over 20 years.
