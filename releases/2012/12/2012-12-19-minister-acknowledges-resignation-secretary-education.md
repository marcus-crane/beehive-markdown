Education Minister Hekia Parata today acknowledged the resignation of Secretary for Education Lesley Longstone, and thanked her for her efforts leading the Ministry.

Ms Longstone’s resignation was announced this afternoon by State Services Commissioner Iain Rennie.

“I acknowledge Ms Longstone’s efforts during her time at the Ministry,” Ms Parata said.

“It has been a difficult period and there have been a series of tough issues to deal with.

“Our Government is working hard to ensure that all our children get a better education. I continue to be focused on raising achievement in our schools so that our kids have the opportunities they need to reach their potential.

“I will be making no further comment on the departure of Ms Longstone.

“I wish her well for the future.”
