Specially trained pharmacists will soon be able to prescribe medication, making access to medication easier for some patients, Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne announced today.

In line with moves already successfully made in Britain, the United States and Canada, clinical pharmacists will be able to undergo special training and competency assessments to register in a new advanced scope of practice developed by the Pharmacy Council with the support of Health Workforce New Zealand.

The trained pharmacist will work in a collaborative healthcare environment and be able to prescribe medication to patients under the care of their team.

The pharmacist will work with a designated medical practitioner who will act as a mentor, providing supervision and advice, and who will continue to be responsible for diagnosis and wider patient management.

Mr Dunne said the change would allow members of multi-disciplinary teams to work to greater effect for the benefit of patients.

“This is a natural extension of the experienced clinical pharmacist’s role, making the best use of their training and knowledge of medicines and how to  manage them ,” he said.

“But this is also about ease of access to services for patients. The positioning of this role, as a key member of the health team, means patients get access to all the care they need, faster, and in one place.”

A first group of 14 pharmacists is currently undertaking the new postgraduate certificate in pharmacist prescribing, which builds on the postgraduate diploma in clinical pharmacy.

Half of the trainees currently work in hospitals and the other half in primary care. They are expected to complete their training early next year.

Cabinet has now approved the drafting of regulations under the Medicines Act 1981 and Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 to enable those who have completed the training to become designated prescribers.

Establishment of the qualification follows a demonstration project funded by Health Workforce New Zealand and run jointly by the pharmacy schools at the Universities of Auckland and Otago. Feedback from consultation with the sector showed widespread support.
