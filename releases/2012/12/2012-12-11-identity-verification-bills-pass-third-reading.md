Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain says identity legislation which passed its final reading today will enable New Zealanders to prove their identity quickly and securely when dealing with government agencies and businesses.

“The Electronic Identity Verification Bill passed its third reading tonight. This will enable more widespread use of the *igovt* service, which enables people to log into numerous websites using a single password, and prove their identity via a website rather than using paper documents.

“This service already exists in limited form, with more than 680,000 *igovt* logons issued. Some government agencies are already making good use of the service, including Studylink’s 322,186 transactions using *igovt* in November alone.

“The Department of Internal Affairs is partnering with New Zealand Post to commercialise and expand the use of the *igovt* technology, which will be known as RealMe. This is an exciting development in making government services available online and will contribute to better public services.  

“The Identity Information Confirmation Bill has also passed its third reading. This enables information such as names and birth dates to be checked, with the individual’s consent, against records held by the Department of Internal Affairs.  This will enable businesses and government agencies to confirm that information is correct, giving them confidence against identity fraud.

“These Bills will enable the widespread use of both services across government departments and increasingly across the private sector, and I am pleased to have seen them pass with broad support from the House.”
