Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today expressed serious concerns about North Korea’s plans to launch a satellite this month using a long-range ballistic missile.

“This latest announcement from North Korea is extremely disappointing and potentially destabilising. New Zealand considers the use of ballistic missile technology to conduct the proposed launch to be inconsistent with UN Security Council resolutions," Mr McCully says.

"To conduct a launch will be highly detrimental to the re-engagement of North Korea with the international community.

"The government strongly urges North Korea to abandon its launch plan, work constructively with its neighbours and the international community, and stop its nuclear weapons programme."
