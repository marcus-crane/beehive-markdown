Prime Minister John Key says he was delighted to hear the news that Their Royal Highnesses, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, are expecting a baby.

“This is fabulous news for Prince William and Catherine, and I know the Queen and Prince Phillip will be extremely pleased.

“It is an important day in any young couple’s life when a baby is expected and I know that Catherine and William will be as nervous and excited as anyone.

“We wish them both the very best and hope Catherine’s stay in hospital is a short one.

“On behalf of the people of New Zealand, I congratulate them both.”
