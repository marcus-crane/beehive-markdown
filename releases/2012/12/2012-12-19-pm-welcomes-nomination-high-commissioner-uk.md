Prime Minister John Key today welcomed the nomination of Dr the Rt Hon Lockwood Smith as New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to the United Kingdom.

“Lockwood Smith has had a distinguished political career and his nomination is a mark of the high esteem in which he is held.

“Since 2008 he has held the role of Speaker of the House of Representatives, and was unanimously re-elected in 2011.

“The nomination of Parliament’s Speaker to the role of High Commissioner emphasises the importance of relationship between New Zealand and the United Kingdom,” says Mr Key.

Lockwood Smith has served as a Member of Parliament since 1984, when he was elected MP for Kaipara. In 1996, he became MP for Rodney, a role he held until 2011 when he went on the National Party List.

He has held a number of positions in National-led Governments, including Minister of Education, Agriculture, Trade and Deputy Finance Minister.

“I wish Lockwood and his wife, Alexandra, all the best for this new appointment,” says Mr Key.
