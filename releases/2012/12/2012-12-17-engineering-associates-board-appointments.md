Ms Cranko is the director of Cranko Architects and specialises in commercial, educational residential projects.

Mr McArthur is a senior manager at Downer New Zealand, and is responsible for the development and maintenance of the company’s graduate, cadet and apprenticeship programmes.

Mr Cowley is an experienced refrigeration engineer. He recently retired as Managing Director and CEO of Cowley Refrigeration Ltd.

“Deborah Cranko, Ross McArthur and Glynn Cowley bring a wealth of skills and experience to the Board,” Mr Williamson says.
