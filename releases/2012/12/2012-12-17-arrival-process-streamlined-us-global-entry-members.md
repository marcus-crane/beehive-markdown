Customs Minister Maurice Williamson announced today that New Zealand Customs has opened a dedicated lane for United States Global Entry programme members at Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch airports.

The lane will streamline and speed up the arrival process for Global Entry members entering New Zealand on a United States passport.

“This initiative is a result of an agreement between New Zealand and the United States to investigate ways of improving the border experience for travellers. Working with other countries to secure and make trade and travel easy is a priority for the New Zealand Government,” Mr Williamson says.

Global Entry members are subject to standard customs, immigration and biosecurity processes.

The Global Entry programme is managed by US Customs and Border Protection. It allows the expedited clearance of pre-approved, low-risk travellers arriving in the United States.
