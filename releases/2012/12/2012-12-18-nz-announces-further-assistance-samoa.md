Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced further assistance to Samoa in the aftermath of Cyclone Evan.

“New Zealand will be making an additional $550,000 immediately available to support relief and early recovery efforts in Samoa, taking our support so far to $600,000,” Mr McCully says.

Funding will be available to respond to official requests, to New Zealand non-government organisations and their partners on the ground, and the Samoa Red Cross.

Five additional New Zealand Red Cross workers will travel to Samoa to support local Red Cross efforts.

A P3 Orion is continuing to assist the Samoan Government with search and rescue and aerial surveillance activities.

“New Zealand will also consider further requests for assistance from Samoa as they undertake the longer-term reconstruction effort. Samoa faces a major recovery effort and they will not face it alone,” Mr McCully says.
