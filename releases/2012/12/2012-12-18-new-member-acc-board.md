ACC Minister Judith Collins today announced changes to the ACC Board with the appointment of a new member, James Miller, and the resignation of a current member, Jane Huria.

“I am extremely pleased to announce the appointment of James Miller.

“Mr Miller’s background is in finance and investment and he has extensive experience as a board director in both the private and public sectors, including the Financial Markets Authority.

“Mr Miller will play an important role in supporting the commercial and investment functions of ACC and I am delighted he has agreed to join the Board,” Ms Collins said.

Mr Miller takes up his role from 1 March 2013.

“I would also like to thank Ms Huria for her contribution to the ACC Board since her term began in 2009,” Ms Collins said.

The vacancy created by Ms Huria’s resignation will be filled early next year.

“ACC’s Board is tasked with delivering on the Government’s priorities for ACC to rebalance its strategic objectives and lead a commitment to genuine culture change.

“I am confident we now have the right mix of skills in place to lead ACC as it embarks on a new era of service for all New Zealanders,” Ms Collins said.
