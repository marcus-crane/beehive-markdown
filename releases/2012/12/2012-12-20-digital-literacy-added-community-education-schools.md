Digital literacy will be included as an educational priority area within the $13.8 million funding for Adult and Community Education in schools next year Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce announced today.

Its inclusion within the scope of Adult and Community Education in schools expands the potential for digital literacy within foundation education in New Zealand.

“Digital literacy is an important skill for both education and employment. Enabling digital literacy as a part of Adult and Community Education provisions in schools will help New Zealanders gain the skills to succeed in the modern economy,” Mr Joyce says.

“Previously, digital literacy has been taught by small community providers and rural education activity providers. 23 Schools throughout the country are funded for Adult and Community Education and can now offer digital literacy skills to their communities.”

Since Budget 2009, a priority within Adult and Community Education has been targeting learners whose initial learning was not successful, raising foundation skills. The addition of digital literacy to this list of priorities gives schools greater opportunity to meet the needs of those learners.

”Digital literacy is becoming increasingly recognised as an essential foundation skill worldwide. Australia has recently included digital literacy within its National Foundation Skills Strategy for Adults. We need to ensure that no New Zealanders miss out either,” Mr Joyce says.
