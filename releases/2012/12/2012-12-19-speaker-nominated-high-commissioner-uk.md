Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced the nomination of Dr the Rt Hon Lockwood Smith as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom.

Mr McCully describes New Zealand’s relationship with the UK as “one of our most important”.

“While we have strong historical connections, the relationship with the UK today remains one of our closest. It is appropriate that the appointment of our High Commissioner should reflect this.

“The nomination of Parliament’s Speaker to the UK role underlines its significance.

“Lockwood Smith is one of the longest serving members of the House. His experience in international marketing and in senior portfolios including Education and Trade make him an ideal diplomatic appointment,” Mr McCully says.

The High Commission also conducts the government’s business with Ireland and Nigeria. It is New Zealand’s official contact with the Commonwealth Secretariat and the Commonwealth Foundation, as well as a range of international organisations with headquarters in London.

Dr Smith is expected to take up the appointment in early 2013.
