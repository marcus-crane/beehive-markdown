The Government is actively pursuing a wide range of initiatives that provide the certainty and support the Small Business Advisory Group is calling for, Minister for Small Business John Banks said today.

Mr Banks has released the Government’s response to the Small Business Advisory Group’s 2012 report, addressing the eight recommendations the Group believed would make a difference to small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

“The Small Business Advisory Group called for clarity, continuity and easier access to government support for small businesses.  SMEs are the lifeblood of New Zealand’s economy, and I am glad to report that government is creating the right economic and regulatory environment that allows them to prosper,” Mr Banks said.

The government’s response acknowledges the challenges small businesses face, particularly the global economic situation and the Canterbury earthquakes.

 

“To support business through these challenging times the Government is focused on creating a more favourable business environment. The Business Growth Agenda sets out initiatives to achieve a more productive and competitive economy.”

 “The Better Public Services for Business programme will also support SMEs by improving government’s interaction with businesses, and developing one-stop online access to all government advice and support for business.

“Other initiatives aimed at SMEs include support for rebuilding Christchurch and the Regulatory Review Programme, which ensures that regulation is fit for purpose and minimises compliance costs,” Mr Banks said.

Responding to specific recommendations from the Small Business Advisory Group, Mr Banks said a business case is being developed for a single business identifier.  The business-focused website, www.business.govt.nz, has also been refreshed to provide more useful information and links to transactional areas of agencies’ websites.

“The Regional Business Partner Network is helping to increase the number of firms that access information and development services. Agencies are also consulting with small businesses when reviewing regulations.”

“I thank the outgoing members of the Small Business Advisory Group for their contribution over the last three years. I am confident that the newly appointed and renamed Small Business Development Group will build on its work and identify other barriers holding SMEs back,” Mr Banks said.
