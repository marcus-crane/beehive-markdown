Garry Denley of Auckland and John Gaukrodger of Hamilton have been reappointed and Nola Dangen of Auckland has been appointed as members of the Real Estate Agents Disciplinary Tribunal, Justice Minister Judith Collins announced today.

The Tribunal was established under the Real Estate Agents Act 2008 and hears charges, applications and appeals relating to the conduct of real estate agents.

Garry Denley is a manager of a North Shore real estate company and has been heavily involved with the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand for many years. He was first appointed to the Tribunal in 2009 and has been reappointed for 18 months.

John Gaukrodger comes from an accounting background and has previous experience of disciplinary processes through his involvement with the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants. He was also appointed in 2009 and has been reappointed for three years.

Nola Dangen is a lawyer who has represented major building and land development companies. She has extensive disciplinary and regulatory experience through Auckland District Law Society and New Zealand Law Society. Her appointment is for three years.

“I'm confident these appointments will maintain a high level of expertise within the Tribunal and provide a balance of experience in law, commerce and the real estate industry,” Ms Collins said.
