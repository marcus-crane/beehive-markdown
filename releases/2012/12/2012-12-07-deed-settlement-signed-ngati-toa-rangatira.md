The Crown signed a deed of settlement for all outstanding historical Treaty claims with Ngati Toa Rangatira at Parliament Buildings in Wellington today, Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson announced.

“Today’s settlement highlights the importance of putting the injustices of the past behind us,” Mr Finlayson said. “The actions of the Crown, that included political and military action against the senior Ngati Toa chiefs, ultimately left Ngati Toa virtually landless and without resources in both the North and South Islands. We can never fully compensate for the wrongs of the past but this settlement enables Ngati Toa to build a stronger future.”

Ngati Toa Rangatira will receive financial redress of $70.6 million, including opportunities to purchase and lease back Crown properties and a right of first refusal over surplus Crown properties.

The Crown will introduce standalone legislation providing Ngāti Toa Rangatira with a right of attribution for the Ka Mate haka. The legislation will require the composer of the haka, Ngāti Toa Rangatira chief Te Rauparaha, to be attributed in certain circumstances.

A key part of the settlement is a multi-faceted redress package over Kapiti Island, reflecting its significance to the iwi. This includes a vesting and gift back over part of the island, the vesting of a total of 189 hectares, provision for an overlay classification over the reserves, establishment of a strategic advisory committee and a conservation management plan.

The Department of Conservation will remain responsible for the management of Kapiti Island and public access will continue to be restricted to protect the high conservation values.

“The government is committed to resolving all historical grievances of the past so all New Zealanders can move forward together.”
