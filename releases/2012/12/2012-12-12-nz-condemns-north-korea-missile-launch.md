Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today condemned North Korea’s launch of a satellite using long-range ballistic missile technology.

“Once again North Korea has blatantly defied United Nations Security Council resolutions and ignored international appeals not to proceed with the launch.  This action can only aggravate tensions on the Korean peninsula and set back efforts to build peace and stability in the region,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand urges North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons and missile programmes, focus its resources on improving the lives of its people, and engage constructively with the international community.”

In April this year, North Korea’s failed attempt to launch a satellite with a long-range missile was met with widespread condemnation, including from New Zealand.
