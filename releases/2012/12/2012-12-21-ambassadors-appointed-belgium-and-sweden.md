Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced changes to New Zealand’s representation in Europe following the closure of the embassy in Sweden.

Paula Wilson, recently appointed Deputy Head of Mission at the New Zealand Mission in Brussels, will become Ambassador to Belgium.

Brussels Head of Mission and Ambassador to the EU, Vangelis Vitalis, will also take responsibility as the accredited Ambassador to Sweden. 

Ms Wilson has served in Berlin and Canberra and in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s Europe and Trade Negotiations divisions.

Mr Vitalis has extensive trade negotiations experience, including with ASEAN and the Russia/Belarus/Kazakhstan Customs Union. 

Mr McCully says he is confident two new diplomatic arrangements in Europe will serve New Zealand’s interests well.
