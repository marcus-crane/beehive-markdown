Justice Minister Judith Collins today turned the first sod at the Manukau District Court construction site marking the start of the $40.6 million redevelopment project.

The redevelopment will include a new four story extension as well as extensive alterations and a complete refurbishment of the existing court building. When complete, the redevelopment will provide four new jury trial courtrooms with provision for further expansion.

Ms Collins says the redevelopment forms a key part in the Government’s plan to create accessible, modern courts that are fit-for-purpose now and into the future.

“This is one of the largest single investments the District Court network has seen in some years. One-third of the demand for court services nationally is from within the greater Auckland area as the population increases.

“While crime is falling and has reduced significantly in the Manukau area, the redevelopment will ensure we have the right infrastructure in place to cope with growing demand for all court services both in Manukau and across the region over the next twenty years.

“We’re investing in the new facility to improve safety and security for court users and staff, and ensure the Court can provide the full range of services people expect.

“The redevelopment is a key part of improving how we deliver services in Auckland, alongside changes to how family and civil cases are managed, centralised calling and other projects to deal with the workloads and the increasing population in the region,” Ms Collins says.

Construction work will proceed in stages and will be carefully managed to minimise disruption to court users during this time. Construction is expected to be complete by November 2014.
