Education Minister Hekia Parata has welcomed the decision by PPTA members to ratify a new secondary teachers’ collective agreement (STCA).

“I want to thank secondary school teachers for the great work they do and congratulate the advocates from the PPTA and the Ministry of Education for reaching this very successful outcome,’’ says Ms Parata.

“This is a very good settlement for secondary school teachers and the Government.’’

The settlement is for a 1.1% increase to the cost of teacher base salaries at the start of 2013, an increase of 1% at the start of 2014, and a further 0.5% at the start of 2015. The collective agreement will expire in mid-2015.

“Resolving this quickly helps us to focus on how we can raise achievement for all children and get more secondary students through NCEA 2 to give them better chances in life.’’
