Education Minister Hekia Parata has today welcomed the formation of a combined Board of Trustees for Kelston Deaf Education Centre and van Asch Deaf Education Centre.

“Today’s celebration marks a significant step towards providing a nationally consistent service for learners who are deaf or hearing impaired.

“The van Asch and Kelston Boards have each provided strong leadership in the past. The formation of the new Board will combine those strengths and provide unified leadership for the two Deaf Education Centres.

“I’d like to acknowledge the passion and dedication of the past Board chairs and trustees and thank outgoing Board members. They have worked hard as separate Boards to achieve the combined Board we are celebrating today.  This has required high levels of integrity and flexibility from both Boards. It is to their great credit that they have kept a clear focus on what will be best for the learners they provide for.

“In particular, I would like to acknowledge the service of Dyanne Bensley, who has been the chairperson of the van Asch Deaf Education Centre Board of Trustees since 1995.

“I would also like to thank the two principals, David Foster and Bernie Mulcahy-Bouwman, who have worked tirelessly to ensure their school communities have been fully involved in the process to combine the two Boards.  Their leadership, too, has been vital in launching a new era in education for the deaf and hearing impaired under a combined Board of Trustees.

“Congratulations to the newly elected trustees. I know you will add to the strong governance tradition left by past Boards of Van Asch and Kelston.”
