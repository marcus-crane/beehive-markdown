Accessing health information in your region is now easier following the launch of new health web tool, *My DHB*, says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“Public reporting on the performance of our health services is a key focus of this Government.

“New Zealanders can now access, in one place, health information specific to their district health board (DHB) region. This includes rest home audits, health funding and health target results.

“*My DHB* also includes information and contact details for general practices, dentists, midwives and other professionals in each region.

“Most of this information has previously been available however it has been on a number of different websites and hasn’t always been that easy to find.

“This new web tool pulls all the information together in one place so it is much easier for the public to find to enable them to make more informed choices about their healthcare.”
