Housing Minister Phil Heatley and Auckland Mayor Len Brown today announced the appointment of a seven-member Board with a strong mix of community, urban development and business skills to lead the Tāmaki Redevelopment Company.

The Tāmaki Redevelopment Company is New Zealand’s first urban redevelopment company and aims to transform Tāmaki (including Glen Innes, Point England and Panmure) in Auckland over the next 20-25 years through co-ordinated economic, social, and housing initiatives.

“I’m delighted to have a Board with this level of talent and experience to lead the Tāmaki urban development programme through its first years,” Mr Heatley said.

“The group has members with strong contacts within the Tāmaki community and iwi, people with superb business skills and with deep knowledge of urban development.  I believe they will make a significant contribution in helping transform Tāmaki into a thriving, prosperous and self-reliant community.”

Mayor Len Brown welcomed the appointment of the Board and said it marked a significant point for the Tāmaki community.

“I know that the people of the Tāmaki community, who have worked so hard and so long to develop a transformation vision for their community, are keen to see it under way,” he said.

“With the appointment of the Board, the management in place and the office established, the stage is set for the company to start its work as part of the Tāmaki community.”

The vision for Tāmaki is made up of four key components: a social component to support Tāmaki residents to get the skills, knowledge and employment opportunities they need and an economic component to strengthen the local economy, creating new jobs and business opportunities.

A housing component will optimise land use and existing housing stock, including progressing private housing development and delivering better social housing options in Tāmaki, and a spatial component will create safe and connected neighbourhoods and spaces that support the social and economic development of Tāmaki and its community. 

The Tāmaki Redevelopment Company will lead the transformation and undertake some projects itself, procure delivery of other projects, and influence the direction of yet others.
