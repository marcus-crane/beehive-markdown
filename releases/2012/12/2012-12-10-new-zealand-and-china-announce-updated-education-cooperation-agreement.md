An agreement, which will increase education cooperation between New Zealand and China, has been signed in Wellington today.

Education Minister Hekia Parata says the agreement will enhance business opportunities for New Zealand’s university, polytechnic and skills sectors.

“China is the largest source of international students in New Zealand and likely to remain so. 

“State Councillor Liu Yandong’s visit will help support New Zealand’s crucial education industry links with China. It also furthers our interest in greater collaboration in education services.

“The agreement provides a foundation for officials’ work in this important economic, social and political area of the relationship.”

State Councillor Liu is in New Zealand from 9-11 December, ahead of the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between New Zealand and China on 22 December.
