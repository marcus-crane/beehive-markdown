Health Minister Tony Ryall says general practices, supported by Primary Health Organisations (PHOs), are making good progress in the three national preventive health targets.

Over the past year general practices have:

- Immunised 58,000 children from vaccine preventable diseases, like whooping cough, measles and mumps
- Offered quit support to 191,000 smokers
- Performed 134,000 cardiovascular disease risk assessments.

“The 2012/13 quarter one Primary Care Health Target results, released today, show general practices continue to make gains in the preventive targets and improve the health of New Zealanders,” said Mr Ryall.

“The number of smokers offered support to quit has increased by 5 per cent. A number of PHOs have made significant improvements in the past quarter. Health Rotorua Limited, for example, has improved by 13 per cent.

“Over three quarters of the PHOs have achieved the new immunisation step target of having 85 per cent of eight months old vaccinated on time by July 2013. General practices and PHOs in Canterbury have done particularly well considering the pressures facing the community there.

“29 PHOs improved their performance this quarter in the more heart and diabetes checks target.”

PHOs are funded by district health boards to provide health care services through general practices to patients who are registered with them.
