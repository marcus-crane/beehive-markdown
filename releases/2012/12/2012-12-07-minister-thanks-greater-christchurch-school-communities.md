Education Minister Hekia Parata has thanked all the school communities in greater Christchurch who have provided submissions on the Government’s Education Renewal Plans.

The Ministry of Education has received submissions from all 31 schools proposed for merger and closure, plus two from Aranui cluster schools, who had been given until 7 March to return their submissions

“I would like to thank all the school communities for participating in the consultation process over the last two and a half months and preparing their submissions.

“I visited 36 of the schools affected by the proposals and it was very apparent during those visits that each community has the best interests of its children at heart. I would again like to thank the parents, members of the teaching profession, students, and wider school community members who took the time to meet with me.

“I can assure everyone that I will be personally reading every submission and giving full consideration to each community’s view before making my decisions.

“Today marks a significant step forward in the renewal of education in greater Christchurch.

“Our Government has committed $1 billion to rebuilding the education sector in greater Christchurch over the next 10 years.  It’s not simply about putting back what was there, but focusing on what can be done better. We have an opportunity to create modern 21st century learning environments that support the best outcomes for children.

“I very much look forward to reading each submission, and school boards can expect to learn of my decisions in February.”
