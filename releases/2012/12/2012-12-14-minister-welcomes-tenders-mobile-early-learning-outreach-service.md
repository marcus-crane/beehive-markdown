Tenders are now open for the Pacific Early Learning Mobile Outreach Service says Pacific Island Affairs Minister Hekia Parata.

“The Ministries of Pacific Island Affairs and Education have worked together to establish a Pacific Mobile Early Childhood Education (ECE) service which will promote the value of ECE to Pacific parents in targeted areas and at community events,” says Ms Parata.

“This is one of the innovative measures the Ministries have developed to increase Pacific ECE participation rates in the Auckland area.

Currently, 86.2 per cent of Pacific children attend an ECE service. The Government wants to raise participation to 98 per cent in 2016. The Pacific Early Learning Mobile Outreach Service aims to assist in the enrolment of non-participating Pacific children into ECE each year.

“We know that quality ECE gives our children the best start in education but too many Pacific children are missing out. The Pacific Early Learning Mobile Outreach Service will give parents a taste of an ECE service and encourage more children and their families to participate,” Ms Parata says.

For more information or if you are interested in submitting a proposal, visit the Government Electronic Tenders Service website at: [www.gets.govt.nz](http://www.gets.govt.nz) .

The deadline for submitting a tender is 12pm, Wednesday 9 January 2013.
