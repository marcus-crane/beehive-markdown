Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced New Zealand will assist with immediate relief efforts in Fiji following Cyclone Evan.

“Our thoughts are with the people of Fiji as they respond to Tropical Cyclone Evan,” Mr McCully says.

“As a first step, New Zealand will make $50,000 immediately available to respond to specific requests from Fiji. Tarpaulins, water containers, generators and chainsaw packs are also on the way to Fiji on commercial flights.

“A contribution of $170,000 to the Fiji Red Cross will help to replenish supplies and ensure it is well positioned to respond to those in immediate need.

“We are also looking at further funding for New Zealand-based non-government organisations that have supplies pre-positioned in Fiji. It seems clear further help will be required and we expect to provide more funding once damage assessments are complete.”

Early reports suggest damage to housing, on-going power outages and flooding across low-lying and river areas. More details will become available as the Fiji authorities make assessments today.

New Zealanders in Fiji are advised to follow instructions issued by local authorities (including any evacuation orders) and keep family in New Zealand informed of their well-being. If consular advice or assistance is required, they should contact the New Zealand High Commission in Suva.
