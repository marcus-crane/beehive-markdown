This year’s Rutherford Foundation Trust Awards and James Cook Research Fellowships recipients have been announced today by Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce.

The two grant schemes have combined Government funding of more than $1.7 million and are aimed at developing the skills of New Zealand scientists.

“The prestigious Rutherford Foundation Trust scholarships have been awarded to nine of our most outstanding young researchers this year - five post-doctoral fellows who will be working in New Zealand and four PhD students who will be going to study at Cambridge, Oxford and the University of Michigan,” Mr Joyce says.

“The James Cook Research Fellowships are aimed at supporting more experienced scientists who are at the forefront of their fields. Previous fellows have become leaders of science and innovation in New Zealand and I am sure the four fellows this year will also make very valuable contributions”

These men and women are researchers of the highest quality and are working on projects that are of real benefit to New Zealand – from the treatment of osteoporosis, heart problems caused by diabetes, to the future of our resource management,” Mr Joyce says.

“Together, these two schemes grow people with knowledge, skills and ideas and ensure the future of quality science in New Zealand.”

The Rutherford Foundation was established by the Royal Society of New Zealand in 2008. It is supported by $1m from the Government each year along with contributions from the Cambridge Commonwealth Trust, the Freemasons Roskill Foundation and private donations.

The James Cook Research Fellowship was established in 1995, and receives full funding from the Government of $720,000 per year.
