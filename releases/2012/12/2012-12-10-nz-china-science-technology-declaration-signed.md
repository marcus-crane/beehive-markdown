A New Zealand-China joint declaration, which will boost science and technology links and co-operation between the two countries, has been signed in Wellington today.

The joint declaration, focussing on enhancing and supporting science and technology research co-operation, was signed by Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce and Chinese Deputy-Minister of Science and Technology Wang Zhigang.

The signing was witnessed by visiting State Councillor Liu Yandong.

“New Zealand and China have strong links in science and technology and this declaration help to grow this relationship,” Mr Joyce says.

The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment of New Zealand and the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People’s Republic of China have also agreed to increase funding over the next 5 years (2012-2016) to enhance and support bilateral science and technology co-operation, totalling $10 million (CNY 50 million).

“China is our second largest trading partner and the bilateral trade and economic relationship we share is very important. Trade between our countries has increased by 50 per cent since the New Zealand-China Free Trade Agreement was signed in 2008 – we want this growth to continue,” says Mr Joyce.

State Councillor Liu is a senior leader in China’s 2012 – 2017 hierarchy. Her portfolios include education, science, screen and television and culture.
