Associate Social Development Minister Tariana Turia today announced that 63 community projects aimed at preventing bullying will receive grants under the first round of the Te Punanga Haumaru fund.

A panel of young people met over two days to consider the 185 applications received. All panel members had previously taken part in Ministry of Youth Development training on providing input into government decisions that affect them.

“Having young people select the projects to be funded under Te Punanga Haumaru reflects how vital it is to have young people at the centre of this work,” said Minister Turia.

“The fund criteria asked for communities to involve young people and their families in developing their projects. The projects selected for funding all showed evidence of this.”

Another important part of the selection criteria was that projects needed to be community, rather than provider-led and demonstrate a community-wide commitment to addressing bullying.

“It is encouraging that the 63 community initiatives funded under Te Punanga Haumaru are spread around New Zealand from Kaitaia in the North to Aparima in the South.

Supporting these projects is a meaningful first step in ensuring all our tamariki, wherever they grow up, can do so in a safe and nurturing environment supported by positive relationships.”

The fund is on-going with the second round to be held in 2013.
