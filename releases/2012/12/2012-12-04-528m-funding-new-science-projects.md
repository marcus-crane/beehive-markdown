Applications have been invited for $52.8 million of Government research funding in the 2013 science investment round, Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce announced today.

Proposals are invited for science and research that will improve New Zealanders’ health and wellbeing with $52.8 million per annum available for new projects starting next year.

“Science and innovation are major drivers of progress and are key strands of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda. We want to focus our efforts on issues that are important to New Zealand,” Mr Joyce says.

“This investment sits alongside the work we are doing developing the National Science Challenges which are seeking input from New Zealanders on the big science issues we should invest in for our country over the next several years.”

“The investments will both focus on this Government’s desire to see value created from new ideas, as well as ensuring the purpose-driven research we invest in benefits New Zealand.”

The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment is calling for research proposals in the areas of biological industries, high value manufacturing and services, energy and minerals, and health and society.

Researchers have until early April 2013 to submit proposals, which will then be peer reviewed and assessed by independent expert panels. The Ministry’s Science Board will decide on what proposals get funded by August 2013.

Two separate, innovative ‘sandpit’ investment processes will also run early next year specifically for environmental research to address freshwater and terrestrial biodiversity and biosecurity issues.
