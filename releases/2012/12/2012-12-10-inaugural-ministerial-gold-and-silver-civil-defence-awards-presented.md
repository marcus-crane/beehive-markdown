The Minister of Civil Defence, Chris Tremain, has tonight presented the inaugural Ministerial Civil Defence Emergency Management (CDEM) Gold and Silver Awards.

“New Zealand is recognised internationally as having one of the best emergency management systems in the world.  We are often the benchmark for other nations.  As a result of this it is important that we recognise individuals and organisations who achieve this on a daily basis,” says Mr Tremain.

Up to one gold award a year can be presented for outstanding contributions to CDEM and silver awards are presented for significant contributions to CDEM.

“The 2012 Gold CDEM Award, the first ever issued, has been presented to the GNS Science Hazards Group,” says Mr Tremain.

“The award recognises the Hazards Group’s outstanding contribution to the development of CDEM in New Zealand over a lengthy period through research into natural hazards, contribution to risk mitigation measures, development of local plans and readiness measures, and advice to all levels of the response during the Canterbury earthquakes.”

Six Silver CDEM Awards were presented to:

- Dave Brunsdon, Chief Executive of the Kestrel Group, for his commitment to and support to the development of resilience in lifeline utilities and work with urban search and rescue.
- John Forbes, Mayor of Opotiki District, for his advocacy of CDEM in the Bay of Plenty CDEM Group.
- John Hamilton, Director of Civil Defence Emergency Management, for his leadership as National Controller during the response to the 22 February 2011 earthquake.
- New Zealand ShakeOut National Coordinators, Jo Guard and Anita Komen, for their development and implementation of New Zealand ShakeOut in 2012.
- Bob Parker, Mayor of Christchurch City, for his community leadership following the 22 February 2011 earthquake.
- Diane Turner, recent CE of Whakatane District Council and a CDEM Controller for her leadership and advocacy of CDEM preparedness and resilience in the community.
