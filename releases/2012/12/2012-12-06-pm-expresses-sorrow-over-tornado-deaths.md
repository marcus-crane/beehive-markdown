Prime Minister John Key has extended his condolences to the friends and families of the people who died when a tornado struck West Auckland earlier today.

“A thunderstorm and tornado struck West Auckland around 1pm today, tearing down trees, and ripping roofs from houses,” Mr Key says.

“This must have been an extremely frightening situation for many people in the local community.

“I’d like to thank the emergency services staff, who are responding to the situation. It’s critical they are able to focus on the response.

“This extreme weather event occurred in the heart of my electorate as well as Paula Bennett’s electorate. I have been kept informed of the situation throughout the afternoon and am continuing to receive updates,”  Mr Key says.
