Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced New Zealand will provide $500,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross Appeal to help those most in need following Typhoon Bopha in the Philippines.

"More than 400 lives have been confirmed lost during this disaster and a further 383 are missing.  Around 230,000 people are thought to have been affected, with homes, roads, bridges, power and communications infrastructure either damaged or destroyed," Mr McCully says.

"New Zealand’s funding will be made immediately available for essential relief items such as food, clean water and shelter.

"Assessments are on-going and New Zealand will consider additional assistance if needed.”
