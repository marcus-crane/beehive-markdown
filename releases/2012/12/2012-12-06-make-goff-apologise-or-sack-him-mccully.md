Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully is challenging the Labour Leader to make Phil Goff apologise or sack him following yesterday’s failed attack on Auckland lawyer Peter Kiely.

“Yesterday Mr Goff made allegations designed to damage the reputation of a respected citizen. His allegations were factually wrong, yet he has refused to apologise,” Mr McCully says.

“Mr Shearer needs to ask himself whether that is a standard he is prepared to accept.

“By any ordinary standard, Mr Kiely is due an apology. If Mr Shearer fails to act, he is effectively endorsing Mr Goff’s cowardly and reckless behaviour. He needs to require Mr Goff to apologise, or stand him down.”
