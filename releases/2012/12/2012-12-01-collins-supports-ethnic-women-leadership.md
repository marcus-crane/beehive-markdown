Ethnic Affairs Minister Judith Collins has today spoken to women at The Ethnic Women's Leadership Programme in Auckland about the importance of making the most of every opportunity offered to them in New Zealand.

"Our country has an excellent reputation when it comes to women being treated as equals," Ms Collins said.

"New Zealand was the first in the world to give women the right to vote and since then, we've benefited from having women in the highest positions - as prime ministers, governor general, as mayors, judges and CEOs for major private and public sector organisations."

The Ethnic Women's Leadership Programme aims to encourage ethnic women to be more influential in their communities.

The Programme gives training on governance and leadership, women on Boards and offers networking, mentoring and work-life balance workshops to help women support other ethnic women to participate in New Zealand life more effectively.

"Women bring a unique set of skills and qualities to our shores - we are creative thinkings, multi-taskers and excellent problem solvers.

"Harnessing the talent and connections of our ethnic women leaders will help boost New Zealand's productivity and will open opportunities for innovation, fresh thinking and new ways of working.

"I see inspiring women leading the way in their communities and in their professions everyday, and I'm committed to championing successful women whenever I can," Ms Collins said.
