Wellington business risk and assurance expert Aloysius Teh has been appointed to the board of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (Te Papa), and Dr Michael Bassett has been re-appointed for a further one-year term, Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson announced today.

Aloysius Teh leads the public sector risk and assurance practice of Deloitte. As a Chartered Accountant and business adviser, he brings extensive risk management and advisory experience in helping organisations strengthen their business practices, performance and risk management. He is a board member of the Institute of Internal Auditors New Zealand. A very keen art collector, he is also a patron of the Venice Biennale and the City Gallery, Wellington.

Dr Michael Bassett has been a member of the Te Papa board since 2009. He has had extensive experience in education, politics, and as a writer and historian. Before entering Parliament in 1972 as an elected Labour MP, Michael Bassett was a teacher, then senior tutor and lecturer at the University of Auckland.

‘The appointment of Aloysius Teh and the reappointment of Dr Michael Bassett help ensure that the Te Papa board has an appropriate mix of experience and skills,” Mr Finlayson said. “I also acknowledge the excellent contribution made by retiring board member Chris Parkin”.
