Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams has announced that work will start on developing an industry regulation to improve the transparency of broadband product information for consumers.

Ms Adams has asked the Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment to begin work on a regulation framework, which could include, among other things, enhanced disclosure requirements for matters such as the total cost of a service, broadband speed, data caps and contract lengths.

“As the ultra-fast broadband network is rolled out around the country, consumers will need a clear foundation on which to consider and compare broadband offerings,” Ms Adams says.

“It is important that consumers are provided with accurate information about competing product offerings and are able to make informed choices.

“While my initial focus is on residential broadband services, I would anticipate that transparency in other communications services could be included in this work programme in due course.”

Ms Adams welcomed the recent move by the New Zealand Telecommunications Forum to develop its own code of practice.

“However, at this time, I consider there is merit in the Forum’s code of practice occurring in parallel with the development of a proposed regulatory framework.”
