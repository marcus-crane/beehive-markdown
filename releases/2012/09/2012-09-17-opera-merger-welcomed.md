The announcement of a merger between the NBR New Zealand Opera and Southern Opera is an exciting and welcome development, Arts Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson said today.

By bringing Southern Opera into its fold, the NBR New Zealand Opera will now have bases in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. It will ensure the South Island is also well served by an international standard opera company, with its national reach.

“This merger ensures the NBR New Zealand Opera’s place alongside the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and the Royal New Zealand Ballet as a genuine national performing arts institution,” Mr Finlayson said.

“Christchurch benefits from having the national opera company based in its city, and top class performances,” he said. “It will also benefit singers who will have the opportunity to join the NBR New Zealand Opera’s Christchurch chorus.”

“Equally, players in the Christchurch Symphony Orchestra may look forward to accompanying performances. These opportunities will foster talent while making sure Christchurch still sees the best opera on offer.”
