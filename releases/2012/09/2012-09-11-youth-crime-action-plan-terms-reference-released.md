Associate Justice Minister Chester Borrows today released terms of reference for the Youth Crime Action Plan.

The plan is part of the Government’s efforts to reduce offending by, and victimisation of, children and young people.

“The Youth Crime Action Plan will improve support for and coordination between frontline youth justice staff, service providers, families, schools and communities. It will identify what’s working well in the current system – as well as areas where there is room for improvement – and come up with practical solutions that make a real difference in communities and the lives of young people,” says Mr Borrows.

The Action Plan’s terms of reference has six key objectives, including improving efforts to intervene in youth offending earlier, particularly with young Māori, and creating a framework to help whānau and community groups develop innovative local solutions.

Mr Borrows says the Action Plan will draw on information from various initiatives, such as reviews of family group conferences and Youth Offending Teams, evidence about the impact of the first two years of the Fresh Start reforms, the select committee inquiry on child offending and the Green Paper on Vulnerable Children.

Officials are consulting with frontline practitioners, non-government organisations, experts and other interested parties who regularly work with child and youth offenders. In addition, extensive consultation is being held with Māori through a reference group and a series of hui across the country.

“These are the people who are closest to the issues and the people most affected by youth crime. Their input will help ensure the Action Plan is practical and credible,” Mr Borrows says.

The Action Plan will help deliver the Government’s Better Public Services goal of reducing youth crime and the wider goal of reducing offending and victimisation rates. The plan is intended to be released in early 2013.
