Environment Minister Amy Adams has today announced a national scheme to encourage the recycling of unwanted televisions and raise investment in New Zealand’s electronic recycling capacity.

The TV TakeBack programme aims to divert up to 500,000 televisions from going to landfill in an initiative that involves the Government partnering with a range of recyclers and retailers to provide a nationwide network of subsidised options.

The programme will also help educate people about the benefits of recycling and lay the foundation for a more permanent solution for electronic waste.

“As we go digital I am asking New Zealanders to play their part in caring for the environment by making sure their unwanted televisions are recycled,” Ms Adams says.

With Hawke's Bay and the West Coast today becoming the first regions to go digital, they will be the first involved in the programme’s implementation. The programme will then be rolled out around the rest of New Zealand to coincide with the digital switch over in each region.

From tomorrow until March, the cost to recycle unwanted televisions in Hawke’s Bay and the West Coast will be subsidised, however there will be a free period in those regions between October 13-28 where no drop off fees will apply.

Residents in each region will be advised of the various recycling options via a local promotional campaign in newspapers, radio and online.

The TV TakeBack programme will significantly expand television recycling services across New Zealand, Ms Adams says.

“Increasing recycling infrastructure will ensure recyclers have the capacity and capability to deal with increased volumes of televisions.

“A greater understanding of the need to recycle unwanted televisions and how to go about it is essential. Televisions pose a threat to the environment if they are disposed of in landfills or dumped elsewhere, so the Government wants to make sure New Zealanders can access affordable electronic recycling services.

“The recycled material has a variety of uses. For example, glass from a television screen can be transformed into bunker sand for golf courses.”

A part of the programme the Government is also investigating options for long term improvements in the management of all electronic waste, not just televisions.

The programme is being funded via the Government’s Waste Minimisation Fund. Money for the Waste Minimisation Fund comes from a waste levy charged on material disposed of at landfills.

**What is TV TakeBack?**

TV TakeBack is a programme supported by the Government’s Waste Minimisation Fund. It is designed to encourage the recycling of televisions and raise investment in New Zealand’s recycling capacity.

It is expected that disposal of old unwanted televisions during and after the Going Digital programme will increase opportunities for recycling so locations are being arranged where people can drop off their unwanted televisions at low cost.

**Is this a national programme?**

Yes, but it will be phased. The first phase of TV TakeBack starts on October 1 in Hawke’s Bay and the West Coast. These regions have been chosen to lead the programme as they are the first where the old analogue television signal has been turned off as part of the Going Digital programme.

The public roll out of the initiative around the rest of New Zealand will coincide with the digital switch over in each region.

**Where can I take my television to be recycled?**

The Environment Ministry has been working with recyclers, Councils and retailers to provide convenient drop off locations. Go to [www.tvtakeback.govt.nz](http://www.tvtakeback.govt.nz) for information on recycling locations in Hawke’s Bay and West Coast.

As each region gets closer to going digital, the website will have more details about collection sites in each region.

In the meantime, people can contact their local Council or electronic waste recycler to find out what recycling services are available in their region.

**Why is it important to recycle unwanted televisions?** 

Televisions contain materials that can be harmful if released into soil or waterways, such as lead, mercury and phosphorus. Safe recycling takes away risk of contamination and reduces waste going to landfill.

**What happens when I drop off my television to be recycled?**

Televisions dropped off for recycling are taken to national recycling facilities where they are taken apart. Components are recycled locally or sent to specialist facilities overseas.

**Where do the components from my old TV end up?**

·         Glass is recycled in New Zealand and used in roading aggregate.

·         Glass funnel is also recycled overseas into new products containing glass.

·         Metals such as steel are melted down and made into new products such as construction material

·         Copper wire is removed and recycled in New Zealand.

·         Circuit boards are recycled overseas.

·         Aluminium is removed and recycled in New Zealand.

The recycled material has a variety of uses. For example, glass from the screen can be transformed into bunker sand for golf courses. Copper around the electron gun can be recycled into new cabling. Degaussing wire that sits around the front of the screen is high grade iron that can be recycled into metal goods, such as nails, nuts and bolts.

**How much will it cost me to drop off my television for recycling?**

The cost will vary in each region and is dependent on a number of factors, including the cost to transport, dismantle and store a television.

However to kick off TV TakeBack, a special promotion in Hawke’s Bay and the West Coast has been arranged. From 13-28 October, dropping off a television for recycling at a TV TakeBack location will be free in those regions.

**Why do I get charged for taking a television to be recycled?**

Although many components from an unwanted television can be recycled, the value of the material that can be recovered is currently less than the cost of transport and recycling.

**Is TV TakeBack just about unwanted televisions?**

This programme provides money to reduce public charges for recycling, to improve recycling infrastructure and raise public awareness.

Increasing recycling infrastructure will ensure recyclers have capacity and capability to deal with increased volumes of televisions. The Government is also investigating options for long term improvements in the management of all electronic waste, not just televisions. This will reduce landfill waste and help the environment.
