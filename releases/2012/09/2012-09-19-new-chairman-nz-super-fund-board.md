Auckland-based company director Gavin Walker has been appointed as the new chairman of the New Zealand Superannuation Fund Guardians board, Finance Minister Bill English announced today.

Mr Walker replaces David May, who was the first chairman and has served on the board since 2002.

“I want to thank Mr May for his decade of service at the helm of the Guardians’ board,” Mr English says. “Under his leadership, the New Zealand Superannuation Fund was established and has grown to the successful $19 billion fund it is today.”

Mr Walker has served on the Guardians’ board since July 2010. He is also chairman of ASB Bank, Sovereign Insurance and the Government’s ultra-fast broadband steering committee.

“We are fortunate to have someone of Mr Walker’s calibre and experience to take over the leadership of the Guardians,” Mr English says.

Catherine Savage, an existing Guardians board member, has been appointed deputy chair.
