Cabinet has approved the redevelopment of the Canterbury District Health Board’s hospitals with a final plan due back by the end of the year, Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee and Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew announced today.

“This project will be the largest hospital build in the history of New Zealand’s public health service and includes fast tracking the design of Burwood Hospital redevelopment in the eastern suburbs,” Mr Brownlee said.

“The total cost is expected to be more than half a billion dollars, with a final price tag confirmed in December.

“Cabinet has approved $10 million initially to develop the final business plan and also to fast track the design and begin work to redevelop Burwood Hospital.”

Mrs Goodhew said Canterbury DHB’s facilities must be redeveloped to meet current and future needs.

“Canterbury DHB has been planning a redevelopment of its health services since 2008 but that process was interrupted by the series of destructive earthquakes in 2010 and 2011,” Mrs Goodhew said.

“Many of Canterbury DHB’s facilities were damaged in the earthquakes, which meant around 106 beds were lost due to the closure of two floors in the Riverside Block at Christchurch Hospital, and around 200 buildings and over 1200 rooms require repairs.

“The final business plan will establish the best option to build additional operating theatres, replace around 500 beds including purpose designed space for children, an expanded intensive care unit and emergency department at Christchurch Hospital and a new hospital for older people’s health at Burwood.”

Mr Brownlee said the Government would appoint a steering group of up to five people, including the Canterbury DHB chair, to work closely with the DHB to develop the final business case.

“The aim of the Hospital Redevelopment Partnership Group is to remove any potential roadblocks or holdups and to enable a faster build once the project is approved,” Mr Brownlee said.

“Canterbury DHB has been doing a great job delivering health services in the region post-earthquakes.

“The group will support the Canterbury DHB board and senior management by allowing them to continue to focus on these challenges.

“The makeup of the Hospital Redevelopment Partnership group will be announced in the next few weeks,” Mr Brownlee said.
