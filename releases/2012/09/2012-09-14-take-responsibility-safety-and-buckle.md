Twenty-five per cent of the motorists who have died on the roads so far this year were not wearing their safety belts, says Associate Transport Minister Simon Bridges.

“We know safety belts can be the difference between life and death, and many of these deaths will have been preventable. I urge road users to take responsibility for their safety – take this simple step to stay safe.”

The 2012 Safety Belt Survey of adult front seat occupants shows that overall wearing rates are very high – 96 per cent of New Zealanders wear their safety belts, up from 92 per cent in 2003.

“This might seem to be an encouraging result, but it still means four per cent, approximately 120,000 drivers, don’t get the message and are putting themselves at risk unnecessarily. Recent crashes show the tragic consequences this can have.”

The Ministry of Transport’s survey also showed that men are more likely to put themselves at risk, with five per cent of male drivers and seven per cent of male passengers not wearing their seatbelts, compared to three per cent of female drivers and three per cent of female passengers.

“There is a lot the Government can do to improve road safety, and we are working hard in this area through our Safer Journeys strategy. But there are actions we can all take to create a safe driving experience, like wearing a safety belt, driving to conditions and making sure we are alert behind the wheel.”
