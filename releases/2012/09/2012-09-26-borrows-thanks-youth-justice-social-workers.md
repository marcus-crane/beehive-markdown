Associate Social Development Minister Chester Borrows says National Social Workers Day is the perfect time to acknowledge the important work social workers do with New Zealand’s young offenders.

“Unfortunately many people think that a clip-around-the-ear and a few stern words is all a young offender needs. But these young people have complex issues which need addressing, giving youth justice social workers an incredibly hard, but essential, job to help put them back on the right track,” says Mr Borrows.

“It’s important to take a moment to acknowledge this work, and extend our thanks for the tireless and professional job they do.”

Child, Youth and Family has 25 youth justice offices around the country, employing around 100 Family Group Conference coordinators and almost 200 youth justice social workers (including senior practitioners and supervisors).

Additionally, there are around 380 people employed to support the young people in four youth justice residences. The roles include cultural advisors, social workers, programme coordinators, youth workers, team leaders, clinicians and night attendants.

“The Government recognises the huge role social workers have to play in our youth justice system. That’s why, as part of our Fresh Start reforms, we provided funding for 40 new front line staff, including Youth Justice Social Workers, and amended the law to reinforce the importance of the work youth justice social workers do on the underlying causes of youth offending,” says Mr Borrows.

“Having heard many inspiring stories of the innovative way our social workers operate, I know they are making a real difference in the lives of young offenders.”
