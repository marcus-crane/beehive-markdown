Justice Minister Judith Collins today announced three appointments to the Liquor Licensing Authority. 

Judith Moorhead, David Major and Ross Miller have been appointed for a term of five years.

“These members bring vast decision making experience to the work of the Authority,” Ms Collins said.

Judith Moorhead is an Auckland barrister and has been reappointed having been a member of the Authority since 2007.

David Major was national director of the Prison Chaplaincy Service until his retirement last year. He was a former member of the Parole Board and has had extensive experience with the Salvation Army in policy development and administration.

Ross Miller, a Judicial Justice of the Peace, is a former chief executive of local authorities in the Wairarapa and Coromandel. He has been a member of the Ministry of Social Development’s Benefits Review Committee for the past nine years.

The Liquor Licensing Authority maintains a general overview of liquor licensing laws and considers and determines the granting and renewal of liquor licences.
