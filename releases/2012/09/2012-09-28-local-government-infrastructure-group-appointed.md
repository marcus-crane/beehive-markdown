Local Government Minister David Carter has today announced an independent expert advisory group to help local government provide more cost effective infrastructure.

The eight-member group is one of the initiatives outlined in the *Better Local Government* reform programme announced earlier this year.

Mr Carter says the Local Government Infrastructure Efficiency Expert Advisory Group will focus on reducing the cost of quality local government infrastructure.

“This will feed into the broader reform programme underway which aims to provide clarity around the role of councils, stronger governance and improved efficiency and financial management.”

The advisory group will be chaired by Greater Wellington Regional Council Chair, Fran Wilde. Other members are Stephen Selwood, Chief Executive of New Zealand Council for Infrastructure Development; Jeremy Sole, Chief Executive of New Zealand Contractors Federation; Josephine Grierson, businesswoman and infrastructure economics expert; Liz Anderson, Infrastructure and Policy Consultant; Debbie Packer, former Deputy Mayor of South Taranaki; Philip Cory-Wright, director, infrastructure company advisor and investment banker; and Alan Bickers, former local government chief executive and engineer.

“The wealth of experience of these members, within the private sector and local government, will be an asset in improving the cost/benefit implications of future local government infrastructure decisions,” says Mr Carter.

The expert advisory group will report back in February 2013. That report will feed into a second piece of local government reform legislation planned for next year.
