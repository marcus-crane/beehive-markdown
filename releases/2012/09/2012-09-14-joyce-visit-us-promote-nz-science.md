Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce will travel on Sunday to Washington DC and San Francisco to raise the profile of the New Zealand science, trade and education sectors.

Mr Joyce will lead a science delegation to attend the New Zealand-United States Joint Commission on Science and Technology Cooperation in Washington DC on 19 and 20 September. The objective is to promote bilateral scientific collaboration with the US at a policy and research level.

“The joint meeting is an opportunity to strengthen the NZ-US relationship, highlight the value of New Zealand’s science expertise and position our country as a valued research partner,” Mr Joyce says.

In Washington DC Mr Joyce will meet with Dr John Holdren, the US President’s Advisor for Science and Technology. He will also visit the Association of International Educators (NAFSA), one of New Zealand’s key tertiary education partners.

“New Zealand has a strong international reputation for innovation and for delivering high quality education. This is an opportunity to highlight our strengths and help double the international education contribution to the New Zealand economy to $5 billion by 2025,” Mr Joyce says.

In San Francisco Mr Joyce will be meeting with Kiwi companies operating in the United States, and Silicon Valley executives.
