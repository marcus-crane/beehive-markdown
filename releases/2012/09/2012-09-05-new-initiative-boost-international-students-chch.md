The Government has today launched the new *Christchurch Educated* marketing initiative to encourage international students to study in Canterbury.

Speaking at the launch in Christchurch, Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce said the Government was committed to working with providers to boost the number of international students studying in Christchurch.

“While the numbers of overseas students studying in the region has understandably declined following the earthquakes, Canterbury is still the second most popular destination in New Zealand for international students and has a strong international reputation for providing high quality education,” Mr Joyce says.

“It has been a tough time for all providers of international education in Christchurch following the earthquakes with a 37 per cent drop in numbers in 2011.

“The Government has been working to assist international student levels in Canterbury recover to pre-quake levels by providing an extra $5 million to Education New Zealand’s nationwide marketing budget, dedicated to Christchurch.

“*Christchurch Educated* is about sending the message globally that Christchurch is safe and friendly, that education providers are back on their feet, and that international students are welcome in the community.”

As part of the initiative, Mr Joyce announced that work on a Christchurch Educated Student Card, the Tertiary Pathway Guarantee, and the establishment of a central meeting place in Christchurch will be undertaken over the next three months.

The Christchurch Educated Student Card will provide student identification, discounts on public transport and purchasing discounts.

Under the Tertiary Pathway Guarantee all international students that attend a Christchurch secondary school and pass University Entrance will be guaranteed entry to a degree programme at Canterbury or Lincoln Universities or the Christchurch Polytechnic Institute (CPIT). They will also be guaranteed an offer of student accommodation and the use of the libraries on all campuses.

A ‘Commons’ for international students will also be established in the central city. This will be a central place for international students to meet and receive information and advice.

“The Government has set an ambitious goal to double the economic value of New Zealand’s international education sector to $5 billion by 2025. Having more overseas students studying in Christchurch’s schools, universities, polytechs and private training establishments is a key part of achieving that goal,” Mr Joyce says.
