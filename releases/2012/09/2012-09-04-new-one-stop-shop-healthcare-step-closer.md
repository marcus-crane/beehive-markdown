Today’s blessing and partial opening of Waikato DHB’s new Meade Clinical Centre brings central North Island residents closer to a one stop shop for their healthcare needs, Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew says.

The $130 million Meade Clinical Centre is the biggest hospital project in the central North Island. The Centre’s name honours Dr John Anthony Meade, who played a central role in Waikato Hospital’s transformation through the 1950s and 1960s to his retirement in 1979.

“Today’s opening of stage one of the new building is a testament to everyone involved in developing this top class healthcare facility. Once completed, the Centre will have more than 6000 pieces of equipment and provide full outpatient services for the region’s 850,000 residents.”

The Centre will be opened in four stages. Among the first services to open at the new clinic this month are Dermatology, Neurology, Neurosurgery and Plastics Clinics along with a new High Dependency Unit.

New Cardiac, Eye, Gastroenterology, General Medicine, Pain Management, Renal, Respiratory and Vascular Clinics will open from next month.

The final two stages, including the completion of the Critical Care Unit with its new intensive care facility, Theatres and Radiology, are expected to open in mid-2014.

“It’s great to see cutting edge technology enabling the best patient care for residents all in one building. I’m also pleased to see patients and visitors being put first with a new kiosk system designed to help people navigate their way around the whole Waiora Waikato hospital campus,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“I congratulate everyone involved, and thank the DHB for all its hard work, along with patients and residents who have put up with the disruptions.”
