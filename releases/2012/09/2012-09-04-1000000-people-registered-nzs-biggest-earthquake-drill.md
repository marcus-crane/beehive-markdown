Civil Defence Minister Chris Tremain is congratulating the one million New Zealanders who have signed up for Exercise ShakeOut, the first-ever nationwide earthquake drill.

“We set the goal of one million ShakeOut participants, and this morning we achieved this goal with Berhampore School in Wellington signing up the ‘millionth’ person.

“At 9:26 am on 26 September, these one million New Zealanders will drop, cover and hold to practice the appropriate actions to take in an earthquake. Exercise ShakeOut is a chance for Kiwi families, schools and workplaces to help raise awareness and make sure they have a plan for emergencies.

“Today is also the anniversary of the September 2010 earthquake in Christchurch. This is a fitting reminder of the importance of being prepared, as an earthquake can strike at any time.”
