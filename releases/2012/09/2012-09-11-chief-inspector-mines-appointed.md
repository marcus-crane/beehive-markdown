Labour Minister Kate Wilkinson has today announced the appointment of Tony Forster as Chief Inspector for mines in the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s High Hazards Unit.

Mr Forster will head a team of four specialist inspectors. He will lead the Ministry’s health and safety regulatory work in relation to mines including both underground and opencast.

“This is a significant appointment for the High Hazards Unit. It is the result of an international search to find the best person from a very small pool of candidates,” Ms Wilkinson says.

Mr Forster has 40 years’ experience in British mining. He has deputised as the United Kingdom’s HM Chief Inspector of Mines and is currently HM Principal Inspector of Mines.

“We are very pleased to have someone of Mr Forster’s calibre in this role.”

The High Hazards Unit was established to strengthen the capacity and expertise to inspect mines and ensure safety in the mining industry.

Mr Forster will start in the role in mid-January. Until then the Chief Inspector role has been filled temporarily by the Queensland Chief Mines Inspector Gavin Taylor who will continue to provide support to the High Hazards Unit.

Mr Taylor has been seconded from the Queensland Government and has made a significant contribution to the safety of New Zealand mining.
