Education Minister Hekia Parata has today announced she will meet with school leaders in Christchurch next Thursday to discuss the approach for education renewal in the greater Christchurch area.

“The priority is delivering a network that will meet changing community needs and deliver better outcomes for learners. It is vital that the investment we make translates into improved educational performance and service delivery,’’ says Ms Parata.

“Through this process people have recognised the unique opportunity we have to do something different and innovative. Our announcements for the schooling sector on Thursday will reflect that.

“The approach we are taking will foster closer connections across the education system. It will support children as they move from early childhood education into schooling and smooth the transitions into secondary schooling, and tertiary or further education, and encourage more young people to go on and gain higher qualifications.

“I would like to thank the sector and the wider Christchurch community for their patience. I appreciate the uncertainty has been difficult but given the scale of the challenge ahead of us, it is important we take the time to get this right. ”

Ms Parata also announced the establishment of three Advisory Boards to provide on-going community input and expertise to the renewal process - an Education Advisory Board, a Waitaha Advisory Board and Pasifika Advisory Board. The Ministry of Education is currently contacting potential members and further details will be released shortly.

“On-going community engagement and detailed discussions with schools and other education services and bodies will be a key feature of the work ahead,’’ Ms Parata says.
