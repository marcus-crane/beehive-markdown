Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson has announced Dunedin Ecologist Dr Ralph Allen the 2012 winner of the prestigious Loder Cup for his outstanding achievements in plant conservation work.

A professional plant ecologist for 30 years with the former DSIR and then Landcare Research, Dr Allen has been pivotal in protecting thousands of hectares of native forest, shrublands, and coastal vegetation throughout Otago, Southland, and the Kapiti Coast.

“Dr Allen’s efforts have inspired others to cherish the native plants and ecosystems around them,” Ms Wilkinson says.

“He has been instrumental in the establishment of several groups that promote the protection of indigenous vegetation including Ecology Action Otago and the Otago Branch of Beech Forests Action Committee.

“Dr Allen was the driving force behind the efforts of the Otago Natural History Trust to establish Orokonui Eco Sanctuary, a fenced area of 307 hectares near Dunedin which is now a secure habitat for native plants and animals.”

Dr Allen was nominated by the Otago Conservation Board. Board chairperson Abby Smith said Dr Allen’s many contributions to the protection, cultivation and enjoyment of New Zealand’s indigenous flora deserved recognition.

Dr Allen has published three books and over 50 scientific papers.

The Loder Cup was first awarded in 1926 to encourage and honour New Zealanders who work to investigate, promote, retain and cherish our indigenous flora.

Ms Wilkinson will award the Loder Cup to Dr Allen at a function later this year.
