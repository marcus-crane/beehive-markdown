Pacific Island Affairs Minister Hekia Parata today announced three key appointments to the Pacific Business Trust Board.

Ms Caren Rangi, of Cook Islands descent, has been appointed Chair of the Pacific Business Trust Board replacing Hamish Crooks.

“Caren’s knowledge of the Pacific business development environment and of the Trust provides stability and focus to the Board,” says Ms Parata.

Ms Rangi has over twenty years’ experience in governance, public sector auditing and strategic organisational management.

Mrs Kenina Court and Mr Rhys Faleafa have been appointed trustees to the Board.

Mrs Court is Principal with WHK, the fifth largest accounting firm in Australasia. She has extensive experience in a wide range of areas including strategy, sustainable business growth, business modelling and improvement.

Mr Faleafa is a Chartered Accountant and the General Manager of New Zealand clothing company Huffer. He has previously worked at Arthur Andersen, lectured at the University of Auckland and is a consultant for SME’s and the public sector. He is Director of Faleafa Investments and Consultants Limited.

Ms Parata also extended her thanks to former Chair Hamish Crooks and former Deputy Chair Sitiveni Mavoa.

“The Pacific Business Trust has gained significantly from their leadership and I am grateful for the valuable contributions they have both made.

“The Pacific Business Trust provides business development, facilitation and training that is relevant, dynamic and informative. I am confident these appointments will assist them to continue to do this well and help Pacific businesses and people play their part in a prosperous and productive New Zealand.”

Pacific Business Trust was established in 1985 to increase business opportunities for Pacific peoples in New Zealand. Over the last six years it has assisted Pacific people to establish 335 new businesses. The Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs is its principal funder, and it receives other funding for the provision of business management training.

The appointments to the Board are for a three year term.
