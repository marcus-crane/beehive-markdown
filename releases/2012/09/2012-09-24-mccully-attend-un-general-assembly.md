Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will travel to New York today for the opening of the 67th United Nations General Assembly.

“The United Nations General Assembly is the premier meeting of member states and is an opportunity to project our voice on international issues that directly affect us and our Pacific neighbours,” Mr McCully says.

“It is also an opportunity to seek support in our campaign for a seat on the UN Security Council and promote our credentials as an independent, fair-minded country committed to international peace and security.”

While in New York, Mr McCully will hold meetings with a number of bilateral ministerial counterparts and regional organisations such as the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Organisation of the Islamic Conference and the African Union.
