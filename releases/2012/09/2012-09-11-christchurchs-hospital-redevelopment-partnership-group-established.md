Health Minister Tony Ryall today announced the members of the new Hospital Redevelopment Partnership Group which has been set up to enable a faster build of Canterbury DHB’s $500 million plus hospitals redevelopment project.

‘These people will work closely and collaboratively with Canterbury DHB to support the largest hospital redevelopment project in New Zealand’s health history,” Mr Ryall said.

‘It is critical that the delivery of every day health services continues for the people of Canterbury while this work is carried out. The government wants to ensure Canterbury DHB has all the support it needs in order to do that, while also being an integral part of the redevelopment.

‘The Group will work with CDHB to develop a final business plan, and fast track the design of the Burwood Hospital redevelopment in the eastern suburbs.

‘The final business plan will establish the best option to build additional operating theatres, replace around 500 beds including purpose designed space for children, an expanded intensive care unit and emergency department at Christchurch Hospital and a new hospital for older people’s health at Burwood.’

The four members of the new Partnership Group are:

Mr Evan Davies (Chair) – Mr Davies is currently Managing Director of Todd Property Group, Chair of the National Health Board’s Capital Investment Committee, a Director of Waterfront Auckland Ltd, and a Trustee of the Anglican Trust for Women and Children.

Mr Bruce Matheson – Chair of Canterbury District Health Board, Mr Matheson is also currently the Chair of Freshpork New Zealand Ltd and H.S.D. Ltd, and is a director and shareholder of Brannigans Ltd.

Mr Tony Sewell – Chief Executive of Ngāi Tahu Property Ltd, Mr Sewell is a member of the Property Institute of New Zealand and in 2004 was recognised by his peers in receiving the New Zealand Property Institutes Industry Award.

Dr Margaret Wilsher - Chief Medical Officer at Auckland District Health Board, and a respiratory physician working in both the public and private sectors. Dr Wilsher is a clinical teacher and Honorary Associate Professor in the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences at the University of Auckland, and is a member of the National Health Board and its Capital Investment Committee.

In addition to the members listed above, the Group will include ex officio members representing the Ministry of Health, Treasury, the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority, and Canterbury District Health Board.
