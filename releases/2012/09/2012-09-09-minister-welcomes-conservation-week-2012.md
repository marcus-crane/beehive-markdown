Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson has welcomed the start of Conservation Week 2012 today.

This year’s theme is 'Love your parks' and will involve celebrating the 60th anniversary of the National Parks Act and the 125th anniversary of Te Heuheu Tukino IV gifting the Tongariro, Ruapehu and Ngauruhoe mountain peaks to the people of New Zealand.

“This week is a great time to get outside and enjoy our beautiful natural landscape, but preserving our conservation areas – be they on public or private land – is an important responsibility for all New Zealanders all year round,” Ms Wilkinson says.

“About 25 per cent of New Zealanders visited a National Park last year, but more of us need to get outdoors and see this great country for ourselves.”

This is an opportunity to get involved and to celebrate other special conservation places by taking part in conservation events and activities in your area.
