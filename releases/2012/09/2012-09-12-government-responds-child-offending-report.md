Associate Social Development Minister Chester Borrows today tabled the Government’s response to the Social Services Select Committee inquiry into the identification, rehabilitation and protection of child offenders.

“I share the Committee’s determination to ensure today’s child offenders don’t turn into career criminals and the right steps are taken to get these young people’s lives on track.

“The Committee provided a thoughtful report and the Government has carefully considered its recommendations,” says Mr Borrows.

The Committee made 31 recommendations, covering the identification of child offenders, effectiveness of rehabilitation programmes, the care and protection referral process, and the effectiveness of the care and protection model. Of the 31 recommendations, the Government has agreed, or agreed in principle, with 26 and will give further consideration to four.

“Its report is timely given the Government’s current focus on reducing youth crime and supporting vulnerable children. Many of the committee’s recommendations are being incorporated into the action plans being developed in these two priority areas – the White Paper on Vulnerable Children and the Youth Crime Action Plan.

“Even before the Inquiry’s recommendations were released the Government had funded an increase in the numbers of social workers in schools, provided $15.3 million for health and education screening for children entering care and protection and $14.5 million Child, youth and Family for enhanced mental health services for those in care and protection.

“The Government will continue to liaise with the child and youth justice sector as we chart a pathway forward,” Mr Borrows said.
