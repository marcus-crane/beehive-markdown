Education Minister Hekia Parata has today announced a review of home-based early childhood education.

The review will seek to ensure that home-based early childhood education (ECE) aligns with the Government’s broader goals and priorities for ECE.  If not, changes in regulations, licensing practices and funding may be required.

“Home-based ECE is the most rapidly growing part of the ECE sector and has a high proportion of enrolments of children aged less than two years,’’ says Ms Parata.

“It has an important role to play in the Government’s priority for all children in New Zealand to have access to high quality early childhood education before starting school.’’

The review is in response to recommendations made in reports by the ECE Taskforce and two Sector Advisory Groups which were established to focus on improving the quality of ECE services. Their reports found that a review of home-based services has the potential to raise overall quality and improve the accountability of home-based networks.

The Ministry of Education will undertake the review which is expected to be completed in April 2013.
