Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today announced the appointment of career diplomat Richard Mann as High Commissioner to South Africa.

"This appointment comes at an exciting time in New Zealand's growing engagement with Africa, with rising New Zealand public and private sector interest in the region," Mr McCully says.

"Richard will play a pivotal role in developing and expanding our relations with southern Africa in coming years. A significant aspect of his role will be to support New Zealand business in the development of export markets in South Africa.

“Richard will also lead the delivery of a dedicated Overseas Development Assistance programme."

Mr Mann most recently held the post of Acting Director, Partnerships, Humanitarian and Disaster Manager, International Development Group at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT).

He has also served as Ambassador to the Republic of Korea, Ambassador to Chile, and MFAT's Director of Human Resources.
