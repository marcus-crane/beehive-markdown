Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will travel to Russia tonight for the 24th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Ministerial Meeting.

Discussions among the 21 APEC nations will focus on trade and investment liberalisation, regional economic integration and ways to enhance emergency preparedness in the region.

Mr McCully will also attend bilateral meetings with counterparts from the APEC region.

Following the meeting, Mr McCully will visit Seoul to mark the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between South Korea and New Zealand.

Korean Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan visited New Zealand in August.

“I am looking forward to resuming my discussions on regional affairs with Foreign Minister Kim,” Mr McCully says.

“At a time when golfing prodigy Lydia Ko has made LPGA history in Canada, I want to acknowledge the significant contribution Korean New Zealanders are making in all areas of New Zealand life.”

Mr McCully will also host a Year of Friendship reception.
