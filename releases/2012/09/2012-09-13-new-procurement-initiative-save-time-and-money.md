Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain says that a new procurement arrangement for web services will streamline tender processes for government agencies.

“The new Common Web Services initiative, led by the Department of Internal Affairs, will allow government agencies to easily engage online expertise from an approved list of 42 providers. Agencies requiring web related resources can now select from this panel of providers, complete minimal paperwork, and get on with the job of providing government information and services online.

“The panel of providers is comprehensive and includes New Zealand owned and operated small-to medium sized enterprises with specific expertise as well as larger companies offering a wider range of services.

“Better procurement practices for government work are vital to ensure that the taxpayer is getting value for money. This streamlined arrangement will reduce red tape and improve efficiency.

“This initiative demonstrates the Government’s commitment to helping citizens and businesses engage with government more easily in a digital environment. The Department of Internal Affairs is also in the process of procuring a single web platform for agencies to use.”
