Police Minister Anne Tolley has today officially opened the new police station at Rolleston, near Christchurch.

The $1.6 million facility, in Tennyson Street, is opening on time and on budget.

“The new police station is a fantastic addition to Rolleston,” says Mrs Tolley.

“It gives the police greater visibility, it’s nearer the local community compared to the previous station, and it is also much more accessible to the public.

“The new station fits perfectly with our focus on frontline policing and preventing crime, as we work towards the target of a 15 per cent reduction in crime by 2017.

“I turned the sod for this new building at the beginning of February, so to have it up and running so soon is a great credit to everyone involved in the planning, design and build.”
