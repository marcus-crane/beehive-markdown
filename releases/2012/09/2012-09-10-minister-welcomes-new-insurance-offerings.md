Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has welcomed the news that Westpac and Lumley Insurance have teamed up to write new construction and full replacement home and contents cover in greater Christchurch.

“Being able to get new cover will help the rebuild gain momentum, and I hope today’s announcement spurs other insurers to further unlock the market,” Mr Brownlee says.

“With the seismic situation stabilising, and the vast amount of geotechnical and seismological work done over the past 24 months, insurers have arguably never been better placed to quantify and price risk.

“Today’s news is a welcome vote of confidence in Christchurch’s future.”
