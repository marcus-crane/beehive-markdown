Prime Minister John Key today announced he will be putting a greater focus on giving more graduates of the Limited Services Volunteer (LSV) course an opportunity to transition into employment.

“I’ve seen first-hand the dramatic effect LSV has on young people who volunteer to go through it,” Mr Key says.

“The course’s unique mix of fitness, personal presentation and other employment-focused activities really motivates young people, leaving them ready to work and keen for a job.”

Mr Key says he has also spoken with employers across the country who have been delighted with LSV graduates they have hired.

“So today I am launching a new initiative to get more of these young people into work,” Mr Key says.

“Today I have personally written to around 175 employers asking them to take on motivated young people who have completed the LSV course and are ready to work. I will continue to write to employers over the coming months.

“I’m also reminding employers that subsidies are available through the National-led Government’s Job Streams initiative to help them employ someone.

“I’m proud of the increased investment we have made in LSV since coming into Government in 2008 – now I want to seem more employers step up and do their bit to help these young people too,” Mr Key says.

LSV is a free, six-week course held at the Hobsonville, Trentham and Burnham military camps for 18-25 year olds.

Young people on benefits are referred to the programme by Work and Income and the course is run by the New Zealand Defence Force.

Earlier this year the Government welcomed a joint initiative between the Auckland Council, the Auckland Chamber of Commerce and the Ministry of Social Development to provide work experience for LSV graduates.

The Government has also been investing in work and training opportunities for young people. Budget 2012 provided for 3,000 more places in the Youth Guarantee Scheme over the next four years, which means there will be 12,930 fees-free places in the Youth Guarantee Scheme for 16- and 17-year-olds in 2013.

“LSV offers a real chance for young people who lack confidence or motivation to start believing in themselves and grow,” Mr Key says.

“I want to see more employers offer these young people the all-important opportunity they need when they graduate – a job.

“We’re making it easy for employers and we’re even subsidising the jobs. So I am personally encouraging businesses to step up and help make a difference to these young people’s lives,” Mr Key says.
