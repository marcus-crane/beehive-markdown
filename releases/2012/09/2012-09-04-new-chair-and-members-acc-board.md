ACC Minister Judith Collins today announced a new Chair and new members for the ACC Board, reflecting the Government’s priorities for the highest standards of best practice and service, and rebuilding the public’s trust and confidence in the corporation.

“My appointments today underline the Government’s commitment to genuine culture change, and will lead to a more balanced and comprehensive approach to the governance and operation of ACC.

“I am pleased to announce the interim Chair Paula Rebstock has been appointed to the position of Chair. Paula has served the Board well in an acting capacity throughout a challenging time for the corporation. She has demonstrated a commitment to culture change at ACC and will bring important continuity to the role on top of her broad experience in corporate governance and regulation,” Ms Collins says.

The new Board members are Deputy Chair Trevor Janes, Professor Des Gorman and Kristy McDonald QC - all appointed for three year terms. A fourth new Board member has been identified, to commence in early 2013, bringing the Board up to its full membership of eight. The appointment will be announced later this year, giving the person time to fulfil prior business commitments. The new appointees join existing Board members Jill Spooner, John Meehan and Jane Huria.

“The Government’s priorities for ACC also include maintaining a focus on levy stability and financial sustainability, providing high quality services for claimants and clients, and ensuring the early resolution of disputes.

“Building on the strength of the existing Board members, the wide-ranging skills and experience of these appointees reflect our priorities. We now have a strong Board to lead ACC as it embarks on a new era of service for all New Zealanders,” Ms Collins says.
