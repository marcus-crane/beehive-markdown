12,300 more New Zealanders have received orthopaedic operations, including hip and other joint replacements, in the past four years.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says district health boards continue to give more patients the operations they need.

“This is the fourth year of record increases under National,” says Mr Ryall.

“If we look back to the 2007/08 financial year 118,000 surgeries were performed – this financial year 153,000 elective surgeries were performed.

“This means an extra 95,000 elective surgeries have been performed in the past four years compared with number performed under the previous Government. This includes:

- An extra 6,800 ear, nose and throat operations, including grommets
- An extra 13,800 general surgeries, such as removing skin lesions
- An extra 4,300 operations for children nine years and under
- An extra 14,800 ophthalmology operations, including cataracts
- An extra 12,300 orthopaedic operations, including hip and other joint replacements.

“This Government is committed to providing more New Zealanders with elective surgery. Over the next four years we are investing a further $68 million to maintain our record levels of elective surgery and to further reduce waiting times for patients.
