Pacific Island Affairs Minister Hekia Parata is delighted by the number of applications for the 2012 Prime Minister’s Pacific Youth Awards and says it confirms a wealth of talent among this population.

“Applications for these awards closed at the end of August and I’m delighted that young Pacific people continue to strive high in their aspirations and goals,” says Ms Parata.

The Prime Minister’s Pacific Youth Awards were inaugurated in 2010 in three categories: Leadership, sponsored by the University of Auckland; Creativity, sponsored by Weta Workshop; and Inspiration sponsored by Cogita Business Systems.

This year the Vodafone NZ Foundation supported a new award, Mobiles4Good, joining last year’s new entrant, Air New Zealand’s Innovation Award, to bring the total on offer to five. A total of 105 entries were received.

“These awards are a wonderful opportunity to recognise outstanding young Pacific people, and to bring them to the attention of all New Zealanders. It aligns with our Pacific Island Affairs priorities in education; youth, skills and employment; Pacific languages and culture; and enterprising communities.

“Young Pacific people play an important role in New Zealand and they continue to aim for excellence,” says Ms Parata.
