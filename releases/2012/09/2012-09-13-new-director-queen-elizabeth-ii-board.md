Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson is pleased to announce the appointment of Susan Yerex as a director on the Queen Elizabeth II National Trust Board.

The QEII National Trust helps protect significant natural and cultural heritage sites on private land.

As at 30 June 2012 there were 3,659 registered QE II covenants on private land covering 99,782.67 hectares.

“Ms Yerex runs a beef and sheep farm at Turangi in partnership with her husband. She will bring governance skills, scientific knowledge and a pragmatic farming perspective to the Board,” Ms Wilkinson says.

She has a strong academic background in agricultural commerce and horticulture and was a Lincoln Kellogg Scholar in 2008.

She serves on a number of private and voluntary trusts, boards and charities, including two which advocate for the care of Lake Taupo and its water – a particular passion of hers.

Ms Yerex’s term of appointment is for three years.
