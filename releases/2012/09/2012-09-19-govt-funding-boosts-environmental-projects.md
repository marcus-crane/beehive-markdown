Environment Minister Amy Adams has announced that more than $750,000 has been given to five environmental initiatives in the latest round of the Community Environment Fund.

“The Community Environment Fund encourages people to take environmental action in their communities. This funding will be used by community organisations to restore native forests, increase biodiversity, reduce pests and educate communities,” Ms Adams says.

Two of the projects, Mid Dome Wilding Tree Seed Source Removal Project and Waimakariri Ecological and Landscape Restoration Alliance, will use their allocated funds to help control wilding trees in the Southland and Canterbury regions.

Wilding trees suppress native vegetation, dry up wetlands and cover otherwise productive farm land. The projects involve working with landowners and the community to restore and maintain the unique biodiversity of the Southland and Canterbury regions.

Mid Dome Wilding Tree Seed Source Removal Project receives $300,000 and $294,000 goes to the Waimakariri Ecological and Landscape Restoration Alliance.

Genesis Reforestation Project will use $100,000 to help with its Shade House in Schools and Communities Restoration and Repair project.

The scheme teaches children how to grow native plants and encourages them to get involved in conservation work such as tree planting.

The project is working with Hawke’s Bay school children and Marae to carry out restoration work for projects such as the Te Karamu Stream Project and Pekapeka Wetland Project.

The Otago Peninsula Biodiversity Trust receives $67,750 to enhance the biodiversity of the Otago region by carrying out possum control and monitoring bird and vegetation numbers.

The Kaikoura Enhancement Trust gets $36,264 to carry out restoration work in the Kaikoura area for the benefit of the local community and the many tourists that visit the region.
