A recycling facility that will process up to 80,000 televisions each year has been opened by Environment Minister Amy Adams.

The Auckland-based Abilities Group has used $110,000 from the Government’s Waste Minimisation Fund to buy equipment that will allow it to recycle televisions at its Glenfield-based plant. The initiative will divert up to 750 tonnes of waste from landfill each year.

“Unwanted televisions are a hazard if not dealt with responsibly, and initiatives like this are crucial in ensuring harmful materials are not released into soil or waterways,” Ms Adams says.

“This is one of a number of e-waste initiatives the Government has funded through the Waste Minimisation Fund.

“Our aim is to build New Zealand’s e-waste processing infrastructure to ensure we have the facilities in place to meet future demand. This initiative is a further step towards New Zealand better managing the 80,000 tonnes of electronic waste created each year from used televisions, computers, cellphones and printers.”

Abilities, which also recycles plastic wrap, cardboard and packaging, was established in 1959 to provide employment for people with disabilities. The organisation employs 150 staff, of which 120 have disabilities.
