Results from 2011 show the Government’s continued focus on performance in the Tertiary sector is working well, Tertiary, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce says.

The 2011 education performance information released today shows that the university, polytechnic, wānanga, and private training establishment sectors have improved their course and qualification completion rates as well as student retention rates.

“I am pleased to see a continuing upward trend in the performance of the tertiary sector. Course completion rates have risen from 77 per cent in 2009 to 82 per cent in 2011, with qualification rates over the same period increasing from 62 per cent to 71 per cent,” Mr Joyce says.

“This is exactly the type of improvement we have been working towards. It shows the tertiary sector is responding to our signals to focus on performance and to deliver better value for taxpayers’ money.

“I am also pleased that the qualification completion rates at level 4 and above continued to increase in 2011. Level 4 and above qualification completions increased from 64 per cent to 72 per cent last year. This shows we are on the right track to deliver on the Better Public Services target of 55 per cent of 25 - 34 year olds having a level 4 qualification or above by 2017,” Mr Joyce says.
