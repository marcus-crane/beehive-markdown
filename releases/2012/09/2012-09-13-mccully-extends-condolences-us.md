Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully today extended New Zealand’s condolences to the American people and the US Government over the loss of life at their diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya.

“We are shocked and saddened by this attack on the US post, and by the death of the US Ambassador to Libya and three other US personnel,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand strongly condemns these acts of violence and sends our thoughts to the families, colleagues and friends of those killed.

“As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has noted, this was an attack by a small and savage group and not by the people or Government of Libya.

“New Zealand is committed to working with its friends and partners, including the United States, in pursuit of a more stable and democratic Libya,” Mr McCully says.
