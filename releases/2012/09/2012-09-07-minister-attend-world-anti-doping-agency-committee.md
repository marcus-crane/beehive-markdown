Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain will attend the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Executive Committee in London on behalf of the Minister of Sport and Recreation next week.

New Zealand currently represents Oceania on the WADA Executive Committee. The current membership also includes Sport Ministers from South Africa, Canada, Japan, the European Union, and International Olympic Committee representatives from Egypt, Switzerland, Ireland, the United Kingdom and Italy.

“I am looking forward to Chairing a meeting of Ministers to discuss agenda items prior to the Executive Committee meeting,” says Mr Tremain.

“The agenda will be dominated by the review of the World Anti-Doping Code. New Zealand’s position on the Committee is very important to reflect our strong stance against doping.

“I will also attend the Closing Ceremony of the London Paralympic Games, and hope to be able to meet with some of our outstanding athletes.”

Mr Tremain will also attend meetings with counterpart Ministers while in London.
