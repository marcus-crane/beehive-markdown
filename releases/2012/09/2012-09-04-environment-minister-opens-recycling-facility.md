A new glass-sorting facility opened by Environment Minister Amy Adams in Tauranga today will help to divert about 3000 tonnes of glass from going into landfill each year.

The facility at Te Maunga Resource Recovery Park received about $47,000 for the project from the Government’s waste disposal levy allocated to Tauranga City Council.

In addition to accepting glass bottles and jars, Te Maunga will also start accepting flat glass, including from windows and doors, which will be sorted and stored before it is then sent to other facilities to be recycled.

The flat glass will be recycled into new products like insulation, and the glass bottles and jars will be used to make new containers.

“This project is a good example of a council using its waste disposal levy funding to work with business on a project that will benefit the local community and reduce waste”, Ms Adams says.

“Tauranga is helping lead the way in waste minimisation and resource efficiency across the country.”

More than 80 per cent of the funding for the project came from the Tauranga City Council’s allocation of the waste disposal levy.

The levy for waste disposed of at landfill is to help communities and businesses develop initiatives that increase reuse, recovery and recycling, and decrease waste to landfill.

More than $76 million has been collected throughout the country via the levy since it was established in 2009.
