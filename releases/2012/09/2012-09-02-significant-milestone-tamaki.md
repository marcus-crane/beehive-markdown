The first neighbourhood-based renewal programme in New Zealand will be formally launched in Auckland tomorrow when the Tāmaki Redevelopment Company opens its doors in the heart of Glen Innes, and chief executive Debra Lawson starts work.

“This is a first,” Housing Minister Phil Heatley says.

“Never before have all the components of a successful neighbourhood – its social life, job and business opportunities, the education of its children as well as the housing – been brought together in one programme.

“The Tāmaki Redevelopment Company will create a thriving and self-reliant community across the broader Tāmaki area, including Panmure, Glen Innes and Point England.

“We’ll also see improvements to the urban environment including better use of large sections and new, warm housing. It’s an exciting development for Auckland, and one that may prove to be a blueprint for urban renewal elsewhere in the country.”

The Tāmaki Redevelopment Company was jointly formed by the Government and Auckland Council and is a long-term programme for the next 15-20 years.

Successful transformation programmes overseas have brought together the local community, government, business, education, social agencies, developers and financiers.

“The people of the Tāmaki community have told us they are keen to see the Tāmaki vision – which they helped to shape – brought to fruition as quickly as possible. That starts to happen now,” Mr Heatley says.
