Associate Transport Minister Simon Bridges is inviting people to have their say on options to make New Zealand’s vehicle licensing systems simpler and more efficient.

“The current systems have been in place for decades and affect every vehicle owner and driver so we need to be sure the rationale for all of these are still clear and justified.”

The Vehicle Licensing Reform project, jointly led by the Ministry of Transport and the NZ Transport Agency, is looking at ways to refine the following systems:

- warrant of fitness and certificate of fitness
- annual vehicle licensing (commonly known as registration)
- transport services licensing

“A discussion document presenting options for change has been developed after a great deal of analysis and research, and public consultation is the important next stage of the process.”

“These are not preferred options; there may be others. The views and knowledge of vehicle owners and drivers and the transport sector will be an important part of any final recommendations to help the government make fair and considered choices, so I encourage people to let us know what they support, and whether there’s anything we’ve missed.”

Mr Bridges says reform has the potential to save millions of dollars in unnecessary costs and time for households, businesses and the Government.

“In relation to the warrant of fitness (WoF) system, for example, New Zealand’s vehicle frequency is higher than most other OECD countries. Around $245 million each year is paid in inspection fees and the time spent getting a WoF is estimated as worth $100 million, but it is unclear whether this results in fewer crashes caused by vehicle faults.

“There is also possibly too high a reliance on a WoF check as a substitute for vehicle maintenance.

“Safety does, of course, remain a key issue. One of the objectives of the Vehicle Licensing Reform project is to reduce regulatory burdens while achieving similar or improved safety outcomes, so any changes to existing systems will have to achieve this.”

People wanting to make a submission can fill in a short online survey, write a submission, or just respond to areas of the reform that apply to them.
