Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew today announced the development of new Quality and Safety Markers for healthcare and a national patient safety campaign to launch early next year.

“New Zealand has an excellent health and disability system by international standards, and the vast majority of patients are treated safely and effectively. However, for a small number of people, events happen that cause harm or have the potential to cause harm. This harm causes great distress to patients, their families and clinicians, as well as increasing health sector costs,” said Mrs Goodhew.

Mrs Goodhew told the Asia Pacific Forum on Quality Improvement in Healthcare in Auckland that this is why the Government tasked the Health Quality and Safety Commission with developing the Quality and Safety Markers.

“The Quality and Safety Markers will track progress in reducing harm caused to patients in the areas of infection, surgery, medication and falls. Errors in these areas are major causes of serious and sentinel events in the health sector. The initial focus will be on harm caused in hospital settings,” said Mrs Goodhew.

“The Commission is currently working with clinicians to finalise the Quality and Safety Markers, with the first regular progress report planned to be distributed to DHBs and made public in mid-2013. The success of the Government’s six National Health Targets demonstrates the effectiveness of regular public reporting on progress in this way.”

The national patient safety campaign will aim to reduce patient harm by raising awareness and increasing knowledge, skills and use of interventions known to improve patient safety.

“Simple changes can lead to big improvements in safety. For example, proper hand washing greatly reduces the risk of patient infections. Checking patients’ footwear for good fit, non-slip soles and safe laces reduces the risk of falling. Using a surgical checklist that includes patient identity, operation side and site and labelling of specimens for testing reduces the risk of surgical error,” said Mrs Goodhew.

The campaign will be led and coordinated by the Health Quality & Safety Commission with local and regional leadership from the sector. Further information can be found at [www.hqsc.govt.nz](http://www.hqsc.govt.nz).
