Queenstown’s reputation as a world-class tourist destination is about to be enhanced even further, Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams says.

Ms Adams joined ultra-fast broadband (UFB) partner Chorus at an event in Queenstown this morning to mark the start of work to build a UFB network in the city.

“Rolling out UFB in Queenstown will meet a growing demand for connectivity by businesses, schools, health providers, residents and tourists,” Ms Adams says.

“Tourism plays a significant role in New Zealand’s economy. That means businesses need to have first-rate infrastructure to be able to connect and interact with their global customer base.

“UFB will also make it easier for tourists to stay in touch with their family and friends, and give them the ability to quickly upload photos and video from their holiday in Queenstown.”

By July next year, more than 2000 customers, as well as three schools, are expected to already be covered by the fibre network in Queenstown.

The schools are:

- Wakatipu High School
- St Joseph's School, and
- Queenstown Primary School

The Government’s UFB initiative involves an investment of $1.35 billion – alongside private sector funding – to roll out fibre to schools, hospitals, and 90 per cent of businesses by 2016, and links to homes and remaining businesses completed by 2019.

“UFB will change the way our doctors and hospitals deliver care and treatment to patients, encourage greater innovation, and create more jobs with higher incomes.”
