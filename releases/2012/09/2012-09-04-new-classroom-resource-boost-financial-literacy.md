Education Minister Hekia Parata today launched a new education resource at Raroa Normal Intermediate in Johnsonville, aimed at helping students boost their financial skills.

‘*Taking Part in Economic Communities’*  aims to help teach learners about financial decision making.

“Given the current economic climate this has never been more important,’’ says Ms Parata.

“Young people today face some really complex financial decisions. That is why it is so encouraging to see schools like Raroa Normal Intermediate, where financial literacy is part of the curriculum, and it’s important we make resources like the one being launched today available to our learners.”

The resource is the result of a public/private collaboration between the Ministry of Education, the Commission for Financial Literacy and Retirement Income and the Tindall Foundation.

The launch is one of a number of activities being held during this week’s Money Week.

The ‘*Taking Part in Economic Communities’* teaching resource will be published online on October 19 and distributed to schools by the end of November.
