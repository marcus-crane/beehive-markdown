Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew was saddened to hear of the passing of Jacqui Te Kani last night.

“Jacqui devoted her life to helping and leading others. She made an incredible contribution across many sectors, to individuals and to communities in New Zealand,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“Jacqui worked tirelessly to make improvements to the lives of women, and especially Māori women. She will be greatly missed.

“Among the many positions she held and contributions she made, Jacqui was currently General Manager of the Māori Women’s Welfare League and also a past National President of the League. Over her time at the League, Jacqui worked closely with the Ministry of Women’s Affairs.

“Our thoughts go out to Jacqui’s whānau and friends and to the Māori Women’s Welfare League at this time.”
