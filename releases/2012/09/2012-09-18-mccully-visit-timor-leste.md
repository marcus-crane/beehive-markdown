Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully will visit Timor-Leste this week to meet President Taur Matan Ruak, Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao and Foreign Minister Jose Luis Guterres.

“New Zealand has made a significant contribution over the past 12 years to Timor-Leste’s emergence as an independent nation and a valued partner in our region,” Mr McCully says.

“While the International Stabilisation Force and UN Mission will withdraw at the end of the year, New Zealand’s commitment to Timor-Leste’s development and security will continue.

“We are contributing $14.5 million over four years to a community policing programme to support the Timor-Leste National Police as they take over responsibility from the UN-led force.”

During his two-day visit, Mr McCully will sign a three-year, $22 million Strategic Framework for Development, focusing on private sector investment, education and training, security and justice.

He will be accompanied to Timor-Leste by a small business mission.
