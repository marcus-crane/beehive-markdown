Small Business Minister John Banks has congratulated Business.govt.nz for winning their category at the NetGuide Web Awards for the second year running.

Business.govt.nz was judged the Best Site for Small Businesses in the 2012 NetGuide Web Awards, which acknowledges New Zealand’s best websites, based on 225,000 votes.

“This deserved award recognises the value Business.govt.nz provides small businesses in New Zealand,” Mr Banks said. 

“It has been a busy twelve months for the site, with the launch of the Mobile Business Toolbox iPad app, the B-Cal business calendar and Business.govt.nz’s ANZ Flying Start Business Plan competition, which attracted more than 750 entries from entrepreneurial New Zealanders.

“Winning this award for two years in a row is a testament to the work the Business.govt.nz team has put in to support small businesses.

“I am confident the site will continue to grow, with several new services, tools and developments underway which will be released in the coming months,” Mr Banks said.

Business.govt.nz was re-launched two years ago and is a first-stop government website for small and medium businesses.

Small and medium-sized business make up 97 per cent of all New Zealand enterprises, account for 31 per cent of all employees and contribute to 40 per cent of the economy’s total output.
