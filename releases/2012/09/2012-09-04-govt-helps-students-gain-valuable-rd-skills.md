Almost 200 undergraduate students will gain valuable work experience in some of New Zealand’s most innovative firms this summer, Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce announced today.

The Government will invest $1.2 million placing undergrads into more than 110 businesses over the summer months to take part in challenging research and development (R&D) work.

“The Government is committed to seeing more businesses doing R&D. It is part of our Business Growth Agenda that puts an emphasis on innovation as a driver for economic growth,” Mr Joyce says.

“The Government’s support can make the difference between businesses picking up a new project or putting it off for a few more months due to a lack of staff or technical knowledge.”

The funding scheme is administered by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and is run every year. Businesses receive up to $7,360 including GST per student they employ – some businesses employ more than one student.

The scheme complements a similar fund for postgraduate students that saw the Government invest $2.1 million in 70 internships earlier this year.

“This is also a great way to encourage young people to choose a career in a technological environment. If we want to lift New Zealand’s economic performance, we need more upcoming talent to go down the path of science and engineering,” Mr Joyce says.
