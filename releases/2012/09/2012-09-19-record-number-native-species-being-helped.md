Record numbers of threatened species are now being actively managed by the Department of Conservation (DOC), thanks in part to a new and world leading system, Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson has announced.

The newly completed Natural Heritage Management System (NHMS) is a long-term initiative that will see our native flora and fauna managed more efficiently.

“As a result of Government investment, the NHMS and the hard work of DOC staff around the country, we expect 336 threatened native species will benefit from active DOC recovery programmes this year – the most ever,” Ms Wilkinson says.

“Under this Government we have increased the number of actively managed threatened species by 35 per cent. This is great news in the battle to protect New Zealand’s unique biodiversity for future generations.”

“These programmes include efforts to bring species such as kiwi, takahe, kakapo and tuatara back from the brink – but also include a number of lesser known but equally important threatened species.”

“The NHMS will enable us to gather better information, select priorities and goals, and assess the effectiveness of our efforts to help ensure the long term recovery of New Zealand’s threatened species,” Ms Wilkinson says.
