Veterans’ Affairs Minister Nathan Guy has commemorated the first ever New Zealand Malayan Veterans’ Day in Wellington today.

“This memorial day will become an annual event, and a chance to pay tribute to all those who served during these conflicts.

“New Zealand forces from all three branches were involved in the Malayan Emergency from 1948 to1960 and the Confrontation from 1963 to 1966.

“Twenty two New Zealanders paid the ultimate sacrifice and lost their lives in service. Today we remember them and all who served, including those from other nations involved.

“For veterans and their families, this day will help ensure that from now on, their service and sacrifice will be properly commemorated,” says Mr Guy.

A national ceremony has been held at the National War Memorial in Wellington today, attended by the the Governor-General Lieutenant General Rt Hon Sir Jerry Mateparae, Chief of Defence Force Lieutenant General Rhys Jones, veterans of the conflict, and representatives from Malaysia and Singapore.

A march past of veterans also took place on the Parliament Forecourt following the commemorative service.
