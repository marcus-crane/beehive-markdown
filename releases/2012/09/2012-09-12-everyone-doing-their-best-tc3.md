Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says he’s sorry he offended frustrated residents in damaged Christchurch homes with his comments reported in The Press.

“I empathise and sympathise with those people, but I’m also extremely angry at the way some people are characterising the Government as not caring or doing nothing for residents on Technical Category 3 (TC3) land, when we and many others are doing a great deal.

“Hundreds of people in insurance companies, the Earthquake Commission, engineering firms and building firms are doing all they can to provide certainty to the estimated 10,000 residents on TC3 land in Christchurch who will need foundation rebuilds or repairs.

“Land is being assessed, homes are being fixed, and every day clear insurance pathways are being identified.

“I know this is not fast enough from many frustrated residents, but if we make poor decisions in haste because of this pressure then it will still be our fault in the long run.

“No one will thank us for making bad decisions.

“I must rely on the advice of people who are expert in their professions, and I’m doing that.

“I’m sorry people are having to wait, and having to live in uncomfortable conditions – we’re getting on with the job and doing our best to provide enduring certainty for everyone.”
