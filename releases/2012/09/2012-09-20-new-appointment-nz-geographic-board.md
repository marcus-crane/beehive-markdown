Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson today announced the appointment of Garrick Murfitt to the New Zealand Geographic Board, Ngā Pou Taunaha o Aotearoa – New Zealand’s place-naming authority.

“Mr Murfitt brings extensive community and organisational experience to the position, having played a leading role in rural organisations and local government for many years,” Mr Williamson says.

Formerly the Chair of the Manawatu/Whanganui (Horizons) Regional Council, Mr Murfitt was recently awarded a New Zealand Order of Merit for services to local body affairs and was nominated to the Board by Local Government New Zealand.

During his career, Mr Murfitt has been committed to working with Maori communities and has been involved in a number of collaborative initiatives involving local government, iwi and hapu, and government agencies.

“His community experience, knowledge of local government and iwi relations will make him a valuable contributor to the work of the Board," Mr Williamson says.
