Health Minister Tony Ryall believes the government’s health targets have played a key role in the increase in New Zealanders satisfied with the care they receive from public hospitals.

The latest Kiwis Count survey shows improvements in the number of people satisfied with the care they receive from public hospital outpatients’ services, including emergency departments.

“72 per cent of New Zealanders are now satisfied with the care they receive from outpatient services, compared to 69 per cent in 2007,” says Mr Ryall.

“Nearly three quarters of 1,121 New Zealanders surveyed were also happy with their care while staying in a public hospital.

“Since the introduction of the government’s health targets in 2009, we have made significant improvements to health services and more patients are receiving the care they need sooner.

“Our DHBs are employing more doctors and more nurses than ever before. Record numbers of patients are now treated in emergency departments within 6 hours. And there’s a greater focus on preventing illness.

“The health targets have driven improvements in our public hospitals, which is making a real difference to patients’ lives."
