Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain today announced the reappointment of Rt Hon Wyatt Creech as Chair and David McFarlane as Deputy Chair of the Fire Service Commission Board. Rangi Wills has also been appointed as a new Board member.

“Rangi Wills will be succeeding the incumbent member Bob Francis, who has served two full terms on the Board. I am particularly pleased that this appointment will bring Māori representation back to the Board, as Māori are represented strongly in the volunteer fire service.

“I would like to thank Mr Francis for his work, including his significant involvement in the Enlarged Rural Fire Districts project.

“I am also pleased that Rt Hon Wyatt Creech has been appointed for a further term, to provide continuity and allow for succession planning. The reappointment of David McFarlane as Deputy Chair maintains significant Fire Service experience on the Board.

“The stability and experience provided by these two members will be especially important during the process of reviewing and updating the functions and funding of the Fire Service.”
