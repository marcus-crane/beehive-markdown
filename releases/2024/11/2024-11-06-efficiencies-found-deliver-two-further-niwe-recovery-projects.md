Upgrades to Nesbitt’s Dip on State Highway 2 (SH2) and Rototahe on State Highway 35 (SH35) will go ahead as a result of improved efficiencies in the Government’s North Island Weather Event recovery programme, Transport Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Regions in the North Island suffered extensive and devastating damage from Cyclone Gabrielle and the 2023 Auckland Anniversary Floods. As part of Budget 2024, our Government committed $609.25 million for state highway recovery to restore roads back to their previous condition, and in July I announced that $250 million of this would be allocated to the East Coast.

“Work to remedy flooding at SH2 Nesbitt’s Dip and SH35 Rototahe was listed but would only advance into delivery if efficiencies in the programme were found. I’m pleased that with a strong focus on achieving value for money and improving efficiency across the recovery programme, these two important projects can now proceed within existing funding.

“These two sections of highway that connect communities on the East Coast have been closed many times due to flooding, most recently at the end of June. These closures create safety risks for emergency services responding to emergencies, and cause significant disruption for communities, businesses, and the flow of freight and goods.

“To enable people and freight to get where they want to go quickly and safely, crews will raise the height of SH2 Nesbitt’s Dip and SH35 Rototahe above the flood level and improve drainage at both sites. By addressing the root causes of flooding and road closures, NZTA will provide a safer and more reliable route for the region.

“Our Government is committed to ensuring our state highway corridors impacted by the NIWE are returned to the standard that Kiwis need and expect. I look forward to these works progressing and being completed.”
