Former Treasury Secretary Dr Graham Scott has been appointed as chair of the newly established Social Investment Board, alongside a group of highly skilled individuals, Social Investment Minister Nicola Willis says.

The board will advise on the implementation of the social investment approach across the public sector and the work of the Social Investment Agency.

Appointees to the board are: Laura Black, Hon Te Ururoa Flavell, Helen Leahy, Katie Murray, Julie Nelson, Dr Graham Scott (Chair), Debbie Sorensen, Mike Williams and David Woods.

“This board is a very strong line-up, with real grassroots experience, practical knowledge, and the courage to drive significant change in the way public agencies deliver social services,” Nicola Willis says.

“Dr Scott is a skilled chair with extensive experience as a senior public servant and is well-versed in social investment thinking. The board attracted more than 250 applicants and the individuals appointed bring a diverse range of perspectives.

“I’m confident this group has a willingness to challenge the status quo and I am very much looking forward to working with them.

“Despite decades of good intentions, multiple strategies and thousands of contracts, we are not getting enough impact from the Government’s efforts to improve the lives of our most vulnerable. We can do so much better.

“Social investment is about intervening earlier, empowering NGOs to innovate and drive change, and making better use of data to target improved outcomes for people.”
