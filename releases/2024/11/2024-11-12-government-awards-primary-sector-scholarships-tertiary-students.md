The coalition Government has awarded scholarships to six tertiary students as part of efforts to boost on-the-ground support for farmers and growers Agriculture Minister Todd McClay and Associate Agriculture Minister Andrew Hoggard announced today.

“We are reducing the regulatory burden on farmers and growers and providing support to adapt and innovate, this includes funding the On Farm Support Science Scholarships,” Mr McClay says.

“The On Farm Support Science Scholarships help build a knowledgeable advisory sector ready to provide practical, specialized support to our primary industries.”

he scholarships, each valued at $5,000, have been awarded to Lincoln University students Georgia Higinbottom, Ashton Robinson, and Henry Bartrum; Massey University students Mac Williams and Ella Bryan; and Otago University student Georgie Burdon, who are studying agricultural science, veterinary science, science, or commerce.

“These impressive scholarship recipients represent the future of primary industry advisory services, and they’ll play a key role in helping our food and fibre sector thrive,” Associate Agriculture Minister Andrew Hoggard says.

New Zealand’s agriculture sector remains central to the economy, with food and fibre exports generating $53.3 billion in revenue as of June 2024. This initiative is part of the Government’s broader strategy to double export value over the next ten years.
