Minister of Internal Affairs Brooke van Velden has today received the report from phase 1 of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into COVID-19.

“The delivery of the phase 1 report marks the conclusion of phase 1 of the Inquiry. Phase 1 Commissioners Professor Tony Blakely and John Whitehead have now resigned from their roles” says Ms van Velden.

“In June I announced there would be a second phase of the Inquiry into COVID-19, covering outstanding matters of public concern including vaccine mandates and safety as well as the impact on social and economic disruption. Phase 2 will begin gathering evidence from 29 November 2024, and I strongly encourage the public to have their say on the matters in scope of the inquiry by emailing [InquiryintoCOVID-19lessons@dia.govt.nz](mailto:InquiryintoCOVID-19lessons@dia.govt.nz) from tomorrow.”

Both the ACT-National and New Zealand First-National coalition agreements include commitments to expand the Inquiry into COVID-19.

“Grant Illingworth KC is the Chair for phase 2, supported by Commissioners Judy Kavanagh and Anthony Hill who have extensive backgrounds in economics and public health respectively.”

“The terms of reference for phase 2 were influenced by the more than 13,000 submissions from New Zealanders that were received during public consultation on expanding the scope of the Inquiry in February and March of this year. Allowing the public to have a say on the matters covered by the Inquiry was a commitment in the ACT-National coalition agreement.”

“I look forward to seeing the final report of the Royal Commission at the end of phase 2, which is due to me by 26 February 2026.”

The phase 1 report is now publicly available at the Royal Commission’s website. \[https://www.covid19lessons.royalcommission.nz/]
