New rules allowing local communities to take direct action against kina barrens are starting to bear fruit, Oceans and Fisheries Minister Shane Jones says.

“I’ve made kina barrens a priority, which is why I introduced a [new special permit purpose](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/new-tools-announced-tackle-kina-barrens) this year to allow the removal and translocation of kina from areas where there are barrens or the risk of them forming,” Mr Jones says.

“The first special permit to remove excess kina has been approved and will help local restoration efforts in Hauraki Gulf.

“Congratulations to Te Kohuroa Rewilding Initiative for being the first group to be approved. Te Kohuroa Rewilding Initiative has identified kina barren sites in Te Kohuroa/Mathesons Bay to harvest from.

“The community-led initiative is made up of volunteers working with iwi, other organisations and the community to create positive outcomes for their local coastal marine ecosystem.

“This is exactly what the new special permit purpose was designed for. It enables communities to take action by removing excess kina to help restore local marine habitat.

[Te Kohuroa Rewilding Initiative’s](https://www.tekohuroarewilding.org/) first community day for volunteers to assist in kina removal is on Saturday, 16 November.
