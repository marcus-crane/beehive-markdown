Transport Minister Simeon Brown has welcomed news that the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) Board has approved funding towards pre-implementation and early works on the State Highway 1 (SH1) Belfast to Pegasus Motorway and Woodend Bypass Road of National Significance (RoNS).

“Reaching this significant milestone is a reflection of our Government’s commitment to get this critical project back on track to unlock more land for housing in the Waimakariri district and provide more reliable freight connections to key freight hubs and export markets,” Mr Brown says.

“SH1 north of Christchurch provides access to Christchurch CBD, Christchurch International Airport, and Lyttelton Port. It’s a key freight route and an important connector route for commuters and tourists.

“Around 21,500 vehicles use the section of SH1 approaching Woodend each day, with approximately 9 per cent being heavy freight vehicles. With traffic volumes expected to increase by up to 28,000 by 2048, the Canterbury region needs this vital RoNS to support economic growth and get people and freight to where they want to go, quickly and safely.

“This project will remove congestion bottlenecks which will improve travel times by up to 11 minutes during peak times.

“The AA has for years noted that this stretch of existing road is the most dangerous in Canterbury. The Belfast to Pegasus Motorway and Woodend Bypass RoNS will not only help move traffic more efficiently, but it will also build upon the legacy of the RoNS built by the previous National Government, by delivering a much safer route for motorists.

“NZTA is moving at pace to begin procurement, enabling works and construction within the next three years on the first phase of seven RoNS, which includes this important South Island corridor. Moving at pace to build a new generation of RoNS signals our Government’s focus on prioritising investments that reduce travel times, increase productivity and unlock land for housing.”
