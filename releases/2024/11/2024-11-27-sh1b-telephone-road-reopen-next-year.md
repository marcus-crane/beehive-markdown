Transport Minister Simeon Brown has confirmed that State Highway 1B (SH1B) Telephone Road in Waikato will reopen in 2025, following agreement by KiwiRail and the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) on a package of improvements to enable the road and rail crossing to function safely and effectively together.

“Economic growth, productivity, and safety are a priority for the Government, and I’m pleased a pragmatic and cost-effective solution has now been found to enable SH1B Telephone Road to reopen to vehicles and freight,” Mr Brown says.

“SH1B Telephone Road has been closed since April 2022 after repeated instances of low vehicles damaging the railway tracks at the level crossing.

“The proposed improvements will see the road level raised, new escape lanes built and improved signage and road marking. The road surface will be raised by up to 410mm over a distance of 90 metres on Telephone Road north of the rail crossing and on Telephone Road/Holland Road/Marshmeadow Road south of the rail crossing.

“Escape lanes built on the north side of Holland Road, either side of Telephone Road, will ensure longer vehicles heading south do not stack across the rail line as they wait to turn into Holland Road. For vehicles travelling east on Holland Road and wanting to turn left into Telephone Road, the escape lane provides a safe place to wait if access to Telephone Road is blocked by a train.

“NZTA expects to have a confirmed contractor for the works on board before the end January 2025, with construction expected to be completed before mid-2025.

“I want to thank locals who travel through this area for their patience and perseverance while this crossing has been closed. I am pleased that NZTA and KiwiRail have found a sensible solution as part of our plan to get people to where they want to go quickly and safely. I look forward to work being completed and the road open in the first half of 2025.”
