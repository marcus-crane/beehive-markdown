The new 110km/h speed limit on the Kāpiti Expressway Road of National Significance (RoNS) will come into effect on 13 November 2024, more than two weeks earlier than expected, Transport Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Boosting economic growth and productivity is a priority for the Government. The new 110km/h speed limit will help to reduce travel times, increase efficiency, and get people and freight where they want to go quickly and safely.

“The Mackays to Peka Peka and Peka Peka to Ōtaki RoNS, which make up the Kāpiti Expressway, were built by National and were designed and constructed to a high safety standard. Since these roads opened, no one has died in a crash.

“Earlier this year, the NZ Transport Agency consulted with New Zealanders on the proposed speed limit increase, with 93 per cent of submitters supporting the proposed 110km/h speed limit.

“This is all part of this Government’s plan to help Kiwis get where they need to go quickly and safely by reducing travel times and increasing productivity on our transport network. We are now delivering on these commitments.”

The new speed limit of 110km/h on the Kāpiti Expressway comes into effect on 13 November 2024 and will apply to 24.5km of the state highway, from north of the Poplar Avenue at Raumati interchange to south of the Ōtaki northern interchange.
