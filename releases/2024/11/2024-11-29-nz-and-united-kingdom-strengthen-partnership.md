New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters and United Kingdom Foreign Secretary David Lammy held the inaugural annual New Zealand-United Kingdom Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue today in London.

“The United Kingdom is our oldest, and one of our closest and most trusted partners,” Mr Peters says.

“While we are separated by vast distance, our close cultural links and shared history and values enable us to achieve more together in the world.

”The discussion at the Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue was wide-ranging - reflecting the breadth and depth of the contemporary bilateral relationship, and the mutual desire to do more together. New Zealand-UK collaboration extends from the joint training of Ukrainian troops in the UK to scientific collaboration, including early earthquake detection in the Pacific using quantum technology, and removing space debris and satellite refuelling”.

Foreign Secretary David Lammy says: "I welcome this valuable opportunity to discuss the enduring strength and relevance of the UK-New Zealand partnership with Foreign Minister Peters. Our shared values and strategic outlook make us natural partners in addressing global challenges, from supporting Ukraine to tackling climate change.

“The concrete steps we've taken today show how our relationship continues to deliver practical benefits for both our nations and the wider world."

The Ministers agreed to increase cooperation in a number of areas including: -

- Signing an Antarctic Cooperation Statement, committing to enhanced environmental and science cooperation.
- New Zealand endorsement of the United Kingdom-led Call to Action against the “shadow fleet” engaged in sanctions circumvention by carrying Russian oil and gas.
- Combined funding of $51m to TIDES, a fund designed to “crowd in” public and private renewable energy investment for Pacific island countries.
- Agreement to develop a Memorandum of Understanding on security, science and technology, including joint research on national security and counter-terrorism.
- Greater collaboration between our national customs agencies to implement preventative measures against child sexual exploitation material passing across our borders.
- Continued promotion of the opportunities provided by the “gold standard” NZ-UK Free Trade Agreement, which has seen annual two-way trade increase by almost 10 percent since entry-into-force. Ministers also welcomed expanding cooperation to strengthen Pacific resilience in line with the Blue Pacific principles. New Zealand also welcomed new UK funding, in collaboration with the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme and New Zealand, to improve Pacific Island livelihoods and resilience by reducing the impact of invasive species on their natural and agricultural ecosystems.
