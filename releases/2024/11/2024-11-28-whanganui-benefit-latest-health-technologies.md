Today’s opening of a new MRI facility at Whanganui Hospital is the latest in a number of health infrastructure projects designed to improve healthcare services for the people of Whanganui and surrounding districts, says Minister of Health Dr Shane Reti.

“I’m really pleased to have been able to deliver on this newly-built MRI suite, through an investment of $3.5 million to ensure more efficient patient flow and reduced wait times for patients,” Dr Reti says.

“The new MRI machine will employ more modern technology than its predecessor, delivering faster scanning, better image quality and better diagnostic capabilities.

“It will support Whanganui Hospital to make improvements toward our health targets.

“While there is more work to do to reduce waiting times for cancer treatment, first assessments and elective treatments for all New Zealanders, we are starting to make real in-roads thanks to focus and accountability driven by the health targets.

“That’s why the opening of this latest MRI facility is so exciting as it helps enable those targets.

“It is further proof that the bold, ambitious goals that we set for ourselves as a Government are starting to pay off.

“Further projects currently underway at Whanganui Hospital include the integrated Allied Health and Therapies space which will be an additional significant benefit to patients requiring a multi-disciplinary approach to their health needs,” says Dr Reti.

The old MRI machine will also remain in operation until late January before being decommissioned, enabling the reduction of waiting lists across both the Whanganui and neighbouring MidCentral Districts.
