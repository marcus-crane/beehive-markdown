New legislation for the Police vetting service to ensure greater clarity, consistency, and efficiency for Police and users of the service, has passed its first reading in Parliament today. 

Each year Police provides over 650,000 vets to support New Zealand’s public safety and national security. 

“The vetting service that Police provide is of significant value to users of the service and Kiwis across New Zealand – particularly those working with vulnerable people,” says Mr Mitchell. 

“This Bill will amend the Policing Act to create a formalised framework, giving Police the legal guidance and protection they need to keep Kiwi’s safe.

“The changes will clarify the information considered, and the tests Police applies before releasing information. This will assist vetting users to better understand what to expect when engaging with the Police vetting service. 

“The legislation will also enable Police to deliver future service improvements that could enhance public safety and increase the efficiency of the vetting service.

“Providing indemnity to Police when sharing information is also a feature of the Bill. This will enable vetting services to err on the side of sharing information, which is critical for keeping vulnerable Kiwis including children, safe. Transparency is key when it comes to public safety.”  

This new legislation gives action to a recommendation contained in a 2016 joint review undertaken by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner and the Independent Police Conduct Authority.
