The latest Conservation Board appointments will help to strengthen environmental efforts across Aotearoa New Zealand, Conservation Minister Tama Potaka says.

Mr Potaka today announced 64 appointments to the country’s 14 Conservation Boards.

“Conservation Boards play a vital role as liaison between DOC with their regions, making their community’s voice heard on conservation issues,” Mr Potaka says.

“The boards are independent bodies that empower local communities and iwi to contribute to the management of conservation areas. Boards provide a voice for local concerns to gain traction in DOC’s work, and on a national level where required.

"’Nau mai haere mai’ to those members stepping up for the first time, ‘hoki mai’ to those returning, and ‘ngā mihi’ to all the outgoing representatives for their important contributions to conservation mahi in their regions.

“There were 394 applications for the public Conservation Board positions in this round, and the level of community interest in conservation management is heartwarming.

“The variety of skills and qualities the appointees bring fills me with hope that together we can make a real difference for our native species and ecosystems.”

Conservation Board appointments took effect from 1 November 2024.
