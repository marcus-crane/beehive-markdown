Five new Aquaculture Settlement Areas will help ensure Ngāi Tahu shares in the opportunities aquaculture offers for Southland’s economy, Oceans and Fisheries Minister Shane Jones says.

“The Aquaculture Settlement Areas (ASAs) I’m announcing today set aside space so the Crown and Ngāi Tahu can assess their potential for aquaculture development. They make up a collective 8787ha and include areas suitable for salmon, mussel, and seaweed farming,” Mr Jones says.

They are offshore from Port Pegasus, Rarotoka South, Rarotoka North, Ruapuke, and Port Adventure.

“The Coalition Government has recognised aquaculture’s enormous potential and made its development a priority. We’ve set an ambitious goal for aquaculture in New Zealand, aiming for it to be a $3 billion industry by 2035.”

Mr Jones says there is demand internationally for New Zealand’s aquaculture products and he is committed to maximising its growth.

“That means cutting away red tape and roadblocks so the industry can better contribute to our export-led recovery and the rebuilding of New Zealand’s economy. Making space for this kind of exploration with Ngāi Tahu today will bring the certainty needed for jobs, opportunities and export dollars tomorrow.”

All current fishing within the ASAs, whether recreational, commercial or customary, will be allowed to continue while this exploration takes place.

“Any space Ngāi Tahu wants to take forward and develop into aquaculture ventures will still be subject to the resource consent process,” Mr Jones says.

ASAs were established in 2004 as part of legislation that delivers iwi 20 percent of new aquaculture space created and forecast.
