Foreign Minister Winston Peters today announced new sanctions in response to Russia’s ongoing illegal invasion of Ukraine – and joined partners in a Call to Action on sanctions-evading ‘shadow fleet’ activities.

“These new sanctions respond to recent findings by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons that illegal Riot Control Agents are being used on the frontlines in Ukraine.  This is in line with reports that we have been hearing throughout the year that Russia is using chemical weapons on the battlefield in clear breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention,” Mr Peters says.

The new sanctions package also targets Iranians involved in the supply of ballistic missiles and drones to Russia, as well as Russian’s facilitating this trade.

“Transfers of Iranian weaponry facilitates Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine. New Zealand condemns those who are providing support.

“New Zealand is part of a wider international sanctions effort, condemning and seeking to hold accountable those supporting Russia’s illegal actions,” Mr Peters says.

Since the Russia Sanctions Act entered into force in March 2022, New Zealand has imposed sanctions on more than 1,700 individuals and entities, along with a range of trade measures. These new sanctions target seven individuals and five entities.

New Zealand has deep concerns about the rise in Russian and DPRK-related 'shadow fleet’ activity. This illegal maritime traffic is a significant threat to all countries: in addition to seeking to bypass sanctions, shadow fleet vessels have a pattern of ignoring maritime safety and environmental rules, avoiding insurance costs, and engaging in other unlawful actions.

Alongside Australia, New Zealand endorses the UK-initiated Call to Action on the Shadow Fleet.  The Call to Action promotes compliance with international standards for maritime safety, environmental protection, and insurance.
