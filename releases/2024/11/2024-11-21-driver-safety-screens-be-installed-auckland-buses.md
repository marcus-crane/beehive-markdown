Transport Minister Simeon Brown has welcomed news from the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) that bus driver protection screens will be installed across Auckland’s bus fleet by 2026.

“The Government is committed to improving the safety of working environments for bus drivers, and Budget 2024 allocated $15 million of Crown funding over two years to do just that,” Mr Brown says.

“The NZ Transport Agency (NZTA), who administers the funding on behalf of the Government, has now concluded assessments on the first round of nine bids from Public Transport Authorities (PTAs) for funding across Auckland, Greater Wellington, Nelson-Tasman, and Hawke’s Bay.

“Today, I am pleased to confirm that an agreement has been reached to approve a bid for funding to retrofit full length driver screens for 80 percent of Auckland Transport’s bus fleet by 2026, or approximately 1,100 buses.

“Bus drivers do an important job in our communities and the Government is committed to helping keep them safe as they go about their work. These hardworking New Zealanders often work with little to separate them from their passengers. Safety screens will provide protection and ensure our service continue to run smoothly and safely.

“In addition, NZTA is also considering funding to deliver driver toilet facilities and an on-board live CCTV trial for 30 buses, with results of this trial informing how Auckland Transport will roll out further CCTV cameras in future.

“I look forward to these initiatives being delivered as soon as possible, and other funding bids to be confirmed in due course once final agreements are made.”
