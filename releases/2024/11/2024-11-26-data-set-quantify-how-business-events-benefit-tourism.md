Today the Minister for Tourism and Hospitality Matt Doocey announced Business Events Industry Aotearoa (BEIA) will be the first recipient of the Tourism Data Partnership Fund at the industry body’s annual conference.

“Understanding how business events contribute to New Zealand’s economy will help regional tourism organisations to make critical decisions and better tell their story for business events,” Mr Doocey says.

“The funding announced today allows BEIA to provide research that will analyse the economic impact of multiday business events, such as by measuring attendees’ personal expenditure and the impact from extending their stays in the region or in New Zealand.

“Between March and November 83 per cent of international business delegates arrived in New Zealand during the off-peak period, this shows that business events are well placed to grow the value of the tourism sector.

“Having represented the industry for almost 50 years now, BEIA is in an excellent position to source and deliver the high-quality data needed to provide the sector with confidence and certainty.

“This data will be important for making informed decisions that will shape the future of our visitor economy.

“I am excited to see what insights BEIA’s research, as well as other initiatives from the Tourism Data Leadership Group will provide.”

The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment is processing further applications for the Tourism Data Partnership Fund. The outcomes of the other applications will be announced in due course.
