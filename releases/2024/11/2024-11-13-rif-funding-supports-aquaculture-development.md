The Coalition Government is backing the development of an aquaculture centre of excellence in Southland with an investment of $2.2 million, Regional Development Minister Shane Jones says.

South Island Industrial Fund Ltd will use the Regional Infrastructure Fund (RIF) loan towards its $6.3m project to upgrade infrastructure at the Ocean Beach site near Bluff. The upgrades will enable expansion to take place at the site.

Ocean Beach, the site of a former freezing works, aims to increase its shared services for more businesses; expand its farming pods, build training and research facilities, accommodation for the workforce and tourism facilities.

“When fully operational, Ocean Beach will provide emerging aquaculture businesses with the infrastructure they need to produce, distribute and export their products, teach the skills needed in the sector and provide a place to invest in aquaculture,” Mr Jones says.

“Ocean Beach is the gateway to Bluff. Its clear waters, cool climate, and thousands of kilometres of coastline will help make it a world-class aquaculture centre of excellence and the largest of its kind in New Zealand.”

“This project met the strict criteria we have put in place for the RIF through its focus on enabling infrastructure. Aquaculture is a key priority for Southland and backing it through the RIF supports the Coalition Government’s goal to reach $3 billion in sales by 2035.

Mr Jones announced the funding at Ocean Beach today. He is in Southland for the Southland Regional Growth Summit tomorrow, and having conversations with iwi representatives, local government, business leaders and sector organisations.

“The summits have been invaluable for getting conversations going about regional priorities, leveraging investments and strategies and finding out where our priorities align so we can work together to maximise our investments for the good of a region.”
