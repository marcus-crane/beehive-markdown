A two-year ban on the take of kuku/mussels from Ōhiwa Harbour in eastern Bay of Plenty will support local efforts to restore mussel beds in the area, Oceans and Fisheries Minister Shane Jones says.

Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Awa requested the closure, Te rāhui kuku ki tua o Kanawa, to support its traditional rāhui and an area of the harbour where mussel beds have been reseeded.

“This closure will ensure the mussels have the best opportunity to mature, reproduce, and contribute to a bigger population in the harbour,” Mr Jones says.

Kuku/mussels are a taonga species for iwi that play a pivotal role in maintaining the ecological balance and mauri of Ōhiwa Harbour.

“I congratulate Ngāti Awa and the local community for their ongoing mahi and commitment to restoring wild mussels in their harbour. This important work will help ensure the area has healthy mussel populations to be enjoyed by future generations.”

The 0.1 sq km closure comes into force today and is enforceable by Fishery Officers.

More information on the temporary closure, including a map of the closed area, cane found on the [Fisheries New Zealand website](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/fishing-aquaculture/maori-customary-fishing/customary-fisheries-management-areas-rules-and-maps/).
