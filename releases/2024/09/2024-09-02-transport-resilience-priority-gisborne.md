A record $255 million for transport investment in Gisborne through the 2024-27 National Land Transport Programme (NLTP) will support economic growth and restore the cyclone-damaged network, Transport Minister Simeon Brown says.

“With $255 million of investment over the next three years, we are committed to making sure that every transport dollar is spent wisely on the projects and services that Gisborne needs.

“The roading network in Gisborne is extremely vulnerable, with limited or no alternative routes when SH2 and SH35 are impacted. The growing risk of severe weather brings with it a greater need for better connections which can withstand heavy rain.

"The investment planned in Gisborne will be focused on fixing damage caused to the roading network by Cyclone Gabrielle and undertaking much needed maintenance work. Rebuild options are also under investigation.

“Recovery works are underway across the region and the Transport Rebuild East Coast Alliance will work at SH35 Mangahauini Gorge to restore and protect this critical highway which sustained major damage. Work is also underway to design a permanent replacement for SH35 Hikuwai Bridge for the East Coast community.

“We're also increasing resilience and safety on Gisborne’s existing roads by investing over $230 million on maintenance and pothole prevention on the region’s state highways and local roads. This includes resealing and rehabilitation works on 217 kilometres of state highway to prevent pesky potholes from forming in the first place.”
