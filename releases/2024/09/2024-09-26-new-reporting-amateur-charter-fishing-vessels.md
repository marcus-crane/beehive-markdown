A proposed new electronic reporting system will make it simpler for amateur charter vessels to record and report fish catch information, Oceans and Fisheries Minister Shane Jones says.

“The new digital reporting, via an app, will replace the paper-based system which is out of date and slow,” Mr Jones says.

“The new system will be a more efficient and effective method for these vessels to record and report their catch. There won’t be any additional reporting and it will bring amateur charter vessel catch reporting in line with the way commercial fishers provide catch information,” Mr Jones says. 

“Electronic catch reporting means faster and more accurate information to support greater sustainability of our fisheries. This is an example of how technology can bring better outcomes for both fisheries management and those who earn a living from the seafood industry.

“My officials are talking with amateur charter vessel operators to seek their feedback and fine-tune the changes to make sure they are practical and effective,” Mr Jones says.

The new system has been developed by eCatch, which is the major provider of technology used by commercial fishers to report their catch to Fisheries New Zealand.

Following consultation, eCatch will work with amateur charter vessel operators to ensure a smooth transition to the new system which is expected to come into effect on 1 November. There will be a six-week transition period for operators in which the old reporting method can still be used.

Amateur charter vessel operators those paid for providing a vessel and guide services for recreational fishers. They are required to register with Fisheries New Zealand and must report what is caught on their fishing trips. There are currently around 190 such operators in New Zealand.
