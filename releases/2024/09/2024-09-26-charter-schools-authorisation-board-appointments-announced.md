Associate Education Minister David Seymour has today announced his appointments to the new statutory Charter Schools Authorisation Board. 

Leading Kiwi educator Justine Mahon has been appointed as Chair of the Board. She is joined by Board members Catherine Isaac, Neil Paviour-Smith, Professor Elizabeth Rata, Rōpata Taylor, Dee-Ann Wolferstan and Doran Wyatt. 

“The Board is an integral part of the new charter school model. It is responsible for approving new charter schools, overseeing performance, and intervening where charter schools are not meeting their contracted performance outcomes,” says Mr Seymour. 

“The Board is a mix of recognised leaders and innovators across relevant areas including education, governance, leadership, performance management and financial management. Their collective depth of knowledge and experience will be crucial in ensuring the new charter school model is a success.   

“I would like to welcome the new Board. They will begin approving new charter schools to open in Term 1 2025. 

“It’s great that some Board members bring a deep working knowledge of the charter school model and have been closely involved in its development. 

“Five of the members were on the Charter Schools | Kura Hourua Establishment Board, appointed in April this year. I’d like to thank Justine, Neil, Elizabeth, Rōpata and Doran for the sound advice they have provided to me on many aspects of the model’s design and implementation. 

“I look forward to working with all the Board members as they begin their terms, and we start to see charter schools opening and lifting learning outcomes for children.”
