A record $3.3 billion of transport investment in Greater Wellington through the 2024-27 National Land Transport Programme (NLTP) will increase productivity and reduce travel times, Transport Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Delivering infrastructure to increase productivity and economic growth is a priority for our Government. We're focused on delivering transport projects in Wellington that deliver reliability for commuters, benefit businesses, and support economic growth. Projects must also demonstrate value for money.

“Our Government is committed to making sure that every transport dollar is spent wisely on the projects and services that Wellingtonians need. Public transport needs to be reliable, and roads need to be maintained to a high standard. With this $3.3 billion investment in Wellington’s transport network over the next three years, that is exactly what we are delivering.”

The NLTP will deliver a significant pipeline of transport infrastructure for Wellington to reduce congestion and enable Wellingtonians to get to where they want to go, quickly and safely.

- Prioritising two new Roads of National Significance (RoNS) – the Petone to Grenada Link Road and Cross Valley Link, and improvements to SH1 from the CBD to the airport, which will include a second Mt Victoria Tunnel and upgrades to the Basin Reserve.
- New passenger trains and line upgrades to improve commuter services to the Wairarapa and Palmerston North.
- Progressing two Roads of Regional Significance – the SH2 Melling transport improvements to provide safer and more efficient access to central Lower Hutt and completing stage 2 of the safety improvements on SH58.
- Additional resilience and safety improvements on SH1 Ngauranga Gorge and SH2 Hutt Valley.

“Wellington has faced significant transport challenges and non-delivery in recent years, with the previous government’s Let’s Get Wellington Moving programme only delivering speed bumps, a pedestrian crossing, and a roundabout.

“Wellingtonians expect central and local government to be focused on delivering the basics brilliantly – delivering new RoNS to reduce crippling congestion, fixing and preventing the record number of potholes on our roads, and increasing travel choices with a reliable public transport network.

“We campaigned on progressing the Petone to Grenada Link Road and Cross Valley Link to unlock land for much needed housing. The additional tunnel and upgrades to the Basin Reserve will provide a total of four lanes to the planes, connecting the city and Wellington’s eastern suburbs, and greatly reducing gridlock in Wellington.

“Delivering reliable, effective, and efficient public transport is a priority for our Government. The Lower North Island Rail Integrated Mobility Programme will improve service reliability, provide more travel choices for commuters, and reduce congestion on our roads.

“Over $660 million will be invested on maintenance and pothole prevention to ensure the region’s state highways and local roads return to the safe and reliable standard motorists expect. This includes resealing and rehabilitation works on 138 kilometres of state highway to prevent pesky potholes from forming in the first place.”
