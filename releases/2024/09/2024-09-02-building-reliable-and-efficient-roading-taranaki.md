A record $808 million for transport investment in Taranaki through the 2024-27 National Land Transport Programme (NLTP) will support economic growth and productivity, Transport Minister Simeon Brown says. 

“Taranaki’s roads carry a high volume of freight from primary industries and it’s critical we maintain efficient connections across the region to keep goods moving to markets, across the country and abroad.  

“The Government is committed to making sure that every transport dollar is spent wisely on the projects and services that Kiwis need. For Taranaki, this means building and maintaining roads to a high standard, and that is exactly what we are delivering. 

“We are delivering on our commitment to tackle and prevent potholes on state highways and local roads throughout the region by investing over $350 million on maintenance and pothole prevention. This includes resealing and rehabilitation works on 319 kilometres of state highway to prevent pesky potholes from forming in the first place. 

“The people of Taranaki want potholes fixed and their roads properly maintained, and this record investment in maintenance and pothole prevention will enable roading contractors to have a clear pipeline of work that delivers real results across the region.   

“Major works to completely seal the length of the Forgotten Highway SH43, which is New Zealand’s oldest heritage trail and attracts tourists to the region, will also continue to improve safety along the route and support the Taranaki’s economic development.  

“Our Government will progress work on the Mt Messenger Bypass during the next three years to remove a steep, narrow, and winding section of SH3, and on the Waitara to Bell Block section of SH3 to make this critical highway safer and unlock housing growth. 

“We will also undertake an end-of-life replacement for SH3 Mangapepeki No.2 Culvert and are continuing to invest across the region to strengthen the network so that people and freight can get to where they want to go, quickly and safely.”
