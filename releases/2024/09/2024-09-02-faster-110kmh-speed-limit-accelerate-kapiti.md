A new 110km/h speed limit for the Kāpiti Expressway Road of National Significance (RoNS) has been approved to reduce travel times for Kiwis travelling in and out of Wellington, Transport Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Boosting economic growth and productivity is a key part of the Government’s plan to rebuild the economy. Today’s confirmation of a 110km/h speed limit on this key RoNS will result in reduced travel times and increased efficiency on the network.

“The Mackays to Peka Peka and Peka Peka to Ōtaki RoNS, which make up the Kāpiti Expressway, were started by the previous National Government and were designed and constructed to a high safety standard. Since these roads opened, no one has died in a crash.

“We know how critical these connections are for motorists and freight operators, and we’re committed to ensuring that this state highway enables people to get to where they want to go, quickly and safely.

“The NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) publicly consulted on the proposed speed limit increase, with 93 per cent of the 3,313 submissions received in support of the new 110km/h speed limit.

“Kiwis overwhelmingly supported our Government’s Accelerate NZ plan at the election to grow the economy, reduce travel times and increase productivity on our transport network. We are now delivering on these commitments.”

NZTA has today opened public consultation on three new proposals for 110km/h speed limits on expressways in New Zealand.

“At the same time Kāpiti residents and Wellingtonians welcome news of a 110km/h speed limit on the Kāpiti Expressway, consultation has now opened on proposed 110km/h speed limits for the Northern Gateway Toll Road, Puhoi to Warkworth RoNS, and the Christchurch Southern Motorway RoNS.”

The new speed limit of 110km/h on the Kāpiti Expressway will apply to 24.5 km of the state highway, from north of the Poplar Avenue at Raumati interchange to south of the Ōtaki northern interchange and is expected to be operational by the end of November 2024.
