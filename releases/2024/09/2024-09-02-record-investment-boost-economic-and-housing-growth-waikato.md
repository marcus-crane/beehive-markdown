A record $1.9 billion for transport investment in the Waikato through the 2024-27 National Land Transport Programme (NLTP) will create a more efficient, safe, and resilient roading network that supports economic growth and productivity, Transport Minister Simeon Brown says.

“With almost a third of the country’s freight travelling into, out of, and through the Waikato, we’re focused on delivering for this region to grow our economy.

“Our Government is committed to making sure that every transport dollar is spent wisely on the projects and services that Kiwis need. For the Waikato, this means building and maintaining the road network to a high standard, and with this $1.9 billion investment, this is exactly what we are delivering for the region.

“The Waikato’s road network is critical to enabling freight to travel around the North Island, which is why we’re delivering on our commitment to build two new Roads of National Significance in the Waikato – SH1 Cambridge to Piarere and the Hamilton Southern Links project to unlock land for thousands of houses in New Zealand’s fastest growing city.

“SH1 Cambridge to Piarere is a critical project that was recklessly cancelled under the previous government. Our Government is getting this project back on track to reduce travel times and improve safety for motorists and freight travelling through the Waikato.

“We are serious about tackling and preventing the record number of potholes on our roads. That’s why a record $1.2 billion will be invested on maintenance and pothole prevention to ensure the region’s state highways and local roads return to the safe and reliable standard motorists expect. This includes resealing and rehabilitation works on 796 kilometres of state highway to prevent pesky potholes from forming in the first place.

“Another key focus in the Waikato region is to the replacement of several bridges. We are delivering a new two-lane SH25 Pepe Stream Bridge in Tairua, and replacing the SH25 Ramarama Stream Bridge and SH27 Ohinekaua Stream Bridge.”
