A record $1.9 billion for transport investment in the Bay of Plenty through the 2024-27 National Land Transport Programme (NLTP) will boost economic growth and unlock land for thousands of houses, Transport Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Transport is a critical enabler for economic growth and productivity in the Bay of Plenty. Over the next three years, this investment will deliver critical infrastructure that reduces travel times for motorists and freight travelling to the Port of Tauranga, along with supporting population growth in the rapidly growing Western Bay of Plenty.

“We’re committed to making sure that every dollar is spent wisely on the projects and services that are needed in the Bay of Plenty. This region needs roads built and maintained to a high standard, and that is exactly what we are delivering.”

The Government is progressing three Roads of National Significance (RoNS) in the Bay of Plenty to increase productivity and unlock housing growth.

“We are investigating upgrades to SH29 Tauriko West connections, replacing the SH29 Omanawa Bridge, and progressing work across two stages for the Takitimu North Link. Stage one will connect Tauranga and Te Puna, and stage two will extend the project to Ōmokoroa with a new four-lane highway.

“With parts of the Bay of Plenty vulnerable to severe weather events, the NLTP will deliver resilience improvements to targeted parts of the region’s roading network. As part of this, investigations will begin into options to improve resilience along SH2 Awakeri to Ōpōtiki where there are currently limited local road detours.

“We’re also developing options to strengthen connections on SH2 Waioeka Gorge between the East Coast and the Eastern Bay of Plenty. This project will be prioritised as part of the NLTP’s cyclone rebuild activities.

“In Tauranga, the Government is also investing in improvements to Welcome Bay Road, Turret Road, and 15th Avenue to Taktimu Drive. These projects will improve efficiency on the local road network and reduce congestion for motorists.

“Over $640 million will be invested on maintenance and pothole prevention to ensure the region’s state highways and local roads return to the safe and reliable standard motorists expect. This includes resealing and rehabilitation works on 349 kilometres of state highway to prevent pesky potholes from forming in the first place.”
