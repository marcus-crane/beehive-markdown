Motorists and freight will now drive through a new roundabout at the SH1/SH29 intersection at Piarere, marking a major milestone for one of the Government’s Roads of Regional Significance that will improve safety and reliability for motorists and freight using this strategic corridor, Transport Minister Simeon Brown says.

“The Government is committed to delivering infrastructure that boosts economic growth, reduces congestion, and creates a safer and more reliable transport network,” Mr Brown says.

"Great progress has been made on the construction of this 60-metre-wide roundabout since we kicked off construction in January this year to improve safety and wait times for people travelling through the Waikato.

“While construction on the roundabout continues, the roundabout has today opened with two temporary approaches now in action.

“SH1 and SH29 are strategically important to the upper North Island and this milestone will come as welcomed news for the more than 2,500 heavy commercial vehicles and 25,000 cars that travel through this pinch point every day.”

The roundabout has been strategically designed to connect into a new Road of National Significance (RoNS) between Cambridge and Piarere.

“Our Government is prioritising a four-lane upgrade of SH1 from Cambridge to Piarere, a critical RoNS that was put on hold under the previous government. Reviving this upgrade will enable Kiwis and freight get where they want to go quickly and safely, supporting economic growth and boosting productivity.”
