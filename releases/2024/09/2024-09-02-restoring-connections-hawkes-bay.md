A record $657 million for transport investment in the Hawke’s Bay through the 2024-27 National Land Transport Programme (NLTP) will support recovery from cyclone damage and build greater resilience into the network to support economic growth and productivity, Transport Minister Simeon Brown says.

“We are committed to making sure that every dollar is spent wisely on the projects and services that Kiwis need. For Hawke’s Bay, this means repairing, rebuilding, and maintaining the region’s road network to a high standard, and that is exactly what we are delivering.

“Key state highways have already re-opened and there are short-term measures in place to ensure the region keeps moving, but there is still more to do. The Government is focusing investment on areas with significant landslides, bridge repairs, and drainage issues to build greater resilience into our transport infrastructure.”

The Government is progressing the SH2 Hawke’s Bay Expressway as one of its first Roads of National Significance to begin procurement, enabling works and construction in the next three years.

“We are committed to four-laning the SH2 Hawke’s Bay Expressway as a new Road of National Significance to reduce travel times and enable people and freight to get to where they want to go, quickly and safely. This project will improve resilience for the region following Cyclone Gabrielle, when the Expressway became a critical connection when other roads were closed.

“Over the next three years, planning, design, and construction will start on the first stage of the Hawke’s Bay Expressway, between Taradale Road and Pākowhai/Links Road. This will reduce travel times for motorists and freight on the most congested section of the expressway.

“The Manawatū Tararua Highway, a new and important connection between Manawatū and Hawke’s Bay, will be completed in this NLTP period providing a new efficient freight route to get goods to market and support economic growth.

“NZTA will continue to prioritise support for the Transport Rebuild East Coast Alliance to progress work across the state highway and rail network. Options will be investigated for SH2 Waikare Gorge, SH5 Napier to Taupō, SH2 Ōpōtiki to Napier, SH2 Devil’s Elbow and flood management at Eskdale.

“This NLTP will invest $370 million on maintenance and pothole prevention to ensure the region’s state highways and local roads return to the safe and reliable standard motorists expect. This includes resealing and rehabilitation works on 212 kilometres of state highway to prevent pesky potholes from forming in the first place.”
