Foreign Minister Winston Peters today announced further sanctions as part of the Government’s ongoing response to Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine.

“Russia’s continued illegal war of aggression against Ukraine is an assault on the rules-based order,” Mr Peters says.

“This latest round of sanctions targets actors involved in Russia’s illegal occupation of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, Russia’s military-industrial complex, and Belarusian individuals and entities providing support to the invasion.

“Russia’s continued illegal occupation of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant threatens nuclear security and safety. New Zealand again calls on Russia to cease its occupation of the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant and immediately withdraw from Ukraine’s territory.

“The sanctioning of Belarusian actors represents a shared effort with our likeminded international partners to condemn and hold accountable those supporting Russia’s illegal actions.

“By joining with more than 35 other countries imposing sanctions on those supporting Russia’s aggression, we raise the costs involved for the Russian war machine,” Mr Peters says.

Since the Russia Sanctions Act entered into force in March 2022, New Zealand has imposed sanctions on more than 1,700 individuals and entities, along with a range of trade measures. These new sanctions target five individuals and six entities.
