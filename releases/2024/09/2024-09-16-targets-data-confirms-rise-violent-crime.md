The first quarterly report on progress against the nine public service targets show promising results in some areas and the scale of the challenge in others, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon says.

“Our Government reinstated targets to focus our public sector on driving better results for New Zealanders in health, education, law and order, work, housing, and the environment by 2030,” Mr Luxon says.

“The targets we set were deliberately ambitious and the results from the first quarter confirm that they will be challenging to achieve – but it’s a challenge our Government is up for.

“We are making particularly good progress on emergency housing, with the results showing that the Government is outperforming previous forecasts.

“Our plan to get children and families out of motels and into a home is working – as of June, there has been a 34 per cent reduction in the number of households in emergency housing and since then there has been further improvement.

“Of particular concern is violent crime, with the results showing that almost 30,000 more people have experienced violent crime based on the New Zealand Crime and Victims Survey which shows people’s experience from up to two years ago. It adds fresh weight to previous data from Police, which showed a concerning rise in reports of violent crime in recent years. 

“It is also further proof that the previous soft-on-crime approach has emboldened offenders and created a crime wave that will take a much tougher approach to stop. 

“That’s why our Government is taking action to hold offenders accountable through tougher sentences. 

“Victims and the public lose faith in the justice system when criminals receive such hefty discounts to their sentences that they don’t reflect the harm caused.

“We will soon be introducing legislation to cap sentence discounts at 40 per cent, with an open mind to going even further. 

“In addition to tougher sentences, we are also increasing the number of cops on the beat, giving Police more powers to crack down on gangs, and addressing serious young offenders.”

The next quarterly progress report is expected to be released before the end of the year.
