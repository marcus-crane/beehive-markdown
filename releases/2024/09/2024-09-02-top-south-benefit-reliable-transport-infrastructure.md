A record $479 million for transport investment across the top of the South Island through the 2024-27 National Land Transport Programme (NLTP) will build a stronger road network that supports primary industries and grows the economy, Transport Minister Simeon Brown says.

“We’re committed to making sure that every dollar is spent wisely on the projects and services that are needed in the Nelson, Tasman and Marlborough regions. These regions need roads built and maintained to a high standard, and that is exactly what we are delivering.”

The Government is progressing the Hope Bypass as a Road of National Significance to reduce travel times and increase productivity.

“Over the next three years, planning will start on the Hope Bypass to get the project ready for construction in 2029. This will reduce congestion for motorists travelling through Richmond’s lower Queen Street and Gladstone Road areas.

“The Hope Bypass will support population growth in Nelson and unlock more land for housing development. It will also provide reliable freight connectivity and reduce travel times for people and freight across the region.

“As part of our plan to improve road safety, improvements will continue on SH6 Blenheim to Woodbourne, where a roundabout at the SH6/Tancred Crescent intersection is underway and scheduled to be completed in February 2025.

“Over $360 million will be invested on maintenance and pothole prevention to ensure the three regions’ state highways and local roads return to the safe and reliable standard motorists expect. This includes resealing and rehabilitation works on 272 kilometres of state highway to prevent pesky potholes from forming in the first place.”
