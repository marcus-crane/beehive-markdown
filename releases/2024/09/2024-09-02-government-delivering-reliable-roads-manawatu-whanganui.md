A record $1.6 billion for transport investment in Manawatū-Whanganui through the 2024-27 National Land Transport Programme (NLTP) will strengthen the region’s importance as a strategic freight hub that boosts economic growth, Transport Minister Simeon Brown says. 

“Delivering infrastructure to increase productivity and economic growth is a priority for our Government. Key to this is delivering the infrastructure the Manawatū-Whanganui region needs to enable people and freight get to where they want to go, quickly and safely. 

“Our Government has re-introduced the successful Roads of National Significance (RoNS) programme, with construction to begin in the next three years on the Ōtaki to North of Levin expressway. This critical RoNS will strengthen connections for motorists and freight travelling between Greater Wellington and Palmerston North.  

“We will also open the Manawatū Tararua Highway in the next three years, increasing productivity by providing a safe, resilient, and efficient route for freight between Woodville and Ashhurst. 

“We’re committed to making sure that every dollar is spent wisely on the projects and services that are needed in Manawatū-Whanganui. With potholes peppering roads across the region, it’s clear that the roading network needs to be maintained to a safe and reliable standard, and that is exactly what we are delivering. 

“Over $480 million will be invested on maintenance and pothole prevention to ensure the region’s state highways and local roads return to the safe and reliable standard motorists expect. This includes resealing and rehabilitation works on 277 kilometres of state highway to prevent pesky potholes from forming in the first place.   

“We campaigned on upgrades to improve rail services for those traveling around the lower North Island, and now we are delivering. Once the upgrades are complete, peak services on the Capital Connection to Palmerston North will double, delivering commuters more efficient and reliable travel options that increase productivity.”
