The Education Minister has established a Māori Education Ministerial Advisory Group made up of experienced practitioners to help improve outcomes for Māori learners.

“This group will provide independent advice on all matters related to Māori education in both English medium and Māori medium settings. It will focus on the most impactful ways we can lift achievement for Māori learners and close the equity gap that has persisted for too long in our education system,” Education Minister Erica Stanford says.

“Members are respected leaders and innovators in Māori education who bring commitment, skills and experience in the sector. I look forward to working with them.”

The MAG will be chaired by Dr Wayne Ngata MNZM and report directly to the Education Minister over a two-year term starting in September 2024.

“While some Māori students achieve excellent results, on average Māori experience worse outcomes than other learners on every major metric that we currently measure. This needs to change.

“I will work with the MAG to develop a Māori Education Action Plan which will be framed by my six education priorities and draw on the existing *Ka Hikitia -* *Ka Hāpaitia* and *Tau Mai Te Reo* strategies. This will require specialist knowledge and experience to make the most difference for Māori learners. I am also committed to working with Te Matakahuki, leaders and representative groups of Kaupapa Māori education, to identify shared priorities.

“I have high aspirations for the achievement of our Māori learners and want to strengthen the role whānau play in education of their Tamariki. This is another step forward in delivering a world-leading education system so every child can reach their full potential,” Ms Stanford says.

## Te whakatūranga o te Māori Education Advisory Group

Kua whakatūria e te Minita mō te Mātauranga tētahi Māori Education Ministerial Advisory Group, he hunga matatau i te ao mātauranga. Ko tā rātou he āwhina ki te whakapakari i ngā putanga ako mō ngā tauira Māori.

“Ka tuku kōrero tohutohu tūtahi tēnei rōpū mō ngā kaupapa katoa e aro nui ana ki ngā take mātauranga i ngā kura auraki me ngā kura rūmaki hoki. E aro nui ana ki ngā āhuatanga whakaaweawe kia pakari ake te eke panuku o te ākonga Māori kia pai te mana taurite kua roa e noho ngoikore ana ki te ao mātauranga” e ai ki a Minita Erica Stanford.

“He tangata matatau ēnei mema i te ao mātauranga Māori, ka ū rātou, ā, ka haria mai e rātou ngā pūkenga me ngā wheako ki te rāngai Mātauranga. E hīkaka ana au ki te mahi tahi ki a rātou.”

Ka noho mai ko Tākuta Wayne Ngata, MNZM hei Toihau mō te MAG nei, ka mutu, ka pūrongo tōtika atu ki te Minita mō te Mātauranga mō te rua tau mai i Mahuru 2024.

“Ahakoa ka puta kairangi mai ētahi ākonga Māori, ko te nuinga o ngā ākonga Māori kāore i te eke i roto i ngā mahi ako e ai ki ngā tatauranga matua katoa ka whakainehia e mātou. Me panoni tēnei āhuatanga.”

“Ka mahi tahi mātou ko te MAG ki te waihanga i tētahi Māori Education Action Plan e kapo ana i aku aronga mātauranga matua e ono, waihoki, e hāngai ana ki te rautaki *Ka Hikitia -* *Ka Hāpaitia* and *Tau Mai Te Reo.* Me matua whai wāhi ngā mātanga, me te hunga whai wheako kia tino whai hua ai ngā ākonga Māori. Kei te tino ū au ki te mahi tahi ki Te Matakahuki, ngā pou whakahaere me ngā māngai nō ngā rōpū mātauranga Kaupapa Māori, hei tautohu i ngā aronga matua i waenga i a tātou katoa mō te ao mātauranga kaupapa Māori.

“He wawata nui ōku mō te ekenga o ngā ākonga Māori me taku hiahia ki te whakakaha i tā te whānau whai wāhi ki te ao mātauranga o ā rātou tamariki. He kokenga whakamua tēnei i roto i te whakarite i tētehi pūnaha mātauranga e kitea ai e ngā tamariki katoa tō rātou pitomata ake”, tā Minita Stanford.
