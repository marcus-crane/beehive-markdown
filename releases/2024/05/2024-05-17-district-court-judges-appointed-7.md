Mr Davey initially started work as a law clerk/solicitor with Bell Gully, before becoming a Crown prosecutor in Rotorua.  In 1998 he joined Lowndes Jordan in Auckland, becoming a partner at that firm before leaving to establish himself as a barrister sole in 2004.

Judge Davey will be sworn in on 18 June 2024.

Mr Murray began his legal career in Russell McVeagh’s litigation team before moving to Palmerston North in 2004 to take up a position as an associate - and later a partner and Crown Prosecutor - with Ben Vanderkolk and Associates. 

Judge Murray will be sworn in on 17 June 2024.

**Kirsty Elizabeth Swadling** of Auckland has been appointed a District Court Judge with a family jurisdiction to be based in Waitakere.
