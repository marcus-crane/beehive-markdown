Transport Minister Simeon Brown has announced that he has approved Waiheke Island ferry operator Island Direct to be eligible for SuperGold Card funding, paving the way for a commercial agreement to bring the operator into the scheme.

“Island Direct started operating in November 2023, offering an additional option for people travelling between Auckland and Waiheke Island. However, unlike its competitors, Island Direct doesn’t receive SuperGold Card funding meaning cardholders don’t have this choice,” Mr Brown says.

“There should be a level playing field for operators of passenger ferries traveling between Auckland and Waiheke Island so that there’s healthy competition and passengers have more travel choices.”

Because Island Direct and its competitors operate on a commercial basis, the next step is for negotiations to bring the ferry operator into the SuperGold Card scheme.

“Negotiations will take place over the coming weeks between Island Direct, Auckland Transport and central government agencies to develop a commercial agreement. If successful, the negotiations are expected to conclude in time to allow Island Direct to begin offering SuperGold Card concessions at the earliest opportunity, in early July 2024,” Mr Brown says.
