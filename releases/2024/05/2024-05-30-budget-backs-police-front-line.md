A focus on supporting frontline Police in this year’s Budget will keep our communities safer, Police Minister Mark Mitchell says.

“We are serious about cracking down on crime and keeping communities safe so people can go about their lives in peace. We back our Police and are giving them more of the tools they need to do their incredibly hard job. 

“Budget 2024 provides $651 million extra over four years in critical support for frontline Policing, including the reinvestment of $55.1 million in savings.

“Our investment includes:

- $226.1 million to deliver an extra 500 Police officers
- $424.9 million to support frontline policing including $242.2 million to boost police pay $62.7 million for frontline police vehicles and maritime capability.

“As part of our savings programme, Police identified $55 million of savings in back office functions. This amount has been automatically reinvested back into frontline Police services.

“Last year alone, Police responded to over 1.2 million events. So I am pleased new specialist vehicles are coming for Armed Offenders Squads, new utes for dog handlers and rural cops, as well as patrol cars for our beat Police officers. 

“Funding will also include a new boat for the Auckland Police Maritime Unit which is essential to keeping people safe on Auckland’s busy waterways.

“Our frontline Police officers do an incredible job both on the ground and on the water. They do this work in a wide range of environments and need specialised vehicles. These new vehicles will enable our Police to disrupt crime wherever it is occurring. 

“We’re cracking down on crime and ensuring there are real consequences for offenders. We’re bringing in tough new laws to go after gangs and tackling youth offending and ram raiders. 

“And we are supporting remand prisoners to turn their lives around by delivering more rehabilitation and reintegration support. Because under our Government, victims - not offenders - are the priority of the justice system. 

“We back our Police. Our Government is investing in the Police frontline to ensure New Zealanders can feel safe and be safe in their homes and communities,” Mark Mitchell says.
