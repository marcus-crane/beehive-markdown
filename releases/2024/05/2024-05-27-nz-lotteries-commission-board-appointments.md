Internal Affairs Minister Brooke van Velden has today announced Mark Todd as the new Chair of the NZ Lotteries Commission Board and two new board appointments. 

“It’s with great pleasure I announce Mark Todd as the new chair replacing Roger Sharp who retires from the board on 31 August,” Ms van Velden says. 

Mark has been a commissioner on the board since 2019 and is currently in his third term. He also chairs the Audit and Risk Committee. 

“I would like to take this opportunity to thank Roger for his service over the past four years. I wish him all the very best.”

“In addition, I am pleased to announce the new appointments of two new commissioners, Angela Dixon and Talia Anderson-Town who will both join the board on 1 June.”

The board plays a significant role for New Zealanders in our communities. They promote, organise, and conduct New Zealand lotteries, make rules regulating the conduct of those lotteries, and distribute all profits to sporting, cultural and other community recipients via the Lotteries Grants Board.  

The board has a commitment to continue to responsibly grow its profits and maximise its distributions to the Lottery Grants Board. 

“I have previously expressed to the board that it is paramount that minimal harm is created from Lotto NZ’s products, and that any impact created from its products can be sufficiently monitored.”

“It is important that Lotto NZ employs responsible and efficient financial management to ensure that returns to the community are maximised. I expect the new chair and commissioners will continue this approach.”
