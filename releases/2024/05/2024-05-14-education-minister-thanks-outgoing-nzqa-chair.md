Minister of Education Erica Stanford has today thanked outgoing New Zealand Qualifications Authority Chair, Hon Tracey Martin. 

“Tracey Martin tendered her resignation late last month in order to take up a new role,” Ms Stanford says.

Ms Martin will relinquish the role of Chair on 10 May and current Deputy Chair Pania Gray will act until a new appointment is made.

“Tracey has been Chair since late 2021, coming in at time when the education sector was reeling from the impacts of COVID-19,” Ms Stanford says.

“On behalf of the Government I want to thank her for her dedication, time and commitment to the role.”
