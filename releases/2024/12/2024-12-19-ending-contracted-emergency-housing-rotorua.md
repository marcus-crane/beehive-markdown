Government today announced the intended closure of the Apollo Hotel as Contracted Emergency Housing (CEH) in Rotorua, Associate Housing Minister Tama Potaka says.

This follows a 30 per cent reduction in the number of households in CEH in Rotorua since National came into Government.

“Our focus is on ending CEH in the Whakarewarewa area starting with the Apollo Hotel, which will be exited by Auckland Anniversary 2025.

“I also intend to see another CEH motel in Whakarewarewa exited by end of March 2025.

“National promised real change for whānau and individuals stuck in emergency housing, and we are on track to deliver, with all CEH in Rotorua set to close within 12 months.

“In June, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development announced it would not renew consents for six of the original 13 motels, and would stop using one COVID-19 motel. Today’s announcement will bring the total number of motels exited by early 2025 to nine.

“This reduction represents meaningful progress for the Rotorua community and is a part of our ongoing plan that will see all motels exited by the end of 2025.

“I want to assure the Rotorua community of our progress in correcting the social, moral and financial catastrophe that emergency housing became under the previous Government.”
