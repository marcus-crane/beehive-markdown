State Highway 1 through the Mangamuka Gorge has officially reopened today, providing a critical link for Northlanders and offering much-needed relief ahead of the busy summer period, Transport Minister Simeon Brown says.

“The Mangamuka Gorge is a vital route for Northland, carrying around 1,300 vehicles per day and connecting the Far North to the rest of New Zealand. Extensive work has been undertaken to clear large slips and address other disruptions caused by severe weather events on this critical route, with the NZTA delivering significant improvements to the resilience and safety of this key corridor.

“Northland has grappled with several challenges in recent years, particularly with road closures and resilience issues. I want to thank the more than 1,000 workers who have worked tirelessly to reopen the Mangamuka Gorge after its closure in August 2022.”

“With this vital route now reopened, Northlanders, freight operators, and tourists visiting the region will benefit from more reliable and safer travel, especially with the busy holiday season approaching. The improved road will not only support faster travel times but also provide long-term resilience to future weather events.”

The reopening of the Mangamuka Gorge today is a significant milestone for the region, enabling motorists, local businesses, and freight operators to get to where they want to go, quickly and safely.

“Northland’s economy depends on reliable road networks, and today’s reopening marks a crucial step in ensuring ongoing connectivity for both freight and tourism. A well-maintained road network is essential for the region’s growth, and our Government remains committed to prioritising improvements in the region as part of our plan to boost productivity and grow the economy.

“With the Mangamuka Gorge now open, I am confident it will provide much-needed certainty for local businesses and visitors planning to travel this summer.”

The Government, local MP Grant McCallum, mayors, stakeholders and members of the community gathered today to mark the opening of the 13-kilometre highway between Mangamuka and Kaitaia, which will open to traffic tomorrow, 20 December 2024.
