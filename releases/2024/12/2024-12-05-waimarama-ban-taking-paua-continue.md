A two-year temporary closure banning the take of pāua from Waimārama south of Hastings will support efforts by local iwi to rebuild pāua stocks, Oceans and Fisheries Minister Shane Jones says.

The closure includes Waimārama Beach and Ocean Beach, two beaches popular with holidaymakers and recreational fishers.

Ngāi Hapū o Waimārama requested the two-year temporary closure to allow the pāua to continue to recover from the effects of seasonal fishing pressures and the impacts of Cyclone Gabrielle. It follows a previous temporary closure and rāhui.

“I have agreed to Ngāi Hapū o Waimārama’s request for a further two-year pāua ban over their rohe moana. I acknowledge hapū observations of localised depletion of pāua and share their concerns that the recovering pāua population would not sustain harvesting at this time.

“While the full impacts from Cyclone Gabrielle on pāua are not known, removing fishing pressure is an immediate measure to make sure the pāua have the best chance to recover,” Mr Jones says. 

“The closure will support previous efforts made by hapū to seed juvenile pāua and ongoing monitoring of the fishery’s recovery, and I congratulate them for this ongoing mahi to support their rohe moana.”

Public consultation took place between 9 October and 11 November.

The closed area extends along the entire coastline of the hapū’s rohe moana, extending from Whakapau Point in the north to Te Rahui in the south, and two nautical miles offshore including the waters around Te Motu-o-Kura/Bare Island.

The closure will come into force from 23 December 2024 and is enforceable by Fisheries New Zealand’s Fishery Officers.
