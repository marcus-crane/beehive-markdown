A total of 41 appointments and reappointments have been made to the 12 community trusts around New Zealand that serve their regions, Associate Finance Minister Shane Jones says.

“These trusts, and the communities they serve from the Far North to the deep south, will benefit from the rich experience, knowledge, and relationships the appointees bring.

“These people collectively bring expertise in education, business, healthcare, community services, marketing, sports, governance, law, environmental protection, grant allocation, and community development to the trusts.

“The 12 community trusts of New Zealand are the custodians of more than $3.5 billion of investments and together grant around $100m into thousands of organisations throughout the country each year,” Mr Jones says.

“The work done by the trusts helps build strong and empowered communities. Strong communities are good for the regions, and good for New Zealand. These people appointed and reappointed to the various boards are the kaitiaki of their communities. I thank them for accepting the challenge and offering their wisdom and expertise.

“I also express my gratitude to those who have ended terms on the community trusts of New Zealand.”
