New Zealand’s seafood exports are set to hit a record $2.2 billion in the year to June 2025, and increase to $2.4b the following year, Oceans and Fisheries Minister Shane Jones says.

“Our seafood sector is a Kiwi success story. The sector’s hard work, healthy demand, tight global supply and high export prices are boosting exports and driving returns to our fish farmers, fishers, and processors.

“The future outlook for our seafood exports is strong. The world knows New Zealand produces amazing seafood and we are well placed to meet global demand through our sustainable fisheries.”

Mr Jones says the seafood sector has successfully tackled a range of challenges.

“Our seafood sector has navigated tough weather and geopolitical issues, which have driven up production costs, so the forecast 3 per cent increase in revenue from the 2023-2024 year is notable.

“Inflation is now returning towards target levels and interest rates are declining, which is reducing debt servicing costs, and global shipping costs have eased.”

Mr Jones says the Coalition Government is supporting the sector to succeed through actions such as extending the terms for existing marine farm coastal permits by 20 years; cutting fishing levies, new tools to tackle kina barrens, the creation of an aquaculture strategy, and reform of the fisheries sector.

“Our aquaculture strategy aims to triple sales revenue to $3 billion by 2035 to deliver greater prosperity across the sector, with good progress being made.

“We’re reducing regulatory impediments that hinder the sector’s success, such as removing the annual cap on foreign fishing crew numbers.

“I thank the seafood sector for its hard work. I am committed to working with fishers to ensure their success for the regions and the wider New Zealand economy.”

Forecasts were released today in the latest Situation and Outlook for Primary Industries (SOPI) published by the Ministry for Primary Industries and available on the [MPI website](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/resources-and-forms/economic-intelligence/situation-and-outlook-for-primary-industries/).
