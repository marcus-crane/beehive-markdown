Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has announced four appointments to New Zealand’s intelligence oversight functions. 

The Honourable Robert Dobson KC has been appointed Chief Commissioner of Intelligence Warrants, and the Honourable Brendan Brown KC has been appointed as a Commissioner of Intelligence Warrants. 

The appointments of Hon Robert Dobson and Hon Brendan Brown were made by the Governor-General after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition and will take effect on 1 January 2025. 

“Commissioners of Intelligence Warrants are part of the robust oversight of New Zealand’s intelligence agencies and ensure effective scrutiny is applied for warranted activities,” Mr Luxon says.

“I want to thank the Hon Robert Dobson and Hon Brendan Brown for their willingness to take on this important oversight function.

“I would also like to acknowledge the outgoing Chief Commissioner Sir Bruce Robertson KNZM for his dedication in the role since 2013.” 

Graeme Speden has been re-appointed as the Deputy Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security for a three-year term from 1 December 2024. 

Melanie Matthews has been appointed as a member of the Inspector-General’s Advisory Panel from 1 January 2025. The appointment was made by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, after consulting the Intelligence and Security Committee, as required by statute. 

Mrs Matthews joins Ben Bateman, Chief Executive Officer of Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu, on the two-person advisory panel. She replaces Lyn Provost, former Auditor-General, whose term ends on 31 December. 

“These two important roles assist the Inspector-General in their independent oversight of New Zealand’s intelligence and security agencies”, says Mr Luxon. 

“I want to thank Lyn Provost for her contribution to the advisory panel since 2018.”
