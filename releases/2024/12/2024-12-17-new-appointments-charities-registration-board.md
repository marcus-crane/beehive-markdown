Mr Roger Holmes Miller and Ms Tarita Hutchinson have been appointed to the Charities Registration Board, Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Louise Upston says.

“I would like to welcome the new members joining the Charities Registration Board.

“The appointment of Ms Hutchinson and Mr Miller will strengthen the Board’s capacity to make balanced and timely decisions, ensuring it can continue to operate effectively,” Ms Upston says.

“Mr Miller previously served nine years on the Board, including as Chair. Both Mr Miller and Ms Hutchinson bring excellent legal and regulatory expertise as well as first-hand experience of the charitable and philanthropic sector.”

The Charities Registration Board is an independent body responsible for decisions about the registration and deregistration of charitable entities.

These appointments follow an amendment to Schedule 2 of the Charities Act 2005 that increased the number of members on the Board from three to five.

“I look forward to working with the new members as they begin their terms,” Ms Upston says.

There are over 28,000 registered charities in New Zealand.
