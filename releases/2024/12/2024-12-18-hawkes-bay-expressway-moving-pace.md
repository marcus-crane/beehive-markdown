Transport Minister Simeon Brown has welcomed further progress on the Hawke’s Bay Expressway Road of National Significance (RoNS), with the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) Board approving funding for the detailed design of Stage 1, paving the way for main works construction to begin in late 2025.

“The Government is moving at pace to deliver infrastructure that boosts economic growth and productivity, reduces congestion, and creates a safer and more resilient network,” Mr Brown says.

“Stage 1 of the Hawke’s Bay Expressway RoNS project will four-lane 6.5 kilometres of the most congested section of the expressway, between the Taradale Road and Pakowhai Road/Links Road roundabouts. This work will enable more efficient travel between Napier and Hastings and provide a more reliable connection to Hawke’s Bay Airport and the region’s largest port.

“Early ground improvement work has already started on Stage 1, including building up the land alongside the Kennedy Road offramp, by repurposing safe, tested silt from the aftermath of Cyclone Gabrielle, provided by the Silt Recovery Taskforce.

“I was impressed to see how much progress has already been made on enabling works when I visited the Kennedy Road offramp site last month. These early works will allow NZTA to bring forward the construction of this project by 12 to 15 months.

“As well as detailed design work for Stage 1, the approved funding will allow the project team to continue with further enabling work at Tutaekuri River bridge in preparation for a new 280 metre bridge. Carrying out enabling works at this site in the current construction season will mean contractors will be able to hit the ground running when main works construction is scheduled to commence in late 2025.

“Our Government will continue to prioritise infrastructure, like the Hawke’s Bay Road of National Significance, that will enable Kiwis and freight to get where they want to go quickly and safely. I look forward to seeing more progress on site as works continue in the new year.”
