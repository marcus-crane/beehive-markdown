Four new appointments have been made to the New Zealand Post Ltd (NZ Post) board, Acting State-Owned Enterprises Minister Chris Bishop says.

“NZ Post is one of New Zealand’s largest State-owned enterprises with revenue of around $1.2 billion and total assets of around $1.5 billion. It is the designated universal postal operator in New Zealand – and at this time of year, the deliverer of Christmas presents for millions of Kiwi families,” Mr Bishop says.

“Ensuring this important organisation operates effectively and efficiently is vital, so Ministers are pleased to confirm that four new members have been appointed to the NZ Post board: Dame Paula Rebstock as Chair, Paul Reid as Deputy Chair, and Brodie Stevens and Linley Wood as new directors. 

“The new members bring a wealth of governance, commercial and logistical expertise to the board. They join four existing board members: Reuben Casey, Paul Cochrane, Roger Gray and Bruce Wattie.

“I thank the outgoing board members for their service.”
