*Mehemea he pai mō te tangata, mahia – if it’s good for the people, get on with it.*

Enhanced reporting on the public sector’s delivery of Treaty settlement commitments will help improve outcomes for Māori and all New Zealanders, Māori Crown Relations Minister Tama Potaka says.

Compiled together for the first time in over 30 years of Treaty settlements, the Whole of System (Core Crown) Report on Treaty Settlement Delivery outlines how 26 core Crown agencies have assessed their progress in meeting their Treaty settlement commitments.

For the 2023/24 reporting period, 77 per cent of the 14,594 core Crown commitments with a status assigned are completed or on track, 18 per cent are yet to be triggered, and five percent are reported to have delivery issues.

“The government is strongly committed to honouring Treaty settlements and delivering better public services. Having this data can help agencies improve their delivery on commitments,” Mr Potaka says. 

The report resulted from He Korowai Whakamana, a Cabinet-agreed framework approved in 2022 requiring Crown agencies to record, track, and report annually on the status of Treaty of Waitangi settlement commitments.

“It’s important to remember the complexity of settlement commitments can vary greatly - some may involve sending letters of introduction while others could involve complex land transfers. 

“While the clear majority are on track, there’s a small percentage where complications have arisen, and the commitment may not be delivered as intended, or within the timeframe specified. 

“Some of these issues have since been resolved. For example, with Base Woodbourne, redress provided for in Treaty settlements with Kurahaupō iwi was unable to be delivered as intended, however, through a resolution process with Iwi, this issue was resolved and is now considered complete.

“Continued annual reporting will help ensure sustained investment in delivery by core Crown agencies and, over time, demonstrate an increase in settlement commitments being delivered, as well as improved agency practice. 

“There is a lot of mahi to do and the Government will continue to refine practices to complete this work more expeditiously.”

### Kei te whakapakarihia ngā pūrongo e pā ana ki ngā kawenga o ngā whakataunga Tiriti

*Mehemea he pai mō te tangata, mahia.*

Mā te whakapakaritanga ake o ngā pūrongo e pā ana ki te whakatutukinga o ngā kawenga a ngā whakataunga Tiriti e te rāngai tūmatanui, ka piki ake hoki ngā hua ki a Ngāi Māori me ngā tāngata katoa o Aotearoa, te kī a te Minita o Te Arawhiti, a Tama Potaka.

He tuatahitanga te whakaeminga mai o ngā kōrero a te Whole of System (Core Crown) Report on Treaty Settlement Delivery neke atu i te 30 tau mai i te tīmatanga o ngā whakataunga Tiriti. Kua whārikihia ngā aromatawai a ngā whare Karauna matua, e 26 te nui, e pā ana ki tō rātou kaha ki te hāpai i ō rātou kawenga i raro i ngā whakataunga Tiriti.

I te tau 2023/24, kua oti, kei te ara tika rānei tētahi 77% o ngā kawenga a ngā whare Karauna matua, 14, 596 te nui, ā, kāore anō tētahi 18% o ngā kawenga kia tīmata, kua pāngia tētahi 5% e tētahi raruraru.

“Kei te pūmau te kāwanatanga ki te whakatutukinga o ngā whakataunga Tiriti me te whakapikinga ake o ngā ratonga a te rāngai tūmatanui. Mā ēnei raraunga ngā whare kāwanatanga e āwhina ki te whakapiki ake i te whakatutukinga o ō rātou kawenga, “ te kī a Mr Potaka.

Kua hua mai te pūrongo i He Korowai Whakamana, arā, he anga kōrero tērā i whakaaetia e Te Rūnanga o te Kāwanatanga i te tau 2022, e tohutohu ana i ngā whare Karauna ki te hopu, ki te whai, ā, ki te tuhi pūrongo ā-tau hoki e pā ana ki te tū o ngā kawenga o ngā whakataunga i raro i Te Tiriti o Waitangi.

“Me maumahara tātou he kaupapa matatini tēnei, he whānui tonu ngā momo kawenga rerekē i roto i ngā whakataunga – he tono reta whakataki ētahi, he whakawhitinga whenua kē pea ētahi atu, he take uaua tērā.

“Ahakoa kei te ara tika te nuinga, kua ara mai ētahi uauatanga ruarua, ā, kāore anō ērā kawenga kia tutuki tika, i te wā tika rānei.

“Heoi, kua ea kē ētahi o ēnei take. Ko Base Woodbourne tētahi tauira, arā, ahakoa kāore ngā iwi o Kurahaupō i whiwhi i ngā hua i tonoa ki a rātou i raro i tō rātou whakataunga Tiriti, nā tētahi whakaritenga ki te taha o te iwi, kua ea te kaupapa, ā, kua oti hoki te mahi.

“Mā ngā pūrongo ā-tau, ka whāngai tonu ngā whare Karauna matua i te kaupapa, ā, ka piki ake te whakatutukinga o ngā kawenga i te takanga o te wā me ngā mahi a ngā whare kāwanatanga.

“He nui tonu ngā mahi hei whakatutuki, ā, ka kaha tonu te Kāwanatanga ki te whakahāngai i ā mātou mahi kia tutuki wawe tēnei kaupapa.”
