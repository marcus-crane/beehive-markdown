A new seafood processing factory in Porirua north of Wellington will bring export revenue, jobs and opportunities for the community, Oceans and Fisheries Minister Shane Jones says.

The Wellington Kaimoana Hub, a joint venture between Māori owned seafood companies Moana New Zealand and Port Nicholson Fisheries, was formally opened by Mr Jones today.

“I congratulate Moana New Zealand and Port Nicholson Fisheries for their work together that has resulted in this outstanding facility and the many benefits it will bring.

“The seafood sector is an important part of New Zealand’s economic engine. The billions of dollars of export revenue it brings into the country is good for all Kiwis.

“The sector’s continued success in the face of tough weather events and geopolitical issues is testament to the people who work hard every day to sustainably collect and process this valuable resource.”

About 9000 people in New Zealand work in the wild capture fishing industry, including seafood processing, supporting whānau and communities across the country.

The 4500m² Wellington Kaimoana Hub is a purpose-built facility and includes a multi-use seafood processing factory to meet the growing demand for New Zealand kaimoana.

“Consumers here and around the world prize New Zealand’s seafood for its high quality and sustainability, providing a good base for continued growth,” Mr Jones says.

“I am committed to ensuring the Government does its part to facilitate that growth.”
