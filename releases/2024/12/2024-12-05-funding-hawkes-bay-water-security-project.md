Up to $3 million from the Regional Infrastructure Fund has been allocated for pre-construction development of the Tukituki Water Security Project in Hawke’s Bay, Regional Development Minister Shane Jones says.

The grant for the project, which is being co-funded by the Tukituki Water Security Project, is limited to work to investigate the technical, environmental, and commercial viability and design of water storage site and distribution network on Makaroro River.

“The perilous state of water security and resilience in Hawke’s Bay can no longer be ignored. Climate change is leading to depleted water, higher temperatures and frequent droughts. The people, communities and environment of Hawke’s Bay need to have a safe and reliable water supply. Doing nothing is no longer an option,” Mr Jones says. 

The Minister made the announcement at the Regional Growth Summit in Hastings today where he also opened the Foodeast-Haumako innovation hub.

The hub for food, beverage and agri-tech excellence would help grow and diversify the Hawke’s Bay’ food sector, Mr Jones said. The Provincial Growth Fund contributed $12 million towards its construction.

“This investment in Foodeast–Haumako will help the region’s food and beverage industry by facilitating growth and diversification and encouraging the development of new local and overseas markets,” Mr Jones says.

The hub includes a main building and innovation centre. There are tenanted offices and shared spaces, as well as a café and options for short-term bookings for training and demonstration spaces and events. The total cost of the hub was $18 million and is supported by a range of local stakeholders.
