The Government has welcomed decisions by the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) and Ashburton District Council confirming funding to boost resilience in the Canterbury region, with construction on a second Ashburton Bridge expected to begin in 2026, Transport Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Delivering a second Ashburton Bridge to improve resilience and connectivity along State Highway 1 in Canterbury is a key priority for both the Government and the Ashburton District Council, and I’m pleased we are delivering for the local community to get this critical project underway.

“We all saw the impact of recent flooding events that occurred in Ashburton in 2021 and 2023 and the effect that this had on supply chains and emergency services across the South Island. These events demonstrated how critical this connection – which takes 24,000 vehicles a day – is for the South Island, particularly as the next alternative bridge is over 27 kilometres away.

“By investing in a second Ashburton Bridge, the South Island’s supply chain will have significantly improved resilience and it will also allow for further growth in Tinwald in Ashburton with a large amount of additional land being unlocked for development.

“NZTA is working at pace to confirm details with Ashburton District Council including the final scope, consenting pathway, and preferred delivery arrangements, so that construction can begin as soon as possible. The Government has also listed the Bridge in the Fast Track Approvals Bill in order to expedite consenting for this critical project.

“Delivering a second Ashburton Bridge will boost economic growth and deliver strong benefits to Ashburton and the surrounding South Island communities. I want to thank Ashburton District Council for confirming their share of funding, and Mayor Neil Brown, and local MP James Meager for their strong advocacy of this important project."
