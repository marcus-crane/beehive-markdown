Four new board members have been appointed to the board of Sport and Recreation New Zealand (Sport NZ), Sport and Recreation Minister Chris Bishop says.

“Megan Campbell, John Fiso (ONZM), Kathryn Irving and Ken Laban will collectively bring strong governance experience in the community, sporting and recreational sectors to the board,” Mr Bishop says.

“The current chair, Raewyn Lovett (ONZM), and deputy chair, Duane Kale (ONZM), have been reappointed to ensure continuity and stability in the organisation. Robyn Cockburn has also been reappointed as a member.

“Sport NZ’s role in the active recreation and sport system includes investing government funds into sporting organisations across New Zealand and promoting the importance of being physically active as a means of staying healthy, as well as developing national policies and strategies for active recreation and sport.

“These new appointments will provide strong organisational leadership to Sport NZ so they can fulfil this role efficiently and effectively, and get more Kiwis into some form of physical activity.

“I thank the outgoing board members Dame Farah Palmer, Rakesh Naidoo, Suri Bartlett and Beatrice Faumuina for their work.”

Further appointments to the board will be made in the new year.
