Minister of Internal Affairs Brooke van Velden says newly appointed Commissioner, Grant Illingworth KC, will help deliver the report for the first phase of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into COVID-19 Lessons, due on 28 November 2024.

“I am pleased to announce that Mr Illingworth will commence his appointment as a member of the Royal Commission from 2 August 2024, filling the vacancy left by Hon Hekia Parata,” says Ms van Velden.

Mr Illingworth is a litigation specialist who has conducted a wide range of civil, criminal, and immigration cases. He has experience in tribunal proceedings and has acted as counsel in proceedings involving two constitutional crises in Fiji.

“I am confident that Mr Illingworth brings a strong set of skills to the Royal Commission which will allow them to deliver to the terms of reference."

The Royal Commission of Inquiry into COVID-19 Lessons was established in December 2022. Both the ACT-National and New Zealand First-National coalition agreements include commitments to expanding the inquiry to cover outstanding matters of public concern.

In June the Government announced that there will be a second phase to the inquiry featuring new Commissioners and expanded terms of reference.

“The second phase of the inquiry will focus on matters of ongoing public concern including vaccine efficacy and safety, the extended lockdowns in Auckland and Northland, and the extent of disruption to New Zealanders’ health, education, and business.

“I look forward to announcing the Commissioners, along with the detailed terms of reference, shortly. It is my intention that Grant Illingworth will be appointed to the second phase of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into COVID-19 lessons alongside new Commissioners,” says Ms van Velden.

Mr Illingworth will be appointed to the Royal Commission by an Order in Council to be made by the Governor-General on the advice of the Minister.
