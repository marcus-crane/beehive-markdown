Foreign Minister Winston Peters travels to Laos this week to participate in a series of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-led Ministerial meetings in Vientiane.

“ASEAN plays an important role in supporting a peaceful, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific,” Mr Peters says.

“This will be our third visit to Southeast Asia and sixth visit to an ASEAN member state since the start of the year. Through concrete actions we are demonstrating our steadfast commitment to the region, which is central to New Zealand’s prosperity and security.”

Mr Peters will also participate in the annual Foreign Ministers’ meetings of the East Asia Summit and ASEAN Regional Forum, which bring together ASEAN and its key Indo-Pacific partners.  Mr Peters experience with the Summit stretches back nearly 20 years, having attended the inaugural Foreign Ministers meeting in December 2005 and a further eight since.  

"With next year marking 50 years since New Zealand became an ASEAN dialogue partner, these meetings present a valuable opportunity to engage our partners on strategic issues facing the wider region, and advance practical cooperation in areas such as maritime security, counter terrorism, transnational crime and cyber security,” Mr Peters says.

Mr Peters will also hold several bilateral meetings with counterparts in the margins of the ASEAN-led events.
