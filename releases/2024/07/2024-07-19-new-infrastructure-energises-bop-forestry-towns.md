New developments in the heart of North Island forestry country will reinvigorate their communities and boost economic development, Regional Development Minister Shane Jones says.

Mr Jones visited Kaingaroa and Kawerau in Bay of Plenty today to open a landmark community centre in the former and a new connecting road in the latter that will streamline industry in the region.

“Both of these projects are part of wider development packages helping to re-energise these communities, boost regional pride and increase economic growth,” Mr Jones says. 

Mr Jones attended a ceremony to open the new Kaingaroa community centre, which is the final milestone in the $11.1 million Kaingaroa Community Development Project, supported by $7.2m in regional development funding.

The project also received co-investment totalling $3.9m from Te Puni Kōkiri, Te Tumu Paeroa (Office of the Māori Trustee), and the Ministry of Health. Co-funding from local business K.L.C Ltd was also crucial to the completion of the wider project.

The community centre will house a medical centre, complete with a kaumātua and rangatahi space, as well as meeting and training rooms. The centre also includes a digital hub to improve internet access and connectivity in the community.

“As Kaingaroa residents know, decades of inadequate funding and maintenance meant infrastructure investment was greatly needed for the revitalisation of the village. The completion of the project enables the community to realise its aspirations to grow and thrive,” Mr Jones says.

The development project created 306 fulltime equivalent jobs over the term of the construction, many by Kaingaroa residents. He Ira Kāhui Anamata (HIKA) Trust, a Māori-owned business, was the main contractor for building the community centre.

Mr Jones also opened the Kawerau Off-Highway Road today. The project received $1.62 million in Provincial Growth Fund (PGF) funding, and $785,000 co-investment from Kawerau-based Sequal Lumber Ltd.

The 1.6km road, off State Highway 34, connects Kawerau Industrial Park to a private forestry road, removing big trucks from local roads and providing efficient connectivity between the Putauaki Industrial Park and a planned container rail terminal.

The Kawerau Off-Highway Road marks a milestone for the Kawerau Putauaki Industrial Development package, which received $10.11m through the PGF and attracted $4.1m co-investment.

“This opening is the result of partnering with Māori landowners, Kawerau District Council, local businesses and the community to support growth for the town,” says Mr Jones.

“The broader Kawerau Putauaki Industrial Development package is providing cost-effective roading and industrial solutions for established industries in Kawerau, and once completed, will attract new industries and further private sector investment.

While in the area, Mr Jones also attended the launch of a refreshed regional economic development strategy developed by TOI EDA, the Economic Development Agency for Eastern Bay of Plenty.

“These collaborative regional strategies are at the heart of what we need for prioritising further regional development investments. I hope to see more projects like these being funded through the new [Regional Infrastructure Fund](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/regional-infrastructure-fund-opens-applications), which I launched on 1 July.”
