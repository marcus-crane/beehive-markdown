New satellite technology that significantly improves GPS accuracy, has reached an important milestone, with two 11-metre satellite dishes switched on by Land Information Minister Chris Penk.

Known as the Southern Positioning Augmentation Network (SouthPAN), the project improves GPS accuracy from five to 10 metres, down to less than a metre – and in some cases to as little as 10cm.

“New Zealanders use GPS services every single day for everything from ordering food, to navigating the city streets. GPS information is also used for critical technical applications like coordinating an emergency response and air traffic control,” Mr Penk says.

“As the project develops, one of the most noticeable changes for the public will be less disruption to flights during bad weather, with a significant reduction in weather related flight cancellations and delays. SouthPAN services will aid flight navigation, making it safer for planes to land when visibility is poor.

“Only a few weeks ago winter weather conditions caused widespread flight cancellations, underscoring the need for modern digital infrastructure to support the safe movement of people, as well as goods and services.

“Improved GPS accuracy has far-reaching benefits for almost every major sector, from agriculture, to aviation, forestry, and construction. An independent report estimated SouthPAN will contribute $864 million to New Zealand’s economy over 20 years, through productivity enhancing and labour-saving applications, such as better resource management, more accurate maritime activities and real-time livestock monitoring through digital fencing tools.

“It is expected this figure could grow as new technologies and innovations are developed to harness SouthPAN’s possibilities.

“SouthPAN is a joint project between the governments of New Zealand and Australia. The Southland facility works in tandem with a newly built centre in Uralla, in New South Wales.

“Partnering with Australia improves our resilience and means if one station is offline, there is a back-up station which is crucial for safety of life applications, such as aviation.”

Some SouthPAN services are already free and available to consumers and delivering services that are 99.5 per cent reliable. The remainder of the network will be established over the next three years.
