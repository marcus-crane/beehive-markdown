An experimental vineyard which will help futureproof the wine sector has been opened in Blenheim by Associate Regional Development Minister Mark Patterson.

The covered vineyard, based at the New Zealand Wine Centre – Te Pokapū Wāina o Aotearoa, enables controlled environmental conditions.

“The research that will be produced at the Experimental Future Vineyard will help ensure New Zealand’s wine sector is prepared for challenges such as changing weather patterns,” Mr Patterson says.

“The Coalition Government is focused on growing the economy, doubling the value of our exports, and ensuring our regions are supported to developing their unique growth opportunities through strategic investment. This state-of-the-art facility enables research to futureproof the sector, ensuring it continues to thrive while protecting and enhancing New Zealand’s $2.4 billion a year in wine exports.” 

Marlborough is New Zealand’s largest wine region, contributing $637 million a year to GDP. It produces 80 per cent of the country’s export wines, and directly employs more than 2900 people and many more seasonal workers.

Plant & Food Research will operate the Experimental Future Vineyard and will work closely with the Marlborough Research Centre, the wider wine industry and will provide industry training.

The vineyard was funded with $900,000 from a $3.79m loan from Kānoa – Regional Economic Development & Investment Unit to the Marlborough Research Centre.
