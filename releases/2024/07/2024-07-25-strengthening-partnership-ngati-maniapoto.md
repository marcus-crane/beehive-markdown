*He aha te kai a te rangatira? He kōrero, he kōrero, he kōrero.*

The government has reaffirmed its commitment to supporting the aspirations of Ngāti Maniapoto, Minister for Māori Development Tama Potaka says.

“My thanks to Te Nehenehenui Trust – Ngāti Maniapoto for bringing their important kōrero to a ministerial forum held at Parliament today.

“Our kōrero focused on the Waiwaiā Accord, which provides a framework for the post-settlement relationship between Te Nehenehenui Trust and the Crown, and what our future relationship might look like,” Minister Potaka said.

“Developing an enhanced and effective mahitahi (working together) between Te Nehenehenui Trust and relevant Crown agencies can hold great potential for supporting the aspirations of Ngāti Maniapoto.

“Today’s meeting with Te Nehenehenui Trust was an opportunity to come together as leaders of iwi and government to seek opportunities, align priorities, and strengthen the Iwi-Crown relationship,” says Minister Potaka.

“I am looking forward to working with my Ministerial colleagues and officials to expand on the topics discussed at the forum, and to identify how we can collaboratively contribute meaningfully to the aspirations of Te Nehenehenui Trust – Ngāti Maniapoto.

“The government is committed to delivering on Treaty commitments to Iwi and hapū.

“Sustaining strong partnerships with Iwi and hapū is essential to the prosperity of all New Zealanders.”

Kua whakaūhia anōtia e tēnei kāwanatanga tōna ngākau nui ki te tautoko i ngā moemoeā, oti rā, ngā whakangākau o Ngāti Maniapoto, te kī a Te Minita Whanaketanga Māori, a Tama Pōtaka.

“Me aku mihi nui ki Te Nehenehenui Trust – Ngāti Maniapoto, nā rātou i mau mai ā rātou kōrero whakahirahira ki te hui minita i tū ki te Whare Pāremata i te rangi nei.

“E aro ana ā mātou kōrero ki te Whakataunga Waiwaiā, he mea whakatakoto i te pou tarāwaho e whakarite ana i te hononga i waenga i ngā Kaitiaki o Te Nehenehenui me te Karauna mō muri i te whakataunga, ka mutu, he pēhea hoki te āhua o taua hononga ānamata “te kōrero a Minita Potaka.

“Ko te whakawhanake i tētahi hononga mahitahi he mea whakarei, he mea whai hua hoki i waenga i Ngā Kaitiaki o Te Nehenehenui me ngā Hinonga Karauna whaitake ka mutu, kei reira pea te pitomata nui mō te tautoko i ngā moemoeā o Ngāti Maniapoto.

“He tino ara te hui i te rangi nei me Te Nehenehenui Trust kia whakakotahi mai i ngā rangatira o ngā iwi, o te kāwanatanga hoki hei rapu huarahi, hei whakahāngai tahi i ngā paearu, me te whakapakari i te hononga i waenga i te Iwi me te Karauna,” te kī a Minita Potaka.  

“Harikoa katoa te ngākau kia mahitahi mātou ko ōku hoa Minita me ngā āpiha ki te whakawhānui ake i ngā kōrero e pā ana ki ngā kaupapa i kōrerotia i te hui, me te kimi huarahi e taea ai e mātou te mahi ngātahi i runga i te ngākau nui ki te whakatutuki i ngā moemoeā o Te Nehenehenui Trust – Ngāti Maniapoto.

“E ngākau nui ana te kāwanatanga ki te whakatutuki i ngā herenga Tiriti ki ngā Iwi me ngā hapū.

“He mea nui te whakapūmautanga o ngā mahitahi pakari ki ngā Iwi me ngā hapū ki te tōnuitanga o Ngāi Aotearoa.”
