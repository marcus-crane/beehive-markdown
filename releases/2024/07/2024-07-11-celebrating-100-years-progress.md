Te Arawa Lakes Trust centenary celebrations mark a significant milestone for all the important work done for the lakes, the iwi and for the Bay of Plenty region, says Māori Crown Relations: Te Arawhiti and Māori Development Minister Tama Potaka.

The minister spoke at a commemorative event acknowledging 100 years since the first recorded meeting of the Te Arawa Trust Board (now represented by the Te Arawa Lakes Trust), which was established following an early agreement between Te Arawa Iwi and the Crown over the lakes.

The Trust hosted the Kotahi Rau Tau Centennial Ball at Rotorua Energy Events Centre in Rotorua today.

“This is very much a day to celebrate Te Arawa,” Minister Potaka said.

“The contribution of Te Arawa Iwi and hapū, through the many initiatives they have established over time, to the Rotorua and Bay of Plenty region is huge and today enables me to acknowledge that on behalf of the Government.”

“Today we celebrate a century of dedication to Te Arawa. Acknowledging the contributions initiated by the Te Arawa District Trust Board in 1924, we honour the wisdom and knowledge of our tūpuna, who continue to guide us today,” says the Chair of Te Arawa Lakes Trust, Geoff Rolleston.

“In true partnership, we know that through acknowledgement and challenge, we can ensure the preservation of our heritage, maintenance of our mana, protection of our tūrangawaewae, and ensure Arawatanga thrives,” Mr Rolleston said.

Te Arawa settled its historic Treaty of Waitangi claims with the Crown in 2006 through the landmark Te Arawa Lakes Settlement.

Since then, Te Arawa has established several initiatives to promote the protection, restoration, and enhancement of the lakes.

“By regenerating mātauranga Māori and fostering a deep connection to our lakes and taonga species, we pave the way for the wellbeing of Te Arawa,” says the Chief Executive of Te Arawa Lakes Trust, Dr Daryn Bean.

“Elevating our understanding of our 14 Kōroto - Te Arawa lakes and taonga species is vital for our collective wellbeing, so as we reflect on our past we make a commitment to our future: always hold steadfast to that which is uniquely Arawa, to uphold our traditions always, to protect te taiao diligently and ensure a vibrant, sustainable future for all those that consider our rohe home.”

The Trust’s achievements include the mobilisation of a volunteer network of 1,500 volunteers who have, to date, overseen the removal of over 180,000 invasive catfish from the Te Arawa lakes as a part of their efforts to remove invasive animal and plant species from the lakes.

“I look forward to continuing to strengthening our enduring partnership shared with the Te Arawa Iwi including organisations like the Te Arawa Lakes Trust and all that can be achieved in the next 100 years,” Minister Potaka said.

## **E whakanui ana i ngā whakatutukinga o tērā 100 tau**

Hei tā te Minita o Te Arawhiti, hei tā Tama Potaka, kei te whakanui te rautau o Ngā Rotomoana o Te Arawa i ngā mahi nui kua oti i a rātou mā ngā rotomoana, mā te iwi me te rohe whānui o Te Moana-a-Toi.

I tū te minita ki te hui whakanui i te huringa o te 100 tau i te huihuinga tuatahi o Te Arawa Trust Board (arā, ko Ngā Rotomoana o Te Arawa ināianei), he mea whakatū nō muri mai i tētahi o ngā whakaaetanga tuatahi i waenganui i Te Arawa me te Karauna e pā ana ki ngā rotomoana.

I whakatūria te Kotahi Rau Tau Centennial Ball e Ngā Rotomoana o Te Arawa ki Te Whare Pūngao o Rotorua i tēnei rā.

“E tika ana me whakanui a Te Arawa i tēnei rā,” te kī a Minita Potaka.

“He nui tonu ngā hua o ngā tini kaupapa o Ngā Rotomoana i roto i ngā tau ki ngā iwi me ngā hapū o Te Arawa huri noa i te rohe o Rotorua me Te Monana-a-Toi, ā, i tēnei rā kei konei ahau ki te tuku i ngā mihi a te Kāwanatanga.”

“I tēnei rangi kei te whakanui tātou i ngā whakapaunga kaha ki runga i te iwi o Te Arawa nō roto i tētahi rautau. Kei te mihia ngā mahi i kōkirihia e te Arawa District Trust Board i te tau 1924 me te mātauranga o ō mātou tūpuna e ārahi tonu ana i a mātou i tēnei rā,” te kī a te Heamana o Ngā Rotomoana o Te Arawa, a Geoff Rolleston.

“I roto tonu i te whanaungatanga, ahakoa ngā piki me ngā heke, kei te whakapūmautia ā tātou taonga tuku iho, e hāpaitia ana tō mātou mana ā, kei te whakamarumaruhia tō mātou tūrangawaewae kia ora nui ai a Te Arawa,” te kī a Mr Rolleston.

Nō te tau 2006 ka whakatauria e Te Arawa ā rātou kerēme ki te Karauna i raro i te Tiriti o Waitangi mā te whakataunga whakahirahira o Te Arawa Lakes Settlement.

Mai anō i taua wā, he huhua ngā kaupapa kua whakatūria e Te Arawa ki te whakatairanga i te whakamarumarutanga, i te whakarauoratanga me te whakapaipaitanga o ngā rotomoana.

“Nō te whakarauoratanga mai o te mātauranga o ngā mātua tūpuna me te whanaungatanga ki ō mātou roto me ā mātou kīrehe māori, kei te takahi mātou i te ara ki te oranga o Te Arawa,” te kī a te Tumuaki o Ngā Rotomoana o Te Arawa, a Tākuta Daryn Bean.

“Kei te whakapiki mātou i tō mātou māramatanga ki ō mātou kōroto 14 – he mea nui ngā roto me ngā kīrehe māori a Te Arawa ki te oranga o Te Arawa whānui – nō reira, i ā mātou e tiro ana ki muri, kei te whakaūngia te ara whakamua: kia mau tonu ki ngā āhuatanga motuhake o Te Arawa, kia hāpaingia ngā tikanga tuku iho, me pono ki te whakamarumarutanga o te taiao, kia tū te ihiihi, kia toitū ēnei taonga mō ngā tāngata katoa e noho ana ki tō mātou rohe.”

Ko tētahi o ngā whakatutukinga o Ngā Rotomoana, ko te whakatūnga o tētahi ohu kaitūao, 1,500 tāngata te tokomaha, nā rātou ngā riha moana 180,000 i tango atu i ngā rotomoana o Te Arawa hei wāhi o tētahi kaupapa e tango atu ana i ngā kīrehe me ngā tipu e whakakino ana i ngā rotomoana.

Hei tā Minita Potaka, “Kei te tiro whakamua ahau i runga i te ngākau harikoa ki te whakapūmautanga tonu o tō tātou hononga ki Ngā Rotomoana o Te Arawa me ngā whakatutukinga ā te 100 tau e heke mai ana.”
