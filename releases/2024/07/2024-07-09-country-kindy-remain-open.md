Associate Education Minister David Seymour says that Country Kindy in Manawatu will be able to remain open, after being granted a stay from the Ministry of Education for 12 weeks.

“When I heard of the decision made last week to shut down Country Kindy I was immediately concerned and asked officials to explain," say Mr Seymour.

The Government is currently undergoing a sector review for the Early Childhood Education sector, to address major issues with affordability and availability of early childhood education, and the complexity of its regulation.

“If we can make it easier for educators to focus on children's safety and learning, and less on the paperwork, then it will be the children who benefit most.”
