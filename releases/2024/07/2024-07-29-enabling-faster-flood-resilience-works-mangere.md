The Coalition Government is proposing temporary law changes to make it easier to undertake flood works in Māngere to improve the community’s resilience to severe weather events, Emergency Management and Recovery Minister Mark Mitchell and Environment Minister Penny Simmonds say.

“Māngere was particularly affected by the 2023 Auckland Anniversary floods and Cyclone Gabrielle, which has left homeowners concerned about the impact future severe weather events could have on their homes,” Mr Mitchell says.

“Developing new culverts, dams and other infrastructure will help to improve the flood resilience of these communities.”

A proposed Order in Council under the Severe Weather Emergency Recovery Legislation Act 2023 would make temporary changes to the Resource Management Act, streamlining the resource consenting process for flood resilience work in the Te Ararata and Harania catchments in Māngere.

Once Auckland Council has undertaken these works, approximately 376 properties will be at less risk from future flooding events. This is the equivalent of moving from Category 2C to Category 1 under the Land Categorisation System.

“Auckland Council asked for these temporary law changes, demonstrating the coalition Government’s commitment and support of a locally led recovery,” Mr Mitchell says.

Environment Minister Penny Simmons says flood risk mitigation and resilience projects usually require complex resource consents which can take a year or longer to complete before spades can get in the ground.

“The proposed temporary law changes would allow Auckland Council to get on with the job this summer and give more certainty to homeowners about the future of their homes.”

The proposed Order would come into effect by the end of October 2024 and would expire in October 2028.
