Minister of Internal Affairs Brooke van Velden says the Government’s online safety website for children and young people has reached one million page views. 

“It is great to see so many young people and their families accessing the site *Keep It Real Online* to learn how to stay safe online, and manage any potential digital harms. It has advice and resources for parents, teachers, and young people on a range of topics from online bullying to digital scams to privacy. I have heard from many parents how these topics affect young people everyday,” says Ms van Velden. 

“Both the parents’ and youth sections have recently had additional information added following feedback from the community. More new content is being added to the educators’ section over the coming months.

“I understand many parents have concerns about what their children are seeing online and want to know what they can do to keep them safe. The *Keep It Real Online* website has plenty of advice on how to talk to your kids about these issues as well as information on third party controls available to families, such as filters on search engines and social media,” says Ms van Velden. 

The Keep It Real Online website is managed by the Department of Internal Affairs and can be accessed at [https://www.keepitrealonline.govt.nz/](https://www.keepitrealonline.govt.nz/). It contains information available in Chinese, Hindi, and Samoan as well as English and Māori.
