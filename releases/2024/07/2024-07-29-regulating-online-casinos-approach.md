Minister of Internal Affairs Brooke van Velden says the Government has agreed to a high-level approach to regulating online casinos designed to minimise harm, support tax collection, and provide consumer protections to New Zealanders.

“There will be a licencing system for online casinos, where operators will need to comply with a set of criteria before they will be able to offer services to New Zealanders. It will be illegal for unlicensed operators to offer services to New Zealanders,” says Ms van Velden.

“Licensing is how we regulate most forms of gambling domestically. This is not intended to increase the amount of gambling New Zealanders do but to ensure operators meet requirements for consumer protection and harm minimisation, as well as paying tax.”

There will be a limited number of licences available allocated by auction, with licences lasting three years and being conditional on meeting regulatory requirements. The minimum age for online gambling will be 18, and operators will only be able to offer online casino games, not sports betting or lottery products.

Licensed gambling operators will be allowed to advertise, which is currently prohibited, but with strict limits. Sponsorship by online casinos will remain illegal.

“I expect the new regulatory system to be in place from early 2026 and the public will have the opportunity to provide feedback during the Select Committee process. Once established, the Department of Internal Affairs will be the regulator.”

Further details will be announced later this year.
