Regional Development Minister Shane Jones will hold a series of nationwide summits to discuss regional priorities, aspirations and opportunities, with the first kicking off in Nelson on August 12.

The 15 summits will facilitate conversations about progressing regional economic growth and opportunities to drive productivity, prosperity and resilience through the Coalition Government’s recently launched [Regional Infrastructure Fund](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/regional-infrastructure-fund-opens-applications) (RIF).

“The Government is focused on strengthening and growing our economy. Supporting the regions to prosper is key to achieving this. Through the RIF, we are looking to invest and co-invest in resilience infrastructure that improves regions’ ability to absorb, adapt and respond to stresses and shocks. We will also invest in projects that support growth through well-connected and productive regions.

“We are looking to the regions to identify their priorities themselves, to leverage existing opportunities, investment and strategies, and bolster the ambitions of local communities. This starts with conversations about central government and regional priorities and where they align, how we maximise the impacts of strategic investment and where we can work together.

“The summits are an opportunity for discussions with iwi representatives, local government, business leaders and sector organisations,” Mr Jones says.

Organised by Kānoa, the Regional Economic Development and Investment Unit, the summits will take place over the next six to eight months.
