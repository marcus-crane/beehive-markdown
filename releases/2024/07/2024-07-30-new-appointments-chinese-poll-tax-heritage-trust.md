Ethnic Communities Minister Melissa Lee has today announced the appointment of eight trustees to the Chinese Poll Tax Heritage Trust (the Trust).

The Trust was established in 2004 to promote the preservation of Chinese New Zealand history and awareness of the contribution of early Chinese settlers. It also provides tangible support for the unique history, language, and culture of Chinese New Zealanders.  

The Minister has reappointed Debbie Sew-Hoy, Jennifer Too, Lois Yee, and Rodney Wong for a second term on the Trust. Denise Ng, Eileen Ng, David Wong, and Hector Wong have been appointed for their first terms.

All terms commence on 1 August 2024. The trustees are based around the country and are all direct descendants of original poll tax payers.  

“Along with their involvement in the Chinese and poll tax communities, the trustees bring a valuable mix of skills and experience in governance, community work, business, finance, and directorship to the work of the Trust,” says Ms Lee.

“I thank the outgoing trustees – Paul Chin, Malcolm Wong, Mark Ngan Kee, and Melissa Wong – for their significant contributions to the Trust.”
