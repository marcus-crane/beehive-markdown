Local Government Minister Simeon Brown has announced his intention to appoint a Crown Manager to both Hawke’s Bay Regional and Wairoa District Councils to speed up the delivery of flood protection work in Wairoa.

"Recent severe weather events in Wairoa this year, combined with damage from Cyclone Gabrielle in 2023 have highlighted the township’s high risk of flooding. Both councils have written to me with concerns around the delivery of Crown funded flood protection works following June’s weather event and the implications for the Wairoa community going forward,” Mr Brown says.

“I expect the Crown Manager will focus on progressing the delivery of a flood management catchment plan and flood protection works, providing leadership to ensure the two councils work urgently and effectively together, with the right systems in place.”

The Crown Manager would be specifically focussed on flood protection works which include the use of the $70 million of Crown funding and the management of the Wairoa River bar.

Failing to ensure an efficient and timely delivery of this flood protection work puts Wairoa at risk of future weather events which could leave a significant portion of the town uninhabitable, says Emergency Management and Recovery Minister Mark Mitchell.

“The recent flooding event in Wairoa has been incredibly tough for the people of Wairoa, particularly following the impacts of other severe weather events in the last couple of years.

“The Government recognises how critical flood protection is and has committed to supporting councils to undertake this work,” Mr Mitchell says.

The Local Government Minister has notified the councils of his intention to appoint a Crown Manager, exercising his powers under Part 10 of the Local Government Act 2002. The councils have 10 working days to provide feedback to the Minister on his intended intervention.

Following feedback from the councils, the Minister will consider potential candidates and make a final decision to undertake this intervention prior to formally appointing a Crown Manager to both councils.
