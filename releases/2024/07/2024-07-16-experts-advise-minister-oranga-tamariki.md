The Oranga Tamariki Ministerial Advisory Board has been re-established by the Minister for Children, Karen Chhour.

“I look forward to working with the new board to continue to ensure Oranga Tamariki and the care and protection system, are entirely child centric,” Minister Chhour says.

“The board will provide independent advice on the performance of Oranga Tamariki. 

“Specifically, I have asked the board to focus on continuing the work of devolving decision-making to communities, on implementing the Oranga Tamariki strategic direction, on strengthening the role of caregivers, building professional social work practice, and monitoring organisational culture.”

Appointed to the re-established board are members of the previous board Tā (Sir) Mark Solomon (Chair), Dame Naida Glavish, Shannon Pakura, Alfred (Alf) Filipaina and Ruth Jones, along with new member Christopher (Chris) Graveson. 

The board will report directly to the Minister.

The board’s term is from 1 July 2024 until 30 September 2026.
