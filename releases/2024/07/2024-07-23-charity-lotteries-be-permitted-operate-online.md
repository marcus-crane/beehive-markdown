Minister of Internal Affairs Brooke van Velden says lotteries for charitable purposes, such as those run by the Heart Foundation, Coastguard NZ, and local hospices, will soon be allowed to operate online permanently.

“Under current laws, these fundraising lotteries are only allowed to operate online until October 2024, after which they would be required to return to selling tickets via post or in person. This Government has taken action so that charities can operate their fundraising lotteries online permanently in an increasingly digital world” says Ms van Velden.

As part of the COVID-19 response, these “class three” lotteries (non-commercial fundraising lotteries with a prize value of over $5000) were exempted from the ban on “remote interactive gambling” which allowed them to sell tickets online, but only until 31 October 2024. A return to the old rules would have seen a loss of customers, additional resources required to facilitate the lotteries, and therefore less money going to community purposes for New Zealanders.

“These lotteries are a significant source of funding for some charities and pose a very low risk of causing harm. I am assured that during the time the temporary exemption has been in place people have not been presenting for gambling harm from these types of lotteries.”

“I look forward to passing a bill to make this exemption permanent before 31 October this year, to give charities certainty so they can continue to fundraise in an efficient and effective way. This minor amendment will make a significant difference to the non-profit organisations which use the revenue from lotteries to carry out their services to the community.”
