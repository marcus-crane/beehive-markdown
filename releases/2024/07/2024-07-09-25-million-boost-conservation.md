*Toitū te taiao – our environment endures!* 

New Zealanders will get to enjoy more of our country’s natural beauty including at Cathedral Cove – Mautohe thanks to a $25 million boost for conservation, Conservation Minister Tama Potaka announced today. 

“Te taiao (our environment) is critical for the country’s present and future. Whether it’s the sound of birds in a forest or the sight of whales in the sea – we have intergenerational responsibilities to protect and enhance te taiao so future generations can visit and enjoy too. 

“Some of the projects include reinstating walking access to the beautiful Cathedral Cove – Mautohe in Coromandel after terrible damage from Cyclone Gabrielle. I have confirmed a short-term fix in time for summer. 

“This funding will also help toward eradicating pests from the Maukahuka – Auckland Island - a key step in more than 30 years of work restoring this Subantarctic World Heritage area. 

“Te Papa Atawhai - the Department of Conservation and I are always looking to better protect for our country’s rich biodiversity and special places. 

“The International Visitor Levy supports major projects protecting and enhancing New Zealand’s beautiful flora, fauna and making it easier for New Zealanders to experience nature. 

“The levy is currently a $35 cost that is charged to most international visitors to our shores, which aims to boost conservation and tourism. 

“All of this mahi (work) helps to ensure New Zealanders can continue to enjoy all the benefits of living on the most beautiful country on Earth.”
