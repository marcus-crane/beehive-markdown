Attorney-General Judith Collins today announced the appointment of the first six Family Court Associates, in a move designed to relieve pressure on the Family Court system.

“The associates will take responsibility for much of the initial work required to get cases to the point that a substantive decision can be made, including conducting mediation and settlement conferences and issuing pre-hearing directions.

“There are presently 16,000-plus active cases before the Family Court and the average age of those cases is more than 300 days. These associate roles will free up Family Court Judges to devote more time to hearing and determining substantive matters before the Court.”

The appointees will take up their roles on 2 April 2024. Four will be based in Auckland and two in Christchurch.

Those appointed are:

**Rachel Lohrey:**

Ms Lohrey is a Queenstown-based barrister who is a principal advisor at the Institute of Judicial Studies.  She began practice in Christchurch before moving to Palmerston North, initially as an in-house lawyer at Oranga Tamariki then on to private practice.
