Thirteen Māori students have been awarded Ngarimu VC and 28th (Māori) Battalion Memorial Scholarships and Awards in recognition of their dedication and outstanding achievements, Minister for Education and Ngarimu Board Chair, Erica Stanford announced today.

This year’s recipients include one doctoral candidate, four master’s students, four undergraduate students, two vocational education and training students, and two secondary school students. 

“These scholarships pay homage to the brave men of the 28th (Māori) Battalion and commemorate Victoria Cross winner Second Lieutenant Te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa Ngarimu,” said Ms Stanford.

The scholarships were established in 1945 to assist Māori achievers to succeed in education and to contribute as leaders in New Zealand and overseas. More than 300 scholarships have been awarded since.

“Each and every one of the recipients exemplify commitment, determination, and leadership, just as the valiant men of the 28th (Māori) Battalion did.
