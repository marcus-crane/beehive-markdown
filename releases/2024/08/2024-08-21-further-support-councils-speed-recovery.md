Emergency Management and Recovery Minister Mark Mitchell has allocated $16.8 million of Budget 24 funding to support councils in accelerating recovery efforts following the severe weather events of 2023.

“The funding comes from the Cyclone Recovery Capability Fund which was announced as part of Budget 2024. Councils have said they require additional expertise to speed up their priority recovery projects, and this funding enables exactly that,” Mr Mitchell says.

“It will be distributed to 12 councils, for 50 separate initiatives which councils identified to help get faster outcomes for their communities. 

“This includes additional geotechnical expertise to speed up decision-making on landslide-affected properties, as well as resources to accelerate roading recovery, bridge repairs and flood protection projects in affected regions.

“Recovery is an ongoing process, and we recognise councils are working hard to implement the necessary measures to support recovery in their communities.  

“We are committed to supporting our councils and communities as they continue to rebuild and recover from the devastating impacts of last year's severe weather events. 

“We have been clear we want the recovery projects to be completed faster, and we want communities to have certainty about their future.

“Strengthening resilience is also the focus for a number of these projects to reduce the impact from future weather events and protect communities from future flooding.”
