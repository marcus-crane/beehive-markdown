Minister for Mental Health Matt Doocey says the rollout of mental health support to primary and intermediate school pupils in Hawke’s Bay and Tairawhiti regions will continue.

“The Government has committed sustainable funding to the phased rollout of Mana Ake, which will grow to $3.7 million a year by 2026/27. This will ensure these services will remain intact and available for young people needing mental wellbeing support,” Mr Doocey says.

Mana Ake is a school-based mental wellbeing programme that helps children learn skills such as coping with change or challenges, managing their emotions, building positive relationships and overcoming grief and loss.

It also provides advice, guidance and workshops for parents, whānau and teachers so they can respond to and support the wellbeing needs of children.

“Once fully rolled out, Mana Ake will provide in-school wellbeing and mental resilience support and be available to around 25,500 students across more than 130 primary and intermediate schools in the regions,” Mr Doocey says.

“Early intervention and prevention is one of my priorities. I’ve committed to it in my mental health targets also as we know it’s one of the best ways to increase access and encourage better mental wellbeing for young New Zealanders.

“Early intervention has the further advantage of setting up young New Zealanders to maintain better mental wellbeing throughout their lives. This is a strong example of a social return on investment.”
