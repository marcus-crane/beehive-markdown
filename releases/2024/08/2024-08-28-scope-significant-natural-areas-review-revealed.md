The Government has decided the scope of a review that will consider how significant natural areas (SNAs) should be identified, assessed and managed, Associate Environment Minister Andrew Hoggard announced today.

In May, the Government introduced a Bill that proposes to suspend requirements for councils to identify new SNAs to provide time for a review of SNA provisions in the National Policy Statement for Indigenous Biodiversity (NPS-IB).

Ministers have now decided the scope of this review which will look at: criteria for identifying SNAs; assessment and identification processes; and the management of land subject to SNAs.

Mr Hoggard says the Coalition Government is delivering on its commitment to cease the implementation of new SNAs and review their operation.

“We campaigned on the importance of individual property rights and we intend to deliver. In their current form, SNAs identified on private property limit new activities and development, and in my view, will likely undermine voluntary conservation efforts.

The review will examine what criteria and process set out in the NPSIB to identify SNAs. 

“I want to make sure that the most unique environments are sensibly protected, without putting undue restrictions on land use change.

Mr Hoggard says he agreed the scope of the review in discussions with the Minister for the Environment, Minister of Conservation and Minister for Māori Crown Relations.

Officials will develop policy options and seek input from groups and individuals with in-depth technical knowledge, including ecologists, officials from local government, Māori and landowners.

Any changes to the NPS-IB will be progressed as part of the Government’s resource management reforms, which will include changes to national direction. The public would have an opportunity to provide feedback on these changes in the first quarter of 2025. Cabinet would make final decisions on national direction changes in mid-2025.

“We want to give certainty to councils and communities as soon as possible.” Mr Hoggard says.

**Notes to editors:** 

Under the NPS-IB, an area qualifies as an SNA if it meets any one of the attributes of the following four criteria: (a) representativeness; (b) diversity and pattern; (c) rarity and distinctiveness and (d) ecological context and once the council has followed processes for consultation and engagement with landowners.

National direction supports local decision-making under the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA). It is provided by national policy statements, national environmental standards, national planning standards and section 360 regulations.

In May, the Government introduced a Resource Management (Freshwater and Other Matters) Amendment Bill which proposes, amongst other matters, to suspend for three years NPS-IB requirements for councils to identify new SNAs and include them in district plans. The Bill also extends some SNA implementation timeframes to 31 December 2030.

The obligation to protect indigenous biodiversity under the Resource Management Act is unaffected by the suspension. Other NPS-IB provisions including the management of existing SNAs will continue to apply.
