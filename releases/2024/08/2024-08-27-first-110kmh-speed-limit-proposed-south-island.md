Proposed speed limit increases to 110km/h on State Highway 1/76 Christchurch Southern Motorway to Rolleston will mean faster journey times for Kiwis travelling in and out of Christchurch from the south and has been welcomed by Transport Minister Simeon Brown.

“Boosting economic growth and productivity is a key part of the Government’s plan to rebuild the economy. This proposal supports that outcome by reducing travel times and increasing efficiency on this key South Island freight route.

“Started by the previous National Government as a Road of National Significance, the Christchurch Southern Motorway has reduced congestion, and improved safety and travel time reliability.

“We know how critical this connection is for motorists and freight operators, and we’re committed to ensuring that this state highway enables people to get to where they want to go, quickly and safely.”

These sections of State Highway 1/76 were built to a high safety standard and have delivered strong safety benefits for those travelling in and out of Christchurch.

“These motorways have safety features that greatly reduce the risk of death or serious injury in a crash, including two lanes in each direction, flexible median barrier between opposing lanes, and a smooth alignment that offers good forward visibility for drivers.

“Delivering 110km/h speed limits on Roads of National Significance where it’s safe to do so is another part of our Government's Accelerate NZ plan to grow the economy, reduce travel times and increase productivity on our transport network,” Mr Brown says.

Consultation on raising the speed limit for the Christchurch Southern Motorway to 110km/h - from east of Curletts Road interchange, Addington, to west of Weedons Road interchange, Rolleston – begins on 3 September and closes on 1 October.
