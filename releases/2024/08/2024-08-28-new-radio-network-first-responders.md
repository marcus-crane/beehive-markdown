The Coalition Government today welcomed the launch of a new national radio network that will provide emergency responders with the modern, resilient, secure radio communications technology they need, says Emergency Management and Recovery Minister, Mark Mitchell and Internal Affairs Minister, Brooke van Velden.

The first component of the Public Safety Network Land Mobile Radio (LMR) network is a pilot area in South Canterbury consisting of eight [digital radio transmission sites](https://www.ngcc.govt.nz/public-safety-network/land-mobile-radio/). Emergency services will use this ‘pilot’ area to test new radios using operational scenarios. This will inform the following eleven-region roll-out of the LMR network to emergency services across the country through until 2026.

“The jobs of our first responders - Ambulance Officers, Fire Fighters, and Police Officers are not easy. They go willingly into situations and places that most New Zealanders do not have to go. They put a lot at risk to keep New Zealanders safe,” says Mr Mitchell.

“Reliable, secure-modern communications are vital to frontline responders. The new Land Mobile Radio network will help coordinate these services, for the safety, wellbeing and prosperity of all New Zealanders.”

The network will be fully encrypted, meaning only emergency services personnel can access transmissions.

“Eliminating outside disruption will be a game-changer for our emergency services, ensuring greater safety of frontline staff and for the security of the information they are sharing,” says Mr Mitchell.

Ms. van Velden says she’s excited about the benefits the new network will bring for safety, operational efficiency and productivity for fire and emergency personnel as they respond to members of the community in need.

“For the first time in New Zealand’s history, the four emergency services agencies will share the same radio network. This will enable greater interoperability between the organisations, bring improved efficiencies and safety for frontline staff – and ultimately, benefit the communities they serve.”

 

**Notes to editors:**

The Public Safety Network is a significant infrastructure project, investing $1.4 billion over 10 years to build and operate the networks and services, and roll out new devices to emergency services staff, stations and vehicles.

The [LMR network](https://www.ngcc.govt.nz/public-safety-network/land-mobile-radio/) is one part of the [Public Safety Network being delivered by Next Generation Critical Communications on behalf of Police, Fire and Emergency New Zealand, Wellington Free Ambulance and Hato Hone St John.](https://ngcc.govt.nz/public-safety-network) 

The LMR will sit alongside the second component of the Public Safety Network, Cellular Services. Cellular Roaming (live since July 2023) now has 14,000 emergency services users who can roam across Spark and One NZ networks, and Cellular Priority will be live in late 2024.

The third element of the Public Safety Network involves the modernisation of ‘personal alerting’ technology. This is available to Fire and Emergency NZ and Hato Hone St John, including for use to mobilise their volunteer workforce.

Delivery of the LMR will start in Canterbury, Wellington and Auckland in 2025, followed by the project’s remaining eight regions throughout 2025 and 2026.
