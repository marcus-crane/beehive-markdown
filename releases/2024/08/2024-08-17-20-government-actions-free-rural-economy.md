Hard working men and women of rural NZ are doing their bit to help rebuild our economy, Agriculture Minister Todd McClay announced today.

“With interest rates and on farm inflation having turned a corner, farmers continue to innovate and boost productivity while working to meet environmental obligations.

“With 80 per cent of all the goods exports coming from the primary sector and more than 350,000 kiwis employed because of rural activity, farming, forestry, and horticulture remains a mainstay of the NZ economic activity.”

Mr McClay says the Government’s ambitious target of doubling exports by value over ten years is an opportunity to work with the primary sector to add value and deliver greater returns at the farm gate.

“The Government has huge respect for our farmers and foresters. We will continue to partner with them to drive down costs, simplify regulations and build trust as we get Wellington out of farming.”

Already we have: 

- Disbanded He Waka Eke Noa
- Removed Agriculture from the ETS
- Restored common sense to intensive winter grazing and stock exclusion rules

The Government’s agricultural team, of Agriculture Minister Todd McClay, Biosecurity, Food Safety and Associate Minister responsible for Animal Welfare Andrew Hoggard, Rural Communities Minister Mark Patterson and Associate Minister responsible for Horticulture Nicola Grigg, are working hard to deliver for the primary sector.

“This Government trusts farmers and will continue to back them to deliver for NZ, Rural communities can be assured that we have the best and most connected team of Ministers from all over New Zealand working hard on delivering for them” Mr McClay says.
