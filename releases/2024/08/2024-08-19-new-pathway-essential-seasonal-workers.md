The coalition Government is providing immediate relief to employers with upcoming seasonal peaks by creating a new subcategory of the Specific Purpose Work Visa (SPWV).

“We know in the coming months a number of sectors will need a significant number of additional workers to undertake key seasonal roles.

“Alongside the changes to the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) scheme, we’re also making it easier for employers to access other essential seasonal workers they need. This is an interim, time-limited, streamlined pathway and is more in line with the length of seasonal work,” Immigration Minister Erica Stanford says.

“This pathway will continue to have some key requirements to support the integrity of our immigration system and provide New Zealanders with the first opportunity for roles. This includes requiring the role be advertised by employers that have AEWV accreditation, the role pays at least $29.66 an hour and is for at least 30 hours a week. Reflecting seasonality, the role must not exceed 9 months in duration.

To be eligible, the role must be directly related to seasonal activity and the applicant must have at least four months experience in the role and start on or before 31 May 2025.

Roles that are ordinarily undertaken by RSE workers in the horticulture and viticulture industries are excluded, as is fishing crew work excluded, as these are covered by other visas. Applications must be received on or before 31 March 2025.

“I will be considering the need for a more permanent, long-term pathway for seasonal workers as part of the ongoing AEWV review,” Ms Stanford says.

“This change is a step forward in creating a smarter immigration system that creates opportunities for people to come here but also protects New Zealanders rights to work and thrive.”
