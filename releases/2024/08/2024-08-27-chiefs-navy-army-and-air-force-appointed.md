Defence Minister Judith Collins today announced Commodore Garin Golding, Brigadier Rose King and Air Vice-Marshal Darryn Webb as the chiefs of the Navy, Army and Air Force respectively. 

“These accomplished leaders are the New Zealand Defence Force’s (NZDF) most senior officers in their service, bringing a wealth of experience and strategic insight and being dedicated to serving our country,” Ms Collins says.

“The Government is committed to ensuring the NZDF is well-led and well-prepared to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex global security environment.

“I look forward to working closely with them and advancing the Government’s commitment to strengthening New Zealand’s security and contributing to global peace and stability.”

The service chiefs will command their service while reporting to the Chief of Defence Force and advising the Minister of Defence. They are appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Minister of Defence. 

All three have been appointed for three years from 27 August. Commodore Golding will be promoted to Rear Admiral and Brigadier King to Major General. Air Vice-Marshal Webb, who has been Chief of Air Force since last year, will retain his current rank.

The NZDF leadership change is completed by Chief of Defence Force Air Marshal Tony Davies’ appointments of Commodore Mat Williams as Vice Chief of Defence Force and Brigadier Rob Krushka as Commander Joint Forces New Zealand. 

“I welcome these appointments and look forward to working with my senior leadership team over the next three years,” Air Marshal Davies says.

Commodore Williams takes up his new role on 27 August and Brigadier Krushka on 30 August. Their ranks will change to Rear Admiral and Major General respectively with their promotions.
