The government is boosting support for farmers impacted by the ongoing drought in North Canterbury, Rural Communities Minister Mark Patterson announced today.

A lack of rain has left farms short of feed, with pasture and crops failing to grow.

“Prolonged dry weather and challenging financial conditions have made circumstances extremely tough for farmers in the Hurunui District,” Mr Patterson says.

Many farmers have been using good management practices, such as reducing livestock numbers, to get through the drought. As lambing and calving gets underway, extra one-off support is needed.

During his visit to affected farms, Mr Patterson announced “The government, is providing $20,000, with the Farmers Adverse Events Trust, Veterinary Association and Boehringer Ingelheim contributing an additional $18,000, to deliver specialist veterinary support to drought-affected farmers in the Hurunui District.”

“A further $30,000 contribution will go to the Hurunui Mayoral Fund to ensure targeted assistance is available to those farmers identified the most critical in need.”

The latest support measures come on top of funding provided to the region earlier this year.

“In March, extremely dry weather conditions were classified a medium-scale adverse event across multiple regions. That classification unlocked around $170,000 in extra funding for Rural Support Trusts to provide early on-the-ground support for affected farmers,’ Mr Patterson says.

“Tax relief is available through the Income Equalisation Scheme, which is designed to help with on farm cashflow.”

“The Ministry for Primary Industries’, On Farm Support service will continue to work closely with farmers and growers to determine where support is required.”

Mr Patterson encouraged farmers across the district who need support, to contact their local Rural Support Trust on 0800 787 254.
