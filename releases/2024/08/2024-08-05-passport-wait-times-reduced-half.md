Internal Affairs Minister Brooke van Velden says wait times for passports have halved since an upgrade to the passport processing software in March caused unexpected delays to passport processing times.

“As of Tuesday 6 August, the passport application queue has reduced by over 57 per cent - 31,000 applications down from a peak of 53,847 at the beginning of May, and wait times have halved,” says Ms van Velden.

“In the month of July, the Department of Internal Affairs \[the Department] issued 50,397 passports – over 10,700 more passports than applications it received.”

Of the passports issued by the Department in July, 83 per cent were issued within 6 weeks. Of the passports issued by the Department in July, 91 per cent were applied for online and 32 per cent were group applications.

“The upgrade to the passports system implemented in March was the most significant in over a decade. I am pleased that Kiwis can use the new options that make applying for a passport online a lot easier,” says Ms van Velden.

“The Department officials have assured me that it continues to work hard to reduce wait times and has measures in place to meet its upcoming goals.

Passport wait times have been steadily reducing. The Department is currently advising applicants to allow up to five weeks plus delivery for a standard passport, down from 10 weeks as reported in May. This timeframe is provided as a reference to ensure customers are aware of the time it may take to issue their passport and can plan accordingly. However, most passports are being issued faster than that.

“Reducing passport processing times continues to be a key priority for the Department,” says Ms van Velden.
