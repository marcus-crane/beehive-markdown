Forestry Minister Todd McClay today announced the establishment of the ‘Tairāwhiti Forestry Action Group’ to expedite wood clean-up in Tairāwhiti and help implement best practice for forestry.   

“This is an important next step to ensure the on-going clean-up of wood and mitigation of future risk across the Tairāwhiti region,” Todd McClay says.

“The Government announced an additional $27 million in Budget 2024 for further removal and treatment of wood debris that presents a risk to life, infrastructure, and property. This brings the Government’s total funding for Tairāwhiti debris and sediment removal to over $110 million, with over 440,000 tonnes of debris removed from catchments and beaches to date.

“This Action Group will bring together the right stakeholders and expertise to accelerate clean-up and deliver ongoing outcomes for the region.”

The Action Group includes representatives from Gisborne District Council (GDC); the forestry industry including owners and contractors; the farming sector; and iwi.

“It is important that all stakeholders build a constructive relationship to deal with these challenges, and that taxpayers can have confidence that Government funding is being used effectively. The Action Group will greatly assist GDC in this,” Mr McClay says.

**RMA Slash Reform**

Mr McClay also announced the Government’s intention to reform the Resource Management Act (RMA) to improve slash management standards and clarify rules around low-risk slash. 

Changes made by the previous government have added costs without equal environmental gain, frustrating both councils and forestry companies alike.

The Government will review settings in the National Environmental Standards for Commercial Forestry (NES-CF) to set a nationally consistent standard and help councils better manage high risk areas while supporting forestry’s contribution to jobs and regional economic growth.

“Forestry is an important part of New Zealand’s economy and a big contributor to meeting our climate change obligations. We now need to reduce cost and get the rules right, " Mr McClay said.
