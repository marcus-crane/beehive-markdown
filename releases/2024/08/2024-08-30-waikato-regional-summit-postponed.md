A Waikato Regional Growth Summit planned for next Tuesday in Hamilton has been postponed following the passing of Kiingi Tuuheitia Pootatau Te Wherowhero VII, Regional Development Minister Shane Jones says.

“I join the many voices already that have expressed sorrow at this news and offer my condolences and aroha to Kiingi Tuuheitia’s whānau, the Kiingitanga movement and Tainui.

“Many local leaders had committed to attending the Waikato Regional Growth Summit I was to host next Tuesday (3 September) but the focus is now, quite rightly, on remembering Te Kiingi and planning for his tangihanga.

“I have decided to reschedule the summit out of respect for this, and to ensure Tainui and the wider Māori community have their views heard at this important regional discussion,” Mr Jones says.

Details about the Waikato Regional Summit, including a new date, will be released in due course.
