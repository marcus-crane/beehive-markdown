Transport Minister Simeon Brown has today announced a refreshed board for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to ensure that the organisation is focussed on delivery.

Mark Darrow has been appointed as the new Chair, while Darin Cusack has been appointed as Deputy Chair. Terry Murdoch, Simon Craddock and Louise Pengelly have been appointed as board members for a three-year term ending 31 July 2027, joining current board members Jill Hatchwell and Charles Spillane.

“As Chair, Mark Darrow brings a wealth of experience to the CAA Board with a strong background in business, governance and leadership that will complement the aviation and management skills of other Board members,” Mr Brown says.

“The new appointments announced today ensures that the CAA has the leadership and experience needed to keep New Zealand’s aviation system safe and secure, while ensuring the CAA is achieving value for money and enabling growth in the aviation sector with emerging aviation technologies.

“The refreshed Board will be responsible for implementing a new direction for the CAA to ensure faster approval times for aviation certificates, reduced queue times for Aviation Security and making sure that the CAA is focussed on ensuring aviation is able to contribute New Zealand’s economic growth.

“Alongside the refreshed Board, the CAA is expected to reduce the unacceptable processing times facing licence applicants in the aviation sector through its Statement of Performance Expectations. This includes processing times for approving Part 102 unmanned aircraft operators, which has risen to an average of 11 months.

“Delivering the frontline services New Zealanders need in an efficient way is a priority for our Government, which is why we’ve appointed Board members that will focus the CAA on improving efficiencies to support economic growth.

“I would like to thank the departing chair Janice Fredric and board members, Alma Hong and Hon Harry Duynhoven, for their services to the Board. I look forward to working with the new members as they begin their terms.”
