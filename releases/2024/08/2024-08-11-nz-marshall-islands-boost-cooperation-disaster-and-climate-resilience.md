New Zealand and the Republic of Marshall Islands will cooperate more closely, including on making island communities more resilient in the face of disasters and the impacts of climate change, Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters says. 

“New Zealand is committed to addressing the ‘Blue Continent’ challenges, including those in the Marshall Islands. For that reason, we are investing more in supporting a resilient and prosperous Marshall Islands,” Mr Peters says, during an ongoing visit to Majuro.

New Zealand will invest $6.2 million in a project aimed at helping the Marshalls to better prepare for and adapt to risks relating to natural disasters and climate change.

“The Marshall Islands, as a nation of low-lying atolls and islands, is at the forefront of natural disasters and the impacts of climate change, and our support reflects that,” Mr Peters says.

Mr Peters is accompanied in the Marshall Islands by Chair of the Labour Pacific Caucus, Hon Jenny Salesa; Chair of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee (FADTC) Tim van de Molen; and FADTC member Teanau Tuiono.

While in Marshall Islands, the New Zealand delegation is meeting President Hilda Heine, Minister-in Assistance Bremity Lakjohn, Foreign Minister Kalani Kaneko and other Ministers and Members of Parliament to discuss shared priorities and perspectives on regional issues.

Marshall Islands is the second destination of the delegation’s four-country Pacific tour, following Fiji and to be followed by the Federated States of Micronesia and Palau.
