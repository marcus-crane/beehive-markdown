Internal Affairs Minister Brooke van Velden says the Government has finalised the detailed terms of reference for Phase 2 of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into COVID-19 Lessons. 

“These terms of reference reflect the decision taken by the Government in June to establish Phase 2 of the Royal Commission. Both the ACT-National and New Zealand First-National coalition agreements include commitments to expanding the inquiry to cover outstanding matters of public concern,” says Ms van Velden.

“Phase 2 of the Inquiry will review key decisions taken by the Government in 2021 and 2022 related to the use of vaccines and the use of lockdowns, in particular the extended lockdowns in Auckland and Northland. The Inquiry will assess whether key decisions struck a reasonable balance between public health goals and social and economic disruption -such as health and education outcomes.”

“Phase 2 of the Inquiry will also assess the impact of decisions taken on inflation, debt, and business activity. Public hearings may be used where appropriate.”

“I am pleased to announce that Grant Illingworth KC has been appointed as the Chair of Phase 2 of the Inquiry. Mr Illingworth joined the Inquiry in July to support the final stages of Phase 1 and will assist the Inquiry in transitioning to Phase 2.”

“I am also pleased to announce that Mr Illingworth will be joined by Judy Kavanagh and Anthony Hill, who have been appointed as Commissioners for Phase 2. Their experience in economics and public health respectively will benefit the Inquiry in achieving its purpose.”

The Commissioners for Phase 1, Professor Tony Blakely and John Whitehead, will resign from their roles following the conclusion of Phase 1 on 28 November 2024.

“The detailed terms of reference for Phase 2 of the Inquiry will address outstanding matters of public concern. I am looking forward to the future of the Inquiry and seeing the findings and recommendations made public at the end of Phase 2 in early 2026,” says Ms van Velden.
