Levies paid by the fishing industry have been cut to help support the sector to increase its value to New Zealand through exports and jobs, Oceans and Fisheries Minister Shane Jones says.

The industry pays an annual Fisheries and Conservation Services Levy to the Government to cover a range of costs including fishing boat observers, science and administrative services.

“The levy has been rising over recent years and the clear message from the fishers is that they are doing it tough in the current economic climate and need some relief,” Mr Jones says.

“I support annual levies to cover service costs but they have to be appropriate, justified and practical. This year’s levies have been reviewed line-by-line to see where savings can be made without reducing the service and without threatening the sustainability of the industry.

“This process has included meaningful and constructive consultation with industry itself.”

The 2024/25 levy has reduced from $41.2 million to $36.3m, including reductions in payments to Fisheries New Zealand and the Department of Conservation as well as the return of $3.2m in accrued overcharges.

“The fishing industry is responsible for more than $2 billion in exports and employs around 9000 people in communities around the country. We need to support it so it can grow and generate more significant benefits to New Zealand.

“The first step is cutting unnecessary costs and dismantling bureaucratic roadblocks. Conversations with the industry will continue to look for more ways to make savings. At minimum that will mean greater and earlier involvement from the industry in the cost recovery planning process and more transparency so fishers know exactly what they are paying for,” Mr Jones says.
