Oceans and Fisheries Minister Shane Jones is streamlining high-level oceans management while maintaining a focus on supporting the sector’s role in the export-led recovery of the economy.

“I am working to realise the untapped potential of our fishing and aquaculture sector. To achieve that we need to be smarter with our resources and work more efficiently across departments and government ministers. This means cutting out unnecessary bureaucracy,” Mr Jones says.

The Oceans Secretariat, created in 2021 by the previous government, has been disestablished and ministers with portfolio responsibilities for oceans will now meet only on an as-needed basis, rather than regular meetings filled with officials, Minister Jones says.

“Along with my colleagues with shared responsibilities for marine system management, I remain committed to ensuring the health of the marine environment while supporting the economic opportunities it offers.”

The Oceans Secretariat comprised officials from relevant agencies including Ministry for Primary Industries, Ministry for the Environment and Department of Conservation. The agencies will continue to work together and provide joined-up advice when required.

“The Coalition Government is focused on rebuilding the economy and easing the cost of living. The primary industries, including fisheries and aquaculture, are a ticket to greater prosperity but need our support to thrive as they should.

“To get there, we need to cut unnecessary red tape, and my work alongside my ministerial colleagues on much-needed reforms to the Resource Management Act is one part of that.

“In the meantime, I will continue to work with my colleagues in the oceans space to progress initiatives related to fisheries and aquaculture, international agreements and marine protection.”
