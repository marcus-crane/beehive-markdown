Regional Development Minister Shane Jones today attended the official opening of Kaikohe’s new $14.7 million sports complex.

“The completion of the Kaikohe Multi Sports Complex is a fantastic achievement for the Far North,” Mr Jones says.

“This facility not only fulfils a long-held dream for local athletes, but also creates a valuable resource for the entire community. It will foster physical activity, encourage healthy lifestyles, and attract events that will contribute to the region’s economy.”

A total of $6.8m in grants was provided through the COVID-Response and Recovery Fund (CRRF) for the construction of a new multi-purpose facility, toilet, access and carpark. Work started on the project in February 2021.

“It’s difficult to overstate the positive flow-on effects of investments like this. The project engaged more than 45 local, regional and national businesses in its delivery. This not only benefits the community with upgraded infrastructure, but it also kept people employed during quiet economic times.” Mr Jones says. 

The Kaikohe Multi Sports Complex is part of the $12.3 million Mid-North Sports Package, a CRRF-funded initiative to revitalise infrastructure across the region. It also included projects like the Kerikeri Domain revitalisation and development of Waipapa sports fields which is set to be completed in June 2024.

Regional Development funding for Te Tai Tokerau includes $797 million from the Provincial Growth Fund. This has generated $1.19 billion in increased spending, making up 5 per cent of the region's GDP and created 5571 full time jobs.
