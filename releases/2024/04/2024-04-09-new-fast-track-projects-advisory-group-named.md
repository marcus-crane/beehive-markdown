The coalition Government has today announced the expert advisory group who will provide independent recommendations to Ministers on projects to be included in the Fast Track Approvals Bill, say RMA Reform Minister Chris Bishop and Regional Development Minister Shane Jones.

“Our Fast Track Approval process will make it easier and faster to build regionally and nationally significant projects as part of the Government’s plan to rebuild the economy and get it working for all Kiwis. It is only through a strong economy that we can solve the cost of living crisis, lift incomes and afford the public services Kiwis deserve.”

“The advisory group members are David Tapsell, Rosie Mercer, Vaughan Wilkinson, David Hunt, Mark Davey and Murray Parrish,” Mr Bishop says.

“Collectively they bring many years’ experience working on infrastructure and economic development projects, environment and conservation initiatives, with local government and on Treaty of Waitangi arrangements.

“Advice from this highly experienced group adds another layer of expert analysis to the proposed fast-track process. It’s great that these high-calibre Advisory Group members are on board to ensure the process is transparent, and to thoroughly evaluate the suitability of projects.”

“The coalition Government is establishing a permanent, ‘one-stop-shop’ fast-track approvals regime to speed up delivery of the infrastructure and major development projects needed to get the country moving again,” says Regional Development Minister Shane Jones.

“Having the expert Advisory Group in place is another important step in ensuring the fast-track process delivers the projects our regions need.”   

The Fast Track Approvals Bill was referred to the Environment Committee on 7 March and does not currently contain any projects in either Schedule 2A or 2B of the Bill.

Projects listed in Schedule 2A of the Bill will be automatically referred into the fast-track process laid out in the Bill, and the listing of a project in Schedule 2B of the Bill will mean it is required to be taken into account by Ministers if and when a project comes before them for referral into fast-track.

Project applications – by either the public or private sectors – can now be made to the Ministry of Environment until 3 May. The Fast Track Advisory Group will then look carefully at the projects and provide independent recommendations to the Ministers of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Transport.

Ministers will consider the recommendations and decide which projects to include in the Bill.

**Notes to Editor:**

The Advisory Group will be engaged between April and July 2024, and will be supported by the Ministry for the Environment and Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.  

The Fast-track Approvals Bill was introduced to Parliament for Select Committee review on 7 March 2024. Submissions on the Bill close on 19 April 2024.
