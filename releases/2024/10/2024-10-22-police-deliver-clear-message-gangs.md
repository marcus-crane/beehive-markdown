Today, Police dealt a significant blow to the Mongrel Mob Barbarians in Opotiki with the execution of over thirty search warrants across the North Island, and sent a clear message that the misery and violence that they cause will not be tolerated, says Police Minister Mark Mitchell.

“I want to thank the police officers involved for the outstanding work that has led to today’s arrests, seizure of property and drugs as part of Operation Highwater, a 10-month investigation in response to violent crime and offending in the town.

“Towns like Opotiki suffer heavily from the drugs and misery that gangs peddle– especially when children and schools are targeted for distribution.

“They also suffer from the senseless violence and besieging of towns and communities, that Police say has been stopped in its tracks by the operation today.

“I want to reiterate Superintendent Tim Anderson’s message for gangs: Police will find you and hold you accountable for your destructive behaviour. They will continue to relentlessly pursue criminals who prey on our communities and cause a huge amount of harm and misery.

“The operations this morning come the day after Police stood up their Gang Disruption Unit in the Bay of Plenty. That unit has continued this afternoon to target and harass gang members across the district, a clear example of how effective these disruption units are.

“Gang members cause significant and disproportionate harm to Kiwis, and by focusing resources on them Police will continue to disrupt criminal activity and prevent the harm it causes in our communities.

“From 21 November, the Gang Disruption Units will be significantly powered up with the Government’s new tools to get rid of gang patches, disperse gang gatherings and prevent known gang members consorting to commit crime.

“The Government is committed to restoring law and order and today’s operation marks a turning point in getting that job done.”
