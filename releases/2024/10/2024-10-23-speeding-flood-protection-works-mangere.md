An Order in Council to speed up flood mitigation works for hundreds of at-risk properties in Mangere, Auckland, has been approved, Environment Minister Penny Simmonds and Minister for Emergency Management and Recovery Mark Mitchell say.

“The Auckland Anniversary weekend floods and Cyclone Gabrielle in early 2023 had a devastating impact on many communities and thousands of people across Auckland,” Ms Simmonds says.

“Te Ararata and Harania in Māngere were among the hardest-hit areas, with 376 properties at risk of flooding again.”

To address vulnerabilities, Auckland Council proposes to undertake flood protection works in these areas.

“The works aim to reduce the flood risk to life and property and increase the resilience of infrastructure for the wider community,” Mr Mitchell says.

The construction of these types of works usually requires complex resource consents.

“Typically, the process for granting these consents would take a year or longer, but the Order in Council will speed up the process, allowing works to start this summer,” Ms Simmonds says.

Orders in Council under the Severe Weather Emergency Recovery Legislation Act 2023 allow the Government to make temporary law changes to help communities continue their recovery from the severe weather events of early 2023.

The temporary law change has been developed in response to a request from Auckland Council, following a community consultation exercise.

“Ministry for the Environment (MfE) officials have worked closely with Auckland Council staff to deliver on the Government’s commitment to a recovery that is locally led with central support,” Ms Simmonds says.

The Order in Council will be effective from late October and will expire on 31 March 2028, with a 12-month review planned to assess its ongoing suitability for the project timeline.
