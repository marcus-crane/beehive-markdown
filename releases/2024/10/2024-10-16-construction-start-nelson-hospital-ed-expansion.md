Health Minister Dr Shane Reti says construction on a significant expansion to Nelson Hospital’s emergency department marks a major milestone in work to improve services for the local community.

“Next week, Health New Zealand will be breaking ground on a $10.6 million expansion to the existing ED, which will increase its capacity, provide a more functional and efficient workspace for staff and a more comfortable environment for patients,” says Dr Reti.

The expansion will provide:

- six additional patient spaces, including two new isolation rooms and a state-of-the-art negative pressure pod, improving the ability to manage and contain infectious diseases
- a new fast-track area for patients who can be treated and discharged quickly
- two dedicated mental health consultation rooms
- an additional triage room
- a whānau room.

“Last month, approximately 78 per cent of patients spent less than six hours in Nelson Hospital ED.

“This is another example of our Government’s commitment to achieving our target of 95 per cent of patients being admitted, discharged or transferred from an ED within six hours.

“These additions will help reduce wait times for patients, ultimately helping provide more timely access to quality healthcare.”

The ED expansion is part of a broader plan to redevelop Nelson Hospital.

“Providing care to the local community remains our priority and careful planning means existing ED services will remain open as usual,” says Dr Reti.

“I want to assure the people of Nelson, wider Tasman and Marlborough regions that the Government remains committed to delivering a hospital that meets their needs and provides modern models of care.

“The redevelopment of Nelson Hospital is important to provide timely access to quality healthcare for the people of the Top of the South.”
