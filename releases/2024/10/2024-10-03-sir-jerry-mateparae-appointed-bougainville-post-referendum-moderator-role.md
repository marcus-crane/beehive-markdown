Foreign Minister Winston Peters has welcomed the announcement of Sir Jerry Mateparae as an independent moderator, to work with the Government of Papua New Guinea and the Autonomous Bougainville Government in resolving outstanding issues on Bougainville’s future.

“New Zealand is an enduring friend to Papua New Guinea and the Autonomous Region of Bougainville and has provided long-running support to the Bougainville peace process,” Mr Peters says.

“Sir Jerry is eminently qualified for the role of moderator, having served as the Governor-General of New Zealand, Chief of Defence Force, and Commander of the Truce Monitoring Group in Bougainville during Operation Belisi.”

Sir Jerry has been in Port Moresby this week engaging in initial conversations with leaders about the moderator role. The announcement of Sir Jerry’s appointment was made following a joint meeting with Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Marape and Autonomous Bougainville Government President Toroama after their consideration of several high-profile candidates.

“We hope that Sir Jerry’s engagement will assist Papua New Guinea and Bougainville to progress post-referendum consultations and decisions on Bougainville’s future, in a way that that sustains the peace and progress of the last 25 years,” Mr Peters says.
