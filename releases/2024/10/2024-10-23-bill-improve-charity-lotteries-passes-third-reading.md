Minister of Internal Affairs Brooke van Velden says lotteries run by charities such as Pet Refuge and the Heart Foundation can now operate and advertise online permanently.

“Temporary legislation that allowed lotteries for non-commercial to operate online was due to expire at the end of October, which would have forced charities who use these lotteries to return to selling tickets in person or by post, and to take down any digital advertising”, says Ms van Velden.

“In an increasingly digital world this would have had significant negative impacts on the ability of charities to fundraise. There are additional operational costs involved with selling tickets in person and a reduced ability to reach customers, decreasing the revenue that can be put towards vital work in our communities.”

“This Government has taken quick action to allow these lotteries to operate online permanently, so they can continue to fundraise in an efficient and effective way. I have heard from many well-loved Kiwi charities about the significant difference this change will have for them, including Pet Refuge and the Heart Foundation.”

“We know these charities make a difference in the lives of New Zealanders and their families every day, and I am pleased that this change will allow them to continue to do so.

“My Bill to make this permanent change passed its third reading last night, providing certainty to non-profit organisations that they can continue to promote their lotteries without worrying about falling outside of the law by doing so.

“I give my thanks to all those who submitted on the Bill during select committee, and the many community organisations in New Zealand for their service to local communities.”

There are currently 46 organisations licensed to offer these charitable lotteries, from well-known charities like the Coastguard and Auckland Rescue Helicopter through to small community sport clubs in Dunedin and Whangārei.
