New Zealand will contribute $20 million to the Pacific Resilience Facility, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters have announced.

“The Pacific Islands region faces severe challenges from natural disasters and climate change impacts and New Zealand is committed to doing its part to help meet them,” Mr Luxon says. 

“We’re joining with other countries in helping to progress the Pacific Resilience Facility, which will encourage public and private sector investment in preparedness for natural disasters and resilience to the effects of climate change.” 

Mr Peters says the Pacific Resilience Facility will help ensure Pacific Island countries have access to the climate finance they need. 

“We urge more countries to join us in making it a reality. The Facility’s focus on community-level projects will ensure practical benefits for Pacific Island communities. It is also a demonstration of what our region can achieve collectively.

“As we head into COP29 next month, where a new global climate finance goal will be agreed, it’s important to emphasise small island states and their communities need climate finance that they can actually access.” 

Mr Luxon and Mr Peters made the announcement today while in Samoa for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.
