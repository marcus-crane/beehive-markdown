*He toi whakairo, he mana tangata.*

The reappointment of one trustee and the appointment of four new trustees to the Te Māori Manaaki Taonga Trust Board will enable the legacy of Te Māori to be carried forward into the future, Māori Development Minister Tama Potaka and Arts Minister Paul Goldsmith have announced.

**Mr Arapata Hakiwai** (Rongowhakaata, Ngāti Kahungunu, Ngāti Porou, Ngāi Tahu) has been reappointed. Mr Hakiwai is currently the kaihautū Māori co-leader at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, where he provides bicultural leadership and works to develop strong relationships with iwi.

The four new appointments are:

**Tā Selwyn Parata** (Ngāti Porou). Tā Selwyn is a champion of the utilisation and revitalisation of te reo Māori, tikanga, waiata and kapa haka. Under his leadership, Te Matatini has grown significantly in viewership and kapa haka participation across the country.

**Ms Puamiria Parata-Goodall** (Ngāi Tahu, Ngāti Māmoe, Waitaha and Ngāti Kahungunu). Ms Parata-Goodall has over 30 years’ experience in the arts, culture and heritage sectors. She is current a member of the Ngāi Tahu Fund, Te Pae Kōrako Ngāi Tahu Archives, Canterbury Museum Trust Board and the Arts Council of New Zealand.

**Mr Ngataiharuru Taepa** (Te Arawa, Te Āti Awa). Mr Taepa is one of New Zealand’s most significant and innovative contemporary Māori artists and is the present Chair of Te Atinga, Contemporary Visual Arts Committee of Toi Māori Aotearoa.

**Ms Evie O’Brien** (Ngāti Awa, Ngāti Ranginui and Ngāti Pikiao). Ms O’Brien has built a career working in executive leadership in higher education. She was previously the inaugural Program Director at the Atlantic Institute based at Rhodes Trust, Oxford, in the United Kingdom.

These appointments come as we have just marked the 40th anniversary of Te Māori, Arts Minister Paul Goldsmith says.

“Te Māori stands as one of Aotearoa New Zealand’s most significant cultural achievements, a transformative event that brought Māori taonga to the world, showcasing the identity, mana, and the richness of Māori culture.”

Established by founding trustees Tā Hirini Moko Mead, Wiremu Cooper and Te Aue Davis, the Trust sought to ensure that Māori were afforded the skills needed to care for their taonga, Māori Development Minister Tama Potaka says.

The Trust was relaunched in 2015 by Piri Sciascia, Arapata Hakiwai and Garry Nicholas, with a broader focus including leading and supporting information exchange, knowledge transfer, and increasing awareness and understanding of taonga Māori.

“I believe there is potential for a reimagined Te Māori, where our culture and taonga amplify international trade and tourism opportunities.

“To quote Tā Hirini Moko Mead, ‘Te Māori raised our self-esteem, it gave us more space in the world, it defined clearly our identity as Māori and as New Zealanders, it ennobled us and lifted our morale – illuminated by a new glow of internationalism’.

“Te Māori is as relevant today as it was 40 years ago, and our collective challenge is to enable its impact to continue.

“I want to acknowledge and thank Garry Nicholas, for his commitment to reviving and strengthening the Trust.”

## Kua whakapakarihia te Poari o Te Māori Manaaki Taonga Trust

*He toi whakairo, he mana tangata.*

I te whakatūnga i tētahi kaitiaki, me te whakatūnga anō i tētahi tokowhā kaitiaki hōu ki te Poari o Te Māori Manaaki Taonga Trust ka whai mana tonu Te Māori haere ake nei, e ai ki tā te Minita Whanaketanga Māori Tama Potaka rāua ko te Minita Toi Paul Goldsmith tauākī.

Kua whakatūngia anō a **Mr Arapata Hakiwai** (Rongowhakaata, Ngāti Kahungunu, Ngāti Porou, Ngāi Tahu). Ko Mr Hakiwai te kaihautū Māori takirua i Te Papa Tongarewa, te tukuna ai e ia ngā aratakinga ā-ahurea, te whakapau kaha ai hoki e kino ai te painga o ngā hononga ki ngā iwi.

Koia ēnei ko ngā whakatūnga hōu e whā:

**Tā Selwyn Parata** (Ngāti Porou). He kaihapahapai a Tā Selwyn i te karawhiua me te whakarauoratia o te reo Māori, te tikanga, te waiata, me te haka. I te urungitanga āna, kua mātotoru te tupuranga o tō Te Matatini hunga mātakitaki, waihoki, kua pēnā hoki te nōhanga mai a te tini makiu ki ngā kapa haka puta noa i te motu.

**Ms Puamiria Parata-Goodall** (Ngāi Tahu, Ngāti Māmoe, Waitaha, Ngāti Kahungunu). Kua koni atu i te 30 tau a Ms Parata-Goodall e noho nei ki te ururuatanga o ngā rāngai mō te toi, te ahurea me te tiaki taonga. He mema ia i te Tahua Ngāi Tahu, Te Pae Kōrako Ngāi Tahu Archives, Canterbury Museum Trust Board me Toi Aotearoa.

**Mr Ngataiharuru Taepa** (Te Arawa, Te Āti Awa). Ko Mr Taepa tētahi o ngā tino i te ao toi hōu Māori i Aotearoa, ā, ko ia hoki te Upoko o Te Atinga, te Komiti Toi Ataata Hōu o Toi Māori Aotearoa.

**Ms Evie O’Brien** (Ngāti Awa, Ngāti Ranginui, Ngāti Pikiao). Kua poipoi a Ms O’Brien i tōna anō umanga i āna mahinga i te hunga kaihautū i te ao mātauranga tiketike. I ōna wā, ko ia te Kaihautū Kaupapa tuatahi i te Atlantic Institute i te Rhodes Trust, i Oxford, i Peretānia.

He huanga ēnei whakatūnga i tā mātou whakanui i te huringa tau 40 o Te Māori, hei tā te Minita Toi Paul Goldsmith.

“Mātāmua ko Te Māori e tū ana hei angitutanga ā-ahurea nā Aotearoa, arā, he huinga whakaumu i kitea ai ngā taonga Māori e te ao, i whakaaturia ai te tuakiri, te mana, me te iho o te ahurea Māori.”

He mea whakatū e ngā kaitiaki, e Tā Hirini Moko Mead rātou ko Wiremu Cooper, ko Te Aue Davis, me te aha anō, ko te kōingotanga o te Tiakitanga kia whāia e te Māori ngā pūkenga e tiakina ai ā rātou taonga, hei tā te Minita Whanaketanga Māori Tama Potaka.

I whakarewaina anō te Tiakitanga i te 2015 e Piri Sciascia rātou ko Arapata Hakiwai, ko Garry Nicholas, me te whāinga whānui e tae rā anō ana ki te aratakinga me te tautokonga i te whakawhitia o te mōhiohio, te mātauranga, me te whakatairanga i ngā mōhiotanga me ngā māramatanga ki ngā taonga Māori.

“Hei tāku, he pito mata e pohewatia anō ai Te Māori, e whakanuia ai te tauhokohoko ā-ao me ngā whai wāhitanga ā-tāpoi e tō tātou ahurea me ā tātou taonga.

“Arā te kōrero a Tā Hirini Moko Mead, ‘Nā Te Māori i hiki ai te wairua, i whai wāhi ai tātou ki te ao hurihuri, nāna tō tātou tuakiri i āta whakatauria mai hei Māori, hei ngāi Aotearoa hoki, nāna tātou i rangatira ai, i mana ai – ā, i miramiratia e te kura o te ao’.

“E pērā tonu ana te hāngai o Te Māori i ēnei rā, tērā i ngā tau e 40 ki muri, ka mutu, ko tā mātou wero he para i te huarahi e whai pānga tonu ai ia.

“E tika ana rā hoki kia mihia a Garry Nicholas i tāna ūnga ki te whakaoranga ake me te whakapakarihia o te Tiakitanga.”
