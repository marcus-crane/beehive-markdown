State Highway 1 through the Mangamuka Gorge will be open for Christmas, with critical work currently underway to clear the large slips and dropouts that have caused significant disruption for Northlanders trying to get where they want to go quickly and safely, Transport Minister Simeon Brown says.  

“The Mangamuka Gorge carries around 1,300 vehicles per day and is a key connector for the Far North to the rest of Northland and wider New Zealand. Weather events have caused sever under and over-slips on this critical route and the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) has undertaken extensive works to strengthen the resilience of this corridor.  

“Northland has had a tough time with road closures and resilience issues on the network, and I want to thank the more than 1,000 workers who have worked in difficult and challenging conditions to get the Mangamuka Gorge reopened since it closed in August 2022. 

“The upgraded route will support improved travel times for freight and road users, boosting economic growth and tourism opportunities across the Far North. It will also provide a safer and more reliable connection between Northland and the rest of the country, strengthening resilience to future weather events.”

The Mangamuka Gorge will open to motorists and freight operators in time for Christmas on 20 December. 

"As Kiwis begin planning their travel for the Christmas and summer period, motorists, local businesses, and freight operators will be relieved to have this economic lifeline reopened in time for the holidays. 

"Northland depends heavily on its state highways, not just for moving freight but also to support its thriving tourism industry. A well-maintained and reliable transport network is essential for the region’s economy, and we are prioritising this to ensure ongoing connectivity and growth.  

“Announcing the reopening date of the Mangamuka Gorge now will give certainty for the region, and those planning to visit.”
