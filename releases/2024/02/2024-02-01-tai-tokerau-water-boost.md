A further $5 million loan has been advanced to the Tai Tokerau Water Trust for Te Waihekeora Reservoir, Regional Development Minister Shane Jones says.

 “Water is a precious resource, Kānoa – Regional Development and Investment Unit at the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment have done amazing work in the North boosting water resilience. I am confident Robert Pigou and his team will continue this engagement throughout Waitangi this weekend”.

 Tai Tokerau Water Trust manages three key water storage projects in Northland:

 Matawii Dam has been completed in May 2023 with the support of a $10 million loan and $2 million grant of Government investment. 

- Te Waihekeora Reservoir in the Kaipara is nearing completion, this $5 million boost has been announced to support the construction of a 3.3million cubic meter water reservoir.
- Otawere Reservoir, the third water storage project, is well underway with works starting in September 2023. This has been enabled through $19 million as loans to the Tai Tokerau Water Trust.

The additional $5 million is part of reprioritising funding from previous Provincial Growth Funds which is a regular, necessary process undertaken by Kānoa.

 Mr Jones says “the new Regional Infrastructure Fund is expected to provide assistance to projects including water storage, subject to final Cabinet approval. The Coalition Agreement between the National Party and New Zealand First has allocated $1.2 billion investment over the term of Government. It will be implemented by the Kānoa team who have an impressive track record in supporting and enabling regional development for our country”.
