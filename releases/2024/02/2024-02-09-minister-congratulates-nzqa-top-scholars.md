Education Minister Erica Stanford congratulates the New Zealand Scholarship recipients from 2023 announced today. 

“Receiving a New Zealand Scholarship is a fantastic achievement and is a testament to the hard work and dedication the recipients have put in throughout the year,” says Ms Stanford. 

“New Zealand Scholarship tests not only students’ advanced depth of understanding, but their ability to apply what they know.”

Additionally, 10 Premier Award winners and 35 Top Subject Scholars will be recognised at the Top Scholar Awards at Parliament in May. 

“Premier Award winners have each received either four Scholarships at ‘Outstanding’ level, or three Scholarships at ‘Outstanding’ level and at least two additional Scholarships with four Top Ten subject placings,” says Ms Stanford. 

“The Top Subject Scholars scored the highest mark in their respective subjects. Two students received the highest score in two subjects each. 

“These prestigious awards recognise each recipient’s exceptional aptitude, and determination to succeed at the highest level. They can be very proud of this success.

“I’d also like recognise the teachers and whānau who have encouraged and supported all of the Scholarship recipients and award winners throughout their studies.”
