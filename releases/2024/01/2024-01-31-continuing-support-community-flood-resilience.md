The Government is contributing more than $15 million to support councils and communities to build flood resilience in three regions, following the 2023 severe weather events.

“Last week I announced funding of just under $12 million for Wairarapa and Northland flood resilience projects, these further projects bring the Government’s contribution this year to $26.8 million across 17 projects,” said Mark Mitchell, Minister for Emergency Management and Recovery. 

“Three projects I am announcing today will help protect homes in areas impacted by landslides during the weather events. The projects include Tauranga’s Egret Avenue and Te Mutu Crescent, ($7.3 million), Coromandel’s Thornton Bay ($1.3 million) and an area in Port Waikato ($1.1 million).

“Stabilising these landslides means people can return or remain in their homes, giving certainty to these communities. 

“A further $3.3 million is being provided for flood resilience work being undertaken by the Thames Coromandel, Hauraki, Waikato, Waitomo and Ōtotohanga District Councils. These projects include clearing waterways of storm damaged trees, removing gravel and stabilising riverbanks. Some of the waterways to be cleared include the Lake Hakanoa chanel in Huntly, the Waihou Rivers Network in Hauraki/Thames Coromandel, and rivers in vulnerable areas of the Waikato, Waipā and Waikato’s West Coast.

“Clearing waterways impacted by the 2023 severe weather events will reduce the likelihood of further flooding causing damage to neighbouring communities and land. 

“We are also supporting a project by Manawatū District Council ($1.675 million) to protect the water supply for residents Stanway-Halcombe rural water scheme area, including Halcombe Village.

“During the 2023 weather events, heavy rain in the Rangitīkei River affected water quality and resulted in a boil water notice for users of the Stanway-Halcombe rural water scheme. With Government support, additional treatment capability will be available, reducing quality issues caused by the washout of riverbanks. The project will also support erosion mitigation works to protect against future weather events.  

“These new projects will bring certainty to affected communities and ensure these areas are better equipped to withstand future severe weather events.”   

**Projects:**

**Tauranga**  
**Egret Avenue and Te Mutu Crescent land slips – Tauranga - $7,323,819**   
This initiative will provide a long-term, permanent remediation solution to two land slips that took place during the Auckland Anniversary weather event at Egret Avenue and Te Mutu Crescent in Tauranga.

**Hauraki, Thames-Coromandel**   
**Thornton Bay slip stabilisation - Thames-Coromandel - $1,300,000**   
This project will significantly reduce the risk of further, imminent, landslide activity at Thornton Bay, on the west coast of Coromandel Peninsula. Further landslide activity in the area, would result in significant loss or damage to public infrastructure, private residential property (including dwellings) and public conservation land.

**Waihou Rivers Network Recovery – Hauraki, Thames-Coromandel - $940,000**  
River management works – key areas of focus include gravel management and stabilisation/works on the Kauaeranga River, Kirikiri Stream, Puriri River, Omahu Stream, Hikutaia River, Komata River and Ohinemuri River.

**Coromandel Storm damaged tree removal – Thames-Coromandel - $642,000**  
Work will be undertaken to remove storm affected vegetation – largely old poplar, willow and pine – which were damaged and undermined during the weather events. This has impacted riverbank stability, water flow and capacity.  
Tree removal will be combined with the follow-up planting of willow and poplar poles as well as erosion protection works to stabilise riverbanks.

**Waikato**  
**Homeowner support to mitigate risks– Waikato - $1,100,000**   
This initiative is designed to mitigate risks, particularly those associated with landslides contributing to the overall resilience of the community affected by the recent North Island weather events.

**Lake Hakanoa Three-Waters Resilience Work – Waikato - $980,000**    
To help prevent floodwater from entering Huntly’s homes during heavy rainfall or flood events, work will be undertaken to support flood prevention, stabilisation and rehabilitation in the Lake Hakanoa channel. These interventions are vital to maintain lake water levels, and to prevent further environmental degradation.

**Improving resilience of rivers in vulnerable areas of the Waikato, Waipā and West Coast catchments - (Waitomo, Ōtorohanga, Waikato) - $704,402**    
Removing waterway obstructions and constructing at least 85 in-stream erosion control structures will mitigate future flood risk for Waikato communities impacted by the North Island weather event. These works will increase river stability and restore capacity in rivers identified as a high priority for action.

**Manawatū**   
**Resilience of the Stanway-Halcombe Rural Water Scheme – Manawatū - $1,675,000**   
Heavy rain experienced during the North Island weather events in the upper catchment of the Rangitīkei River resulted in a boil water notice for water scheme users. This project will protect the water supply scheme for residents in Halcombe Village and within the rural scheme area.

The work will provide additional treatment capability to respond to reduced water quality caused by washout of riverbanks and will also support erosion mitigation works to protect against future weather events.
