Work to increase flood resilience in Hawke’s Bay can start sooner, thanks to a new fast consenting process, Minister for Emergency Management and Recovery Mark Mitchell and Environment Minister Penny Simmonds say.

“Faster consenting means work to build stop banks, spillways and other infrastructure can get underway sooner, increasing flood protection for about 975 properties and their communities,” Mr Mitchell says.

“The works will also help protect the industrial area and Napier’s wastewater treatment plant in Awatoto.”

“A streamlined consenting process allows councils to get on with the job sooner, giving affected people the certainty they need for the future of their homes and businesses,” Ms Simmonds says.

The streamlined consenting will only apply to applications lodged by Hawke’s Bay councils and for eight specific locations in Awatoto, Havelock North, Omahu, Pakowhai, Pōrangahau, Waiohiki, Wairoa, and Whirinaki.

“The recently approved Order in Council makes temporary changes to the Resource Management Act to streamline consenting for this flood resilience work.

“Hawke’s Bay Regional Council and Hawke’s Bay Regional Recovery Agency requested this Order. Making this happen demonstrates the Coalition Government’s commitment to a locally led recovery supported by Government,” Ms Simmonds says.

“It also delivers on the Coalition Government’s 100-day commitment to make any additional Orders in Council to speed up cyclone and flood recovery efforts.”
