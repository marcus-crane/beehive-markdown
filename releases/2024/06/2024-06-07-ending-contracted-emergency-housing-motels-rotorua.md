The end of Contracted Emergency Housing (CEH) motels in Rotorua is nearing another milestone as the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announces it will not renew consents for six of the original 13 motels, Associate Housing Minister Tama Potaka says.

The government is committed to stop using CEH by December 2025.

In 2022, Rotorua Lakes Council granted HUD consents for 13 motels to provide Contracted Emergency Housing. Consents were granted for two years - expiring in December 2024. 

With a pipeline of social houses scheduled to be completed in Rotorua, HUD will soon apply for resource consent for seven CEH motels for 12 months ending in December 2025. 

It is expected that by mid-2025, there will only be four motels needed. 

“The Ministry of Housing and Urban Development will work closely with the Rotorua community including Ngāti Whakaue and Te Arawa, Restore Rotorua and the Rotorua Lakes Council to ensure they are aware of the progress,” says Mr Potaka.

“This will provide certainty for families needing housing, until they can move into a long-term home, while reassuring the people of Rotorua that the use of these motels in the city is winding down quickly.”

Rotorua MP Todd McClay says the government is fulfilling its commitment to ending the use of Contracted Emergency Housing motels in Rotorua.

“We are determined to get whānau out of these motels, and into stable housing.”
