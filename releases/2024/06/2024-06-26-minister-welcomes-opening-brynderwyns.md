Transport Minister Simeon Brown welcomes the opening of State Highway 1 through the Brynderwyn Hills from midnight tonight, following four months of closure to complete critical recovery and maintenance works.

“Northlanders, local businesses, drivers, and freight operators will be relieved to have this important lifeline open. The Government thanks them for their patience as these critical works have been carried out,” Mr Brown says.

Additional slips on the corridor towards the end of April caused frustrating delays to the planned reopening, and the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) has used this extended closure time to complete other additional maintenance work.

“I thank the more than 900 workers, many of them Northlanders, that have worked day and night on site in very difficult and challenging conditions to get this critical route reopened as soon as possible.

“Northland has had a tough time with road closures, delays, and more recently, power disruptions. The Government has worked with Northlanders and agencies to respond to these challenges facing the region.

“We know that the Brynderwyns is a crucial connection to and from Northland for both people and freight, so getting it opened has been a priority.

“These extensive works have strengthened the resilience of this corridor while the Government prioritises an alternative to the Brynderwyns as a new Road of National Significance, as part of the National-NZ First Coalition agreement.”

“With the road opening tonight, I want to encourage all New Zealanders once again to support, visit, and explore everything that Northland has to offer.”
