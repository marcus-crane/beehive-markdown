Attorney-General Judith Collins today announced the appointments of 19 King’s Counsel.  

Also known as a silk, in reference to a gown traditionally worn as part of their robes, the rank of King’s Counsel is awarded to barristers sole who have demonstrated excellence in their careers or, from time to time, other lawyers in recognition of their extraordinary contributions to the field of law. 

This year, 18 barristers sole have received the rank, while Professor Philip Joseph from the University of Canterbury has been recognised for his distinguished career as a legal scholar and significant contribution to public and constitutional law. 

The barristers sole appointed – from 110 applicants – are: Wendy Aldred, Katherine Anderson, Sarah Armstrong, Douglas Ewen, Sally Gepp, Daniel Kalderimis, Zane Kennedy, Alanya Limmer, Kelly Quinn, Philip Shamy, Todd Simmonds, Timothy Stephens, Christopher Stevenson, Robert Stewart, Nura Taefi, Anne Toohey, Samuel Wimsett and Garry Williams. 

“I am delighted to see lawyers appointed from such a broad range of practice areas, including general civil, commercial, defamation, media, human rights, criminal, and environmental and resource management,” Ms Collins says.

“In addition to their exceptional legal skills, these new silks demonstrate commitment to supporting and mentoring colleagues and increasing access to justice for all New Zealanders. They are seen as leaders in setting and maintaining the standards of the profession. I congratulate them all on their appointment.”

There was no appointment round in 2023. The senior bar has also been reduced in number by retirements and some existing silks being appointed to the bench, creating additional opportunities for experienced lawyers to be recognised.
