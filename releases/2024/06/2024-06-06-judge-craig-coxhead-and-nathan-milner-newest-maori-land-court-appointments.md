*Tangata tū tangata ora, tangata noho tangata mate.*

Minister for Māori Development Tama Potaka today announced Judge Craig Coxhead (Ngāti Makino, Ngāti Pikiao, Ngāti Awa, Ngāti Maru) as the new Deputy Chief Judge, and Wellington lawyer Nathan Milner (Ngāti Porou, Ngāi Tahu) as a Judge of the Māori Land Court.

"I want to congratulate Deputy Chief Judge Coxhead and Judge Milner on their appointments to the Māori Land Court after many years of service and dedication to our judicial branch of government,” says Mr Potaka.

Deputy Chief Judge Coxhead has 16 years of judicial service in law matched by his extensive knowledge of tikanga Māori and experience of Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 and the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975.

Deputy Chief Judge Coxhead has held numerous national and international judicial roles including Waitangi Tribunal Judge, Māori Land Court Judge, Presiding Officer on three Waitangi Tribunal inquiries, as well as Chief Justice of High Court of Niue and Judge of the High Court in the Cook Islands. This longstanding mahi puts him in good stead to undertake the Deputy Chief Judge role.

Judge Milner has more than 15 years post-admission commercial law firm experience from his time at a large national law firm and small boutique firm.

Judge Milner has been a Counsel in the Māori Land Court, Māori Appellate Court, High Court, and Waitangi Tribunal. Prior to his admission he was Research Counsel for the Chief Judge of the Māori Land Court (who is also the Chairperson of the Waitangi Tribunal) and then as an Assistant.

“With considerable experience in Māori land law, trusts law, estates, commercial and contract matters, Māori Fisheries Act 2004 issues and disputes, legislative development and dispute management and resolution, I am confident Judge Milner will thrive in the opportunity before him as Māori Land Court Judge.”

Incoming Deputy Chief Judge Coxhead and Judge Milner will be officially sworn in over the next month.

### **Ko te Kaiwhakawā Craig Coxhead rāua ko Nathan Milner ngā kopounga tino hou ki Te Kooti Whenua Māori**

*Tangata tū tangata ora, tangata noho tangata mate.*

I pānuitia i te rangi nei e te Minita Whanaketanga Māori a Tama Potaka ko Kaiwhakawā Craig Coxhead (Ngāti Makino, Ngāti Pikiao, Ngāti Awa, Ngāti Maru) hei Kaiwhakawā Matua Tuarua Hou, ā, ko rōia Nathan Milner (Ngāti Porou, Ngāi Tahu) hoki hei Kaiwhakawā o Te Kooti Whenua Māori.

“Me mihi au ka tika ki a te Kaiwhakawā Matua Tuarua Coxhead rāua ko Kaiwhakawā Milner i tā rāua kopounga mai ki Te Kōti Whenua Māori nā runga i te tini tau o te mahi me te ngākau nui ki tō mātou peka whakawā o te kāwanatanga”, te kī a Minita Potaka.

Kua 16 tau a Kaiwhakawā Matua Tuarua Coxhead e mahi ana i te mahi whakawā, ka mutu, he whānui tōna matatau ki te tikanga Māori me tōna wheako ki Te Ture Whenua Māori 1993 me Te Ture Tiriti o Waitangi 1975.

Kua whai a Kaiwhakawā Matua Tuarua Coxhead i ngā tini tūranga whakawā ā-motu, ā-ao anō tae atu hoki ki te Kaiwhakawā o Te Rōpu Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi, he Kaiwhakawā o Te Kōti Whenua Māori, he Kaiwhakawā Āpiha Matua i ngā uiuinga e toru o Te Rōpu Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi, ka mutu, hei Kaiwhakawā Matua o te Kōti Matua o Niue me te Kaiwhakawā Matua o te Kōti Matua i ngā Kuki Airani. Nā runga i te roa ia e mahi ana i ēnei mahi e tika ana kia riro i a ia te tūranga o te Kaiwhakawā Matua Tuarua.

Neke atu i te 15 tau te wheako o Nathan Milner mai i tōna wā e mahi ana i te mahi ture ā-arumoni ki tētahi tari ture ā-motu me tētahi tari huatau iti i muri i tana whiwhinga i tana tohu.

Kua mahi a Kaiwhakawā Milner hei Kaitohutohu i Te Kōti Whenua Māori, Te Kōti Pīra Māori, Te Kōti Matua, me Te Rōpu Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi. I mua i tana kopounga ko ia te Kaitohutohu Rangahau mō te Kaiwhakawā Matua o Te Kōti Whenua Māori (ko te Heamana hoki ia o Te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi) kātahi hei Kaiāwhina.

“Nā runga i te whānui o tōna wheako i te ture whenua Māori, te ture kaitiaki, ngā pānga tuku iho, ngā take arumoni me te kirimana, ngā take me ngā tautohe o te Ture Kaimoana Māori 2004, te whakawhanake take ture, te whakahaere me te whakatau tautohe, e whakapono ana au ka momoho a Kaiwhakawā Milner i te mahi kei mua i a ia hei Kaiwhakawā o Te Kōti Whenua Māori.”

Ka whakaoatitia a te Kaiwhakawā Matua Tuarua Coxhead me te Kaiwhakawā Nathan Milner ā te marama e tū mai nei.
