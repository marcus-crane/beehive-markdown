I want to thank today’s recipients of awards and all those across the education sector for the work that they do.

“Since becoming Minister of Education I have been privileged to see just how passionate our educators are, and I want to acknowledge the difference they make in the lives of the children, teachers and the communities they work with.

“Education changes lives and the impact these people have undoubtedly had, needs to be acknowledged and celebrated.”
