The Government has stepped in to support vital air links to our offshore islands, the Chatham Islands, Great Barrier Island and Motiti Island, Transport Minister Phil Twyford announced today.

“As part of our $600 million support package to minimise the impacts of COVID-19 on the aviation sector, the Government has fast-tracked funding of up to $1.7 million to maintain air links to these remote communities, Phil Twyford says.

“This funding is for services provided by Air Chathams, Barrier Air, Fly My Sky and Island Air Charters.

“These vital air links deliver critical supplies and groceries to the islands, while allowing products like the Chatham Islands’ fresh seafood to be air-freighted and sold in the mainland or exported.

“Island residents are relying on air connectivity, particularly during the Alert Level 4 period, and we’ve moved quickly to ensure these services are able to continue.

“Resilient transport links are essential to maintain good stocks of medicines, food and critical equipment right across the country. This support means air services will continue while fewer passengers are travelling during the Level 4 lockdown, after which the Government will consider additional funding support where it’s needed.

“Our Government has moved quickly to ensure all of New Zealand has the supplies they need and help exporters get their goods to market so they can continue to support jobs and the economy,” Phil Twyford says.
