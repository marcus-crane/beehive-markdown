The Government is proud to play our part in international humanitarian work to provide support and protection to refugees, and celebrate the contributions our refugee community makes on World Refugee Day today says Minister of Immigration Iain Lees-Galloway.

“We are proud to welcome and support refugees who have escaped extreme situations to settle here in New Zealand and build a new life with us,” says Iain Lees-Galloway.

“Former refugees contribute to our committees culturally, economically and socially. They bring with them their experiences, cultures, skills and their strong desire to participate in employment, community activities, volunteering and education.

“Many former refugees have played a part as essential workers during Levels 3 and 4 of the COVID-19 response. We thank them and continue to be impressed by the work they do in our communities.

“Although the UNHCR has suspended its refugee resettlement programme due to the COVID-19 pandemic work is underway to support the resumption of refugee resettlement once the UNHCR is ready, and our border restrictions are lifted. This includes ensuring that safe travel routes are available to facilitate refugee movements and the appropriate health measures and controls are in place,” says Iain Lees-Galloway.

Five projects to increase the wellbeing of our refugee community were supported in Budget 2020. They include helping former refugees reunite with family, supporting community settlement, and increasing security and processing.
