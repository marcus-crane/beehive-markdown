The Minister of Conservation Eugenie Sage today announced a targeted ministerial review into the governance of Fish and Game New Zealand and regional Fish and Game councils.  This statutory agency is responsible for managing most of New Zealand’s game bird hunting and freshwater fishing for species such as trout and salmon.

“The laws governing Fish & Game were enacted some 30 years ago. An organisational health check is timely to make sure Fish and Game’s governance and organisational arrangements are fit for purpose today,” said Eugenie Sage.

Two independent experts, former Law Commission member and former Secretary for Justice Belinda Clark and former Environment Court commissioner John Mills have been appointed to undertake the review

Belinda Clark of Wellington has recently retired from the Law Commission. She has been a CEO of several entities and has extensive expertise in organisational management, public administration and law. 

John Mills of Wellington is a former Environment Court commissioner, sheep and beef farmer and former regional councillor for Environment Southland.  He has significant experience in decision making around the environment and natural resources and knowledge of rural New Zealand.

“The review is limited to a health check of the governance of Fish and Game. It is not a review of Fish and Game’s statutory roles or functions. Interested parties, including licence holders, will be able to provide their views to the review panel,” Eugenie Sage said.

She said she was pleased with the support of Fish and Game’s leadership for a review and their help in progressing it.

The review panel is being supported and funded by the Department of Conservation (DOC). The panel is responsible to, and will report to, the Minister of Conservation rather than the department.

It is anticipated that the review panel will produce a report by the end of 2020.
