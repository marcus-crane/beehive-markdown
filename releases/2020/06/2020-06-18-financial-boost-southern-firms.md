Eleven Southland and Otago engineering and manufacturing firms will receive up to $2.2 million from the Provincial Growth Fund to support economic growth and create new high-skilled jobs, Regional Economic Development Minister Shane Jones announced today.

“The vision of these companies align with the Provincial Growth Fund’s objectives to increase productivity, create jobs and enhance economic opportunities in their region. Some 43 new sustainable jobs will be created which will get money circulating where it is needed most right now to offset the economic impact of COVID-19,” Shane Jones said.

“Today’s announcement builds on over $30.7 million in PGF funding already announced for Southland and Otago manufacturing and engineering firms late last year which bought with it approximately 160 jobs. That’s just over 200 new sustainable jobs being created through our investment and these companies have the potential for further growth.

“The majority of manufacturing and engineering firms the PGF has already funded have just got on with it. They’ve been able to order new equipment, accelerate their production, hire new staff, meet their current customers’ demands and vie for new work. A number of these companies continued working through the COVID-19 lock-down as essential services and have experienced increased demand for their products and services,” Shane Jones said.

The engineering and manufacturing sector has been identified as a key sector for PGF investment, with Otago and Southland specifically targeted due to the high number of firms in the sector there.

“Many of the 11 companies funded today have been producing to their full capacity and the barriers faced by them shows that while manufacturing and engineering is a strong sector in these two regions, it is constrained by the need for capital to invest in modern and more productive equipment and a need for more workers, both skilled and unskilled,” Shane Jones said.

Otago and Southland engineering and manufacturing firms receiving funding today:

**Otago**

**Queenstown Engineering Ltd -** $190,000 towards this specialist fabrication and installation company to purchase machinery to process greater quantities of steel in-house and reduce out-sourcing work.
