A panel of seven experts are adding their support to help shape the future of Māori broadcasting, Minister for Māori Development Willie Jackson has announced today.

“Today I will meet with some of the most experienced Māori broadcasters, commentators and practitioners in the field. They have practical insights on the media landscape that will be important as we look ahead. I am excited to have their input as we look to support a capable and sustainable Māori broadcasting sector”.

The independent advisory panel members are Peter Lucas-Jones, Scotty Morrison, Annabelle Lee-Mather, Nicole Hoey, Ella Henry, Jason Ake and Bailey Mackey. They span the fields of iwi radio, television broadcasting, journalism, production and language revitalisation. The panel will be appointed until 30 June 2021.

“Māori broadcasting is a critical platform to tell Māori stories, provide Māori perspectives and promote Māori language and culture. It’s critical we get this right”.

Over the last 12 months there has been discussion on how best to support the Māori media sector in a fast-changing technological environment, where audience preferences are shifting says Minister Jackson.

“The role of the panel is to provide me with independent expert advice. This will support decision-making in relation to any improvements to Māori broadcasting, before I take recommendations to Cabinet next year.”

Consultation on Māori Media Sector Shift options took place in June 2020. Feedback on those options will inform the next steps of work.
