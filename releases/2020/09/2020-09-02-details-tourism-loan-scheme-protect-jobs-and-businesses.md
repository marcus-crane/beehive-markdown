Twenty six Inbound Tour Operators (ITOs) have been approved for a $20 million loan scheme as part of the Government’s tourism recovery plan and support for businesses, Tourism Minister Kelvin Davis announced today.

“ITOs will play an important role in helping to rebuild visitation once borders re-open, by linking overseas wholesalers and travel sellers with New Zealand tourism businesses,” Kelvin Davis said.

“The Government has acknowledged this role with the allocation of $20 million from the Tourism Recovery Fund to support ITOs, through loans with especially favourable terms and an extended repayment period, which will help them prepare for when our border opens.

“These 26 ITOs have been assessed to be of strategic importance and provide coverage of key overseas markets,” Kelvin Davis said.

Tourism Recovery Ministers have approved the loans key terms and conditions, which will also apply to Strategic Tourism Assets Protection Programme (STAPP) businesses.

**Loan scheme details:**

- loans will be provided over a five year term
- the loan principal will be provided interest-free for the first 24 months, after which the interest rate will be 3 per cent per annum
- no repayments on loans will be required until the third year of the loans

“We’re pleased to be able to offer the same favourable terms and conditions to successful STAPP applicants who applied for a loan,” Kelvin Davis said.

Successful ITOs and STAPP applicants will receive a letter outlining the details of the loan scheme this week.  

When the offers are finalised they will be published on the Tourism Recovery section on MBIE’s [website](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/immigration-and-tourism/tourism/tourism-recovery/strategic-tourism-assets-protection-programme/funding-recipients/).
