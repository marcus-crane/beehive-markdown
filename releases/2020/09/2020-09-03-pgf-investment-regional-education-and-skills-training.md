Up to 1800 people will have access to alternative pathways to work through a Government investment of $12.2 million in regional education and skills training, Regional Economic Development Minister Shane Jones has announced.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has dealt a blow to New Zealand’s economy, with the effects being felt hard in the regions. Our recovery will be driven, in large part, by the regions so it is imperative businesses have a well-trained work force and Kiwis have more ways to learn and upskill,” Shane Jones said.

“This funding of $12.2m, from the [Te Ara Mahi](https://www.growregions.govt.nz/regions/te-ara-mahi/) allocation of the Provincial Growth Fund, will support a range of education, skills training, pre-employment and job pathway projects in Bay of Plenty, Waikato, Tairāwhiti, Hawke’s Bay, Northland and Manawatū-Whanganui.

“These projects will increase the number of people enrolled in PGF-funded skills and employment programmes from the [11,090 I announced last month](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/pgf-creates-more-10k-jobs-success-stories-across-nz) to around 13,150.

“Investing in skills and education for our people not only supports them, their family and whanau and their communities, it supports regional businesses.

“Te Ara Mahi is just one of the many ways this Government is supporting the regions, from direct investment from the Provincial Growth Fund and through the $3 billion for shovel-ready infrastructure projects to funding for regional apprenticeships and worker redeployment,” Shane Jones said.
