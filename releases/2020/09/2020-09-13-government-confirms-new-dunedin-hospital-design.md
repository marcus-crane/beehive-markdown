The Government has agreed on a preferred design for the new Dunedin Hospital featuring two separate buildings, and has provided funding for the next stages of work.

Minister of Health Chris Hipkins says Cabinet has approved in principle the detailed business case for the new hospital, giving people in the Southern region certainty and confidence in the design and ongoing progress

“The new Dunedin Hospital will transform healthcare across the Southern region delivering improved health outcomes for future generations,” says Chris Hipkins.

“Cabinet has approved the design option which broadly aligns with the preliminary site masterplan – Outpatients on the Wilsons block and Inpatients on the Cadbury site. This will deliver a stronger separation of services and much needed day surgery capacity earlier than other options. It also provides excellent linkages to the health sciences division of the university and avoids overbearing the heritage area of the city.

“Cabinet agreed the detailed business case in principle as it’s important the project maintains momentum and demolition and design milestones are reached. We’ve released $127 million to progress design, demolition, piling, project management and early contractor engagement.

“It’s expected the total budget for the project will now exceed $1.4 billion. This will be confirmed once concept design is finished and costings can be finalised. The final details of the business case are expected go to Cabinet for approval by February 2021.

“It’s important we get this right. The new Dunedin Hospital will be world class and the biggest ever hospital build in New Zealand. It will have improved clinical capacity and digital technology, and more integrated services to support new models of care.

“The new hospital is a huge opportunity to change healthcare in the region. The project will also be a significant boost to the local economy, offering many jobs and opportunities for local businesses,” said Chris Hipkins.

**Note to editors:**

At around 89,000 sqm, the new hospital will provide approximately 411 beds, including 30 ICU beds, and 20 theatres with shell space for additional theatres.

The new facilities will be designed for flexibility and future expansion. The project will aim to achieve a five Green Star sustainability rating.

Outpatients (at almost 15,000 sqm) is due to be complete by early 2025, with Inpatients (at around 73,500 sqm) due to be finished in the first quarter of 2028. There will be a link bridge joining the buildings.

Implementation Business Cases for each building – Outpatients in mid-2021 and Inpatients by the end of 2021, will be considered by joint Ministers of Health and Finance, prior to confirming the main contractor for each building.
