The New Zealand Māori Arts and Crafts Institute Vesting Act 2020 was passed by the House today and the Minister for Māori Development, Nanaia Mahuta, says this has been a long time coming and means the iwi can now focus on developing their future.

When the Act comes into force upon receiving the Royal Assent, it will vest Te Puia | NZMACI, the national tourism and cultural arts institution, in Rotorua iwi.

“Not only is it a tourist destination where commercial gains will be made, it will also ensure that the legacy of toi Māori will be around for future generations so that our future carvers, weavers, waka exponents, arts and crafts champions will have a place to hone and further their craft continuing a long tradition of our people.”

Te Puia New Zealand Arts and Crafts Limited Partnership will be the kaitiaki of the institution and is a partnership between Wāhiao Tūhourangi o Whakarewarewa, the hapū of Ngāti Hurungaterangi, Ngāti Taeotū, Ngā Te Kahu o Ngāti Whakaue and the Pukeroa Oruawhata Trust on behalf of Ngāti Whakaue.

“It is fitting that manawhenua of the Whakarewarewa Valley land assume ownership of the Te Puia / NZMACI business. They are kaitiaki and owners of the underlying land and have made significant contributions to the development of the Institute over the years.

“The land on which the tourist attraction operates at Whakarewarewa was returned to the iwi in 2009, and in 2017, iwi and hapū members endorsed the proposal to have Te Puia NZ MACI business also vested in them.

“The institute will face challenges as the impacts of COVID-19 are felt throughout the tourism and hospitality sector. It also however has a long history of innovation, creativity and resilience. I am confident the iwi partners will respond well to the new environment.”

A significant tourism enterprise and cultural icon, Te Puia New Zealand Arts Māori and Crafts Institute will be transferred to the new iwi owners immediately.

Te Puia New Zealand Arts Māori and Crafts Institute is the only institute of its kind in the world. It was first started in 1926 and operates as a tourism venture with specialised education schools dedicated to Māori arts and crafts.

“It’s a very special occasion for the iwi and hapū involved as it now enables them to start planning to achieve their future aspirations,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

**Ka puritia te taonga tuku iho a Toi Māori mō Aotearoa**

I whakamanatia te New Zealand Māori Arts and Crafts Institute Vesting Act 2020 i te Whare i te rangi nei, ā, e kī ana te Minita Whanaketanga Māori, Nanaia Mahuta, kua roa hoki tēnei rā e haramai ana, nā, kua tahuri te iwi ināianei ki te whakawhanake i a rātou anō i a rātou e titiro whakamua ana. 

Kia oti te whakamana i te Ture i tōna whakawhiwhinga ki te Tohu Karauna, ka tuku Te Puia | NZMACI, arā, te whare tāpoi, toi ā-motu, ki ngā iwi o Rotorua. 

“Ka noho tonu a Te Puia hei whakahaere arumoni, ka mātua whakarite anō hoki ka mau tonu te kaupapa tuku iho a Toi Māori mā ngā whakatipuranga e whai ake nei, kia whai kāinga tonu ngā kaiwhakairo, ngā kairaranga, ngā tipua waka, tipua toi, hei kāinga whakapakari i tō rātou tohungatanga kia kaha tonu, mai rā anō tēnei momo kawenga tuku iho o tō mātou iwi.” 

Ka noho ko Te Puia New Zealand Arts and Crafts Limited Partnership hei kaitiaki o te kaupapa, arā, he pātuinga tērā i waenga i a Wāhiao Tūhourangi o Whakarewarewa, te hapū o Ngāti Hurungaterangi, Ngāti Taeotū, Ngāti Kahu o Ngāti Whakaue me te Pukeroa Oruawhata Trust mā Ngāti Whakaue.

‘E tika ana kia riro mā te mana whenua o te riu o Whakarewarewa e whiwhi te pakihi o Te Puia / NZMACI. Ko rātou ngā kaitiaki, ngā kaipupuri o te whenua i raro i ngā puia, he nui hoki wā rātou tautoko ki te whanaketanga o te Kaupapa i roto i ngā tau.

“I whakahokia te whenua, kei reira te mahi tāpoi e whakahaeretia ana ki te Whakarewarewa, ki te iwi i te tau 2009, ā, i te tau 2017 i whakamanatia e ngā mema o ngā hapū me ngā iwi te tono kia tukua mai te pakihi Te Puia NZMACI ki a rātou.” 

“Ka puta ngā tini wero ki te kaupapa i te pānga o te mate Korona puta noa i te rāngai tāpoi, manaaki. He hītori roa hoki tōna o te auahatanga, me te manahautanga. Kei te whakapono ahau ka pai te taiao hou nei ki ngā hoa pātuinga, arā, ngā iwi.

He tino pakihi mō te tāpoi, he tohu ā-ahurea anō hoki, ka whakawhitia inamatatia Te Puia New Zealand Arts Māori and Crafts Institute ki ō rātou kaipupuri hou.

Ko Te Whare Toi Whakairo o Te Puia Aotearoa kāore tōna ritenga huri noa i te ao. Nō te tau 1926 i oroko mai ai, ā, he mahi tāpoi te mahi me ōna kura mātauranga ake e hāpai ana i ngā toi whakairo a te Māori. 

“He rangi tino mīharo rawa atu tēnei ki ngā iwi me ngā hapū e whai wāhi ana ki tēnei kaupapa, i te mea, kua wātea rātou ki te whakatau, ki te whakamahere, ki te whakatutuki rātou i ō rātou iti kahurangi,” Te kī a Nanaia Mahuta.
