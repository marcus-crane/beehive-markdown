Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters has today announced that a $26 million investment in Ōpōtiki will see important public amenities upgraded and further progress made on new aquaculture opportunities.

“The people of Ōpōtiki have been waiting decades for real investment in key infrastructure, and support for the incredible aquaculture opportunities that the wider region can provide,” Mr Peters said.

“Unlocking the long neglected potential of the provinces and creating hundreds of new jobs in places such as Ōpōtiki, is absolutely essential to our country’s recovery from the economic devastation of COVID-19.”

“A total of 245 jobs will be created through the construction and operation of overdue aquaculture infrastructure in Ōpōtiki, and a further 202 jobs for locals as a result of club renovations and CBD improvements,” Mr Peters said.

The projects announced today are mixture of Provincial Growth Fund (PGF) and [Infrastructure Reference Group (IRG)](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/government-seeks-infrastructure-projects) shovel ready projects as follows:
