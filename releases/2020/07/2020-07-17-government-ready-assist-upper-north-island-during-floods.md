The Government is on standby to assist communities across Coromandel, Northland and Tairawhiti following extensive flooding overnight.

“I’ve spoken to the local Mayors and understand the most important message this morning is to stay off the roads and avoid unnecessary travel so that emergency services can provide assistance to those most in need,” Civil Defence Minister Peeni Henare said.

“Overnight several Civil Defence centres were open to help people who had to evacuate their homes due to flooding or couldn’t get home due to road closures.

“Last night there were 45 calls received by the Far North District Council relating to roading, infrastructure and downed trees.

“In Tarawhiti, SH35 was closed between Te Puia & Tolaga Bay, some local roads are also closed, and the Hikuwai River is being monitored.

“As damage assessments take place this morning, I am considering options for travelling to the region to see where the Government can best support local communities during this time,” Peeni Henare said.
