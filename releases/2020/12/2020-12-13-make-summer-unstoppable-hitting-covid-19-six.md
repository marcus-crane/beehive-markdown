COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins today launched the nationwide ‘Make Summer Unstoppable’ campaign to keep COVID-19 at bay, during day 3 of the Blackcaps test match against the West Indies at Wellington’s Basin Reserve.

The campaign TV ads premiered on the big screens at the Basin.   

“After the year we’ve had, we all need a classic summer break we can enjoy,” Chris Hipkins said.

“Whether it’s days at the cricket, at the beach or at the backyard barbie with whānau and friends, we all want to be able to enjoy this summer without the interruption of COVID-19. 

“We’ve all got a part to play to bring on an ‘unstoppable summer’. Everyone can make a difference by continuing with the basic health steps that’ve allowed us to hold back the virus so far.

“The ‘Make Summer Unstoppable’ campaign reinforces the basics: asking Kiwis to wash or sanitise hands; scan QR codes; turn on Bluetooth on the COVID Tracer app; stay home if you’re feeling even a little unwell – even if that means missing the cricket, and getting advice on whether to take a test.

“We’re also asking businesses and venues to actively encourage their customers to scan QR codes.

“This isn’t a new message – it’s what we’ve been saying all year -- but summer travel creates additional challenges, so we all need to be extra vigilant. As the Blackcaps consistently show us, it’s teamwork which gets you through, so it’s great to be able to screen these campaign ads publicly for the first time at the sort of big event so many Kiwis will want to be a part of. 

“We’ve seen what happened during the northern hemisphere summer and in the USA during Thanksgiving, where people travelled widely and without taking precautions, driving a huge spike in cases. We don’t want that to happen here.

“We want to get the Kiwi summer off on the right foot. Christmas and the holiday season is a time of the year when people come together socially more often; there are more large-scale events; and people move around the country in bigger numbers.

“That’s why our focus to ‘Make Summer Unstoppable’ is all about reminding and motivating everyone to keep doing the easy, everyday actions which will keep us free of COVID-19.

“As a country we’ve all worked exceptionally hard to stop COVID-19.

“This [campaign](https://covid19.govt.nz) says let’s keep at it. Let’s continue to stop COVID-19 so that we can make summer unstoppable.”
