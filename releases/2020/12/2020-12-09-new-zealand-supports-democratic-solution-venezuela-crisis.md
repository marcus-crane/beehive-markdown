New Zealand supports a peaceful and democratic solution to the current crisis in Venezuela, Foreign Minister Hon Nanaia Mahuta says.

“Underpinning this approach is a call to respect the will of the Venezuelan people and to hold free, fair and transparent elections.”

“The government of Nicolás Maduro was not able to meet the minimum conditions for election observers, such as those from the European Union and Organization of American States, to attend. New Zealand continues to be extremely concerned about the humanitarian and human rights situation in Venezuela.”

The human rights situation in Venezuela remains dire. In September the Independent International Fact Finding Mission on Venezuela reported accounts of extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions and torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment.

“Venezuela held its legislative election over the weekend and there are serious concerns it was not conducted in a free and fair manner,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“New Zealand advocates for free, fair and democratic participation in the electoral process. These are the principles that are necessary for peace and stability in Venezuela.”
