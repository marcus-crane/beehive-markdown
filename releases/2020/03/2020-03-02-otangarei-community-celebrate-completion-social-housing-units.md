The first kaupapa Māori transitional homes, opened today in Ōtangarei, will ensure the small but vibrant community can look after whānau most in need.  

Māori Development Minister Hon Nanaia Mahuta officially opened six units at the Ōtangarei Papakāinga this morning and celebrated with the Whangārei community.  

Minister Mahuta congratulated Ōtangarei Papakāinga Limited and Te Hau Āwhiowhio ō Ōtangarei Trust on the completion of these whare which will help struggling whānau work towards a thriving and prosperous future.  

“Papakāinga reflects a whānau support system which means the kāinga are more than physical structures. 

“The focus of this papakāinga is to provide whānau Māori, who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, with a setting where kaupapa Māori wrap-around-services will help them get back on their feet faster,” Minister Mahuta says. 

This project consists of five two-bedroom transitional housing units and one two-bedroom unit for an on-site manager. 

Te Puni Kōkiri has worked alongside the Trust for several years and invested $450,000 to support these whare and the Ministry for Housing and Urban Development contributed $446,160. 

“This project represents a positive working partnership between government organisations but more importantly between Māori and the Crown.” 

Minister Mahuta commended the Trust and said it was evident the community of Ōtangarei were passionate about seeing whānau Māori thrive.  

“These homes will not only provide whānau with warm, dry and safe housing but will provide a platform for them to rebuild their futures. We are committed to improving the lives and wellbeing of all New Zealanders and ensuring a thriving Aotearoa.” 

 

**Ka hurō te hapori o Ōtangarei i te otinga o ngā kāinga pāpori**

I whakatuwheratia i tēnei rā ki Ōtangarei, he kāinga kaupapa Māori tuatahi hei atawhai i ngā whānau e taumaha ana ki waenganui i tēnei hapori iti, kaha hoki. 

Nā Te Minita Whanaketanga Māori, nā Honore Nanaia Mahuta i whakatuwhera ngā whare e ono i te Papakāinga o Ōtangarei i tēnei ata, ā, i whakanuia hoki tēnei i te taha o te hapori o Whangārei. 

Ka mihia e Minita Mahuta a Ōtangarei Papakāinga Limited me Te Hau Āwhiowhio o Ōtangarei Trust i te whakatutukinga o ēnei whare ka āwhinatia nuitia ngā whānau kia nui te oranga mō rātou hei te wā heke. 

“Ehara te Papakāinga i te kāinga anake.  He kawenga tautoko ā whānau.” 

“Ko te aronga matua o tēnei papakāinga kia āwhinatia te hunga kāinga kore, kua tata rānei ki te kāinga kore, ki ngā ratonga kaupapa Māori hei whakapakari anō i a rātou,” hei tā Minita Mahuta. 

E rima ngā kāinga rua moenga me tētahi kāinga rua moenga mō te kaiwhakahaere ka noho ki reira. 

He mahitahi huanui tēnei whakahaere i waenganui i te kāwanatanga me ngā rōpū, engari ia, he huanui i waenganui i te Māori me te Karauna.” 

Ka mihia e Minita Mahuta te Tarahati me te kī ake, he mārakerake te kitea ko te hapori o Ōtangarei e ngākaunui ana ki te oranga nui mō ngā whānau Māori. 

“Ehara noa iho ēnei kāinga i te kāinga e āhuru ai, e mahana ai, e haumaru ai ngā whānau, engari, he pikinga taumata ki te whakapakari i ō rātou huarahi ki mua.  Pau ana ō mātou kaha ki te whakapakari i te oranga, i te hauora o ngā tāngata katoa o Aotearoa me te whai kia taurikura te āhua o Aotearoa.”
