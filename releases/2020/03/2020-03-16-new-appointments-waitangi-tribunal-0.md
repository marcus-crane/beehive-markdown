Māori Development Minster Mahuta today announced the appointment of Susy Frankel and Paul Hamer, and the reappointment of Basil Morrison CNZM JP to the Waitangi Tribunal (the Tribunal).  

The Minister says the two new appointees, who are both associated with Victoria University of Wellington, bring vital skills and experience to the Tribunal membership. “They are both highly regarded in their respective fields, and will no doubt bring their wealth of expertise to the Tribunal,” says Minister Mahuta. 

Susy Frankel, currently a Professor of Law and the Chair of Intellectual Property and International Trade Law at Victoria University of Wellington, has worked for many years in the realm of intellectual property, including the protection of mātauranga Māori (traditional knowledge). 

An esteemed historian, Paul Hamer is also a Research Associate at Victoria University of Wellington and is currently employed as a Principal Advisor in Māori Strategy and Partnerships at the Department of Corrections. Paul has extensive experience in the public sector, having worked for both the Tribunal and Te Puni Kōkiri in various roles. He is also an expert on Māori migration to Australia. 

All three members have been appointed for a three-year term, and Minister Mahuta wishes them well in their respective roles at the Tribunal.  

“Congratulations to our three new appointments to the Waitangi Tribunal. They are all of a high calibre, and I look forward to seeing their contributions to the Tribunal’s important work,” says Minister Mahuta.
