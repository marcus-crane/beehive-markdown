Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has announced the appointment of Brendan Horsley as Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.

 Mr Horsley will be appointed for a term of five years, starting from 8 June 2020.

 “The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security has a significant oversight role to ensure the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service and the Government Communications Security Bureau act with propriety and operate lawfully and effectively,” Jacinda Ardern said.

 Mr Horsley has had an extensive career at Crown Law, most recently in the role of Deputy Solicitor-General (Criminal). In that role he has been responsible for the professional leadership and supervision of the Crown prosecution network. He has also had significant involvement with the intelligence agencies and the Office of the Inspector-General.

 Previously Mr Horsley worked at the Ministry of Justice as the first National Director of the Public Defence Service, responsible for providing legal aid criminal defence services.

 “I would like to thank the Deputy IGIS, Madeleine Laracy, who has been acting IGIS since the position became vacant from the appointment of Cheryl Gwyn to the High Court in July 2019,” Jacinda Ardern said.

 The appointment of Mr Horsley is made by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the House of Representatives. Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee is consulted, as is required by statute.

 **Notes to editors:**

•  ensuring that security and intelligence agencies carry out their activities lawfully and properly

•  independently investigating complaints about the intelligence and security agencies

•  providing advice about oversight of the intelligence and security agencies to the New Zealand Government and the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament.
