Taita College in the Hutt Valley will be redeveloped to upgrade its ageing classrooms and leaky roofs, Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced today.

“The work is long overdue and will make a lasting difference to the school for generations to come,” Chris Hipkins said.

“Too many of our schools are struggling to cope with outdated facilities, insufficient space and poor quality classrooms. Many are more than 40 years old.

”I want all our schools to provide a learning environment that supports educational success and one that students, parents, whānau and communities can be proud of.

“The first part of this project will fix leaking roofs. I understand arrangements are already being made with local suppliers to get underway.

“The school will also be getting a dedicated performing arts space, which it has never had before.

“This around $32 million investment has a dual benefit. It boosts learning but will also provide work for local building companies and suppliers.

“Projects like what we’re announcing at Taita College today are an important part of kick-starting the economy.

“Last month I announced $160 million of upgrades for 600 small or remote schools. More than $100 million in other school projects are getting underway. These projects will deliver a real boost across New Zealand.” Chris Hipkins said.

“The Ministry of Education will work with the school to get things moving as quickly as possible.”

The project will rationalise old, poor quality, surplus classrooms. Other classrooms at the school will be upgraded to deliver quality learning environments for around 400 students in the Decile 2 School. 

Further announcements will be made about investments in school property in the coming months.

**Q&A** 

**How soon will the Taita College redevelopment begin?**

Planning and design is already underway, but the Ministry will work further with the school to ensure that the project delivers their infrastructure priorities. Once planning is complete, the Ministry will tender for a supplier so that works can get underway.

**How many people will be employed by the Taita College redevelopment project?**

The exact number of staff employed on a redevelopment project is determined by the supplier. However, with a project of this size we anticipate a number of trades and subcontractors will be employed to deliver works.

**Will any other schools be getting redevelopments?**

The announcement at Taita College is just the first of a number of infrastructure investments that this Government will be making in the school property portfolio. I look forward to sharing the details of more projects as they become ready to announce.
