The Government is funding more pathways to jobs through training and education programmes in regional New Zealand to support the provinces’ recovery from the economic impacts of COVID-19, Regional Economic Development Minister Shane Jones and Employment Minister Willie Jackson have announced.

“New Zealand’s economic recovery will be largely driven by the regions and they need a well-trained workforce and sustainable employment opportunities to get their economies moving,” Shane Jones said.

“The challenge is one we were already addressing but it has been scaled up in response to the impact of COVID-19. This Government has put in place a wide range of measures to support regional recovery and secure Kiwi jobs. We need to ensure those who need help into skilled work receive it.

“That’s why we are providing $14.79 million for organisations in some of our most vulnerable communities to provide a diverse range of educations, skills training, pre-employment and job pathway projects,” Shane Jones said.

The funding package consists of $11.62m from Te Ara Mahi (TAM), the Provincial Growth Fund’s employment, skills and capability fund, and $3.17m from He Poutama Rangatahi (HPR), the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s youth training and employment pathway fund.

 "He Poutama Rangatahi supports community based projects that seek to help young people facing multiple barriers to employment,” Willie Jackson said.

“By investing in skills and training for our young people, we can break down some of those barriers and support our rangatahi to succeed in a challenging environment.

“This will be crucial for towns such as Rotorua and Kaikoura, where the effects of COVID-19 will be particularly difficult due to loss of income from international tourism.” Willie Jackson said.

The funding covers projects in Canterbury, Manawatū-Whanganui, Hawke’s Bay, Bay of Plenty, Waikato and Te Tai Tokerau.
