Prime Minister Jim Bolger says the Hon Matiu Rata's death will be greeted with great sadness and dismay across the land.

"Mat had the character and demeanour to cross all social and racial frontiers and the capacity to endear himself, even to his opponents."

"His vision, his role in the setting up of the Waitangi Tribunal, his leadership of Tai Tokerau and his contribution to the Ratana Church cannot be over-stated."

The Prime Minister says he shared much of his early political career with the former Maori Affairs Minister and much admired the courage and determination he exhibited in the pursuit of Maori self determination.

"He was a fine family man, a warm hearted politician and a committed activist in the battle for Maori rights."

"Mat worked determinedly towards fulfilling Maori aspirations and it is tragic that his death comes before his efforts on behalf of the Muriwhenua claim, that he had been progressing on the day of his terrible accident, prevented him seeing the conclusion of those negotiations."

"I will miss his company and good humour and send my very real sympathy to his family and friends. They can now, I hope, take some solace in the memory of Mat's honourable and distinguished career."
