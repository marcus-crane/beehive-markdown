The Minister of Maori Affairs, the Hon Tau Henare, was tonight mourning the loss of one of Maoridom's great leaders, the Hon Matiu Rata.

"His contribution and services to Maori, to his people in the north, to his whanau, hapu and iwi can not be measured in words.

"I, like many others, loved Matiu as if he were one of my own. He was a father-type figure to many an aspiring politician, of all political make-up, and I shall miss him dearly.

"My heart, and those of my family's goes out to Nellie at this time.

"Matiu's loss has left a huge vacuum to fill and will be felt by both Maori and non-Maori alike."

Kua hinga te totara o te waonui a tane

Kua mokemoke te iwi Maori i te hinganga o te matenga o tetahi rangatira nui o te ao Maori

Na reira, e Matiu, haere atu ki o tupuna matua

E tatari mai ana te ao wairua

Moe mai i roto i te ariki
