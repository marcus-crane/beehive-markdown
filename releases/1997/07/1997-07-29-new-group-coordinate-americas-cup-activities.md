The Coalition Government has announced plans to take a coordinating role in the hosting of the America's Cup series.

Prime Minister Jim Bolger today released details of a new group, the America's Cup Taskforce as part of a Millennium structure.

The Minister responsible for establishing the group, Tourism & Sport, Fitness and Leisure Minister, Murray McCully said the Taskforce showed that central Government was taking a lead in ensuring the America's Cup was a success.

"This is the biggest event New Zealand has ever seen which has the ability to profile our country for an extended length of time it is essential that we do everything in our power to ensure that our country is seen as a perfect host."

Mr McCully said there was a number of groups involved in hosting the America's Cup including local and central Government and the Taskforce's job would be to make sure the parties worked together to ensure the benefits of the event were maximised.

"Since I have been working with those groups it has become very clear that a co-ordinating body was necessary to ensure New Zealand had a positive profile as the host country," he said.

"I see the America's Cup Taskforce as enshrining a partnership between central government and the wider Auckland region to commit to the success of the event."

Mr McCully said there were a number of long term spin-offs for New Zealand from the America's Cup series and the Taskforce would also be charged with maximising any trade and tourism opportunities.

The group would also be involved in developing branding and promotional opportunities for New Zealand available through the event and associated activities.

The America's Cup Taskforce consists of representatives from the Auckland Regional Services Trust, Auckland City Council, Team New Zealand, Auckland Regional Council, The New Zealand Tourism Board, the Auckland Mayoral Forum and the recently formed Eventscorp.
