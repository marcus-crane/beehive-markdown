Kerry Marshall, Tui France, Councillors, Elaine Henry, Chair of the Kahurangi Trust, Trustees, Community Employment  
Group Advisor Peter Hall, John Soulsby, and members of the Work Crew, Employment Service and Careers Service  
representatives.

It gives me great pleasure to be with you this afternoon for the launch of the Kahurangi Employment Trust.

It is a real pleasure to be here on my home turf, so-to-speak. I spent my senior secondary school years in Nelson, and really  
enjoy opportunities such as this to come home & share in the great things happening in the Nelson region.

I have been particularly looking forward to today, having been personally involved in helping the unemployed into  
community work and training through a Trust; and this occasion here marks a positive step forward on this front.

I believe the Tasman Bays Work Scheme, and now the Kahurangi Employment Trust is an example of what can be achieved  
when there is a shared vision to use projects of benefit to the community as the basis for keeping unemployed job seekers  
connected with their communities, motivated, and skilled.

I am confident that Councils and communities throughout New Zealand will look to the Kahurangi Trust as a progressive  
example of the successful achievement of the partnership principle which is critical to the success of local employment  
initiatives.

And I am pleased to say that the Coalition Government's Employment Strategy will, over the next twelve to 18 months look  
to support and foster initiatives such as this one on a far wider scale than has ever been possible in the past.

The reasons the Government will be looking to support more of this type of venture are many.

As I said before, this Trust's success hinges not only on the commitment of the many individuals who have put their energies  
into its establishment, but also on the co-operation and partnerships between a number of organisations who have an interest  
in assisting unemployed job seekers in the Tasman Bays area into work and training.

The foresight of John Soulsby, who recognised the need to link skills training with ongoing employment and on-the-job  
training for job seekers saw the Tasman Bays Work Crew established back in 1994, with the help of Community  
Employment Group and Employment Service resources.

The Tasman District and Nelson City Councils have quickly recognised the value of the Work Crew concept not just in the  
services they can provide for the Councils in the work they undertake, but also in the commitment it has to helping  
unemployed job seekers to become valued and skilled members of the local working community.

To date, over 100 local job seekers have taken part in the Work Crew, with more than 75% of them moving on into further  
work or training. That is an outstanding result and one John and his team should be very proud of.

Now in 1997 we see the Trust established, and a management group operating to expand and develop the concept further. No  
doubt John will be pleased to have the responsibility for the initiative spread amongst other helping hands. And I have no  
doubt that the formation of the Kahurangi Employment Trust will see the concept expanded further, and many more job  
seekers benefiting from it.

The Coalition Government has made a commitment to achieving two very clear goals with its employment policy. The first  
is to reduce the number of long-term unemployed, and the second is to maximise the involvement of job seekers in suitable  
part-time community work or training.

I am very pleased to say that the Kahurangi Employment Trust is making a valuable contribution to both those goals. You  
have a clear focus on assisting those job seekers most in need of this form of support in your community, and you achieve  
that by involving them in a range of meaningful community work and training.

You have identified a local solution to a local employment need - something else the Government will be advancing this  
year with a move away from central control of employment resources to local control, and the establishment of Regional  
Employment Commissioners and Committees.

And you have taken an integrated approach to nurturing and expanding this initiative. The Community Employment Group,  
the Employment Service, the Tasman District and Nelson City Councils, together with Trust Bank Canterbury and the Tindall  
Foundation have all made a tangible commitment to supporting this initiative for the benefit of the local community and its  
unemployed.

The Kahurangi Employment Trust clearly illustrates the benefits of such an integrated approach. The partnerships you have  
formed here have created much greater momentum than could have been achieved by any one of your organisations  
individually. And again, it is the local community and your unemployed job seekers who are going to benefit.

This initiative is yet more proof that there is a vast array of work to be done in our communities which would not otherwise  
be done by the private sector, and which can form the basis for valuable work experience for our unemployed. I have no  
doubt that as word spreads, and as the Trust's reputation grows, the supply of available work will boom, and there will be  
no shortage of job seekers who want to follow in the footsteps of the hundred or so job seekers who have already benefited  
from this initiative since its inception.

In closing ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to congratulate you all on your foresight, your initiative, your  
commitment and your enthusiasm for this project. I can assure you I will be spreading the story of the success of the  
Kahurangi Trust and I will be encouraging communities around the country to emulate the partnership principles that you  
have adopted here in Tasman Bays. I am sure that the Trust will go from strength to strength as it develops, and I wish you  
every success for your future.
