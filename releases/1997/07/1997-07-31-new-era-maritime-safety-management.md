"A new era in safety management for commercial ships, both large and small, is beginning," Transport Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

A rule created under the Maritime Transport Act 1994 covering both the Safe Ship Management system (SSM) and the larger-scale International Safety Management code (ISM) was recently signed by the Minister and will be available from today.

"Under both SSM and ISM the ship operating company and those on the ship take greater responsibility for day to day safety of their vessel and crew, rather than simply meeting requirements on the day of the annual survey, as has been the case in the past," Mrs Shipley said.

"This will bring a new level of responsibility for those operating small commercial vehicles such as charter boats or water taxis, and will help ensure our adventure tourism industry meets high safety standards.

"Eighteen months of publicity means that most in the maritime community have heard about Safe Ship Management. Several hundred operators have already entered the system, are being processed into the system right now, or have applied to enter. Those who have not yet applied should do so, because from February 1 next year they will need to belong to a Safe Ship Management system to operate legally.

"Nothing in this new set of rules affects private boat owners who do not use their vessels for commercial purposes," the Minister concluded.
