Judge Michael Brown is to chair the Population Conference which is to be held on November 13 and 14 this year, Immigration Minister Max Bradford announced today.

Formerly the Principal Youth Court Judge of New Zealand, Judge Brown is presently the Adjunct Professor of Law at Waikato University.

Mr Bradford said Judge Brown was an ideal person to chair the Population Conference.

"Judge Brown brings to the role a lifetime of experience and service to New Zealand and its people of all ages and backgrounds. He is a person with a genuine and lifelong concern for New Zealand and New Zealanders," Mr Bradford said.

"He has seen a lot of New Zealand life in his role as a Youth Court judge, he has a great sense of humour, balance and is one of the wisest people I know."

Judge Brown said the Population Conference was an important opportunity to consider how New Zealand would evolve over the next decade and beyond.

"As a nation we should be taking a proactive look at the issues to get a vision of where we are going. It is exciting to be involved in such an event," Judge Brown said.

In addition to his legal career, Judge Brown has served on numerous sporting, charitable, community and educational bodies.

He was the Chancellor of Auckland University from 1986 to 1991, and has delivered papers to International Law Conferences in Hong Kong, New Zealand, Australia and Scotland.

A father of six children, his tribal affiliations are Ngati-Kahu, Te Aupouri, Te Rarawa and Ngapuhi.

THE POPULATION CONFERENCE  
PEOPLE. COMMUNITIES. GROWTH.  
BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
The two-day Population Conference on November 13 and 14 is expected to attract about 300 participants, including representatives from the academic world, central and local government, the business sector, education, health, Maori and other ethnic groups, and social service and community sectors.

The Government considers it important for a diverse range of people to participate in the conference, and recognises that some community groups may require financial assistance in order to attend. Decisions on such assistance will be made once registrations have been received.

As well as the wide range of participants and top quality speakers from New Zealand and overseas, the conference venue itself is expected to be a highlight of the programme.

It will be the first ever conference to be held at the new Museum of New Zealand, Te Papa Tongarewa, on central Wellington's harbour front. (The museum opens to the public in 1998.)

The full-on programme includes a series of key addresses from experts on the following topics:

New Zealand's current and future population dynamics;  
an international perspective on demographic and economic impacts of immigration;  
population change and the role of immigration;  
population change, education, skills and growth;  
population change and economic and social participation;  
population change and growth and development.  
Key addresses will be followed by a wide variety of smaller forums with specialist expert speakers, panel and audience discussions.

Forum topics:

Population change and the labour market;  
population change, education, skill development and growth;  
the successful settlement of migrants and factors for setting immigration targets;  
population change and social services;  
population change and urban expansion and infrastructure;  
population change, national identity, ethnic diversity and cultural development;  
population change and conservation, environment and recreation;  
population change and Maori development;  
population change and the business sector;  
population change and international linkages.  
The Prime Minister Jim Bolger, Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters and Minister of Labour, Immigration, Business Development and Energy, Max Bradford, will also speak at the conference.

A programme outline is attached, and further details will be announced soon.
