Today's decision on the application to import rabbit calicivirus as a control for feral rabbits will necessitate a concerted effort on the part of the Ministries of Agriculture and Environment to examine all methods available for rabbit control, the Minister for Biosecurity, Hon Simon Upton, said today.

"For all but approximately 9% of New Zealand's total land area the rabbit population is held in check. However, at the other end of the spectrum, the damage done in our semi-arid, rabbit prone lands (approximately 3.7% of New Zealand's land area) is not in dispute.

"This decision means, therefore, that an answer to this problem still has to be found," said Mr Upton.

He said that throughout the consultation and assessment period he had been emphatic that the decision was to be at arm's length from any political involvement. "In fact, under present law there is no opportunity for politicians to substitute their judgement for that of the Ministry of Agriculture.

"Concern had been expressed early on by the applicant group that political pressure would be brought to bear. I can assure all those who made submissions that the Government was only informed of the decision once it had been taken. The assessment involved gathering all scientific information available and identifying areas of uncertainty relating to the effectiveness of the virus as a biocontrol under New Zealand conditions.

"It is clear from the decision maker's report that there is still more to be learnt from the Australian experience. To date the distribution of the virus in Australia and the factors relating to its performance as a biocontrol agent are poorly understood. RCD may yet be part of an answer to New Zealand's rabbit problem at some time in the future," continued Mr Upton.

The initial round of consultation on the introduction of RCD led to almost 800 submissions. Technical experts subsequently reported on the key issues from their specific areas of expertise, taking into account the public submissions. Submitters were then given the opportunity to advise whether or not their issues had been adequately taken into account in the reviewers' reports. This culminated in the preparation of a report by the Chief Veterinary Officer of MAF to Dr Peter O'Hara, Deputy Secretary of MAF, before he made the final decision.

Mr Upton emphasised the decision meant RCD retained its status as an unwanted organism under the Biosecurity Act, 1993.
