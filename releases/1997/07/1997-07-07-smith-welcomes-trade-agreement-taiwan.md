International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith has welcomed an agreement with Taiwan (Chinese Taipei) which will give New Zealand exporters better access to Taiwanese markets by substantially reducing tariffs.

"This agreement will give a major boost to exports in our seventh largest market. It means better access for all of New Zealand's main exports to Taiwan, including dairy and forestry products, beef and seafood," Dr Smith said.

The agreement came during negotiations for Taiwan to join the World Trade Organisation (WTO).

Agriculture and horticulture were a particular focus of the negotiations because of past problems faced getting these sectors' goods into Taiwan.

But improved access was also sought for all of New Zealand's industrial exports. For example, in areas like forest and paper products, cosmetics and furniture, New Zealand has negotiated tariff cuts of between 50% and 100%.

Most of the concessions will come into force when the Taiwanese join the WTO but some important changes have immediate effect, the minister said.

Key benefits to New Zealand include:

- In the dairy sector (New Zealand's largest source of exports to Taiwan), tariffs on processed dairy products have been cut. For example, the tariff on butter has been halved from 10% to 5%, the tariff on cheese will reduce from 20% to 5% and the tariff on yoghurt from 32.5% to 15%. New Zealand has also secured a substantial quota for liquid milk products.
- Quotas on New Zealand apples will be scrapped once Taiwan is admitted to the WTO and this year the quota has been doubled to 8000 tonnes. Tariffs will drop from 50% to 20% over six years.
- The tariff on beef will be cut by two thirds (from NT$30 to NT$10 a kilo) over six years. This will make New Zealand product much more competitive on the Taiwanese market. New Zealand has also negotiated a tariff cut in advance of Taiwan's accession to the WTO. This cut, from NT$30 a kilo to NT$27 a kilo, took effect last week.
- Import bans affecting opportunities on several emerging horticultural products will be removed. All quantitative restrictions on peaches and plums will be removed on accession. In the meantime, a quota of 500 tonnes was made available for New Zealand product this year. Once Taiwan joins the WTO, there will also be access for persimmons and nashi pears.
- Import bans on fisheries products (including squid and mackerel) will be phased out.
- In addition to concessions on products, Taiwan's liberal access for overseas service providers has been locked in. This means, for example, that Taiwan will maintain liberal access for New Zealand educational institutions wanting to market their services.

Taiwan applied for membership of the WTO early this decade. As part of the application process, Taiwan is negotiating market liberalisation packages with all its main trading partners. Negotiations with New Zealand began in 1994. WTO members accept that the timing of Taiwan's accession is linked to the accession of the People's Republic of China (PRC).

"I hope to see both the PRC and Chinese Taipei admitted to the WTO as soon as possible. I expect the process to be completed in the course of next year," Dr Smith said.
