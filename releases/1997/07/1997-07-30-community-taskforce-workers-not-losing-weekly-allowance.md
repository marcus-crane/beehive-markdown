Employment Minister Peter McCardle confirmed that changes were being implemented by the Employment Service in the way it reimburses Community Taskforce participants for their work-related costs.

"Although legislation allows for up to $20 per week to be paid to participants, the practice has been to pay a flat rate of $20 per week subject to three days work being completed."

"Under the new arrangement, job seekers will instead be reimbursed for actual travel and other work-related expenses up to a maximum of $20 per week."

Mr McCardle said however that he is keen to ensure the strategy of steadily increasing the number of job seekers involved in community work is not diminished, and he has asked the Employment Service to monitor the impact of the change.
