International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith will make a concerted effort to improve wool sales into the vast Chinese market when he visits China next week.

The most important part of his visit will be official negotiations over better access for New Zealand wool, as China is New Zealand's biggest wool market.

The negotiations are part of China's bid to join the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Joining involves reaching bi-lateral trade agreements with existing WTO members such as New Zealand.

"I'll be doing my utmost to ensure that New Zealand wool growers get the best deal possible from these negotiations," Dr Smith said.

"Conditions in the Chinese market have been less than ideal in recent years and better access would help a recovery in our wool exports." Wool exports to China have fallen from $311 million worth in the year to June 1995 to $216 million in the 12 months to June this year. This reflects difficult market conditions in China and a drop in demand as the Chinese economy slowed down.

"I hope the negotiations with the Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation, Madam Wu Yi, can help reverse this trend," Dr Smith said.

While in China, Dr Smith will also help launch a Wools of New Zealand Fernmark quality initiative aimed at ensuring high quality standards are met by New Zealand exporters sending wool to China.

"I applaud this type of linkage between our suppliers and the marketplace.

It's exactly the sort of thing needed if we are to expand our presence in key export markets like China," Dr Smith said.
