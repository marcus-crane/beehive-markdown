The Coalition Government is looking forward to taking an active role in the lead-up to the Year 2000 celebrations and beyond, Prime Minister Jim Bolger announced at a special launch this evening.

"An exciting calendar of community-initiated events is already emerging for the new Millennium - including concerts, marathons, motoring events and a Maori Performing Arts Festival."

"New Zealand will also be hosting a number of high-profile international events, such as APEC in 1999, the America's Cup, the FIFA Under 17 World Cup and the World Netball Championships and we can expect to share some of the spotlight and visitors from the Year 2000 Olympics in Sydney."

Mr Bolger said the Government had set up a structure to help with the coordination, promotion and, where necessary, funding of various events.

A Millennium Board, chaired by the Prime Minister, will be responsible for establishing an over-arching national vision and will also help with the development of a single millennium brand, promoting New Zealand throughout the world.

Under the umbrella of the Board will be the Sydney 2000 Taskforce, the Towards 2000 Taskforce and the America's Cup Taskforce, each working towards meeting a range of objectives which would ultimately make the most of the opportunities Year 2000 activities would generate.

Mr Bolger said the dawn of the millennium literally gave New Zealand a golden opportunity to capture international focus.

"New Zealand is in an unrivalled position to attract tourism and world notice as the first nation in the world to welcome in the new millennium.

"But we also stand to profit in a wider sense, by using this opportunity to promote an enduring international impression of a proud and progressive nation.

"I am confident that the new millennium will be an exciting one for New Zealand, as we watch the maturing and strengthening of our own distinct identity.

"The millennium year gives us the opportunity as a nation to celebrate who we are now, and also to look forward and determine what we want for our own country in the future," Mr Bolger said.
