A new, integrated information technology system will boost the New Zealand Immigration Service's ability to clamp down on immigration scams and meet its business goals, Immigration Minister Max Bradford said today.

The single Applications Management System (AMS) would replace 12 existing IT immigration systems and was expected to result in major efficiency gains for the NZIS when it became fully operational in October, Mr Bradford said.

The total project expenditure was $6.3 million, but cost-benefit analysis showed a payback on the development after three years. Maintaining the present system was not viable because of increasing upgrading and maintenance costs.

"In addition, there are major benefits for the Government. The system will assist in clamping down on immigration scams, and enhance risk management by capturing and profiling all customer movements through the border and contact with NZIS."

New Zealand Customs will also have access to the information to check for passenger alerts as well as recording passenger movements.

"It will store comprehensive information for evaluation and research, and assist with policy advice. Customer service will also be enhanced."

The project was not an easy one to implement, Mr Bradford said.

Changes in Government policy and other circumstances beyond NZIS's control - such as the need to re-tender the development part way through - delayed its implementation.

"However, I am pleased AMS will be fully operational in October after a six-week phase-in period."

The first site will be the NZIS Wellington branch. AMS will then be phased in through out New Zealand followed by offshore offices.
