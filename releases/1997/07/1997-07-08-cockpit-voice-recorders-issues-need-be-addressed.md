Transport Minister Jenny Shipley is urging pilots and airline operators to demonstrate their public responsibility and professionalism and use Cockpit Voice Recorders (CVR's) where fitted to their aircraft.

"Cockpit voice recorders are an important tool for air accident investigations, and the Government wants to ensure the information they gather continues to be available for that purpose.

"There are issues that need to be addressed about the use of the information gained from these devices for other purposes. I have asked all the groups representing pilots to come and see me so that these issues can be fully considered.

"If necessary, I am prepared to consider recommending legislation to my Cabinet colleagues to ensure an appropriate balance is struck between the need to protect the information for safety purposes and the legitimate requirements of law enforcement authorities.

"The release of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission's (TAIC) report on the Ansett Dash 8 accident shows how invaluable the CVR is to accident investigation. Both the cockpit interchanges and the background noises recorded contribute to discovering what happened, and possibly to preventing other crashes from happening.

"It is proposed that rules will be introduced making it mandatory for operators of the larger commercial aircraft to fit and operate CVRs by April 1999. Some aircraft already have CVRs fitted.

"Before then, I am keen to ensure that we have resolved the issues of the use of the information gathered by the CVRs.

"The Ministry of Transport is developing a discussion document on the issues surrounding the use of CVR and other similar safety related information. It will be focusing on international practices and addressing the matters raised in the recent Court of Appeal decision. It is due for release next month for public comment.

"In the meantime, given the importance of the CVR as an accident investigation tool, it is vital that operators and pilots continue to use them at all times in the public interest. I appeal to all pilots to see that this occurs while we work this issue through ," Mrs Shipley concluded.
