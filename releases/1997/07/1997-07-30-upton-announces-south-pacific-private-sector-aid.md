Nineteen training and business development grants to support private sector development in the Pacific Islands have been announced today by Associate Foreign Minister Simon Upton.

The grants, totalling NZ$525,000.00, are being made under the Pacific Islands Investment & Development Scheme (PIIDS), part of New Zealand's Official Development Assistance (NZODA) programme, and cover private sector activities in eight countries.

"PIIDS promotes more effective business and training linkages between the New Zealand private sector and counterpart private sectors of our South Pacific neighbours", Mr Upton said.

"PIIDS is a forward looking and innovative use of our Official Development Assistance which acknowledges the important contribution which the New Zealand and Pacific Islands' private sector can make toward regional development".

In the July bidding round, 30 proposals were submitted for competitive assessment. Grants were allocated according to each proposal's development value, commercial viability and the likely long-term economic and employment benefits for the recipient country.

Proposals for the next round of PIIDS grants should be sent to the Development Cooperation Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade by 3 October 1997.

List of grant recipients and background note attached.

The nineteen proposals cover activities in eight South Pacific countries:

Group sizes are limited to 12 to meet safety, accommodation and environmental concerns.

Pare & Ruru Masters (Aitutaki) and the Free Range Egg & Poultry Company Ltd (Auckland) will create a fully integrated farm on Aitutaki in the Cook Islands.

Background Note: The Pacific Islands Investment & Development Scheme (PIIDS)

The scheme has developed from a combination of the old Pacific Islands Industrial Development Scheme, and the South Pacific Development Assistance Facility (SPDAF).

Basic Objectives Of PIIDS

To encourage private sector development in Pacific Island Countries in partnership with the New Zealand private sector.

To create employment and economic growth in the South Pacific based on Pacific Island economies' comparative advantages.

To encourage New Zealand private sector investment in the Pacific Islands.

To facilitate the transfer of knowledge from New Zealand to the South Pacific through the provision of training, marketing, technical, and managerial support.

How the Scheme Works

The scheme aims to meet the needs of the private sector directly. PIIDS has been designed to be flexible with a range of funding options available including training, feasibility, and equity assistance.

There are six separate grants available under the scheme. PIIDS Investment allows for the funding of up to 50% of the cost of a feasibility study to a maximum of $10,000 and may contribute up to $75,000 as an Equity Grant to the new venture on a dollar for dollar basis. PIIDS Development can provide grants of up to $25,000 to facilitate Training Needs Analyses, Training Programmes, Advisory Missions, and Personnel Attachments to New Zealand.

PIIDS proposals are assessed by a panel made up of Development Division staff and an independent private sector consultant during three competitive assessment rounds each year. Proposals are assessed on the basis of their developmental merit, and in the case of PIIDS Investment - their commercial viability.

The total 1997/98 PIIDS allocation is $2 million.
