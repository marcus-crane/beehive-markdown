Employment Minister Peter McCardle advised today that due to continuing work on the computer generated end-of-month statistics, there will be a delay in the release of the May registered unemployment figures.

"The figures were due to be released tomorrow morning. However I am not prepared to release any data until such time as I am confident the statistics are accurate."

"Given the general interest in these unemployment statistics, I am not happy with the delay in their release. However equally I have conveyed to my Department that I expect all figures to be an accurate total of the numbers registered as unemployed."

"The Employment Service is working extremely hard to ensure that the May register figures are completely robust, and ready for release as soon as possible." Mr McCardle said.

Mr McCardle concluded by saying he has been advised that the statistics for May are unlikely to be available before Thursday 26th June, 1997.
