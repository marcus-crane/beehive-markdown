The Minister of Education is encouraging teachers and teacher trainers to take advantage of programmes designed to lift the number of Maori teachers and teachers proficient in te reo Maori.

"We want to increase the number of people in our schools able to teach in te reo Maori. We would also like to see more young Maori entering into the teaching profession," Mr Creech said.

"Extra investment is being made to increase te reo proficiency. I hope teachers and aspiring teacher trainees will take advantage of the extra funding.

"In addition the Government is investigating further measures to increase the number of Maori teachers and te reo Maori teachers - with decisions due later this year."

Today marks the start of Maori Language Week.

"It will take time to improve the level of te reo proficiency. It is a big challenge, but the Government is working to meet the challenge.

"But before we can further expand Kura Kaupapa Maori for example, we have to make sure we have enough teachers able to teach in them and teach well," Mr Creech said.

The Government will spend $40 million over three years on new Teacher Supply initiatives. Included in the investment is funding specifically targeted at Maori Teacher Supply.

The Government is providing extra funds for professional development for lecturers training te reo Maori teachers.

The Ministry of Education is also to develop an ideal level of proficiency for Maori-medium teacher trainees.

Training providers will be asked to bid for funding for te reo Maori programmes to help Maori-medium teacher trainees improve their proficiency in te reo Maori.

Providers will also be asked to consider ways in which they can provide teacher training that is more accessible to rural and mature people.

More study awards will be also available for teachers undertaking the Diploma of Bilingual Education.

Maori medium training providers have been asked to bid for extra places to provide training in te reo Maori for trainees undertaking Maori medium teacher training  
Mr Creech said further initiatives are under development and would be announced later this year.

MAORI TEACHER SUPPLY INITIATIVES  
Establishing an "ideal" level of proficiency in te reo Maori

An "ideal" level of proficiency in te reo Maori, and related assessment procedures for Maori-medium teachers and trainees is to be developed, involving sector representatives and Government agencies, over the second half of this year. This level will not be mandatory but will be available as a tool to:

help training providers to assess the needs of Maori-medium teacher trainees and assess whether trainees have met this level of proficiency on graduation

provide information to schools on the proficiency levels of teachers seeking employment

help the Ministry to make decisions on the allocation of funding for in-service programmes to upskill teachers in te reo Maori

enable monitoring of the overall levels of language proficiency among the Maori-medium teacher workforce and teacher trainees.  
Upskilling Maori-medium teacher trainers

$360,000 will be available in each of 1997/98 and 1998/1999, for distribution to Maori-medium training providers to help them provide additional professional development to current and prospective Maori-medium teacher trainers. Providers will be asked to develop proposals for the provision of professional development to their Maori-medium staff and funding will be distributed by the Ministry of Education on the basis of these proposals. This funding will support training providers in their efforts to recruit new staff and to address the training needs of current staff.

Postgraduate Diploma in Bilingual Education for trained teachers

Additional funding will be available so that the number of teachers able to receive study awards each year to undertake the Diploma in Bilingual Education will increase from approximately 20 to approximately 30. These awards provide leave with pay for teachers for the duration of the programme and cover course fees. It is designed to support improved skill and knowledge levels among the Maori-medium teacher workforce and to provide a means by which teachers can move into the Maori-medium education field.

National Maori recruitment campaign

$100,000 will be available annually from 1997/98 to 1999/2000 to continue and extend the national Maori recruitment campaign that has been running during 1996/97. This campaign will seek to increase recruitment of Maori to all forms of teacher training, including Maori-medium training. It will include face-to-face contacts using major hui, schools and tertiary training establishments and television, radio and print advertising. The additional funding (up from $50,000 during 1996/97) will enable the campaign to be intensified.

Data collection

The Ministry of Education will be collecting improved data on teachers, trainees and the community pool, including the capacity to differentiate by ethnicity, as part of its overall teacher supply strategies, to improve its capacity to monitor the supply of Maori teachers and to help with future policy development.

EFTS Funding for te reo Maori programmes for Maori-medium teacher trainees

Maori-medium teacher training providers will be informed that bids for language EFTS, to enable them to offer te reo Maori training in association with their Maori-medium teacher education programmes, will be favourably considered by the Ministry of Education. Providers will determine the numbers of EFTS required and bid for these from the current EFTS pool for tertiary language programmes. The provision of specific EFTS for te reo Maori language programmes is designed to support Maori-medium teacher trainers to achieve high levels of proficiency among Maori-medium teacher graduates.

Increasing the supply of teacher training accessible to rural and mature people

The Ministry of Education will be consulting with training providers as to how they might offer more programmes that are accessible to rural and mature trainees as an important part of improving overall teacher supply, and will be seeking ways of providing information to rural people about their training options.
