Two new appointments to the board of New Zealand On Air were announced today by The Minister of Communications Hon Maurice Williamson.

Juliet McKee has been named as the new Deputy Chair of New Zealand On Air Board and Pamela Meekings-Stewart has  
been reappointed to the board for a second term.

"Mrs McKee's background as an economist, company director and her skills in business and administration will prove  
invaluable to the New Zealand On Air Board," Communications Minister Maurice Williamson said.

"The reappointment of Ms Meekings Stewart whose background is film and television will provide for valuable continuity of experience," Mr Williamson said.

New Zealand On Air is responsible for gathering and distributing the Public Broadcasting Fee and the new appointments which take effect from July 16, will be for a term of three years.
