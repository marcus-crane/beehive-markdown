Suicide bombers who last night killed 14 people and wounded more that 150 in Jerusalem had carried out a provocative and cowardly act of terrorism, Prime Minister Jim Bolger said today.

"If those behind this terrorist act think that peace can be achieved by intimidation and the killing of innocent citizens, they are sadly mistaken," Mr Bolger said.

"This latest act of terrorism undermines the latest attempts to reopen negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians."

Mr Bolger expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and said that peace in the Middle East could only come through building trust, confidence and integrity. There had to be a genuine willingness for peace by all parties.

The Prime Minister reiterated New Zealand's support for recent efforts in the United Nations to move the peace process forward. However, terrorist actions created real difficulties for peace initiatives supported by the international community, he said.
