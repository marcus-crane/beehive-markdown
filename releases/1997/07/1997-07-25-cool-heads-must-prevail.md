The Minister of Maori Affairs, the Hon Tau Henare, said cool heads must prevail in the lead up to tomorrow's annual meeting of Te Ohu Kaimoana in Wellington.

Mr Henare said while there is a lot of media hype surrounding the meeting discussion of the issues at hand must be allowed to prevail above all else.

"The fisheries issue is one that's ripped our people apart from day one.

"I know on one side there's a lot of expectations the vexed question of allocation will finally be answered, and on the other that consultation must continue," said Mr Henare.

"Tomorrow's forum is yet another opportunity to thrash the issues about in a reasonable manner. As a people we should take that opportunity to talk about the issues amongst one another, rather than talk past each other."

Mr Henare will be attending the meeting along with other Maori Members of Parliament.
