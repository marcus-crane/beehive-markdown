Fostering a social and economic environment which encourages participation by older people is one of the greatest challenges facing New Zealand society for the future, Prime Minister Jim Bolger said today.

Mr Bolger's comments followed the presentation to the Government of the final report of the Prime Ministerial Task Force on Positive Ageing by Task Force chairman, Sir Ross Jansen.

Mr Bolger said he hoped the report would provide New Zealanders with a greater understanding of the issues facing an ageing population, as well as providing present and future Governments with a range of policy options designed to capture the rich resource offered by older people.

The Task Force's report shows that there will be a significant increase in the proportion of people aged 65 years and over in the next half-century, from 12 percent of the population in 1996, to 25 percent of the population in 2051.

Mr Bolger said that the number of centenarians was also rising and since he had become Prime Minister the number of cards of congratulations had grown steadily.

"In 1991, I signed 95 cards of congratulations to New Zealanders who had celebrated their 100th birthday and in 1996 I signed 136 cards," Mr Bolger said.

"I understand that when I am 100 years old, my successor as Prime Minister will be signing almost 50 cards a week."

Mr Bolger said the report by the Task Force would add weight to Government initiatives already being developed in areas such as health, education and social welfare, savings for retirement and a population conference in November looking at demographic change, including ageing and immigration, and what that means for New Zealand society in the future.

"We want a society free of prejudice and discrimination against older people, that captures the wisdom and experience that only age can bring, and uses this rich resource to build stronger communities in the future.

"To do this, we need to be able to identify the roles and responsibilities of individuals, communities, the voluntary and private sectors, as well as the Government, in the promotion of positive ageing," Mr Bolger said.

"I don't regard an ageing population as a problem. However, it will become a problem if we don't start thinking about these issues now and recognising the way in which the "seniors boom" will impact, progressively, on our society well into the next century.

"What is very clear already is that there is no single response. We need to look at the issue from a number of angles and understand that we are not alone in the world on this issue - we are very much a part of a global demographic change."

Mr Bolger noted that his recent talks with Chancellor Kohl of Germany, Prime Minister Howard of Australia and Prime Minister Hashimoto of Japan had all focused on this issue, while in the United States, the White House last year hosted a conference on ageing and in Britain, the Carnegie Foundation reported to the Government on the UK's ageing population and proposed a platform for future policy change.

"This Government accepts the challenge the report by the Task Force poses. I will be asking Ministers to consider the report's recommendations affecting areas of public policy and there will be a Government response to it later in the year," Mr Bolger said.
