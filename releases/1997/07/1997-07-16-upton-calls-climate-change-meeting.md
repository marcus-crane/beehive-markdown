The Minister for the Environment and Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Hon Simon Upton, has called for developed country Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change to meet at Ministerial level prior to this December's Conference of the Parties in  
Kyoto.

At the Kyoto Conference, developed (Annex I) countries are scheduled to agree to new targets to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.

"With negotiations showing no signs of progress to date and considerable gaps remaining between the positions of key players, there is an urgent need for the developed nations to get down to some hard talking," Mr Upton said.

"New Zealand takes the view that it is up to the Annex I countries to reach a common position on how far they are prepared to go and on what terms. This can only be reached directly between the Parties and given the current differences, at ministerial level."

Mr Upton said that leaving this gap unbridged until Kyoto may be too late. In such circumstances, it would be doubtful whether agreement could be reached at the Kyoto Conference.

"There is still too much misunderstanding among countries. The issues have to be talked through candidly around the table. There will need to be compromises if any agreement is to be reached. At this stage, the choice is between modest progress or no progress at all."

Under the Convention, the developed (Annex I) countries are committed to take the first steps to reduce emissions. Beyond this, the progressive evolution of commitments to embrace developing countries will be vital. Given the global nature of the problem, participation by all countries is necessary if climate change is to be effectively addressed. Developing country emissions will outstrip those of the developed world within the  
next thirty years, and will do so at an increasing rate.

"Developed countries have no chance of persuading developing countries to adopt commitments if they cannot even agree on a common approach themselves."

Mr Upton had approached Canada to chair this Ministerial meeting.

"Canada's admirable efforts to bridge outstanding gaps between key players makes them the obvious choice to spearhead such an initiative", said Mr Upton.

New Zealand has approached a number of key Annex I players, including the US, EU, Japan and Germany with this initiative. Mr Upton said that initial reactions to the proposal have been positive.
