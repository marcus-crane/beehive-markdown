"There has been some speculation surrounding the circumstances in which a contract for a media information programme concerning the government's 'children under six' healthcare policy was made," Prime Minister Jim Bolger said today.

"After reviewing the matter with the Minister of Health and then with the Deputy Prime Minister I have decided to refer it to the Controller and Auditor-General, for his independent consideration and advice.

"I will comment further in light of that advice which I expect to receive by the end of July," Mr Bolger concluded.
