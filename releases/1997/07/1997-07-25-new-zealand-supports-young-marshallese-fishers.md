The Hon John Luxton, Minister of Fisheries, recently travelled to the Marshall Islands to attend multilateral meetings to discuss the Conservation and Management of Tuna stocks in the Central and Western Pacific Ocean.

The first of these meetings, with delegates from each of 16 countries within the Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), confirmed a previously agreed position on the principles which would form the basis of the negotiation process with distant water fisheries countries and entities that fish within their region. The countries within the FFA include; Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, PNG, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Tonga, Tokelau, Vanuatu and Western Samoa

At the second of these meetings, delegates from member countries of the FFA met with delegations from distant water fisheries nations and entities that fish within the Central and Western Pacific Ocean and agreed on a declaration of principles as a shared position from which to conduct negotiations and work programme for subsequent meetings.

To assist the Secretariat of the FFA for the Marshall Island Conference, NZ provided computer equipment to the Marshall Islands in the form of 2 computers, 2 printers and 1 fax to the value of USD 11,000. At the conclusion of the meeting, the equipment was presented to the Marshall Islands Fisheries Institute. While in the Marshall Islands, the Hon John Luxton met with the principal of the Institute, Captain Larry Muller, one of the course instructors, Captain Willy, and some of the students.

The Institute has 24 senior students as well as 12 junior fishers. Their course runs for 9 months, which includes 3 months of practical experience and 6 months of classroom study, where they learn skills in navigation, seamanship and marine engineering. At present the Institute is awaiting the arrival of a 45 m long line boat, built in NZ, for use in the practical portion of their course. The computer equipment will be a very valuable resource in the classroom portion of their course.
