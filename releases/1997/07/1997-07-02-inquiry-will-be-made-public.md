The outcome of the inquiry into an incident earlier this year when a mentally-ill man raped a woman in Levin would most definitely be made public, Health Minister Bill English said today.

"The incident which is being investigated was extremely serious with tragic consequences for the victim.

"There is no question that the key findings of the report will be made public, especially if there are any questions at all about the conduct of public institutions. Public institutions must be accountable to the public.

"In releasing the report, however, we clearly have to recognise the privacy interests of patients and/or other people involved," said Mr English.

"This has been a particularly complex case and large amounts of information have had to be collated and analysed. For these reasons I have approved a further extension to the inquiry until the end of this month, but I do not believe any further extensions would be in the public interest," he said.
