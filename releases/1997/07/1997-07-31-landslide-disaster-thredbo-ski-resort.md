Prime Minister Jim Bolger this afternoon personally conveyed New Zealand's condolences and support to Australia's Prime Minister John Howard, following the landslide disaster at Thredbo Ski Resort.

"The New Zealand Government, on behalf of all New Zealanders, sends its deepest sympathy and support to all Australians on this sad day.

"New Zealand knows all too well the tragic effect of natural disasters, particularly in alpine terrain, but it does not make the event any easier to accept.

"Our best wishes and prayers are with the family and friends of the victims," Mr Bolger said
