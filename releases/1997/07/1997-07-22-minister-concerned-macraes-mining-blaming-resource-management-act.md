The Minister for the Environment, Hon Simon Upton, is concerned that Macraes Mining Company Ltd is blaming planning delays for the deferral of their expansion plans.

Last Friday Macraes managing director, Patrick O'Connor, was reported to have deferred the proposed $120 million expansion of the East Otago mine because of the falling gold prices and delays in the granting of consents under the Resource Management Act.

Mr Upton said he was concerned that the Resource Management Act was being used as a convenient excuse to justify putting a major development on hold.

The proposed expansion of the gold mine is a huge undertaking. It will leave behind a hole that will take approximately 200 years to fill with water, two new tailings dams with over 50 million tonnes of tailings behind them and rock stacks over 100 metres high.

\`\`From my understanding, it is the fall in gold prices fairly and squarely that has put the viability of the mine expansion in doubt'' Mr Upton said. \`\`To try to allege delay in the resource consent process as a reason is misleading''.

\`\`As I understand it, the company applied for over 30 different resource consents just before Christmas last year, and further applications for a massive tailings dam the day before the hearing was due to start in April'' Mr Upton said.

\`\`For the company to blame delays on the Resource Management Act , and the councils processing the applications, is unreasonable'' he said.

\`\`The assessment of these consents to safeguard New Zealand's environment from unacceptable damage is the key reason for the Resource Management Act. Such assessment is not some clip on to slow down development. To expect decisions on complex issues in an unreasonable  
time-frame is to undervalue the importance of environmental management".

\`\`I am always happy to investigate legitimate concerns about delays in processing resource consents, but I am not prepared to have the Resource Management Act undermined by people using it as a convenient whipping boy for difficult investment decisions''.
