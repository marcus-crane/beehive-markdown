The Minister of Maori Affairs, the Hon Tau Henare, today condemned alleged racially motivated arson in the South Island at the weekend.

The Ngai Tahu Community Law Centre in Christchurch is believed to have been the subject of racially motivated attack that followed the settlement of Ngai Tahu's claim against the Crown last Friday.

Mr Henare reiterated that such an attack should not be tolerated and he encouraged anyone with information on it to assist the Police with their inquiries so the offenders could be brought to justice swiftly.

"It's a sad state of affairs when the ignorant choose to let their views be known like this," he said.

"It's a cowardly act and I'd challenge the coward, or cowards, responsible to front up."

Mr Henare said the attack showed there was a lack of informed opinion about the treaty claims and the claims process, even though there was a vast range of resource material available on the subject from a variety of sources.

He urged people to better inform themselves of the issues.

"I don't think the actions of the individual or individuals responsible will endear them to the wider community. It doesn't do anything for anybody and alienates sections of society.

"Becoming informed is a simple enough exercise," said Mr Henare.
