The Minister of Communications, the Hon Maurice Williamson today expressed his disappointment at the decision of CLEAR Communications Limited to involve the Government in commercial litigation between itself and Telecom New Zealand Limited.

"CLEAR has been attempting for some years to persuade the Government to change the regulatory environment for  
telecommunications to a form which would be more favourable to it.

"The Government will not be influenced in its policy development by litigation.

"The Government will continue to develop policies for the benefit of the community overall, not to the advantage of any one player," the Minister said.

"Clear has been able to achieve some 18% market share in the national toll market, some 20% market share in the international toll market and has launched a local access service. CLEAR made a $37 million profit in 1996, representing a return of 16%.

"Government is taking advice on the issues raised in the statement of claim and will examine the scope for seeking to have the claim struck out," Mr Williamson said.
