Health Minister Bill English today announced changes to the way secure long-term care for mentally ill patients was provided, with new facilities to be built to replace the ageing National Secure Unit at Lake Alice.

"These are people who need long-term, safe and secure care. The new facilities will provide a therapeutic environment for them, where they can be closer to their families and where there is appropriate security.

"It will be up to the Transitional Health Authority to sort out the best arrangements for the patients, regardless of location. Good Health Wanganui, which runs the NSU, will have the same opportunities as other providers to tender for the provision of these services," he said.

Mr English said there would be capacity for up to 40 beds with the new facilities. Currently there were beds for up to 35 patients at the NSU. Planning work would start immediately and the units would be expected to be up and running within 18 months to two years.

"The current facilities and services at Lake Alice are not adequate for these patients. We know we can do things better and this decision is about providing the best possible service for this group of people.

"Even the name of the National Secure Unit has always been a misnomer because it implies that this is the most secure of the secure units we have for detaining people. In fact what makes this group of patients different from others being treated by forensic mental health services is that they need long-term care.

"People with mental illness deserve to be treated with the same dignity and respect as others treated by our health services. This decision means we can provide facilities that are safe for the patients and safe for the community," said Mr English.
