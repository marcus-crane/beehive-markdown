The Government's planned booking system for surgical waiting lists would give certainty to the people eligible for operations, Health Minister Bill English said today.

Releasing the latest available figures on surgical waiting lists, Mr English said the figures were almost meaningless without being able to evaluate need.

"The raw numbers of people currently on waiting lists do not tell us much about the actual needs of people.

"The reality at present is that some people will be on a waiting list for a very long time because their need is never going to be urgent. Other people, who should be seen much more quickly, will also be on a waiting list for too long because the system is not designed to help them.

"It is also true that people now get treated differently depending on where in New Zealand they live. This is not fair, but it means there will be some trade-offs as we work towards implementing booking systems around the country.

"By 1 July next year the aim is to have all elective surgery completed according to clear and consistent criteria which is set down on a national basis.

"The Government has recognised that it must address the back-log of people on waiting lists. Last year $130 million was committed to clearing waiting lists and a further injection of $105 million over the next three years was announced in the Budget," he said.
