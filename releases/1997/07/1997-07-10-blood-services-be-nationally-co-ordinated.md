A single Crown-owned agency to nationally co-ordinate the country's blood service would be established by 1 July next year, Health Minister Bill English announced today.

"The review of the country's blood sector which I released earlier this year recommended that a national service be established. There has been wide support from the blood sector for a single, co-ordinated service and the Government has now decided to put a national service in place."

"There are currently 22 separate blood services operating throughout New Zealand, each accountable to its own Crown health enterprise.

"The move to a national service will ensure blood services are accountable to a single agency and will provide a nationally consistent service for users of blood and blood products.

"A lot of work still needs to be done on the shape and roles of the new service and how it will interact with hospitals. The improvements will build on the high quality service now in place. Blood donors will still be a crucial part of the service and will continue to have an opportunity to donate locally. More detailed information on these changes will be available at the end of September.

"The new national service will cost up to $1.5 million to establish but there is scope for significant efficiencies to be made within blood services once in place," he said.

The transition to a national service will be overseen by an advisory committee over the next 12 months.
