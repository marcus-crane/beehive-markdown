Forestry Minister Lockwood Smith today acknowledged the key role of John Valentine, Chief Executive of the Ministry of Forestry, in the development of New Zealand forestry.

Dr Valentine announced his resignation yesterday. He will leave the ministry on September 5 to take up a new appointment as chief executive of the New Zealand Seafood Industry Council.

"In the short time I have known Dr Valentine we have developed an excellent working relationship," Dr Smith said.

"He has served the people of New Zealand well in his role as chief executive and he has made a very real and significant contribution to the development of New Zealand's outstanding forestry sector.

"There have been many changes to the forestry industry during his long career, including the Crown's withdrawal from timber growing and processing and the emergence of New Zealand as a significant force on the international forestry scene.

"Throughout these changes Dr Valentine has been there ensuring forestry makes its best possible contribution to New Zealand."
