The Minister of Maori Affairs, the Hon Tau Henare, today announced his support for the Aranui High School Academy after recent criticism concerning members of its rugby team receiving benefit payments.

"I support the Aranui High School Academy concept as a positive and innovative way to assist young students, particularly Maori, into careers of their choice," he said.

"Up until now I have only heard good things about the academy concept and the impact it has had on both the school and its local community."

The Minister was concerned about the recent criticism that students should not be competing in school competitions if they receive benefit payments. He also expressed his concerns about the implications that the criticism may have on the Academy.

"I am disappointed to hear of the recent criticism that the Aranui Academy rugby team has received. I am aware that some students already receive benefit payments indirectly through family support benefits, and that other students may be placed in more fortunate positions where they can rely on their parents to meet their financial needs.

"The issue seems to come down to providing opportunities for students to pursue their aspirations and some students have an unfair advantage to begin with."

"I hope the Aranui issue can be resolved without adversely affecting the aims and aspirations of the school, its academy and its students," said Mr Henare.
