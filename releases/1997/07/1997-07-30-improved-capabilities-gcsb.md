Prime Minister Jim Bolger today announced two decisions taken by the Government to enhance the signals intelligence collection capability of the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB).

Both initiatives relate to the GCSB's satellite monitoring station at Waihopai near Blenheim, which has made a significant contribution to New Zealand's foreign intelligence collection capability since it was established by the then Labour Government about ten years ago. They are intended to remedy constraints which are increasingly diluting the effectiveness of the station in both the volume and range of high interest foreign communications able to be collected to satisfy the foreign intelligence requirements of the New Zealand Government.

Mr Bolger said a second antenna and covering radome will shortly be constructed at Waihopai. This will be similar in appearance to the station's existing radome. The Minister of Defence has issued a certificate under Section 4 of the Resource Management Act 1991 to enable the construction to take place without the need to obtain a resource consent.

The second decision will enable the station to collect foreign voice communications which have until now been unable to be monitored by GCSB for legal reasons.

Mr Bolger said an Order in Council, the Crimes (Exemption of Listening Device) Order 1997, had accordingly been signed by the Governor-General exempting the Waihopai station from the provisions of Part IXA of the Crimes Act 1961.

The Prime Minister stressed that the new powers were strictly confined to the collection of foreign communications which contain, or may reasonably be expected to contain, foreign intelligence.

"GCSB remains forbidden by law to intentionally intercept New Zealanders' voice communications, as it always has been," said Mr Bolger.

Mr Bolger said the Government was conscious that the increasing number of communication satellites had resulted in the steady erosion of the effectiveness of the single antenna Waihopai station.

At the same time, the need for intelligence to support the Government's foreign, defence and trade policies had, if anything, increased over recent years, Mr Bolger said. Therefore the decisions had been taken to proceed with these initiatives.

The Prime Minister noted that the arrangements for the oversight and accountability of the GCSB have been strengthened by the appointment of an Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security last year.

Mr Bolger also said that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security has been requested to examine the established internal procedures and practices employed by the GCSB to ensure that it complies with the constraints contained in the Order in Council exemption.

"I have advised the Inspector-General that I am seeking reassurance concerning the established operating methods, procedures, and rules by which GCSB ensures that its operations and activities are at all times lawful, proper, and have no adverse or improper impact on the lives of New Zealand citizens.

"While neither I nor my predecessors have any reasons to doubt the GCSB's scrupulousness in these matters, this falls very clearly into the purview of the Inspector-General, and it is appropriate at this time, that he be invited to extend his oversight into this area."
