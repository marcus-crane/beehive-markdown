Hon Deborah Morris today launched the Support Workers in Schools Programme, a new initiative by the Hutt City Safer Community Action Network.

The programme aims to reduce criminal behaviour, improve school attendance and attainment and make more effective use of existing specialist services.

"A number of schools are doing extremely well at providing the education and support young people need. However, for some, there is still a long way to go. I hope that a dedicated programme such as this can provide students with an education that meets their needs. To do this the lives of young people need to be viewed holistically because education is not just a classroom experience, it is often about what goes on outside the classroom in young people's private lives.

"The recent Budget delivered resources for some innovative projects designed to help schools and youth at risk. $ 7 million of new money has been set aside for a comprehensive crime prevention package specifically targeting young people at risk of offending.

"The resources promised will only produce results if there is energy and commitment from those delivering the services. And these will be two of the key ingredients in your Support Workers in Schools Programme," said Hon Deborah Morris.
