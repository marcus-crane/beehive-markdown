Transport Minister Jenny Shipley says the Coalition Government's latest initiative to tackle the road toll begins today with the start of a 12 month trial of hidden speed cameras.

" Already this year 278 people have died on the roads compared to 254 at the same time last year. Speed is estimated to be a factor in around a third of fatal crashes. We cannot let this continue.

"The road toll is particularly worrying in Waikato with 61 people dying in that region already this year - more then 70 per cent higher than the 35 deaths at the same time last year. Almost 22 per cent of all deaths have occurred in Waikato, although that region has only 9.6 per cent of the country's population.

"That is part of the reason why the speed camera trial will be conducted in Police Region 2, which covers Waikato, Coromandel, Bay of Plenty, East Coast and Taupo.

"In the three years since speed cameras were introduced, LTSA research indicates a reduction in the number of fatal and serious crashes of approximately 23.3 per cent at urban speed camera sites, and 10.9 per cent at rural sites.

"Speed cameras definitely assist in slowing people down which saves lives. Before speed cameras were introduced in the Australian state of Victoria in 1986, on average 19 per cent of drivers were exceeding the speed limits. Today, 11 years on, only two per cent exceed the speed limits. New Zealand is experiencing a similar pattern of reduction, but we still have a long way to go.

"The message the Coalition Government wants to get across to drivers is that they should drive at an appropriate speed for the conditions regardless of whether they can see a speed camera in operation or not. We want to know whether making speed cameras less obviously visible will help reinforce that message, and that is what the 12 month trial will establish.

"The National Road Safety Committee which has members from the LTSA, Police, Ministry of Transport, ACC and Transit, will be assessing the trial in terms of speed, reported crashes and public attitudes.

"Once the 12 month trial is complete, the Coalition Government will decide whether to introduce hidden speed cameras throughout the country.

"All drivers need to now that the risk of dying in a car crash doubles when speed increases from 100 km/h to 120 km/h. We should choose to drive at safe speeds for the sake of ourselves and our families, and speed camera fines should be seen as a salient reminder that speed kills," the Ministers concluded.
