The options set out in the Pathways for Auckland discussion document for the future use of the resources of the Auckland Regional Services Trust will be explained by the Minister of Local Government, Hon Chris Fletcher and Dr Roger Blakeley, Secretary for Local Government, at a public meeting to be held 8pm Monday 28 July 1997 at the Jubilee Hall, Parnell.

"This is a chance for Aucklanders to learn more about the options outlined in Pathways and ask questions about the document and subsequent process once submissions have been received," Mrs Fletcher said.

"The meeting is intended to provide people with an opportunity to become better informed about the options, as well as for those who want to have their say publicly."

Submissions will be accepted up until 8 August 1997. Copies of Pathways for Auckland are available from Auckland Link Centres, the Epsom Electorate Office or the Department of Internal Affairs in Wellington.

The Pathways public meeting will be held at 8pm, Monday 28 July 1997. Jubilee Hall, Parnell Community Centre (the former Blind Foundation building), Parnell Road, Parnell, Auckland.
