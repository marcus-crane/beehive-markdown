Health Minister Bill English said today the Ministry of Health would be supporting improvements to fire protection in rest homes following an investigation into the fire in the Joan Whiting Rest Home, Collingwood.

"The fire at Collingwood highlighted just how dangerous the situation can be for old people. In particular the increasing frailty of residents, which makes independent evacuation difficult, has to be taken into account when considering fire protection measures in rest homes," said Mr English.

Information gained by the Ministry shows that of the 790 licensed old people's homes in October 1996, a third did not have sprinkler systems.

"The Building Industry Authority is currently reviewing key clauses in the Building Code covering fire safety and sprinkler requirements. The Ministry is taking the opportunity of the review to support improvements to fire protection in rest homes.

"The Ministry will also work with the Fire Service to encourage rest home operators to install sprinklers and to tighten up the requirements for fire evacuation plans," said Mr English.
