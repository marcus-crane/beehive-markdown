Former race relations and human rights conciliator Hiwi Tauroa has been appointed Commissioner at Waiomio School in Northland.

Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today that he had dissolved the school's Board of Trustees, following a report by the Education Review Office which expressed "major concerns" about governance, management, compliance and curriculum delivery.

"Careful consideration has been given to the submissions from the school on the possibility of dissolving the Board of Trustees. I believe the best step forward is to proceed with the dissolution of the Board and appoint a Commissioner," Mr Creech said.

A former secondary school principal, Hiwi Tauroa will take responsibility for the functions and duties of the board.

Mr Creech said Mr Tauroa was a widely experienced member of the Tai Tokerau Maori Trust Board and had tribal affiliations with Ngapuhi, Ngati Whatua, Ngai Tahu and Ngati Mamoe.

"I am pleased that a person of Mr Tauroa's experience and standing in the community has agreed to accept this appointment," said Mr Creech. "It will be his job to help the Waiomio School to function effectively, and to address the school's immediate concerns.

"The daily management of the school will continue to be the responsibility of the school's principal, in consultation with Mr Tauroa," he said.

Waiomio School's roll at 1 March this year stood at 8.

Waiomio School Background Information  
The Education Review Office said in its May 1997 report that it had major concerns related to governance, management, compliance and curriculum delivery:

ERO recommended that the Minister of Education (under Section 107 of the Education Act 1989) should dissolve the board of trustees on the grounds of mismanagement, incompetence and lack of action.

Following this report, the Minister invited the school board to comment on the ERO report, and to give reasons why it should not be dissolved. The board presented its response on June 25, and it was given full consideration by both the Minister and the Ministry.

The Minister decided he was not satisfied with the reasons the board gave for remaining in office, so he has today formally dissolved the board.

As a consequence, the Secretary for Education has appointed Hiwi Tauroa as Commissioner.

Mr Tauroa has extensive educational, local body, and community experience. He's a former secondary school principal, Race Relations Conciliator and Human Rights Conciliator. He has tribal affiliations with Ngapuhi, Ngati Whatua, Ngai Tahu and Ngati Mamoe.

The appointment of the Commissioner is an interim measure. It will be his job to help the school operate effectively and to address immediate concerns.

His role is to:

set up procedures which address the issues raised in the report on the discretionary assurance audit carried out by ERO

arrange for new board elections

exercise governance responsibilities until a new board is elected.  
The Ministry will appoint an independent facilitator to investigate the ongoing viability of Waiomio School.

The daily management of the school will continue to be the responsibility of the principal, who will confer with the Commissioner as necessary

The Commissioner's term of office will end with the election of a new board.
