Health Minister Bill English said today he was very keen to see some of the projects identified for better patient care in Wanganui get off the ground.

"These projects have been identified within the proposed joint venture from Wanganui United for the management of general practitioner and hospital services in the town.

"Good Health Wanganui should be able to now begin work on making many of the improvements proposed in the plan without requiring further structural major change.

"These proposals include initiatives to improve mental health services, an asthma management project, the redesign and merger of the emergency and after-hours services and the redesign of the outpatients, acute and elective inpatient services. Others include development of a retail pharmacy, the redesign of maternity services and the development of diagnostic and pharmaceutical guidelines.

"I would be keen to see these projects get off the ground quickly, regardless of the longer-term issues around full integrated care in Wanganui," Mr English said.

"I have not given approval to the Wanganui United proposal as it currently stands. The proposed joint venture offers some opportunities in terms of improved patient care and health outcomes. However, aspects of the current proposal pose risks for the Crown and these must be addressed before I would consider giving approval to a proposal.

"As the owner of by far the greater proportion of the assets in such a joint venture, the Crown's interests must be protected. A more incremental approach to change may be the best solution," he said.

"I have encouraged Good Health Wanganui and Progressive Health Incorporated to come back to me with a modified proposal. In the meantime I would certainly encourage work to start on some of the specific projects identified," Mr English said.
