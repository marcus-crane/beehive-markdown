It may be across the Tasman, but New Zealand has a lot to benefit from the Sydney 2000 Olympics.

Prime Minister Jim Bolger today released details of a new group, the Sydney 2000 Taskforce as part of a Millennium structure.

The Minister responsible for establishing the group, Tourism & Sport, Fitness and Leisure Minister, Murray McCully said the Taskforce was necessary to ensure New Zealand took full advantage of the opportunities created by the Olympic Games in Sydney.

"Sydney 2000 are Australasia's Games and it is important that we have New Zealand representatives watching and monitoring the developments across the Tasman to ensure we don't let any chances go by. "

Mr McCully said the Taskforce was made up of represenatives from various sectors and was designed to both monitor and maximise on the diverse range of opportunities the event created.

"The Sydney 2000 Olympics are much more than just a sporting event, they present opportunities for New Zealand in trade, tourism and cultural activities as well," he said.

The members of the Taskforce will be Chief Executive Officers from The Hillary Commission, The NZTB, Tradenz, The New Zealand Olympic Committee, The New Zealand Sports Foundation and the Ministry of Cultural Affairs.

This new group succeeds the, now disbanded, New Zealand 2000 Taskforce.
