The Government has announced it will set up a Taskforce to identify the support teachers need to lift the maths and science results of young New Zealanders.

Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today that he was particularly concerned about the test results of 8 and 9 year olds as documented in the Third International Maths and Science Study.

"We need to make sure that our young people have good skills in maths and science and are encouraged to pursue study in these subjects."

The study shows New Zealand 8 and 9 year olds were below the international averages in mathematics and slightly above the international averages in science.

"While the tests only assessed a limited range of factors and the results did not take into account curriculum changes, I do not think the Government can rest on its laurels over the science and maths achievements," Mr Creech said.

"The Government would be foolish and remiss if we ignored the sorts of results in the Third International Maths and Science Study.

"I will be setting up a Taskforce to examine New Zealand's performance in maths and science and to see what needs to be done to ensure that our results are up there with the rest of the world," Mr Creech said.

The group will once established move quickly to provide advice on:

The needs of classroom teachers in implementing the curriculum.  
Establishing the best balance of new Budget expenditure between curriculum materials and professional development.  
Members of the Taskforce will be appointed shortly and will include academics, practitioners, teachers and principals.  
Mr Creech wants their advice back as quickly as possible so programmes and support can be put in place for the 1998 school year to advance maths and science achievements.
