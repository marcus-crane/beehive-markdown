The Minister of Education is putting the time-table for the new school curriculum back on track, after it was put on hold just over a year ago.

The Minister has announced new timelines for the completion of the reform of the school curriculum which began in 1991.

"The new national curriculum statements - one for each of the seven essential learning areas - are designed to provide students with up to date teaching and learning to prepare them for life and work in the new millennium," Mr Creech said.

The new national curriculum statements were introduced between 1993-95 for English, science and mathematics. A fourth, for Technology, was issued in 1995 but has not yet been made compulsory. Altogether, there will be seven statements setting out the compulsory curriculum for all students in years 1-10 (new entrants to form 4.)

Each statement also has a Maori language equivalent for the increasing numbers of students who learn through the medium of te reo Maori. So far, three of these statements have been introduced: for te reo Maori, Putaiao (science) and Pangarau (mathematics.)

The timetable for the completion of the reforms was paused in June last year. "The implementation of the new school curriculum was creating concern and pressure in schools. The pause was put in place in response to the concerns about teacher workload and the scale and pace of change in schools," Mr Creech said.

"Since then a lot of work has been done in conjunction with school representatives as to the best way forward with the new school curriculum." The Minister has approved the new implementation plan following consideration by the consultative group examining workload in schools.

"The new timelines will include comprehensive support for the implementation of the curriculum statements.

"The new plan includes a transition phase to ease the introduction of each new national curriculum statement. This will give schools at least two years to come to grips with the new curriculum as each one is implemented." Mr Creech said during the transition phase teachers and students will receive extra support such as teacher professional development programmes, resource materials for teachers and students, and advisory support from the teacher support services attached to each college of education.

"Once the reforms are completed, the Ministry of Education will review the whole curriculum to ensure that the changes are reflected in student results and that schools are managing it.

"The new timetable should give schools certainty to plan for curriculum development and implementation." Obsolete syllabuses, curriculum legislation and regulations will be revoked as part of the plan.
