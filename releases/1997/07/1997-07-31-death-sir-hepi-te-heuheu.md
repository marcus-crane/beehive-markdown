"I am greatly saddened to hear of the passing of Sir Hepi te Heuheu this evening," the Prime Minister said tonight.

"Sir Hepi was a distinguished and pre-eminent New Zealander known for his wisdom and humility."

"He was much loved and respected by all those who knew him. His loss is New Zealand's loss," Mr Bolger said.

Sir Hepi te Heuheu was descended from a line of paramount chiefs of Ngati Tuwharetoa. He served on numerous land trusts and was a key leader in many organisations, including the Tongariro National Park Board, a park which his great grandfather gifted to the nation in 1887.

Sir Hepi's work was recognised by the Crown when he was made a Knight of the British Empire in 1979.

"Sir Hepi was looked upon by Maori as a political leader, one who could bring the concerns and voices of Maori to the attention of the Government of the day. It was a role which he carried out with distinction and honour."

The Prime Minister extends his deepest sympathies to the te Heuheu family on behalf of the Government and people of New Zealand.
