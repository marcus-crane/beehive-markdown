Health Minister Bill English said today he was concerned at allegations that young patients at Lake Alice Hospital were abused there in the 1970s.

Mr English confirmed that a report from the lawyer acting for a number of former patients had been referred to him this week from the Attorney-General's office.

"My initial reaction from seeing the television documentary and reading the lawyer's report was one of horror at what had happened to these people. I have no reason to disbelieve their stories.

"We now have to ask what the appropriate next step is. I don't yet know what that is and will be asking the Ministry of Health for advice on what options are available," said Mr English.

"There will inevitably be some very complex legal issues involved, but the Government cannot be seen to be hiding behind a wall of legal complexities.

"Lake Alice is a place which holds some terrible memories for a lot of New Zealanders. I am very pleased that we are going to be looking at closing it down. However, I do believe that the culture of places like Lake Alice has changed, even since the 1970s. The lack of accountability then and the idea that people in authority were always right has certainly changed," he said.
