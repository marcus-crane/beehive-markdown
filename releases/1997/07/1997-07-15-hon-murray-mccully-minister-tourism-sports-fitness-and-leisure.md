Sport and Tourism Minister Murray McCully is travelling to Australia this morning (Tuesday 15 July) to discuss how New Zealand can maximise the trade, tourism and sporting opportunities provided by the Sydney Olympics.

Mr McCully will meet at the Games site this afternoon with the New South Wales State Minister for the Olympics, Michael Knight, for an on-the-spot briefing on construction progress; he will have additional briefings in Sydney with the Olympic Organising Committee's new CEO and other key players with a stake in Games-related activities, such as local representatives of the NZ Tourism Board and Tradenz.

Tomorrow (Wednesday 16 July), Mr McCully will attend the annual gathering of New Zealand and Australian Federal and State Sport and Recreation Ministers in Brisbane.

"New Zealand manufacturers could benefit from Sydney Olympics trade spin-offs as much as from sports or tourism," said Mr McCully.

He said the start-up of the Sydney Olympic buying programme in recent weeks opened up furniture, whitegoods, information technology, catering, uniform provision and other potential 'fit-out' opportunities for New Zealand firms.

"This is an opportune time to meet with key players, with the Prime Minister due to announce in a few weeks how New Zealand will maintain the impetus generated by tourism and sporting activities, to ensure we take advantage of every opportunity to benefit from the Games," Mr McCully said.
