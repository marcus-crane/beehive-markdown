The Minister of Education today announced new measures intended to further improve the accuracy and reliability of how school staff are paid.

"There has been a lot of concern about the way the education service payroll system has operated. Over recent months the centralised payroll service has improved but there can be no complacency.

"The Government wants to ensure problems experienced earlier this year where many staff in schools weren't getting the correct pay is not repeated. People should be able to rely on getting the right amount of money in their pay packets," Mr Creech said.

The Minister of Education, the Minister of Communications and the Associate Treasurer have been examining options to further enhance education payroll services available to schools and to respond to demands from schools to run their own payroll.

Cabinet has approved three new initiatives for schools to lift the accuracy of staff pay:

A voluntary trial for some schools to manage their own payrolls.

Improved access to school payroll and personnel information through the provision of an Internet Website containing collective employment contract information.

The option for schools to directly input their payroll data on-line into the central payroll system.  
"The Government wants teachers and other school staff to be confident about the payroll system. We want to reduce the risk of them getting the wrong pay. The measures should reduce the error rate further," Mr Creech said.

"In line with the Tomorrows' Schools principle of self management, a number of schools have been seeking the capability to run their own payrolls. Some schools already run very successful payroll systems for their support staff."

There will be benefits to both staff and management for those schools that opt to trial managing their payroll.

"The schools will be more responsive at a local level because there will be instant access to the payroll rather than having to go through a third party. There is the potential to cut the amount of time spent on processing the payroll information and staff will also have immediate access to the people who process their pay," Mr Creech said.

"For the purposes of the trial directly resourced schools will come into the pilot because they have a maximum expenditure cap at school level. Centrally resourced schools do not have that financial discipline. A way will have to be worked through that issue before centrally resourced schools could o their own payroll."

The trial will be closely monitored.

"The Education Ministry will continue to consult the Payroll Reference Group (which includes representatives from the teacher unions, the secondary school executive officers association, principal organisations and school trustees) on development of improved payroll options," Mr Creech said.

"We hope to get the new initiatives up and running in the next two months. Schools will be contacted with further details."
