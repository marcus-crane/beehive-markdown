Rural residents will continue to receive the same frequency of delivery service as now," said Maurice Williamson Minister of Communications during today's Parliamentary Question Time.

"This will be guaranteed by a new Deed of Understanding that the Government will establish with New Zealand Post Ltd.

"The Deed will also include undertakings that a rural delivery fee will not be reintroduced, and that New Zealand Post Ltd will maintain its nationwide delivery network and a network of postal outlets.

"Deregulation will provide postal customers with more choice in services and service providers, and without deregulation there is no guarantee New Zealand Post's current level of service would be maintained.

"New Zealand Post has acknowledged the reduction in price for a basic letter was undertaken in preparation to meet increased competition," said Mr Williamson.
