Health Minister Bill English said today more than $250 million was invested by the country's hospitals in the last financial year and more was planned in the coming year.

"Last year our Crown health enterprises invested $255 million on capital programmes. This year we could well see around $300 million invested.

"That is a huge sum. If this was the most disastrous period in this history of public hospitals in New Zealand, why would the our hospitals be going ahead with an investment programme on this scale?

"This money has been spent on everything from new theatres, modernisation programmes and, in the Hawkes Bay, a new regional hospital.

"In some areas we are seeing changes to our hospitals, particularly hospitals in rural and smaller areas. Some hospitals are closing where they are too big and too expensive to maintain. Even then, public money continues to be spent in these areas providing health services for local people.

"This programme of capital investment proves this Government has a long-term commitment to our public health system," he said.
