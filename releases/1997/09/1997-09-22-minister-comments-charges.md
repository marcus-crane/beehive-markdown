The Minister for ACC Jenny Shipley says she is still very angry at the behavour of former ACC chief executive Gavin Robins, which has led to criminal charges being laid by the Serious Fraud Office.

"I am confident that the thorough investigation by the board of ACC that led to the matters being referred to the Serious Fraud Office picked up all the unacceptable behaiour.

"ACC levy payers and claimants can be confident that the Government and the board of ACC are determined to achieve the highest standards of management and performance from the top to the bottom of the scheme.

"We have turned a corner, with the appointment of a new chief executive to ACC, Gary Wilson. I am sure that Mr Wilson and the board of ACC will demonstrate that the public can have confidence in their management of ACC," Mrs Shipley concluded.
