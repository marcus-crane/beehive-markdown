Employment Minister, Peter McCardle said today recent Reserve Bank and NZIER forecasts for strong job growth into the year 2000 are encouraging news for job seekers.

"Both agencies project accelerating job growth out to 2000, with the Reserve Bank forecasting an employment increase of 96,000 and the Institute of Economic Research predicting an even greater increase of 102,000 over the same period."

"While unemployment remains a challenge, our present official unemployment rate of 6.7%, which puts us below the OECD average and well below our Australian neighbours, together with the job growth forecasts, give us reasons to be optimistic about our future." said Mr McCardle.

"Positive prospects for job growth over the next three years confirm the thoroughly good sense of the Government's twin strategies of providing real jobs through stronger economic growth, while attacking long-term unemployment and increasing long-term job seekers' active involvement in their communities."
