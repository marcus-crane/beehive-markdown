The Government will provide an additional humanitarian contribution of NZ$250,000 to help feed starving children and other vulnerable groups in North Korea, Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Upton announced today.

"More than a third of North Korean children are malnourished and recent reports note nurseries filled with stunted children, many too weak to stand and walk," Mr Upton said.

Serious drought has destroyed 70% of the country's maize crop, adding to the food shortages North Korea already faces. Humanitarian relief agencies have issued urgent appeals for assistance.

The New Zealand contribution will be channelled through the UN's World Food Programme. The money will come from the Emergency and Disaster Relief allocation of the New Zealand Official Development Assistance programme. This brings to $700,000 total New Zealand aid to North Korea since the beginning of 1997.
