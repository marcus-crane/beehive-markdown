Health Minister Bill English said today the Alliance's health spokeswoman Phillida Bunkle was more interested in plumbing than people.

"Ms Bunkle is being dishonest with her current concern about changes that are happening in our hospitals. She is the first to say we should be spending more on health education and prevention, yet she is also advocating spending money propping up out-of-date buildings.

"In the real world we cannot have both. I have no problem with changes that see us spending less on buildings that are too big and too expensive and using the money saved to pay for better services for vulnerable people, such as children, the mentally ill and older people in continuing care.

"I want to see our valuable health dollars being spent on people, not plumbing," he said.
