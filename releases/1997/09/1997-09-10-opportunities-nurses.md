Health Minister Bill English told nurses at their annual conference today that in future he expects to see nurses taking on roles currently carried out by junior doctors in the hospitals and general practitioners in the community.

"Nurses have traditionally shown themselves to be open-minded to change and development in the health sector.

"That open-mindedness will stand nurses in good stead in future. Changes being initiated around the country are being driven by the need for improved clinical quality and by the need for the different health professionals who look after the same patient to work together.

"Both these changes provide significant opportunities for nurses.

"In hospitals there are opportunities for nurses to take on more management roles. I am also convinced that the way hospitals use junior doctors will change and increasingly they will look to nurses to take on that role. A highly skilled nurses not only has the medical skills but also the patient management experience to do a better job and we are seeing evidence of that in some hospitals already.

"In the community, the role of nurses will expand. Already practice nurses have become a critical part of many general practices and their role is going to expand further. Nurse prescribing, which I strongly support, will play a significant role in allowing nurses to operate more independently in the community..

Mr English urged nurses to look at the longer-term opportuntities opening up for nurses in the sector.

"I am willing to make changes to the system which will allow nurses to expand their role. The changes we have seen to midwifery, for example, have been made possible by the changed funding environment we now have and I support these changes.

"My door is always open to discuss new ideas," he said.
