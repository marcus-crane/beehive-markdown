Health Minister Bill English confirmed today that an inquiry was underway into the case of Jason Mackrell, who was found guilty yesterday of the rape and murder of an elderly Christchurch woman.

"This inquiry will assess the treatment of Mr Mackrell by mental health services in Christchurch.

"It started some months ago, but was put on hold until the court case was completed. The inquiry will now be finished.

"This case is a tragedy for Mr Mackrell's family and for the victim's family. The family have advised me they have concerns about decisions made in the course of Mr Mackrell's treatment.

"The inquiry will establish whether there were any inadequacies in the way Mr Mackrell was looked after and advise me on what we can do to protect the public in the future," said Mr English.

The inquiry was initiated by the Director of Mental Health Services at the Ministry of Health, Dr Janice Wilson. It is being carried out by the District Inspector of Mental Health for Canterbury, Mr Rob Perry, with the assistance of an independent advisor, Dr David Chaplow.
