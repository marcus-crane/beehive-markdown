Labour MP Trevor Mallard's 'Guaranteed Access to Neighbourhood Schools ill' was trying to turn back the clock by bringing back school zoning, ducation Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

"This Bill is completely unnecessary. There is no problem to address. Unless schools are full, there is no need to put in any restrictions on what pupils they can take, as invariably the schools take all the pupils that apply.

"The Bill is poorly drafted and if passed would have lead to considerable confusion. For example the words "living permanently" would lead to administration difficulties."

Mr Creech said the Bill had heavy workload implications.

"No matter how much spare space a school had it would have to go through the full task of preparing an enrolment scheme. The Ministry of Education would have to approve the scheme even when it was not needed.

"The bill would return New Zealand to zoning and limit the right of parents to choose the school they feel provides the best courses and teaching for their children. Turning backwards to school zoning will create more problems than it solves.

"It forces students into schools that might not be right for them and that they don't want to go to. Zones stop students choosing the school that they and their parents. "

Mr Creech said zones were a real estate agent's dream.

"Desirable schools pump up the value of real estate in their zones. Where the zone is 'bad', better off people can buy their way out of it - leaving behind those who can't afford to."

Mr Creech said the Government stands by the current policy of choice because well performing schools will attract more students. It also encourages each and every school to provide the best quality education possible. "Where there are problems, however, are when schools are full and we have had legislation planned for some time to resolve this issue. Next month we will introduce legislation that gives students a right of access to their neighbourhood school if it is full.

"Labour has known for some time that the Government's bill has been is coming up."

The proposed Government legislation does not bring back zoning. Under current law, when a school is full it puts in place an enrolment scheme setting the rules by which that school selects the students it takes.

Currently the schools alone can determine that policy. In future the proposed enrolment scheme will have to be approved by the Education Ministry. One of the factors it will have to take into account is preference for students from the local school. It will also ensure enrolments schemes are co-ordinated in each area.

"The Government's proposed law change is not a return to the school zoning of the past. Where schools are not full anyone can apply and go to them. Parents will be able to continue to send their students to the school of their choice," Mr Creech said.
