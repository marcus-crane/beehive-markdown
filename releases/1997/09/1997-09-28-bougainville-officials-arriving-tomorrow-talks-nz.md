The first group of Bougainville delegates attending Burnham II, the second round of talks on the future of Bougainville, is expected to arrive in Christchurch at 3am tomorrow morning," Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Don McKinnon said tonight.

Around 100 officials from the Papua New Guinea Government, The Bougainville Revolutionary Army, the Bougainville Interim Government and the Bougainville Transitional Government are arriving in Christchurch over the next 48 hours. The talks are scheduled to begin officially at Burnham Military Camp on Wednesday 1 October.

"The first round of Burnham talks held in July brought together leaders of Bougainville groups only." Mr McKinnon said.

"The resulting Burnham Declaration said they wanted to work with the Papua New Guinea Government to find a political solution to their grievances."

Burnham 2 is bringing together officials from both Bougainville and Papua New Guinea.

"These talks are not at the political level, but represent another important step forward in the long process towards peace."

Mr McKinnon said this time the Australian Government was organising and funding the delegate's travel. Delegates from the BTG, BRA and BIG arriving in the morning are travelling from Honiara, in the Soloman Islands, on aircraft of the Royal Australian Airforce.

PNG officials are arriving on commercial flights over the next couple of days.

"Getting people to and from Burnham II is a big undertaking and we thank the Australians for their help in this area."
