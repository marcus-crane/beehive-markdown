Dr Sook-ll Kwun, Minister for Science and Technology in the Republic of Korea is visiting Wellington to sign a Science and Technology Cooperation (STC) arrangement between New Zealand and the Republic of Korea.

"The STC arrangement is a significant step in the development of scientific co-operation between our two countries and paves the way for future research and development collaboration in science and technology," said Mr Williamson

"The New Zealand science reforms, in operation since 1992, have been of great interest to Korea and the delegation will receive an overview of our science and technology system at first hand.

"New Zealand enjoys a dynamic relationship with Korea, with strong linkages forged in the areas of trade and tourism.

"Minister Kwun's visit provides an opportunity to demonstrate New Zealand's continued commitment to an important bilateral relationship," said Mr Williamson.
