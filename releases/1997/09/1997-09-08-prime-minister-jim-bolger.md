The Prime Minister said today that Mr Neil Kirton, MP, former Associate Minister of Health and Minister of Customs, has released to the media copies of papers he received as a Minister, including those related to the health portfolio.

At the time Mr Kirton was dismissed from the Cabinet, the Secretary of the Cabinet wrote to him reminding him of the provisions of the Cabinet Office Manual about the handling of official papers when a Minister leaves office.

The Manual requires that any release of documents should first be referred to the Prime Minister. Without consultation Mr Kirton has released papers and is therefore clearly in breach of the Manual.

"The convention that former Ministers should not release Government information without referring to the Prime Minister is a long-standing one. It has been widely understood, respected and honoured by Ministers of many former Governments.

"As a Minister, Mr Kirton agreed to abide by the provisions of the Cabinet Office Manual, and that obligation is ongoing. The documents that Mr Kirton received as a Minister are held on trust. Mr Kirton has breached that trust. Mr Kirton accepted certain responsibilities when he was sworn in as a Minister and I am disappointed that he has failed to honour those obligations."
