Details of new Chinese tariff cuts show New Zealand exports to China will receive an earlier-than-expected boost, International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith announced today.

Last month, Dr Smith negotiated an extensive range of tariff cuts for New Zealand exports to China during talks related to Beijing's bid to join the World Trade Organisation. Many of the cuts were to be brought in over six years.

Then, during the recent 15th National Party Congress in Beijing, China announced a broad range of cuts that will reduce its average tariff from 23% to 17% from this Wednesday.

Now, newly-released details show particular benefits for New Zealand exports to China. The goods affected by the new announcement include a range of items, such as meat, fats, fish, forest products, hides and skins, kiwifruit, milk powder and casein -- all items which New Zealand exports to China.

"So, in some cases, tariffs will drop even quicker than was anticipated after the WTO talks. That means New Zealand exporters will have an early opportunity to increase their business with the world's most populous country," Dr Smith said.

"Still the tariffs effective from Wednesday will not be as low as the final tariff levels New Zealand negotiated last month, meaning further reductions will come in later."
