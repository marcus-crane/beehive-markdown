New Zealand has sent a strong message to the United Nations that it must either be reformed or become a dinosaur," Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Don McKinnon said today.

He was referring to a speech delivered on his behalf by New Zealand's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Michael Powles, to the Fifty Second Session of the UN General Assembly yesterday.

"The UN is facing a crisis," Mr McKinnon said. "We believe member states must endorse the reforms proposed by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan back in July."

The package contains proposals to modernise the UN's management and budgetary structures, reduce duplication of tasks and groups, and channel money from administration to economic and social projects.

"These ideas will allow the UN to do more with less money," Mr McKinnon said. "We believe the package must be adopted as a whole and I urge members to support it even if they find fault with individual elements."

Mr McKinnon also called on member states to do their bit to strengthen the UN. New Zealand payed its full annual contributions in January every year, but not all other states took the same view, he said.

"We cannot accept that any member state is entitled to withhold payments unilaterally," he said.

Mr McKinnon's speech went on to advocate reform of the system under which New Zealand is classified as belonging to the "Western European and Others" UN grouping.

"It would be much better if our grouping reflected the fundamental importance we place on our membership of the South Pacific Forum and of regional organisations such as APEC and the ASEAN Regional Forum," he said.
