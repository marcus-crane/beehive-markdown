"New Zealand and Canada have submitted a joint 'friends of the court' brief (amicus curiae) to the Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal" announced Foreign Minister Don McKinnon.

The brief emphasises that the Tribunal has the power to order any state to produce documents relevant to its proceedings.

"Bringing war criminals to justice is of great importance if peace, stability and reconciliation are to survive in the Former Republic of Yugoslavia.

"New Zealand has and will continue to support the Tribunal in its efforts to obtain evidence from the Governments of Croatia and Bosnia Herzegovina" Mr McKinnon said.

The Tribunal was established by the United Nations Security Council to prosecute serious war crimes committed in the Former Republic of Yugoslavia.

Croatia has been challenging the legality of "orders for the production of documents" issued by the Tribunal earlier this year. This has the potential to diminish the Tribunal's future ability to successfully prosecute suspected war criminals.

"New Zealand is totally committed to the work of the Tribunal and to the effective prosecution of war criminals. For this reason we have always strongly supported the establishment of a permanent International Criminal Court.

"I am confident that this joint New Zealand-Canadian brief will help the Tribunal in its work" Mr McKinnon said.

"Friends of the court" briefs have also been submitted by The Netherlands and Norway.
