Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said today he was thrilled that more than 100 countries had last night approved a Treaty banning anti-personnel landmines.

Representatives from these countries, including New Zealand, have been negotiating the treaty over the last three weeks in the Norwegian Capital Oslo.

"I am delighted that the outcome of the meeting in Oslo has been so successful," Mr McKinnon said. "It will now go forward to a signing ceremony in Ottawa in December".

"New Zealand is a member of the core group of countries driving these negotiations and we are very pleased to be able to play a constructive role in achieving this result. I also would like to pay tribute to my colleague Canadian Foreign Minister Axworthy who initiated what has become known as the Ottawa process."

Mr McKinnon also paid tribute to the efforts of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines and to the late Diana, Princess of Wales, for the role she played in bringing the victims of landmines to the attention of the media and the public.

"Landmines are the most indiscriminate weapons available. The Ottawa process is a great step towards ridding the world of these truly appalling weapons."

"We will be encouraging as many countries as possible to sign the Treaty".
