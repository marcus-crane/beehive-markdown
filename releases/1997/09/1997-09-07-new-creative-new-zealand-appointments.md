Cultural Affairs Minister, Hon Chris Fletcher, today announced a number of new appointments to the Council of Creative New Zealand and its member boards, Te Waka Toi and the Arts Board.

The Council of Creative New Zealand has three new members - Dr Marilyn Waring, Andrew Caisley and Dr Michael Volkerling. New appointments for the Arts Board are Gray Bartlett, John Daly-Peoples and Dr Takiora Ingram as Pacific Islands representative. Te Waka Toi's new appointments are Elizabeth Ellis as Chair and new member Gwen Neave.

"Elizabeth Ellis has already served with distinction as a member of Te Waka Toi for the past three years and has been a member of the Council of Creative New Zealand. Her background and experience in Maori arts will be valuable in building on the work already undertaken by Te Waka Toi and in setting its future direction", Chris Fletcher said.

Chris Fletcher paid special tribute to the work of Ngapo Wehi for his three years as Chair of Te Waka Toi. "Ngapo's dedication and hard work in establishing Te Waka Toi in its first years has been immense and I am delighted he has agreed to work with me in developing programmes for young Maori youth", she said.

"I would like to thank the retiring members Lewis Moeau, Sandi Morrison, Sefita Haouli and Ray Sleeman for the work and effort they have all put into Creative New Zealand and New Zealand arts and culture. Their contribution to the achievements of Creative New Zealand during its establishment phase is greatly appreciated and I wish them well", Chris Fletcher said.

Creative New Zealand consists of an Arts Council and two boards, the Arts Board and Te Waka Toi. The Council and boards are each composed of seven members.

The Arts Council sets policy and strategic direction, and has a major role to play in promoting and advocating for the arts. The Arts Board and Te Waka Toi develop art-form policy, allocate grants and carry out initiatives that support the Council's strategic direction. Te Waka Toi specifically supports and promotes Maori arts. Members of the Council and Boards are appointed by the Minister of Cultural Affairs for a term of up to three years.

Creative New Zealand receives funding directly from the Government through Vote: Cultural Affairs and from the New Zealand lottery Grants Board. The Council of Creative New Zealand is accountable to the Minister of Cultural Affairs and produces an annual report that is tabled before Parliament.
