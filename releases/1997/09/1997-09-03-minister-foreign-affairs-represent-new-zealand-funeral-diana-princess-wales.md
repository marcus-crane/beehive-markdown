Foreign Minister Don McKinnon will represent New Zealand at the funeral service for Diana, Princess of Wales in London on Saturday, Prime Minister Jim Bolger announced this afternoon.

Mr Bolger asked Mr McKinnon to represent the people and Government of New Zealand following advice from London that representation should be at a senior ministerial or high commissioner level.

Mr McKinnon had been due to leave for Britain on Monday to attend Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group and bi-lateral meetings in Europe, but will now leave earlier to attend the funeral.

"Although the funeral will not be a formal State occasion, such senior representation shows the high regard New Zealanders hold for the life and work of the Princess of Wales.

"I am sure the funeral will be a moving reflection of the character and the interests of the late Princess of Wales. New Zealanders respects for her will be paid, both here at the planned Commemorative Services, and in London by Mr McKinnon," the Prime Minister said.
