Regulations which make it lawful  
to possess and spread material containing rabbit calicivirus disease (RCD) are  
now in effect, the Minister for  
Biosecurity, Hon Simon Upton announced  
today.

The effect of the Biosecurity (Rabbit Calicivirus) Regulations  
1997, which took effect yesterday, is to deem that from 24 September 1997 RCD

is established in New Zealand and the offence of possessing material  
containing the virus no longer applies.

The Regulations will not provide  
a retrospective immunity to those who have acted in breach of section 21 of the  
Animals Act. The Ministry of  
Agriculture still intends to prosecute those  
responsible for introducing the virus into New Zealand and those involved in the  
initial spreading of it.  
Investigations in this area are continuing.

The Minister said the Government had also introduced legislation into  
the House today so as to give Parliament the opportunity to consider the

matter fully and to avoid any question about the vires of the regulations  
that have been passed.

The policy background to the regulations and  
proposed legislation is as follows:

From the information which became  
available within a few days of the first confirmation of RCD, it was clear that  
containment and  
eradication was not technically feasible.

The  
Government decided that the public interest was best served by facilitating the  
exchange of information about the behaviour of the  
disease but this could  
not happen while the threat of prosecution existed.

It is the  
Government's expectation that everybody who has an interest in controlling  
rabbits will now see the benefits in sharing information  
and that this will  
lead to the development of rabbit control strategies which integrate RCD as a  
tool, perhaps the principal tool, with other  
control measures. MAF has been  
charged with facilitating the communication between the interested parties but  
Government and its  
agencies are not going to assume a management  
responsibility for rabbit control. Regional pest management strategies are the  
obvious  
vehicle for an integrated approach.

Mr Upton said MAF's  
Chief Veterinary Officer would now consider whether the status of the RCD virus  
as an "unwanted" organism should be  
retained. "Given that the Biosecurity  
Amendment Bill Number 4, which is due to become law, would introduce an offence  
of spreading an  
unwanted organism, it seems inconsistent for RCD to retain  
its unwanted organism status in light of the Government's decision that it  
should be  
made legal," the Minister said.
