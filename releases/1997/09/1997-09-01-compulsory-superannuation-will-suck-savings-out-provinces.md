"The proposed compulsory retirement savings scheme will suck money out of provincial New Zealand's cities and towns," State Services Minister Jenny Shipley said tonight.

Speaking at a public meeting in Dunedin, Mrs Shipley said the proposed compulsory RSS will damage provincial economies.

" Farmers and the business people in provincial centres have traditionally used their farms or their businesses as their bank. Forcing them to instead lock away 8 per cent of their income in a compulsory retirement savings scheme would have a dramatic impact on their ability to invest in development. The investment decisions would instead be made by urban-based funds managers, who are likely to invest in the main cities or overseas. In effect it will shift savings, rather than increase savings overall.

" The proposed compulsory RSS also removes people's right to make their own decisions about investing for the future. Many farmers plant a forestry block, or buy a second house in town to rent out. Neither of these investment options will be acceptable under the RSS, because that requires diversified savings, not a single type of investment.

"It is wrong for the Government to dictate how people are to save, without regard to the impact on individuals or regions.

"Many of my concerns about the impact of the scheme on rural people also apply to all New Zealanders. The scheme hurts women and people on low incomes because it is regressive, it is inexcusably costly to administer, and it offers no more certainty than current arrangements.

"I will continue to argue for a NO vote. But regardless of whether New Zealanders support or oppose the proposed compulsory RSS, they must make sure they vote. It is essential to send a clear message that leaves current and future governments in no doubt about what New Zealanders think," Mrs Shipley concluded.
