Health Minister Bill English said today changes to rural and smaller hospitals were ultimately changes for the better.

"We need new facilities that are better suited to the sorts of health services New Zealanders now need. We don't need post-war buildings that are now soaking up health dollars because they are too big and too expensive to run.

"We have got to get our health sector positioned to meet the needs of the 21st century.

"There has been a lot of talk about closures. The fact is that new health facilities are regularly opening. These are new facilities, either purpose-built or modifying older buildings, which provide a range and style of health services much more suited to a modern health system than what we've had in the past.

"There is no hidden agenda in this. What we are increasingly seeing in health is a meshing of services between community based providers and the hospital sector and between the different types of people who provide health services. That inevitably means a mix of public and private provision and a change in the style of services offered.

"The list of so-called closures put out by the Alliance health spokeswoman Phillida Bunkle makes interesting reading. She claims eight hospitals are to close and two more might close. The reality of these 'closures' is quite different as the following list shows," said Mr English.

Opotiki. Options for the best way of providing services for the people of Opotiki are still being considered.

Napier. The Government is spending $50m building a regional hospital for the Hawkes Bay which will replace both the Hastings and Napier hospitals. This is the biggest hospital development in New Zealand since the Starship Children's Hospital was opened in the early 1990s.

Greytown. Greytown Hospital will be closed because the amount of money being spent running an old building could not be justified. It had 10 beds, nine of which were for long-term and disability care, 44 staff, did not provide any A & E service and was losing $80,000 each month. Instead, Central health will fund new locally-based services.

Templeton. By March 1999 all the residents who are able, will be living in the community. New residential services will be in place for those residents who need specialist support services. This plan has been agreed following many years of consultation between all those involved, including patients and their families.

Gore. Southern Health will not continue to run services at Seddon Memorial Hospital, in Gore. Southern Regional Health is discussing plans with the community for a District Health Facility, which could include GP services, GP beds, basic trauma services, maternity services, aged care, and visiting specialists for outpatient clinics.

Nga Whatu. This hospital has been providing support services for people with intellectual disabilities. Planning has been underway for some time so that those who are able can live in the community and alternative residential services are provided for those who still need residential care. No date has been set for the changes.

Dannevirke. The old Dannevirke Hospital had 36 beds, most of which were for the elderly, 50 staff, and was losing $83,000 a month. A new hospital just opened has nine beds for GP and maternity services, provides physiotherapy, laboratory and radiology services, is next door to the GP clinic, and provides space for specialist outpatient services.

Waimate. Waimate Hospital, which provided long-stay care for the elderly, was closed in September 1996, and alternative services purchased locally.  
"This list shows that, rather than a list of closures, it is a list of changes and new developments. In all cases public money continues to be spent in these areas providing health services for locals.

"But it is Ms Bunkle's idea of which hospitals might close that is most wildly inaccurate. She cites Kenepuru Hospital as being destined for closure, where in reality a $3 million upgrade is now underway at that hospital. Surgical capacity is being doubled and the maternity, dental and rehabilitation services and being refurbished.

"The downsizing and possible closure of Burwood Hospital will also come as a real surprise to those involved. What is actually happening is that options are being looked at which would see more services being transferred there from Christchurch to relieve pressure on Christchurch Hospital.

"What we have to accept in health is that we cannot hang on to the past. As long as we do that we will continue to spend valuable health dollars on plumbing instead of people," said Mr English.
