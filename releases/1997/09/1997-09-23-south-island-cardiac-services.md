Health Minister Bill English today issued a directive to Southern Regional Health to negotiate directly with the parties involved in setting up the two-site cardiac service for the South Island.

"I am issuing a directive for all the parties involved to negotiate. This has the effect of cancelling the previous tender round," Mr English said.

"It is now completely up to the parties involved. The Government has cleared every obstacle it can to get a service in place for the people of the South Island as soon as possible," he said.

"Today's directive to the Southern Regional Health legally requires it to negotiate with the Canterbury Health and HealthCare Otago. The two Crown health enterprises and the surgeons have set up a joint venture to deliver cardiac services in the Dunedin and Christchurch hospitals.

"The new service must meet the clinical specifications for a safe quality cardiac service. It must also be contracted within the benchmark price set by the established through the Southern Regional Health," he said.

"I have repeatedly relayed to the joint venture parties my concern to get the first patients through the Christchurch hospital doors. We have all waited too long for this service to be delivered in both major South Island cities," Mr English said.
