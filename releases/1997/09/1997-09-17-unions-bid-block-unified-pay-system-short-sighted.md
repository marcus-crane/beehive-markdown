Education Minister Wyatt Creech has today warned teachers and parents about the latest attempt by the leadership of the secondary teachers' union to try to block the development of a unified pay system for teachers.

"In the education sector we have a high duty of care to work constructively together towards resolving issues. The last thing I want to see is any action that will lead to disruption of classes - it only damages the education of our young people.

"The longstanding grievance felt by primary teachers that they are rewarded at a lower rate just because they teach in the primary sector is one of the issues that needs resolving," Mr Creech said.

The Government is seeking a unified pay system which pays teachers on the basis of skills, qualifications, responsibilities and performance, no matter what part of the compulsory sector they work in.

"It has always been clearly understood by all parties involved that we needed an approach that would permanently remove the pay differential between the primary and secondary teachers.

"However the secondary teachers' union has announced that it will 'actively oppose any entrenchment of primary rates onto secondary'. This is doublespeak for active opposition to making the solution durable. Primary teachers should be awake to this deception. "

Mr Creech said the PPTA's stance seems to be purely driven by an industrial motivation.

"The PPTA executive has now gone public stating that it has a "problem with the mechanism for entrenching parity" because it would mean "primary teachers would be unable to support secondary teachers in any sort of industrial action".

"The latest PPTA statement calls into question the union's commitment to developing a pay system that rewards teachers fairly and properly.

"Teachers at the classroom level and parents should be aware and concerned that the PPTA has consistently refused to play a constructive role in developing a unified pay system. The union's approach puts narrow self interest above better education results for our young people.

"I see considerable differences between the position of the PPTA leadership and secondary teachers in classrooms. I visit many colleges and make a point of raising the issue. Many many secondary teachers have told me they support the claim of their primary sector colleagues."

Mr Creech said he had written to the PPTA pointing out these concerns and the Government's desire to work constructively with those affected in developing the pay system.

"The PPTA's track record to date has not been good. It agreed to participate in the Working Party process and to the Terms of Reference governing the group's work, but delayed entering the talks until pressured to in last year's pay round. It then pulled out of the working party before the process was complete.

"Almost every group in the education sector supports the unified pay system approach. I urge the PPTA to take stock of this and show some commitment to developing a pay system that meets the needs of the education system now and in the future," Mr Creech said.
