"New Zealand must stop any further decline in its defence capability and start building back capability," Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Don McKinnon said today.

In a speech to the UK Royal College of Defence Studies, Mr McKinnon said New Zealand's poorly equipped defence force was lacking in terms of size and performance and diminished our credibility internationally.

"New Zealand is in danger of being labelled a free loader. While our security within the region and globally is increasingly safeguarded as a result of growing economic independence, we can't lose sight of the traditional sources of security - such as a well equipped, professional and effective defence force.

"Our ability to play a respected and influential role in multilateral forums such as APEC or the ASEAN Regional Forum is significantly mediated by our broader security profile. We cannot be taken seriously unless we are respected for a sharper end security contribution."

Mr McKinnon said that New Zealand had reduced ability to make a sound contribution to Closer Defence Relations with Australia and the current Defence Assessment was bring carried out because of this.

"I am optimistic the Defence Assessment and subsequent Government decisions on force structure requirements and funding will ensure New Zealand can continue to make partnerships work be they our alliance with Australia, the Five Power Defence Arrangement, under the United Nations Charter, in the Asean Regional Forum context or more broadly.

"This will require us to stop any further decline in our capability and start building back towards levels prescribed in 1991. The partnerships that form the basis of our defence require this commitment."
