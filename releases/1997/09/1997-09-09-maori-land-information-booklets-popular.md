The Minister for Courts, Hon D.A.M. Graham, has welcomed the re-print within a month of publication of two Maori Land Court information booklets - A Guide to Succession and A Guide to Maori Land Trusts.

The booklets are part of an overall campaign to help Maori manage their land more effectively.

'I'm delighted this information is reaching its audience and that the community is demanding more,' Mr Graham said.

Fifteen thousand Succession booklets and 30,000 Trust booklets were published in early August. A further 10,000 Succession and 5,000 Trust booklets are being printed due to requests from Maori Land Court offices and the Wakatu Incorporation in Nelson.

Chief Registrar of the Maori Land Court, John Grant, said he was delighted at the publications' success.

'The Court's sole focus is Maori land ownership and management and we need to make sure Maori are aware of what we do and how we can help,' he said.

'There are seven Maori Land Court offices throughout New Zealand and we're opening an information outlet in Auckland before the end of the year.

'We're also looking to update the way we operate, including greater use of information technology and a stronger focus on our customers' needs.

'The land information strategy is an important part of that,' he said.

The booklets are available from all Maori Land Court offices and the Department for Courts National Office in Wellington.
