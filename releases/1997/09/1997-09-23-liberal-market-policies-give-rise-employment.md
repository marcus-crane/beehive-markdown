Reform in Telecommunications Services has directly resulted in increased jobs for New Zealanders, Minister of Communications Maurice Williamson told guests at the Telecommunications Exporters of New Zealand (TENZ) dinner tonight in Wellington

The TENZ dinner comes at the start of the 16th APEC Telecommunications Working Group Meeting being in held in  
Wellington this week.

"New Zealand has been at the forefront of liberalising telecommunications services, encouraging competition and facilitating a consumer orientated approach," said the Minister.

"Manufacturers have found the more liberal environment has offered opportunities to focus on specialised equipment for export rather than import substitution for the small New Zealand market.

"A high priority for this Government has been to generate jobs and in the Electronics Manufacturing Sector this has meant the 1988 workforce of 3,000 growing to over 5,000 in 1997.

"Correspondingly the percentage of export sales has grown from 8% in 1980 to 60% in 1997 which in dollar terms translates to over $600 million.
