Health Minister Bill English said today the Ministry of Health advice on RCD indicated a very low risk to people.

"Ministry of Health information shows that to date, internationally people who have been working closely with rabbits in infected areas show no signs of contracting the virus," Mr English said.

"There has been no documented clinical illness in humans associated with outbreaks of the virus in rabbits. This is despite RCD being present in rabbits in 40 countries.

"That doesn't mean people dealing with infected rabbits should not take every precaution just as they should when handling any sick or dying animal," he said.

"It needs to be remembered that there are New Zealanders travelling every day in countries which have the virus and we do not give them with any health warnings. We also have visitors from those countries coming to New Zealand and do not conduct any human health precautions," Mr English said.
