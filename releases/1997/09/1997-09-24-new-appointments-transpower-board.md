The Minister for State Owned Enterprises, Jenny Shipley, today announced the following appointments and re-appointments to the board of the State Owned Enterprise Transpower New Zealand Ltd.

Transpower owns and operates the national grid for transmission of electricity from generators to distributors and direct supply customers.

Current director Sir Colin Maiden has been appointed to the chair and four new directors have been appointed. Sir Colin replaces Doug Ritchie who is stepping down after 11 years on the board of first ECNZ and then Transpower.

Jenny Shipley thanked Doug Ritchie and the outgoing directors for their service.

"Doug Ritchie and his team have been good custodians of the shareholders' interest in Transpower, and the company has performed well under their guidance. I want to take this opportunity to thank those who have reached the end of their term for their contribution, especially Mr Ritchie. The government has valued his many years of service on the board of first ECNZ and then Transpower.

"I have been particularly concerned at recent media comment about departing directors. I want to make it clear that no board members have been axed, dumped or sacked.

"The Government has recently begun considering changes in the structures and regulatory environment for electricity generating and distribution companies. Transpower is in the process of re-focussing its business strategy. It is an appropriate time to bring some new directors on board who are well-positioned to lead that process," the Minister said.

Jenny Shipley says the new directors have been selected to meet a new set of skills required for the changed circumstances of the energy sector. They are Rotorua lawyer Richard Charters, Christchurch business consultant Jane Huria, Auckland company director Alison Paterson and Christchurch company director Dr Brent Layton. Director David Sadler has been reappointed to the board.
