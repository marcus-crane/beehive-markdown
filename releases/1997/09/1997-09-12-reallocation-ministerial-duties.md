Prime Minister Jim Bolger, in consultation with Deputy-Prime Minister Winston Peters, has today announced the following reallocation of Ministerial responsibilities:

Minister of Women's Affairs: Hon Jenny Shipley  
Minister of State Services: Hon Paul East  
Minister of Cultural Affairs: Hon Simon Upton  
Minister of Local Government: Hon Maurice Williamson  
Minister of Customs: Hon Tuariki John Delamere  
Associate Minister of Health: Hon Tuariki John Delamere  
Associate Minister of Women's Affairs: Hon Deborah Morris  
The Prime Minister said the reallocation of portfolios follows the resignations of Neil Kirton and Christine Fletcher from the Executive.

Mr Bolger and Mr Peters decided to reallocate portfolios to existing Ministers rather than to appoint any new Ministers at this time.

Mr Bolger said he was confident that the reordered Ministerial team would continue to provide sound leadership in their respective portfolios.
