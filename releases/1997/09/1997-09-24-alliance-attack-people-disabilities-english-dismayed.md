Health Minister Bill English said today he was dismayed that the Alliance had described changes for the residents with disabilities at Templeton Hospital as the most disastrous period in the history of the public health system.

"The Alliance's health spokeswoman, Phillida Bunkle, is clearly willing to use people with disabilities as a means of political point-scoring.

"She cites the closure of Templeton Hospital in Christchurch as a cut in services. The reality is quite different.

"There have been many years of consultation about the appropriate care for the 430 people who now live at Templeton, consultation that has involved both them and their families.

"Agreement was recently reached about the best way to resettle residents in the community where they are able to live there. New residential services will be up and running for those residents who need specialist support services. All the parties concerned were involved in this agreement.

"I have been advised of one resident who recently left Templeton and now has a full-time job. This proves the potential of positive change in these people's lives.

"I am asking the Alliance to withdraw its objection to this change. The clear intention of everyone concerned is to provide a better life for the people there and I am dismayed that the Alliance has attacked the closure as a major step backwards for the public health system.
