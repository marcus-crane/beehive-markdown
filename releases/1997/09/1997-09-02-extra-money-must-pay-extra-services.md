Health Minister Bill English made it clear today the Government expected extra services not inflated pay packets from extra health funding.

"A one percent pay rise across the Crown health enterprises would cost $19 million. That money could pay for 6500 people to come off waiting lists and get the treatment they need," Mr English said.

"Of course you must fairly remunerate staff when they perform highly complex work that requires years of training. However, CHEs must ensure personnel costs do not rise out of step with the market and inflation just because there is extra money in the system.

"In the last year CHEs increased spending by 4.2 percent ($121 million), taking their total spending to $3.033 billion or $58 million per week. Almost half the increased CHE funding was absorbed by personnel cost increases," he said.

"The CHEs employ nearly 4000 clinicians (hospital doctors, specialists, physiotherapists, psychiatrists, and others) who earn an average of $106,000 per annum. CHEs employ more than 17,000 nurses, earning an average of $44,000 per annum and 9000 clinical support staff (includes enrolled nurses) earning an average of $38,000.

"In the last financial year non-clinical support staff including management and administration staff received considerably lower pay increases than clinical staff, 0.3 percent compared to more than four percent," Mr English said.
