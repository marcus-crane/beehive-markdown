Education Minister Wyatt Creech said he was encouraged by the response from education sector groups this week to the Government's desire to fully implement a unified pay system for primary and secondary teachers.

"I have used this week to talk to education groups about my deep concern at the secondary teachers' union plans to actively oppose an enduring unified pay system."

Mr Creech cancelled travel to an APEC ministerial Human Resource Development meeting in Korea to meet the education groups.

"The feedback I have received indicates that the PPTA is basically on its own over this issue," Mr Creech said. "The meetings have been useful. I have urged the PPTA leadership to reflect on this and to advise its members of the widespread concern about the position.

"The unified pay system is about ensuring that all teachers get paid on the basis of skills, qualifications, responsibilities and performance, no matter what part of the compulsory sector they work in. It is not about reducing the pay of secondary teachers."

Mr Creech said he wanted all students to be taught by quality teachers who are happy in their work. The unified pay system is part and parcel of reaching that goal.

"I have had a good opportunity for free and frank discussions with education sector groups this week to let them know about the Government's concerns over the PPTA position."

Mr Creech has made it clear to all those involved that the PPTA's claims about bulk funding and its theory about secret deals are completely wrong.

"I told the PPTA that there is no link between bulk funding and the unified pay system. There are no "underground' or "backhand" deals whatsoever. The two issues are completely separate. The focus is on the issues that arise in the context of the employment contract."
