New Zealanders can expect increased choice and innovation in their postal services because of deregulation, announced Hon Maurice Williamson Minister of Communications at today's opening of the new Mail Boxes Etc Centre in Takapuna

"The Postal Services Bill will break the New Zealand Post monopoly on the delivery of letters weighing less than 200 grammes where a delivery charge of less than 80 cents is made," said the Minister.

"Deregulation will increase the choice and mix of services available but not as some claim at the expense of our rural delivery service.

"Rural residents will continue to receive the same frequency of delivery as now and this will be guaranteed by a new Deed of Understanding that the Government will establish with New Zealand Post Ltd.

"Once competition in domestic letter services is established, I hope to see consumers benefiting from the sort of price reductions that we have already seen from international mail.

"Mail Boxes Etc is creating a strong position in the market to meet business needs and as the postal environment changes further, the company will be well placed to respond to new market opportunities and customer demand," Mr Williamson said.
