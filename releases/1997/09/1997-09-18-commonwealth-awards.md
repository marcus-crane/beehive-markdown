Health Minister Bill English today presented four women's organisations with Commonwealth Awards of Excellence in Women's Health.

"In New Zealand we don't give enough recognition to excellence in our health systems," Mr English said.

"Each of these groups has made a significant contribution to women's health in this country.

"This international award acknowledges the hard work their staff and volunteers have put into promoting health through a range of projects from cervical screening to refuge work," he said.

"The Palmerston North Women's Health Collective and the Wellington Women's Refuge are groups who face real local needs every day. They are providing health services to women who are not getting the services they want from the more mainstream health services which consume most of the health budget.

"The Federation of Women's Health Councils Aotearoa, New Zealand and the National Cervical Screening Programme are working on a wider front but with the same committed energy," Mr English said.
