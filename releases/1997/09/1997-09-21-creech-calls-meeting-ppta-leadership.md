Education Minister Wyatt Creech has decided to call off plans to travel to Korea this week to attend the APEC Human Resource Development Ministerial Meeting, and will instead use the opportunity to work to prevent any unnecessary action by the secondary teachers' union (PPTA) over the development of a fair unified pay system for teachers.

"This is an extremely important matter for the education sector. I am concerned about the increasingly provocative statements by the PPTA leadership over the development of a unified pay system.

"The union leadership claims it is at loggerheads with the Government. It is threatening industrial action over the development of a unified pay system. It has predicted that 1998 will be the worst year under Tomorrow's Schools for industrial action by the union.

"Talk of industrial action come-what-may before negotiations have even started is provocative and premature. Responsibility demands that we work through the issues in a constructive manner," Mr Creech said.

"I can not let the position go unchallenged," Mr Creech said. "The PPTA leadership must be convinced that there is absolutely nothing sinister about a pay system that is fair and rewards, recruits and retains quality teachers who perform in our classrooms."

The Government and other education sector groups have been trying to constructively develop a unified pay system that helps schools employ quality teachers to teach young people.

"It has always been clearly understood by all parties that we needed an approach that would permanently remove the pay differential between primary and secondary teachers. "I have asked the leadership of the PPTA to meet me as soon as possible this week. I will also seek to meet others involved in the Unified Pay System Working Party to fully brief them on developments. I want to do all I can to avoid the potential for disruption and difficulty that the PPTA leadership's position will, unless amended, cause."

Mr Creech said the Government was seeking a durable pay system where the pay of primary and secondary teachers is not based on what sector they teach in.

The PPTA has stated that it can never agree to the permanent removal of the differential.

"I believe that it is important that I meet with representatives from the PPTA this week - before the union holds its annual conference. I will be encouraging the union to lift its opposition to the unified pay system in the overall interests of all involved in the education system."

Associate Education Minister Brian Donnelly will represent the Government at the APEC Human Resource Development Ministerial Meeting on September 25-26.
