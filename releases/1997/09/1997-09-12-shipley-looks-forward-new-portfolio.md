The newly appointed Minister of Women's Affairs, Jenny Shipley, says she is looking forward to again representing the interests of all New Zealand women at the cabinet table and promoting issues of importance.

Mrs Shipley was Minister of Women's Affairs from 1990-96, and the Prime Minister asked her to take on the job again following the resignation of Christine Fletcher.

"I am saddened by Christine Fletcher's decision, but I accept that she has her own reasons for stepping down.

"My male colleagues know they must reflect the concerns of women as well as men in their decision making. In my experience they are willing and able to do that. Their acceptance and promotion of the Films, Videos and Publications Classification Act and the sexual and reproductive health strategy are both illustrations of that willingness.

"I am delighted with the appointment of Deborah Morris as Associate Minister of Women's Affairs. She is already associate Minister for ACC and we have developed a good working relationship in that area. As a young woman, she brings a perspective that will be valuable to the Coalition Government and to the country.

"Deborah Morris is just one example of the many talented women among the newcomers in the Coalition Government's ranks. One of the advantages of MMP is that is has enabled more women to play a part in the democratic process. The National party put many capable women in winnable positions on its list, and I look forward to seeing more progress in that direction in the future," Mrs Shipley concluded.
