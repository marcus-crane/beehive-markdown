"A building New Zealanders can be proud of."

That was the comment today from Minister for Ministerial Services Don McKinnon on Cabinet's in principle decision to move the Beehive and go ahead with original plans to complete Parliament House.

"Implementing the 1911 plan is a bold option," said Mr McKinnon.

"But armed with technical advice that we can move the Beehive, with a unanimous supportive recommendation from the Select Committee, and with support of New Zealanders whose imagination has been sparked by this innovative concept, it now looks ike we can bring the great vision of the original architects to fruition.

"In Europe and in other countries throughout the world, national buildings are recognised as an integral part of a nation's culture, heritage and identity.

"New Zealanders are already very proud of the refurbished Parliament House which means that future generations will really appreciate its full completion.

"The decision also means we are facing the demands of the future by building on the legacy of the past. The eve of the 21st century is an important time to confirm this challenge which will take us through the next century."

Mr McKinnon was commenting from Brussels where he has been meeting European Commission officials. He returns to Wellington on Wednesday.
