Health Minister Bill English said today the Alliance's health spokeswoman Phillida Bunkle was being dishonest when she claimed he had said no populations under 42,000 would keep surgical and medical hospitals.

"Ms Bunkle knows I have never said that. It is dishonest of her to make something up and claim that I said it.

"What I have said is that some of our smaller hospitals will have to look at changing the way they provide services. These changes are driven as much by medical advances as anything else and affect the biggest hospitals as well as the smallest.

"Ms Bunkle is also being dishonest about her health priorities. She is the first to say we should be spending more on prevention and health education, yet she is advocating spending money propping up out-of-date buildings.

"I do not apologise for raising questions about the future of hospitals that are too big and too expensive to maintain. We should be spending our valuable health dollars on people not plumbing.

"This Government is proving its commitment to improving health by investing more money. Over the next three years that will mean an extra $1.5 billion is spent and I want to see that money translated into real services for people. Simply continuing to provide the same services the same way as in the past is not an option," he said
