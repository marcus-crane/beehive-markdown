New Zealand's next ambassador to China will be Peter Adams," Foreign Minister Don McKinnon announced today.

"China is a major power in our region and our relationship with this vast and rapidly changing country is a very important one for New Zealand," the Minister said.

"This year marks the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries. We are looking ahead to strengthening trade with China which is already our eighth largest export market and our most important market for wool. People-to-people links, through business, education and travel are developing and New Zealand works with China through APEC and other regional organisations."

Dr Adams is a career diplomat, and is currently Director of the APEC Division in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. He has had postings to New York and Washington. He was also seconded as the Deputy Director to the South Pacific Bureau for Economic Cooperation (now the Forum Secretariat) in Suva. He has held a variety of positions in Wellington, including Director of the International Security and Arms Control Division, and Director of Economic Division.

Dr Adams who replaces Chris Elder, will take up his appointment early in 1998.
