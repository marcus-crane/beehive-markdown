Health Minister Bill English today launched two publications to promote and protect breast feeding.

"The importance of breast feeding cannot be overstated. Breast milk is the ideal food for infants especially for the first four to six months. These two publications aim to assist women overcome the barriers to achieving this," he said.

"The Ministry of Health publication, Infant Feeding Guidelines for New Zealand Health Workers, and the New Zealand Infant Formula Marketers' Association publication, Code of Practice for the Marketing of Infant Formula, aimed to increase the rate of breast feeding in New Zealand.

The publications were written in response to the World Health Organization's International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes which imposes various requirements and restrictions on the marketing and distribution of breast-milk substitutes. The Code was prepared after consulting widely with the health sector and industry.

"The prevalence of breast feeding in New Zealand increased substantially from 1975 to the late 1980s, but evidence suggests the rates have levelled off during the last decade," Mr English said.

"Data collected by the Royal New Zealand Plunket Society show more than 90 percent of mothers initiate breast feeding but this drops to 57 percent of babies being fully or partially breastfed at six months of age.

"The Ministry of Health aims to increase the rate of babies being fully or partially breastfed at six months of age," he said.

"The publication, Infant Feeding Guidelines for New Zealand Health Workers, focuses on promoting breast feeding, safe infant feeding practices and the New Zealand interpretation of the WHO Code.

"The New Zealand Infant Formula Marketers' Association's response to the Code has been the development of the self-regulatory Code of Practice for the Marketing of Infant Formula.

"Healthcare workers and industry play an important role in whether women maintain breast feeding and the five companies which market infant formula and belong to NZIFMA should be commended for co-operating with government to restrict the advertising of infant formulas," Mr English said.
