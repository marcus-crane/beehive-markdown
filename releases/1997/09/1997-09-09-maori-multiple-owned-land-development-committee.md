The Minister of Maori Affairs, the Hon Tau Henare, today announced the members of a new committee, the Maori Multiple-owned Land Development Committee.

The Coalition Agreement promised to establish such a committee to look at issues relating to Maori land and multiple-ownership.

"This is part of the Government's commitment to provide an effective tenure and development system for Maori land owners," said Mr Henare.

The committee will provide independent advice to the Minister on a number of policy issues such as Maori land fragmentation, the identification of Maori land use options and financing Maori land development.

Its findings will also feed into the upcoming review of Te Ture Whenua Maori Act.

"The Government wishes to be informed in considering its approach to Maori land and this committee has been established to provide contestable advice on issues relating to Maori land," he said.

It is envisaged the committee will be active for four months and would meet on a fortnightly basis.

NAMES OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE ATTACHED WITH A BRIEF RESUME.
