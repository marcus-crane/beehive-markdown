An Auckland-based cut-flower company has increased its export earnings eightfold in just the last four years, and expects to grow further through 1998.

The exporter is New Zealand Bloom and it's won the admiration of International Trade and Agriculture Minister Lockwood Smith who presented it with a Tradenz Export Commendation Award in Auckland tonight. (5.10 pm 8 Doncaster Street, Airport Oaks, Auckland)

Dr Smith said that while "defeatists" might say a flower was just a commodity, that hadn't been New Zealand Bloom's view.

"You've moved up the value chain," he said. "You have people on the ground, in the marketplace, as close as possible to the final consumer, assuring the highest quality for your product."

Also praised by Dr Smith was the company's move towards fixed prices and forward contracts with a single importer in each market.

"You've decided not to take your chances on some spot auction market like other exporters, most notably the wool industry. You're extracting a premium from the market and delivering higher returns to your suppliers," he said.

The company expects to continue growing this financial year so that its earnings will be ten times those of 1993.

Dr Smith will be presenting another Export Commendation Award next week to Hastings-based Kemblefields vineyard.
