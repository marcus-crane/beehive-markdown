The Government today released a consultation green paper setting out the issues and options needing examination if the provision of tertiary education in New Zealand is to keep up with change in the next century.

Education Minister Wyatt Creech said the Tertiary Education Review Green Paper provided an opportunity for informed debate and decision-making on a major issue facing New Zealand in the 21st Century.

"The Tertiary Education Review comes from the need to have a tertiary education system that delivers for New Zealand. The tertiary sector must meet student demand for quality courses that are relevant and valuable. We also want to make sure that our tertiary institutions are operating effectively, efficiently in an accountable manner," Mr Creech said.

The Tertiary Education Review presents ways to:

Improve opportunities for participation in tertiary education.  
Improve participation and achievement of groups currently under-represented.  
Encourage high quality qualifications, programmes and tertiary education providers.  
Encourage value for the student and Government financial contribution.  
"The tertiary sector must be responsive enough to be able to cater for a wide range of students including school leavers, adult students and especially those who have traditionally been underrepresented.

"In thinking about this we have to take the longer view. We have to look out at least twenty years and more. Tertiary education will take on a greater international dimension in the years ahead. Advances in information technology are also breaking down the barriers to study. "The tertiary sector needs to be able to adapt and respond quickly and effectively to change."

The Green Paper presents the Government's thinking about the way to move ahead. It considers ways to share resources more fairly over a wider number of students, and enable the government's funding to follow the student more closely.

It suggests ways to ensure quality of all qualifications, programmes and providers and to improve the information available to students when making decisions about courses.

The paper presents options to get better governance and accountability arrangements for tertiary education institutions.

"I want to make it very clear that this Green Paper does not propose reductions to Government spending on tertiary education," Mr Creech said. "It does not recommend privatisation of publicly owned tertiary institutions nor their commercialisation. It does not include anything about profit goals for tertiary education.

"What it does set out to do is ensure that tertiary students get the education they deserve into the 21st Century. The Government spent about $2 billion on tertiary education in the last financial year. We want students to get the best from that investment.

"The Green Paper has been prepared to focus public discussion on critical issues facing the tertiary sector.

"It is crucial that Government decision-making is based on a well-informed debate. The Government is seeking a wide range of views on the ideas set out in the Green Paper, and is not wedded to particular solutions at this stage.

"Careful consideration will be given to all submissions. Final decisions will be announced in a white paper due once the analysis and consideration of the submissions received on the Green Paper has been completed."

The Coalition Agreement committed the Government to a comprehensive review of tertiary education.

Submissions close in three months, on 15 December 1997.
