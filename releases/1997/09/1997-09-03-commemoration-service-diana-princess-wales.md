More than 1500 seats will be reserved for members of the public at the Commemoration Service in Wellington for Diana, Princess of Wales on Friday at 12.30pm, the Prime Minister's office said today.

The public would be allowed into the Town Hall from 10.30am on Friday on a first-come, first-served basis either through the Civic Square entrance or the Wakefield Street entrance.

There will be no access for the public through the main doors.

The inter-faith service, to be led by the Dean of Wellington, Michael Brown, will be attended by the Prime Minister, the Governor General, MPs, government officials, the diplomatic corps and representatives from some of the local and international organisations The Princess of Wales had supported.

Speakers are also being set up in Civic Square so that people unable to get into the Town Hall will still be able to participate in the service.
