A Taumarunui-based tourism company and a department of the Hamilton City Council are the national winners of the 1997 Business Development Quality Awards, Business Development Minister Max Bradford announced tonight.

Taumarunui-based Mountain Air and the Regulatory Support Group of the Hamilton City Council were the highest ranking applicants out of eight public and private sector organisations who achieved the Business Development Quality Awards standard this year. A total of 49 organisations entered the 1997 awards.

"The Business Development Quality Awards are part of the Government's strategy to foster enterprise and innovation through promoting business excellence, best practice and total quality management among all New Zealand organisations," Mr Bradford said at the awards ceremony in Wellington.

"New Zealand depends on the on-going excellence of its small and medium sized businesses which account for around 99 percent of all New Zealand enterprises. But it is equally important that central and local government are committed to quality and best practice.

"At every level, whether exporting their own products, supplying larger business or offering services, the quality and practices of all New Zealand organisations affects our country's international competitiveness and our ability to grow."

At last count small and medium sized businesses accounted for about 680,000 full time jobs for New Zealanders - an amount which has increased by about 65,000 jobs since 1994. That is more than two thirds of the total 95,000 increase in full time equivalent jobs during that period.

Mr Bradford said the Government was committed to a programme of economic growth in order to create more jobs, raise the living standards of all New Zealanders and pay for education and health and our other social goals. Mr Bradford congratulated Les Wills and his team at the Regulatory Group of the Hamilton City Council, and Robyn and Keith McKenzie of Mountain Air.

"The assessment panel was unanimous in its decision on our 1997 national winners."

As highest ranking public and private sector applicants, representatives of their organisations will have the opportunity to meet the world's leading quality management exponents on a 10-day study visit to the USA.

The eight organisations awarded 1997 Business Development Quality Awards, including the two national winners, are:
