Michael Chilton, the current Deputy High Commissioner to the United Kingdom will take up the role of Executive Director for New Zealand's Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Task Force 1999, The Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Don McKinnon, said today.

Mr Chilton, who takes up his appointment in January 1998, will have responsibility coordinating preparations for New Zealand's year in the APEC chair.

Mr McKinnon said 1999 will be a huge year for New Zealand on the world stage and the role would be a challenging one.

"Throughout the year we will host several APEC conferences culminating in the Leaders' meeting in Auckland in September. At this meeting alone we expect more than 3000 delegates from 20 APEC member economies will attend."

"The APEC Leaders' meeting will be the largest international conference ever held in New Zealand, bigger even than the Commonwealth Heads of Government gathering in 1995."

Mr McKinnon said that in addition to the 3000 delegates, up to 2000 journalists could be expected to attend.

"Throughout 1999, New Zealand will feature in newspapers around the world. This type of coverage will mean a huge publicity boost for New Zealand."

"Preparing for all of these events will be a massive undertaking."

Mr Chilton was previously High Commissioner to Malaysia, and accredited to Brunei. These countries will chair APEC in 1998 and 2000 respectively. Mr Chilton has completed postings in three other APEC countries - the United States, Thailand and Singapore.
