Labour Minister Max Bradford today announced the appointment of Beverley Wakem to the Higher Salaries Commission.

The Higher Salaries Commission determines the salaries paid to Members of Parliament and the Judiciary as well as certain other senior public sector positions.

"Beverley Wakem combines insight and experience of both the public and private sectors which will stand her in good stead as a member of the Higher Salaries Commission. I am confident her appointment will maintain the balance of expertise and perspective required for the effective operation of the Commission," Mr Bradford said.

A graduate of Victoria University, the University of Kentucky and Trinity College, London, Ms Wakem has business and managerial experience in both private and public sectors.

She was director general-chief executive of Radio New Zealand from 1984 to 1991, leaving that role to become commercial director, then general manager human resources and corporate affairs for Wrightson NZ. Since 1996 Ms Wakem has been executive chairman of Hill and Knowlton Ltd, a public relations and marketing firm. She has served as a board member of the Australia New Zealand Foundation, the Enterprise New Zealand Foundation and as a director of Capital Power, Wellington. She is a fellow of the NZ Institute of Management and associate member of the Institute of Directors. She was awarded a CBE in the 1990 Queen's Birthday Honours.

Ms Wakem's appointment fills an existing vacancy on the Commission. Appointments to the Commission are made by the Governor General by Order in Council for terms of up to three years.
