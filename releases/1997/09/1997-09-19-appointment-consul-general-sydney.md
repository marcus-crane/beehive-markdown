Career diplomat Priscilla Williams will be the next New Zealand Consul-General in Sydney, Foreign Minister Don McKinnon announced today.

Ms Williams is currently Director of the United Nations and Commonwealth Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade

"Ms Williams brings a vast amount of diplomatic experience to this important job," Mr McKinnon said.

Priscilla Williams would be working closely with the High Commissioner in Canberra to promote New Zealand's trade and economic interests and government relationships in New South Wales, the Minister said. Her time in Sydney would coincide with the Olympic Games in 2000, and this would be an important focus for her work.

The New Zealand community in Sydney numbers more than 60,000 and New Zealanders visit Sydney more than any other city in the world. The Consulate-General supports New Zealanders there with consular services.

Before taking up her present position, Priscilla Williams was Director of the Environment Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Her other assignments have included postings as High Commissioner in New Delhi and Nuku'alofa. Ms Williams is no stranger to Australia. She worked previously in Canberra as New Zealand's Deputy High Commissioner.

Ms Williams is to take up her position in early 1998. She replaces Consul-General Doug Law.
