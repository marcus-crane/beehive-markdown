The Government has made an in principle decision to move the Beehive and complete the original South Wing of Parliament House, Prime Minister Jim Bolger announced today.

The decision followed a unanimous report by the Government Administration Select Committee recommending that the Government investigate the feasibility of moving the Beehive and completing Parliament House in the 1911 design.

Mr Bolger said the next step would be to obtain the necessary consents and detailed costings to confirm the in principle decision.

"Moving the Beehive will be one of the most ambitious feats of engineering undertaken in New Zealand's history.

"We will combine the technology and knowledge of the 21st century with the original vision of architects John Campbell and Claud E. Paton in 1911.

"This imaginative plan will not only add to New Zealand's Parliamentary heritage, it is literally about building on New Zealand's history.

"It is truly a project for the millennium," Mr Bolger said.
