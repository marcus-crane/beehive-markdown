Health Minister Bill English today released the latest figures on the number of public health nurses in New Zealand.

"These figures show that numbers have remained fairly stable since 1989. If anything there has been a slight increase in the number of registered nurses in New Zealand who work as public health nurses.

"The PSA is trying to cause concern about the future of public health activities by claiming that the number of public health nurses is being cut. There may be changes in different areas, but these figures show that overall there is an on-going commitment to the work that public health nurses do, such as well-child services and health education programmes.

"In 1989 there were 474 public health nurses, compared with 490 in 1996, which is the latest year for which figures are available. The proportion of these working full-time has also increased slightly, from 388 in 1992 to 398 in 1996," said Mr English.
