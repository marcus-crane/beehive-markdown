The Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, Hon D.A.M. Graham, said today Cabinet had approved a nine-month extension to the Whakatohea Deed of Settlement's ratification deadline.

'The ratification process has taken longer than originally envisaged and during that time it has become clear that the Deed will not be ratified in its present form,' he said.

'The negotiating committee has therefore been given till 31 March next year to renegotiate specific elements in the settlement and then seek ratification from Whakatohea.

'These elements are restricted to the Crown apology and the generic natural resource instruments offered to Whakatohea in recognition of their interests in lands administered for conservation purposes and natural resources.

'Cabinet's approval to re-negotiate is limited to the non-fiscal elements of the Deed.

'All other aspects of the Deed, including the $40 million quantum, will remain intact.'

The Deed of Settlement signed on 1 October last year agreed a comprehensive settlement of Whakatohea's historical Treaty of Waitangi claims against the Crown.
