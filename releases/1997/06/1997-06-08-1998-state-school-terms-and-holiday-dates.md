Wide input from the public has helped set the dates for next year's school terms and holidays.

Education Minister Wyatt Creech has confirmed the 1998 state school term dates.

The Government sought the public's view about proposed school term and holiday dates by way of the School Terms and Holidays Green Paper in April.

"I wanted to hear what people thought of proposed dates before they were finalised. The response to the consultation paper was overwhelming, with more than 3,000 individuals and groups making submissions," Mr Creech said.

Three-quarters of those who responded backed the proposed dates.

"This is the first time there has been such wide consultation on the timing of school term dates, and I am very pleased to be able to proceed knowing there is considerable support for them," he said.

"One feature that has emerged is a call for a very different arrangement of term dates for the senior stage of secondary schooling. In fact, the secondary teachers' union, the PPTA, has pushed for the dates of all terms to be set to fit the needs of the senior stage of schooling where preparing students for exams takes on importance.

"To design the whole system to suit just one subsection of the whole would be unfair to others. However I do think the issue should be considered and have asked officials for advice on whether some way can be developed - perhaps different terms and holiday dates for the senior years of schooling - to accommodate the proposal in the future," the Minister said.

"Changes like this could be contemplated as developments within the senior school make it increasingly analogous to the early levels of tertiary education. Any such change would however be significant and would need widespread consultation," Mr Creech said.

"These sorts of ideas need to be considered as part of the overall examination of term dates. I want to ensure that the time schools are open is conducive to providing a quality education. We need to provide a learning environment that best meets students needs."

The following pattern of dates has been approved for next year for all state schools: Term 1 Primary Wednesday 28 Jan to Thursday 9 April  
Secondary Tuesday 3 Feb to Thursday 9 April  
Term 2 All schools Monday 27 April to Friday 3 July  
Term 3 All schools Monday 20 July to Friday 25 Sept  
(Primary and secondary schools have the same dates for Terms 2 and 3.)  
Term 4 Primary Monday 12 October to Wednesday 16 December  
Secondary Monday 12 October to Friday 11 December

(In 1998, primary schools must be open for 394 half-days and secondary schools for 380 half-days.)

The Government's Green Paper also raised wider issues such as: whether school terms should always be the same length, whether primary and secondary years should be the same length and when external examinations in secondary schools begin and end.

"The feedback from the submissions will be used when we are considering the longer term shape of the school year. A White Paper will be produced to present final Government policy on these issues," Mr Creech said.
