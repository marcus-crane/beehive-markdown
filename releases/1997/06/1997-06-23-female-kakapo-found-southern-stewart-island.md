The Minister of Conservation Nick Smith today announced that a female kakapo has just been found in the Tin Range on Southern Stewart Island. The endangered nocturnal parrot was found by Department of Conservation staff over the weekend. A search team was sent into the area after a conservation officer on holiday found signs of the kakapo in the area.

Dr Smith said staff were very excited by the find as it was a major boost to the recovery programme.

"Kakapo are critically endangered and of the previously known fifty adult birds and three chicks only eight adult females are currently considered capable of breeding. The recruitment of an additional female into the programme is significant", he said.

Dr Smith said a transmitter had been placed on the bird and once checks on health and weight and whether she had nested were made it was likely she would be moved to the safer location of Codfish Island.

The first female kakapo seen this century was found on Stewart Island in 1980. Prior to this it was believed kakapo were essentially extinct as only a few solitary males had been found in Fiordland. In the late 1980's and early 1990's, conservation staff undertook a rescue of the small Stewart Island population of 57 bird because they were under threat of predation from wild cats.

The last kakapo to be found on Stewart Island was Cyndy who was transferred to Codfish Island in 1993. Cyndy this year hatched the first kakapo chick of the season. Unfortunately "Grommit" died of major organ failure a couple of weeks ago. Two other chicks hatched this season on Codfish Island are doing well.

Dr Smith said the search team will stay in the area of the Tin Range in case there are any other stray kakapo lurking round.

The kakapo recovery programme is undertaken by the Department of Conservation in association with Comalco and Forest and Bird.
