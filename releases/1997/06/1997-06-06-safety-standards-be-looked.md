The Minister of Consumer Affairs, Hon Robyn McDonald said today that she acknowledged the concerns of child-care organisations Plunket and Barnardo's New Zealand on the lack of mandatory standards for nursery products.

"I am very sad about the recent tragic death of a baby in a portable cot and welcome the company's recall," said Robyn McDonald.

"I acknowledge the concerns raised and believe strongly that we must look at the issue of safety standards. I have asked the Ministry of Consumer Affairs to advise me in detail on standards for nursery products. I know there is already considerable work being done in consultation with child-care organisations on product safety.

"I intend talking to Plunket and Barnardo's New Zealand about their call for compulsory safety standards for nursery equipment. I will talk to both experts and industry participants about the best approach to be taken, before any decisions can be made. I also want to ensure that any standards relate to international specifications too.

"Parents can be assured that I am working to find the best solution and to enhance safety in child products," said Robyn McDonald.
