Education Minister Wyatt Creech has asked the Ministry of Education to give very careful consideration to an international report on the maths and science results of New Zealand nine year olds.

The Third International Mathematics and Science study released today shows New Zealand nine year olds were below the international averages in mathematics and slightly above the international averages in science.

"I am concerned about the outcome of the study. While the research was carried out three years ago and new initiatives have come in in the meantime, I want to ensure that achievement levels are improving in mathematics in particular.

\`\`Improvements have been made to strengthen the curriculum and give teachers more training. Nevertheless, we need to look very carefully at what these results are telling us.

\`\`I have asked the Ministry of Education to consult with mathematics and science education experts to determine whether any further changes are needed, and to put in the right kind of support,'' said Mr Creech.

\`\`We must be sure that the situation has not only been rectified, but that the achievement of New Zealand students ranks with the better nations in the world.''
