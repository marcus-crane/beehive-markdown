State Owned Enterprises Minister Jenny Shipley and Forestry Minister Lockwood Smith say the Government will read with interest the Court of Appeal decision on the West Coast Forests Accord case.

The Court of Appeal today released its decision on the case brought by the West Coast Regional Council and others, which found in favour of the Crown.

"The Government will now carefully consider the implications of the ruling.

"The Ministers are aware of many concerns raised about the future of the native forests and the timber industry on the West Coast. Earlier today we met with the West Coast Mayors, along with Treasurer Winston Peters, and heard their views on the issues.

"All sides of the issue will be given due consideration", the Ministers concluded.
