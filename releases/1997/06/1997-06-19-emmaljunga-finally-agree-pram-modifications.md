The Minister of Consumer Affairs, Hon Robyn McDonald today welcomed the decision by Emmaljunga to agree to modify five of its range of prams. This decision is in response to safety concerns identified after the tragic death of Felix Penny in a Ringo Sport pram. The five models are: Viking, Nouvelle, Jupiter, Sonnet II and the Ringo Sport.

"I am delighted that the Ministry of Consumer Affairs has successfully negotiated this result," said Robyn McDonald.

"After Felix Penny's death, the Ringo Sport was recalled by Foldaway Industries (the importer of Emmaljunga prams) for modification.

"The Ministry then proceeded to check all Emmaljunga prams for similar design features. This feature related to unsecured flaps at the head end of the pram which could inadvertently come off. The Ministry reported to me that some other Emmaljunga prams had similar unsecured flaps and my officials considered these to raise potential safety concerns," the Minister stated.

"Emmaljunga have designed an additional sleeve which effectively adds the same feature that is already incorporated in later models of Emmaljunga prams and which ensures that any potential safety concern is minimised.

"Owners of the Viking, Nouvelle, Jupiter, Sonnet II and Ringo Sport must call the following number 0508 222 437 to receive the modification pack. I also encourage owners of the Ringo Sport who have not yet had it modified as part of the recall earlier this year, to call for the pack and fit the sleeve to their pram.

"I am also releasing the report provided to me setting out the position of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs to this important safety issue. Ensuring that consumers are protected where possible is an essential part of the Ministry's role and we are initiating further initiatives to focus on product safety," said Robyn McDonald.
