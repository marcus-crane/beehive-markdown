Health Minister Bill English has ordered a full report on the week-end fire at the Joan Whiting Rest Home in Collingwood.

"Older people are very vulnerable and we must be sure all the procedures were followed. One fire in a rest home is one too many, but we must learn what we can from this tragic incident," he said.

"Modern rest homes provide a safe environment for old people. However, we need to be sure that the older building stock is also as safe as possible."

Mr English said the fire safety sections of the Building Code were currently being reviewed by the Building Industry Authority, which has primary responsibility for fire safety compliance. Recommendations from the review would go out for public consultation in August.

"The issue of sprinklers in rest homes will be looked at as part of this review. My expectation would be that the requirements for sprinklers will be tightened as a result of this review," he said.

The report into the Collingwood fire will be prepared by the Ministry of Health, which is responsible for licensing rest homes.
