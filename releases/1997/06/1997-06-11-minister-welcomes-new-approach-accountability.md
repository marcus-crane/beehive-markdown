State Services Minister Jenny Shipley says the Coalition Government supports the steps being taken by the State Services Commission to clarify the responsibility and accountability of chief executives.

"The Cabinet has considered carefully and accepted the standards letter and report being released today.

"This will ensure both the Government and the general public can have confidence that public servants are clearly aware of the high standards that are expected of them.

"This is the result of a great deal of hard work by the former State Services Commissioner, Don Hunn, and the way he has involved public service chief executives in agreeing on a set of standards is a tribute to his leadership skills.

"I am confident the new Commissioner, Michael Wintringham will be able to work with the chief executives to put this in to practice", Mrs Shipley said.

The Minister noted that today's announcement delivers on one of the requirements set out in the Coalition Agreement, which calls for "a review of the practice and principles of accountability in the Public Service, particularly having regard to the independent status of senior management in the public sector".

"The public of New Zealand want and deserve a Public Service that is well regarded, and that is able to recruit and retain the best people to serve the public interest while still being prepared to be held to account.

"Both today's clarification of standards and fair remuneration are important to achieving that goal. Cabinet has also been considering a new remuneration system for public sector chief executives, and I will be announcing details shortly," Mrs Shipley concluded.
