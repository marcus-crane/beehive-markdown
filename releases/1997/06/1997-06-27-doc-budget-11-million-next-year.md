The Minister of Conservation Nick Smith said today that funding for conservation in the year ahead will bring a huge boost to key areas of the Department of Conservation's work. These include pest control, threatened species and recreational facilities and would ensure that key policy work in the area of biodiversity and historic heritage is progressed.

"The Department of Conservation's budget increases from a total of $163.2 million in 1996/97 to $174.1 million in 1997/98. The Department is reaping the benefits of both last years and this years green packages which combine to give the Department its highest level of funding in both nominal and real terms in its ten year history. This is despite funding of $2 million now being included in Vote: Biosecurity and the ongoing reduction in baselines of $773,000 to fund the $6.3 million cost of restructuring. There are also major conservation gains in the $1.5 million per year for LINZ to fund tenure review of the South Island High Country and increase the public lands for conservation."

"Pest and weed control receives the largest boost in resources. The Budget for this area has increased from the $28.9 million spent this year to $32.7 million in 1997/98 (a $3.7 million increase). In 1998/99 it will rise to $36.2 million, (a further $7.3 million increase) and in 1999/2000 to $37.0 million (a $8.1 million increase). On top of this, the Department of Conservation will, for the first time through Vote: Biosecurity contribute $1.8 million per year to pest management programmes run by Regional and District councils from Vote: Biosecurity, and resolve a longstanding gripe from farmers."

"The Department's crucial threatened species programme is the second major winner. The budget will increase from $23.6 million this year to $25.6 million in 1997/98 (a $2 million increase), further increase to $28.3 million in 1998/99 (a $4.7 million increase) and to $28.6 million in 1999/2000 (a $5 million increase). This additional funding will enable a whole range of new programmes to try and save endangered species from extinction and the implementation of the concept of mainland islands."

"The 1997/98 year will also see a huge investment in improved recreational facilities. $36.9 million is budgeted to be spent on recreational facilities and services as compared with the $33.2 million spent this year. Part of this increase is due to work on the upgrading of structures being behind schedule and funds from last year being transferred forward. A major component of this work is upgrading tracks, bridges, platforms and huts to meet the Department's new quality systems."

"Major changes are in the pipeline for a system of managing our historic heritage. The Budget provides funding of $1.2 million per year for the Historic Places Trust, to replace funding formerly provided by the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board. This will ensure the Trust's work is maintained in the interim until the Historic Legislation Review is concluded. $600,000 is provided to ensure this work is conducted over the next two years."

"The other key policy work included in the budget is the funding for New Zealand's Biodiversity strategy. This will allow the development of a detailed and robust policy for the protection and sustainable management of the biological resources which give New Zealand a distinctive natural character and its economic productive base."

"I know that some groups will be disappointed that the increase for conservation is not greater. While I would have wished for more, the government is working within tight fiscal constraints. There is always more conservation work that can be done and this will be pursued in future budgets of the coalition government. The Department of Conservation is going through a difficult period of change with the current restructuring. However, with this process coming to an end and these extra resources, the Department is well placed to move into an exciting and positive era for conservation."
