The Associate Minister for the Environment, Hon Deborah Morris, announced today - World Environment Day - grants to six schools from the New Zealand Glass Environment Fund.

The New Zealand Glass Environment Fund was set up in 1983 to encourage studies which would give young people an understanding of the importance and fragility of their environment.

"Educating young people about the ways they can contribute to a cleaner, greener New Zealand is vital. It's about creating a generation that knows how to value and relate to their environment. The New Zealand Glass Award brings business, government and community together on constructive initiatives for young people and the planet. It's awesome!" said Ms Morris.

Karori West Normal School in Wellington is to receive $3,065 to develop a native plant reserve within the school grounds.

Otewa School will receive $1,500 for the long term development of a section of the Mangapohue Stream for the protection of the eco-system from pollutants.

Katikati College will receive $370 to restore a local wetland.

Kamo High School will receive $1,217 to enable them to continue their work on the establishment of three marine reserves in the Whangarei Harbour area.

Paremata School will receive $733 to complete a recycling project. They already recycle plastic and paper, and plan to build a worm compost to help recycle food scraps.

Western Lakes High School will receive $5,080 to purchase equipment to help analyse data gathered from an environmental project based on Lake Rotorua.

A total of $11,965 was allocated to schools through the New Zealand Glass Environmental Fund.
