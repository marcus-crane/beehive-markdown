Mr Sutton's claims about the RCD response plan are cheap politics of the sort for which he is renowned.

'The Government is not poised to spend large sums of taxpayers' money saving rabbits from disease', Mr Upton, Minister for Biosecurity, said today.

'But, unless and until RCD is officially approved for release in New Zealand, the Ministry of Agriculture is required by law, under the Biosecurity Act, to assume that it is an unwanted organism. And Mr Sutton well knows this.

'For that reason, MAF is required to have thought about how it might attempt eradication of the virus.

'Whether those contingency plans are ever activated depends entirely on the seriousness of the incursion and the likelihood of eradication being successful', said Mr Upton.

Mr Upton confirmed the fact that a decision on whether or not to approve the introduction of RCD would be made in July. Legal authority for the decision rests with Dr Peter O'Hara on behalf of the Director General of Agriculture, and is at arm's length from any political involvement.
