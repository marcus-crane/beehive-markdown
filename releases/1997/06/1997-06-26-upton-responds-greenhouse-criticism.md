Environment Minister Simon Upton has challenged Labour's Energy spokesperson Pete Hodgson to spell out just which bit of the European Union's greenhouse gas policy he supports.

"Does he support cuts in CO2 emissions of up to 25% as proposed for Germany, or increases of 40% as proposed for Portugal? Or does he prefer the French approach of no change based on a policy of relying more and more heavily on nuclear power?"

Mr Upton said that calls on the Government by Labour and others to back the European Union target shows how superficial his knowledge of the climate change debate is. "The fixation with debating targets rather than the mechanisms by which greenhouse gases are reduced, shows a woeful ignorance of the real issues at stake.

"The New Zealand government has stated plainly for over a year now that solutions have to take account of the fact that different nations face widely different compliance costs. In simple terms, the dirtier a country was prior to signing the convention, the easier it is to meet national targets; conversely, the greener a country was prior to the convention, the harder its task.

"That's because it is much cheaper to close down inefficient, ancient, polluting industries (as in the former East Germany) that it is to reduce emissions from modern plants."

The CO2 working party, established by the government in 1995, advised the government to promote tradable emissions permits on a global basis as the best way of reducing the costs faced by relatively clean economies like New Zealand. Mr Upton endorsed this approach in addressing the United Nations in New York this week.
