The Minister of Maori Affairs, the Hon Tau Henare, today reiterated comments made by the president of Mana Motuhake about his leader, Sandra Lee, and again asked her to quantify what she has done for Maoridom.

"The president said in the NZ Herald on Tuesday: 'I have to ask myself what she has done for Maori since she has been a politician - if pushed, I would find it hard to quantify.'

"Sandra and I entered parliament at the same time, but the only thing constructive she's done ever since is bash her own relatives in the South because of a personal vendetta.

"She couldn't lead when the opportunity came her way so when the Alliance put its list together last year she went out on a limb for her mentor, Matiu Rata, to be included on its list so she could have him at her side when the going got tough.

"Wisely, the party thought otherwise about Matiu's inclusion on the list, but it begs the question: would the real Sandra Lee please stand up?

"Instead of telling us to roll up our sleeves, which we've done with no help from her because she's caught up in the tirade of misinformation that has tarred parliament. Why doesn't the Alliance deputy leader show some forethought and leadership herself for the betterment of Maori," said Mr Henare.
