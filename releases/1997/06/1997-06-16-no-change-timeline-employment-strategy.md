Employment Minister Peter McCardle said today there has been no change to the planned implementation of the Coalition Government's major reform of Employment Policy which is on track to be fully in place by the second half of 1998, with significant progress planned for the 1997/98 financial year.

"These employment reforms constitute the most complete overhaul of employment policy in decades."

"Since becoming Employment Minister I have consistently said that the Employment Strategy would not be fully introduced before the second half of 1998, and that position has not changed." said Mr McCardle.

"The Government is committed to far-reaching reforms in employment policy that seek to reduce the number of long-term unemployed and involve job seekers in suitable part-time community work or training."

"As I have said many times, those reforms are comprised of comprehensive changes to the way assistance is delivered to the unemployed; including integration of employment and training-related services, greater regional control of employment resources as well as the replacement of the negative unemployment benefit with a positive community wage or training allowance."

Mr McCardle said that despite the scale of the reforms, development of the proposed changes is progressing extremely well, and significant policy development has already been achieved.

"While the full strategy is not expected to be in place until later next year, there are ,many aspects that we expect to implement in this coming financial year. However I am not able to pre-empt details of this year's Budget at this stage."

"I have said all along that I am not prepared to rush the policy development phase simply in order to score a few quick political points, at the expense of a robust and effective employment strategy that makes a real difference for New Zealand's unemployed."
