The Minister for Courts, Hon D.A.M. Graham, said today New Zealand's Family Court has received international recognition for its innovative work.

The AFCC Judge Irwin Cantor Distinguished Program Award for innovative programming was presented to Principal Family Court Judge Patrick Mahony by the Association of Family and Conciliation Courts at the 2nd World Congress on Family Law and the Rights of Children and Youth in San Francisco last week.

The Congress was attended by 1500 delegates from over 50 countries and Judge Mahony says there was very strong interest in the NZ Family Court system.

'After 16 years, it is still regarded as innovative and one of the best models of a unified Family Court,' Judge Mahony said.

'The Court's mediation and conciliation service continue to attract attention.

'Family courts everywhere are grappling with the problem of violence within families and our Domestic Violence Act drew a great deal of interest and favourable comment,' he said.
