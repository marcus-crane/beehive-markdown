Employment Minister Peter McCardle has today directed Employment Service Officials to meet with farmers whose properties have sustained damage as a result of the Opuha Dam collapse, to ascertain what Taskforce Green assistance may be appropriate.

"I have asked Officials to meet with farmers to determine what clean-up and repairs are required and what labour resource they need to get that work done," said Mr McCardle.

"I am conscious that this is an immediate issue for farmers, and that a decision needs to be made as quickly as possible about the level of Taskforce Green assistance that will be appropriate."

Mr McCardle said that the circumstances surrounding the dam collapse dictate that consideration needs to be given to whether the government will seek compensation from insurance companies for the cost of support provided through the Taskforce Green programme.

"Under Taskforce Green criteria, short-duration assistance is normally approved in instances where a natural disaster has occurred; such as in the recent case of hail damage to Hawkes Bay orchards," the Minister said.

"Because this, technically, is not a natural disaster, consideration may be given as to whether or not the Government might seek compensation for assistance it provides."

However, that does not detract from the immediate relief required by local farmers, and I am committed to seeing appropriate assistance provided to them as quickly as is practically possible." concluded Mr McCardle.
