The Minister for Racing, the Hon Tau Henare, said the TAB would not be "hocked off" as speculated in the Evening Post today.

"I'd like to put a bet on with their columnist, Graeme Peters, about this one and I know who'd win," said Mr Henare.

"Articles like the one in today's Evening Post are at the least mischievous; at the best, absolute rubbish."
