Prime Minister Jim Bolger today released the report of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (Hon Justice Greig) on his inquiry into the propriety of the action undertaken by the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service for the Department of Social Welfare.

In his report, Justice Greig said that he was satisfied both of the lawfulness and propriety of the actions and the conduct of the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service and the Government Communications Security Bureau.

Mr Bolger said he had asked the Inspector-General to conduct an inquiry, following several expressions of public concern in late 1996, including correspondence from a Member of Parliament.

"The report speaks for itself. I trust those who expressed concern at the time will be reassured by the Inspector-General's findings," Mr Bolger said.
