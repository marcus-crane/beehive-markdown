Prime Minister Jim Bolger today announced that Cabinet had agreed to fund Enhanced Task Force Green schemes and contributions to Mayoral Relief Funds, to assist the people of Wairoa on the East Coast and Peria Valley in Northland to recover from the wide-spread damage caused by the Queen's Birthday cyclone.

Approval to use Enhanced Task Force Green means that the Government will finance groups of 30 people to work in the area on clean-up operations over a four week period.

The Cabinet has also approved a direct donation of $15,000 to each local authority to help administer this programme.

In addition to the Task Force Green assistance, the Cabinet also approved a direct donation of $15,000 to each Mayoral Relief Fund.

Mr Bolger said: "The people in Wairoa and Peria Valley were severely affected by the cyclone and I am pleased to announce that Cabinet has approved these assistance measures."

"Government has made these decisions in addition to the welfare and other assistance - including the appointment of a Recovery Coordinator in the Wairoa area - that some Government departments are already providing.

"Once the immediate problems are solved, the Local Authorities in the area will be able to seek funding from Government through normal recovery mechanisms to repair infrastructural assets damaged in the storm," Mr Bolger said.
