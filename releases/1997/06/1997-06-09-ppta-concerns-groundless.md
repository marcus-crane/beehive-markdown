Secondary school teachers and parents should be seriously questioning PPTA claims that there is about to be an "attack" on teachers and the state school system, Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

"This year the Government is focused on building confidence in the education sector and improving education outcomes for at risk young people. I would urge secondary teachers to consider this at the meetings called by the PPTA which start tomorrow.

"The PPTA is 'crying wolf' yet again. It has already been proved completely wrong this year with its campaign over what it saw as some ulterior Government motive with bulk-funding.

"The public should note these claims and subsequently judge the credibility of the PPTA. The real test will be on Budget Day when the PPTA will be proved wrong, " Mr Creech said.

"The scaremongering does not help build confidence in our education system."

Mr Creech said the Coalition Agreement makes it clear that bulk funding is optional. It cannot be forced on schools. Earlier claims by the PPTA in regard to bulk funding have been shown to be wrong.

"The union appears to be presenting a serious of 'what-ifs' to teachers, fueling concern and uncertainty about what the Government has planned for education in the Budget."

Mr Creech said the education component of the Budget had been well and truly settled and teachers would know on Budget Day exactly what it means for them.

Mr Creech said the PPTA was wasting its members money by running full page newspaper advertising posing a series of questions which have no substance.
