Employment Minister Peter McCardle said today that the New Zealand Employment Service has resolved the computer problems that prevented it accurately stating registered unemployment figures in April and publishing the statistics for May on time.

"The final revised figures now show that the register stood at 149,920 at the end of April; a fall of 2791, or 1.8% over the month."

"In May the register rose by 4,325 to 154,245. This represents an increase of 2.9% last month." said Mr McCardle.

"Registered unemployment rose by 2.7 percent over the combined months of April and May. The recent slowing in employment growth and the introduction of work testing for some beneficiaries on April 1 1997 were expected to contribute to a rise in registered unemployment in April and May, and the rise in the register is consistent with these factors."

Mr McCardle said the problem with the Employment Service registered unemployment statistics was due to a computer programming error which has now been identified, and the program corrected.

The statistics are an administrative record of the number of job seekers registered with the Employment Service. The official measure of unemployment is the quarterly Household Labour Force Survey.
