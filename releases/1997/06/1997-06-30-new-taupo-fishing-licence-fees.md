The Minister of Conservation Nick Smith has approved new licence fees for trout fishing in the Taupo district. The new fees take effect at the start of the season on 1 July.

Hon Dr Nick Smith said it was first time fees have been set by the Minister in concurrence with the Tuwharetoa Maori Trust Board. This is as a consequence of the amendment to the Maori Land Amendment Act which required a greater involvement of Tuwharetoa in setting the fees.

From 1 July a whole season adult licence will cost $52.00 (up from $46.50), a child season $10.00 (up from $6.00) and an adult day licence $12.00 (previously $9.00). There are also increases for other classes of licences.

Dr Smith said this is the first increase in adults' Taupo fishing licence fees since 1994, while children's licences had not changed since 1992. The fishery, like those managed by the New Zealand Fish and Game council, was required to operate solely on the money raised through licence sales. Revenue had been falling in real terms while the costs of maintaining the fishery sustainably were, if anything, increasing.

The additional revenue would be spent in a number of areas of fishery management. The main ones were research on ageing and survival of young trout; monitoring spawning fish numbers in the Tongariro River and Lake Otamangakau; a review of licence categories, formats, availability and prices; replacing anglers information signs on rivers and at boat ramps; and acquisition of new equipment for law enforcement operations against serious poaching offences.
