The Minister of Maori Affairs, the Hon Tau Henare, has attacked the Alliance's deputy leader, Sandra Lee, and her mentor, Mana Motuhake founder Matiu Rata, for politicising the Adopt an MP programme launched last week by the Minister.

"Those two have managed to turn what was essentially an honest attempt to better inform MPs about Maori education initiatives into a political exercise to the detriment of the programme," said Mr Henare.

"When is Sandra Lee going to stop living in the shadow of Matiu Rata and stand up and be counted for being herself. Better still, when is Sandra Lee going to stop whingeing and moaning and instead either come up with some ideas for Maoridom of her own instead of the vitriol of abuse she constantly heaps on Maori initiatives.

"In that sense I propose that she is really the 'uppity' one and I have to concur with the Mana Motuhake president's comments and ask: what has she done for Maori since she's been a politician?"

Mr Henare launched the Adopt an MP programme last week in parliament.

The programme is an initiative of Te Areare, the Maori council of the NZEI, and aimed to better inform MPs about kura kaupapa, kohanga and Maori education by attaching, or "adopting", members in to their respective whanau.

"As for Matiu Rata I'm even more surprised that he could misconstrue the intent of the programme for some sort of public gain.

"However those of us in Government, despite the intentions of Sandra Lee and her mentor, are committed to working towards better outcomes for Maori, the results which will become public in the next fortnight."
