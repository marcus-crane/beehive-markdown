Employment Minister Peter McCardle said today that New Zealand Employment Service figures released today show an increase in the number of registered unemployed by 5.4% in June to 162,581.

"An increase in June is not surprising given the register has risen in the month of June every year for the last decade and a half due to seasonal and other factors."

"This month the statistics include additional registrations flowing from the introduction of work-testing for some new beneficiary groups from April 1997."

"I have been advised by the Employment Service that while it was estimated that approximately 2000 new registrations per month could be expected as a result of the work-test policy changes, data on the additions of newly work tested beneficiaries to the register is not available."

"This makes it more difficult to draw firm conclusions about the relative contributions of policy changes and other factors to the register increase." said Mr McCardle.

The statistics are an administrative record of the number of job seekers registered with the Employment Service. The official measure of unemployment is the quarterly Household Labour Force Survey.
