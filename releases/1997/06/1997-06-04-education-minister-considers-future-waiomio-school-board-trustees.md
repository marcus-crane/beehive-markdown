The Minister of Education has formally informed the Board of Trustees of Waiomio School in Northland that he is considering dissolving the board.

The Minister's action follows a recommendation by the Education Review Office that the board should be dissolved and a commissioner appointed to govern the school.

The Kawakawa school's roll when ERO visited this year was 14 children.

Mr Creech said today the Review Office had major concerns relating to governance, management, compliance and curriculum delivered at Waiomio School.

"I have advised the Board of Trustees that they have until Wednesday 25 June to respond to my letter and give reasons why the Board should not be dissolved," Mr Creech said.

"I want the educational concerns resolved as quickly as practical so the school community can move forward."

Mr Creech said he would make his final decision after he had heard back from the Board.

If the Board is dissolved, Mr Creech will instruct the Secretary for Education to appoint a commissioner.
