The Minister of Justice, Hon D.A.M. Graham, announced today that the House had unanimously carried a motion recommending the Governor-General appoint Judge Neville Clarke Jaine as the Police Complaints Authority.

Judge Jaine's appointment will be for four years from 1 July 1997. He succeeds Sir John Jeffries whose term expires at the end of this month.

The PCA is an independent authority charged with investigating complaints alleging any misconduct or neglect of duty by a member of the Police or concerning any practice, policy or procedure of the Police affecting the complainant.

It is also responsible for investigating any incident involving serious bodily hard notified to the Authority by the Commissioner of Police.

Judge Jaine is currently the Judge Administrator to the Chief Justice and the Chief District Court Judge. He was appointed to the District Court Bench in 1978.

He is a former Chairperson of the Representation Commission. In 1992 and 1995 he held a warrant as a temporary High Court Judge. He has also twice been an Acting Chief District Court Judge (in 1995 and 1997).

Judge Jaine earlier served as the Executive Judge for the Wellington region.
