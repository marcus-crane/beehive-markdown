Recommendations on how to implement health initiatives set out in the Coalition Agreement are contained in a report released today by the Minister of Health Bill English.

"The Coalition Government welcomes the Steering Group report and will be looking through the details so that decisions can be made to implement the necessary changes by 1 July 1998 in line with the Coalition Agreement," said Mr English.

"We are making solid progress in reshaping the health sector," he said.

Mr English said he was inviting submissions from the health sector and the public on the report. Submissions should be made to the Ministry of Health by 1 August.

"Over the next six weeks I will also meet with key health sector groups about the issues covered in the report," he said.
