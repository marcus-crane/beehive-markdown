The Government today released "Education 1997-1999: Government Strategy" - a document spelling out the timing of major policy reviews and the general approach to consultation on them.

"The Coalition Agreement committed the Government to several important policy reviews which will ensure that the education system can respond effectively to the changing demands placed on it over the years ahead.

"Where it is sensible to do so we want those involved in education and the public to participate and help shape the policies as we develop them," Mr Creech said.

The review process will start with the Government releasing a series of documents this year.

Three Green Papers will be published:

A future Qualifications policy and the National Qualifications Framework (June)  
Review of Tertiary Education (August)  
Review of Teacher Education (September).  
The Green Papers will set out the Government's thinking on particular issues, along with assumptions and reasons for that thinking. People will then be able to make submissions which will be used in the development of final Government policy. The Government's final position will be published in a White Paper.

"The Government has adopted this approach because it allows widespread input into policy, while moving effectively to final decisions," Mr Creech said.

The Government will also produce an issues paper on An Education Strategy for Maori and another on National Assessment Policy. The papers are designed to promote discussion about the issues, which can be drawn on during the development of policy.

"I urge all those interested in helping to shape future education policy to take part in the consultation process we have set up," Mr Creech said.

"The reviews and other education initiatives will help lift educational achievement for all students so they can contribute to a highly skilled, adaptable and motivated workforce.

"We will build on the successes already achieved, to ensure the education system is in the best possible shape as we embark into the 21st Century."
