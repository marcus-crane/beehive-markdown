Hon Deborah Morris today farewelled the Youth Skills Olympic team who will travel to Switzerland to compete in the International Youth Skills Olympics.

The 23 winners from the national finals, which were held in March, will now represent New Zealand and compete to be recognised as the world's best craftsperson in their trade.

The New Zealand team will face the most skilled workers from around the world, competing in a high pressure 4 day competition in St Gallen, Switzerland.

"More often than not all we hear about young people are the negatives. But today and as you compete, I hope you'll make the headlines: a positive message about the success and potential of our young people" said Ms Morris.

"I think it is fantastic that you are excelling in your trade. You've already proved you're amongst the best in New Zealand - now go show the world!" concluded Ms Morris.
