Conservation Minister Nick Smith today told the Local Authorities in Auckland meeting for the first time as the Hauraki Gulf Forum that it was the first step towards the formal establishment of the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park.

"The Coalition Government is committed to the Park's establishment. The Forum brings together key agencies with an interest in the Hauraki Gulf and will help provide the momentum to formally establish the Park. The inclusion of the central Government agencies covering Conservation, Fisheries and Maori Affairs provides the first opportunity for decision makers with an interest in the Park to consult and find a common direction."

"The issue of Maori representation at the Forum is important given the number of Iwi with interests in the Hauraki Gulf. From a government perspective, I am pleased that the Minister of Maori Affairs has agreed to be represented at the Forum alongside myself and the Minister of Fisheries."

Dr Smith said is working on a draft bill to formally establish the Park and will closely consult with the Forum on the specifics of that legislation.

"While there is widespread support for the concept of the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park, there is a lot of work to be done on the detail. The Park's success depends on ensuring compatibility with existing statutes covering Resource Management, Fishing, Conservation, Local Government and Transport. I believe we can develop a model that will give the Hauraki Gulf the status and protection it deserves without creating a unwieldy bureaucracy."

Dr Smith said that he hoped the legislation would be ready for introduction by the end of the year.
