Health Minister Bill English today welcomed the transfer of Maori patients from Tokanui Hospital to the care of skilled Maori mental health workers.

"The Government through Midland Health is pleased to be in a funding partnership with Hauora Waikato in this move, as the patients transfer from the hospital to new care with their own people," Mr English said.

"We could all learn from the holistic approach, Hauora Waikato Maori Mental Health Services takes.

"Hauora Waikato will treat their people in ways that take into account Maori values, whanua support, the influence and importance of Kaumatua and Kuia in helping their people live according to Maori standards," Mr English said.

"As with other successful healthcare, good Maori mental health starts with building the care round the patient's needs. The other vital ingredient is good relationships between everyone involved in that care, including the Government where it is the paying partner," he said.

"That is why I am promoting all the integrated care initiatives happening round the country. They involve doctors, nurses and others, working in hospitals, health clinics, on the marae and down suburban streets putting aside traditional patch protection to work more closely together for the benefit of the people they see in common.

"Hauora Waikato takes this integrated approach which will be important for these former Tokanui patients. Hauora Waikato will be able to use its strong relationships in the community to link these people with supported accommodation or other specific help they need," Mr English said.
