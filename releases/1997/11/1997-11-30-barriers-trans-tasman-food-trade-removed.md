Food exporters on both sides of the Tasman will benefit from the trade agreement between Australia and New Zealand to reduce food inspection costs that takes effect today (Monday), Associate Health Minister Tuariki John Delamere and International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith have announced.

Both countries have agreed to give unrestricted import entry to low-risk food products that have been manufactured in the other country, the Ministers said.

"The agreement will mean that low-risk foods sold in New Zealand can enter Australia without the need to be re-examined and vice versa.

"This will mean that it is easier to trade between the two countries and exporters will benefit from reduced compliance costs.

"It is a significant step towards the creation of a single market in food."

Mr Delamere and Dr Smith said that the new arrangement comes after close assessment of each country's regulatory standards for food products.

"Both countries have very high standards meaning that if a low-risk foodstuff is approved for sale in one country, it will automatically be fit for sale in the other. It is not a good use of resources to require these products to be inspected twice."

An agreed list of high-risk imported foods will remain under surveillance in both countries.

New Zealand exporters to Australia will still need to meet food safety entry requirements for: tomato and tomato-based products (canned), selected cheeses, desiccated coconut, crustaceans (cooked and raw), fish (tuna and shark species), manufactured fish (surimi and marinara mix), bivalve molluscs (cooked and raw), smoked and smoke-flavoured vacuum-packed fish, canned mushrooms, spices (pepper, paprika, cinnamon and nutmeg), nut products (peanuts, pistachio nuts and peanut butter), chicken and pork meat and meat products made from other meats (eg, sausages). The Ministry of Health will maintain surveillance on these imported foods entering New Zealand from Australia to ensure that these products meet our standards.
