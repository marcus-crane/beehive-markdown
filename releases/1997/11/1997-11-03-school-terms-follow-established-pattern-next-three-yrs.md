The dates for terms and holidays for state primary and secondary schools have been set for the next three years, Education Minister Wyatt Creech announced today.

"The Government's consultation Green Paper on School Terms and Holidays has provided enough feedback for me to set the dates for school terms and holidays until the year 2000. Setting the dates in advance should give schools certainty to plan for the future," Mr Creech said.

\`\`Responses to the Green Paper were overwhelmingly in favour of having four school terms, each of approximately ten weeks,'' said Mr Creech.

\`\`There was some opposition to the four term year from some in the secondary sector who found it did not suit their programmes as well as the three term year. It included the strong feeling that the fourth term did not have enough weeks for students to prepare for exams. I have taken heed of this view," he said. \`\`I am working with the New Zealand Qualifications Authority, to achieve a later national examinations start date to accommodate the concern. This issue will be reviewed in time for 1998.''

All state schools will be expected to follow the published dates, although minor variations can be determined by individual school boards of trustees. Summer school holidays will also follow the established pattern.

Mr Creech said people clearly did not want the pattern of even-length terms to be disrupted in order to always have Easter in school holidays.

Primary schools are required by law to be open for instruction for 394 half-days each year, and secondary schools for 380 half-days. To make up the difference, primary schools generally start a few days earlier than secondary schools and finish a few days later.

\`\`We have to be very careful when looking at changing the length of the school year to make sure that students do not lose any of their entitlement to education,'' said Mr Creech. \`\`However, after substantial consideration of this I have decided to allow some flexibility for local decision-making.

\`\`For example, there may be a few cases where all parents and local groups in a community agree that the local primary schools could move to the shorter length of the secondary year, with a correspondingly longer school day.

\`\`This will be allowed only with the approval of the Ministry of Education and will only be given where there is clear local support for the change after other affected schools have been fully consulted.

\`\`I have directed the Ministry of Education to report to me on all the policy issues involved in the length of both the primary and secondary school years.

\`\`In general, the Government is very pleased with the outcome of this Green Paper consultation with the community. The actions we are taking reflect the majority opinion,'' concluded Mr Creech.
