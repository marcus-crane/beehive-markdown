The Governor-General has appointed Judge Arthur Middleton to the position of Deputy Chairperson, Social Security Appeal Authority, the Associate Minister of Social Welfare Hon. Dr. Nick Smith announced today.

Judge Middleton will begin hearing benefit appeal cases from Monday 24 November 1997.

"Judge Middleton is ideal for the appointment as he previously held the position from 1984 to 1987.

"The Government's main priority is to get the benefit appeal process up and running again. I am sure that Judge Middleton will have no problems quickly settling into the role and hearing appeal cases," says Dr Smith.

The Governor-General made the appointment on the recommendation of the Cabinet.

The current chairman, Judge Fenton Latham, is away on sick leave but expected to serve out the balance of his three year term.
