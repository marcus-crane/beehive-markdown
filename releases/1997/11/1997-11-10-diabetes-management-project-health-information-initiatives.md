A diabetes management project was one of 28 health information proposals which would be supported with funding of $3.5 million from the Health Provider Development Programme, Health Minister Bill English announced today.

"This money was allocated in the Budget and shows the Government's commitment to helping improve the quality of information that is available about the health sector.

"Accurate, timely information is particularly vital to good decision-making in a sector as diverse and resource intensive as health. On a day-to-day basis, standards of patient care will be improved because of these projects through the development of better ways of collecting health information."

Mr English said projects to be funded covered a wide range of initiatives, including the management of diabetes, development of a mental health knowledge base, publishing referral and other guidelines on the Internet, the development of communications between providers, and a telemedicine pilot.

Sixty-two applications for funding were received, with the total amount applied for almost $12 million.

"Many of the applications were of a high calibre with clearly identified benefits. Following a review by an independent panel, related proposals were grouped together into 13 projects to maximise the benefits to participants and the sector," he said.
