Health Minister Bill English said today the advertising campaign by international drug companies was about profit, not people.

"I am surprised at the tactics of drug companies in launching a political and emotive campaign about drug choices.

"Over recent weeks I have had informal discussions with representatives of various drug companies and the Researched Medicines Industry (RMI). I was under the impression that we were starting to make some progress towards common objectives.

"I have been waiting for a proposal from the drug companies, but still have not seen it. Launching a million-dollar plus advertising campaign makes sense if profit is the motive, but not if we want to help people.

"This year's publicly-funded drug budget is $747million, which is more than $200 per man, woman and child. If growth is not reined in it could reach $800 million.

"Every day we spend more than $2 million on drugs in this country. There are more than 2,000 drugs currently subsidised by the Government.

"I owe it to all New Zealanders to make sure that the chance to improve health services for everyone is not eaten up by rising drug costs," said Mr English.
