Employment Minister Peter McCardle said today he finds comments made by the Labour Party about current levels of long-term unemployment astonishing, given their own record on unemployment, between 1984 and 1990.

"Labour's mismanagement saw registered unemployment rise by around 100,000; but even worse, saw the number of long-term job seekers explode from just over 10,000 to 74,000.

"That is an increase of over 600% in just six years.

"Labour alone gave us large-scale long-term unemployment.

"It is because of this legacy that the Government's Employment Strategy is essential."

"To begin to substantially attack this challenge, administrative changes were made in July this year. They ensure that more accurate records are now kept of the real length of unemployment; and we now know the true size of the long-term unemployment problem." said Mr McCardle.

In addition, the Government has introduced an explicit goal for Employment Policy; which is to cut long-term unemployment.

"Since July, the number of job seekers registered for more than four years has been cut by 1262 from 12,652 to 11,390."

"While we are only four months into the new financial year, there are initial indications that our groundbreaking, explicit goal of reducing very long-term unemployment is going to produce results.

"And while I would not hold my breath for Labour to admit that they alone created large-scale long-term unemployment, I do not expect to see them trying to score political points on this, of all issues." concluded Mr McCardle.
