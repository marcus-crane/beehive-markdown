"I am honoured to accept the challenge of leading New Zealand to a brighter future," Jenny Shipley said today.

Jenny Shipley was confirmed as the successor to Jim Bolger as leader of the National party caucus at this morning's caucus meeting. She was also given caucus authority to negotiate coalition transition arrangements.

"My colleagues in the National party team will be striving to bring to the country a fresh sense of purpose. We need to restore public trust in parliament, through unity, discipline, and a clear focus on our goals.

"I am committed to a sound economy that rewards effort and meets genuine social needs with compassion and regard for honest kiwi values. The National New Zealand First Coalition Government has been providing New Zealanders with many positive new programmes and initiatives.

"Our National party team wants to continue to work in coalition with New Zealand First, and I will be having discussions with that party about the way forward.

"Our National party team is, as always, looking to the future, and has decided this is the best time for a leadership change.

"Jim Bolger has been an excellent National Party leader for more than a decade, and in his seven years as Prime Minister has guided the Government and the country in a wise and responsible manner.

"I have a great deal of respect for him, and am personally appreciative of the opportunities and encouragement he has given me over the years.

"Mr Bolger's decision to signal his intention to retire at this stage will reinforce his reputation as the leader in developing an understanding of the requirements of the new MMP era, as it is an important step in maintaining stability. Mr Bolger will continue to have my full support in his role as Prime Minister until the date he has set for his retirement.

"He is an outstanding man who has made an outstanding contribution.

"History will record his key role in confronting he challenges facing the National government when it was first elected in 1990, and his unswerving commitment to carrying through a programme of economic reform that is now paying off.

"I also want to express my admiration for Joan Bolger, who has played such an important behind-the-scenes role in supporting her husband and family in the face of the onerous demands of a political life. She has won the respect of us all for her warmth and generosity of spirit and her ready empathy with everyone she meets.

"No new leader could hope to match the length of service and experience of Jim Bolger, who has been in parliament since 1972,and first served as a Minister in the Muldoon cabinet.

"I aim to bring a fresh style to the National party's tradition of sound, stable leadership. I want National party supporters across the country to know their confidence in our party is not misplaced, and National will continue to provide the sort of Government this country needs.

"I want to thank the Rakaia voters who have always supported me, and I will continue to represent their interests to the best of my abilities.

"I also especially want to thank my family who all provide me with enormous strength, encouragement and care.

"Our National party team faces many challenges ahead, and I will be asking a lot of all my colleagues and I am both honoured and humbled by their support," Jenny Shipley concluded.
