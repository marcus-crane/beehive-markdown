While the average Kiwi would prefer to deal with authorities as little as possible, few really want our country to become an environmental 'wild west', the Minister for the Environment, Simon Upton, said this morning in a speech to businessmen of the Maungakiekie electorate.

Mr Upton said, "there has been quite a lot of comment about the Resource Management Act in recent times. Much of it has been either sweeping and general, or highly anecdotal. It's easy to comment in those terms. It's a little harder to generate such easy solutions. I have neither easy solutions nor the luxury of sweeping broadsides available to me.

"Few people disagree with the broad goals of the Resource Management Act", he said. "New Zealanders want an environment with air you can breath, rivers and coastal waters you can swim in and soil that your children can play in without the threat of becoming ill. What is more, we want those values on a sustainable, long-term basis and that means taking account of the ecological integrity of resource use.

"The Resource Management Act is fundamentally about securing these sorts of outcomes.

The Minister outlined the results of a recent survey of 73 businesses commissioned by the Ministry of Commerce. "In many ways", he said, "the survey (undertaken by Ernst and Young) confirms what many of us already suspected - that the business sector generally endorses the RMA's  
intent and philosophical basis but that there are implementation problems and there is plenty of room for improvement on practice issues."

Mr Upton continued, "the move to a more market economy has led people to take a much closer interest in their property rights. That's a healthy thing. Inevitably, the way in which regulations cut across those rights is being subjected to greater scrutiny. Again, that's fair enough. But I'm a little concerned that some commentators are starting to talk as though the RMA represents a new regulatory code that was imposed from nowhere on pristine and inalienable rights that have never been in any way truncated. Some talk as though we have just left behind a golden age. That's a myth. The RMA replaced a thicket of regulation and legislative prescription that was far more intrusive.

"The fact is that statutes concerned with resource use are, by definition, all about resolving conflict between private property rights and the so called "public good". Conflict resolution is at the heart of the RMA as it was at the heart of the legislation it replaced. It would be remarkable indeed if from time to time this conflict did not bubble to the surface.

"No amount of legal reform can remove that conflict. But we can improve the way in which that conflict is handled by those who exercise powers under the Act. That is why we have allocated a further $1.8 million over three years to improve practice under the Act. I have put together a  
comprehensive programme of case studies and practice guidelines.

The Minister outlined this programme in his speech, and concluded by saying, "anecdotes, no matter how loudly or often they are repeated, are still only anecdotes. What we have to do - and have started to do - is identify failings in practice that can be swiftly put right. They are problems that stem from the way ordinary people working in councils, sitting on hearings committees, and submitting applications go about their business.  
There are ways to get good results under the Act and there are ways to make it fail. We have to identify the best ways to make it work and make sure that these techniques, processes and attitudes are adopted by all those involved."
