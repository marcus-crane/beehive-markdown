Health Minister Bill English announced today that the Government had approved a final $7.8 million for Healthcare Hawkes Bay's regional development plan.

"This amount is on top of the $41 million the Government has already made available for the new regional hospital, which was the core phase of the regional development. The money announced today will go towards finalising the other elements of the plan, including rural health centres in Waipukurau and Wairoa and services in Napier.

"The board now has the resources to complete the development plan and is free to finalise its plans and get the work under way.

"I am particularly pleased that this money will enable new health services in Waipukurau and Wairoa. These communities have been considering changes for some time, and now they can get on with the job.

"This is part of a successful strategy to upgrade rural health services across New Zealand," said Mr English.
