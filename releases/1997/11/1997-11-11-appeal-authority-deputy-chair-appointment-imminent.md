Associate Minister of Social Welfare, Hon. Dr. Nick Smith today confirmed that Cabinet has decided on the appointment of a deputy chairman to the Social Security Appeal Authority.

"The current chairman, Judge Fenton Latham, is away on sick leave and the Government is making every effort to appoint a deputy to begin hearing benefit appeal cases as soon as possible.

"Cabinet's decision has been forwarded to the Governor-General and we expect to be able to announce who that person is, in the next few days.

"At this stage I expect Judge Latham to serve out the balance of his three year term," says Dr Smith.
