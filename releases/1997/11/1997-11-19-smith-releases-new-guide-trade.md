International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith has today released an easy-to-understand guide aimed at helping people navigate the minefield of acronyms covering organisations relevant to New Zealand trade.

"These organisations and the processes they are involved with, such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO) or Closer Economic Relations (CER) and the AFTA-CER dialogue, are vitally important to New Zealand's future export performance.

"For example, the WTO negotiations on liberalising agricultural trade in 1999 will have a direct impact on our economic well-being.

"I hope this ready reference guide will assist in the understanding of exactly what the organisations are, how they work and why they are so relevant to New Zealand," Dr Smith said.
