Health Minister Bill English said today that measles could be eliminated in New Zealand if immunisation rates were increased sufficiently.

"Until recently measles was considered too difficult to eradicate. But with the shift from one to two-dose immunisation regimes, total control over the disease is now possible.

"Measles should not be seen as a 'normal' childhood disease. It is miserable for the sufferer and it kills.

"This year's epidemic has seen 1,697 cases notified by the end of September and 154 hospitalisations. Fortunately there have been no deaths.

"In 1991 we were not so lucky, with 629 hospitalisations and seven deaths - all of which were avoidable. Of those hospitalised there were 94 cases of measles pneumonia and 10 cases of encephalitis - some of which will have caused brain damage.

"The strong response from the public and health professionals to combat this year's epidemic shows that New Zealand is capable of eliminating measles. We need to maintain this level of support to completely eliminate measles.

"The immunisation rate for measles for the first three months of this year was 84 percent. The rate has increased since then due to the enhanced immunisation programme, although exact figures are not yet known. However, more than half-a-million doses of vaccine were issued by the national vaccine store in May and June - enough to immunise more than 90 percent of children aged one to 10 years.

"Our target is to get the immunisation rate 95 percent or more by the 2000.

"Smallpox has already been eliminated worldwide and polio is close to being eliminated. Very good success rates from immunisation campaigns in Finland, the United States, and the United Kingdom show that measles could be the next disease targeted for global eradication," said Mr English.
