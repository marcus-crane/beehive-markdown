Employment Minister Peter McCardle said today that the number of people registered with the New Zealand Employment Service in October had not changed significantly, increasing by less than 0.1% to 170,120.

Demonstrating the complexity of comparing October with earlier statistics, Mr McCardle said that if the new groups of beneficiaries required to register since April 1 were extracted, the register would have dropped by 472.

"Since April, 6548 additional clients not previously required to be enrolled have joined the register; an average of 935 clients each month." said Mr McCardle.

The Minister said the ongoing reduction of very long-term unemployment over four years was pleasing, especially given cutting long-term unemployment is the cornerstone of the Employment Strategy.

The NZES register is an administrative record of unemployed clients assisted by the Employment Service and is not the official measure of unemployment. The official measure of unemployment is the quarterly Household Labour Force Survey.
