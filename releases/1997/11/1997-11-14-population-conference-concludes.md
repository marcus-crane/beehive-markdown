Immigration Minister Max Bradford says he is looking to establish an advisory group on population and immigration issues following the Population Conference which concluded in Wellington today.

"The Government needs the knowledge and expertise of those who have contributed to the Population Conference to help prepare for the issues facing us as a population in the future."

The advisory group would offer expert knowledge and opinion on immigration and broad population issues. Mr Bradford said he would be pursuing the idea with his Cabinet colleagues as soon as possible.

"The Population Conference has highlighted the fast and dramatic changes our population is undergoing, and the issues that presents for our future. We are at a demographic crossroads and the conference has opened the door for ongoing debate and preparation for the future. It is important that the debate does not stop here," Mr Bradford said.

"For example, we have heard about the 1990's baby blip, the need to be ready to meet the demand for good education of that generation and its role in supporting an aging population next century.

"We have examined immigration - its benefits and impact on New Zealand, problems with settling migrants and the advantages of increasing cultural diversity and richness of our country.

Mr Bradford said the expert advice and the views of those at the conference would be taken into account in future immigration policy.

"It seems that maybe we should be thinking in terms of a more long term policy - not using immigration policy and targets to counteract the swings we get in long term migration flows.

"It is also important that we address our lack of comprehensive information and research about ourselves as a population, which is utterly inadequate if we are to really understand and plan for the future," Mr Bradford said.

Mr Bradford said the research, presentations and discussions of the Population Conference had been recorded and would be made publicly available in the next few weeks.
