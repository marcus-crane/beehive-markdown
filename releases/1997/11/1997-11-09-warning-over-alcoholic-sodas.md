Health Minister Bill English is warning the liquor industry that it runs the risk of regulatory action if it does not adopt a code of practice to limit the appeal of alcoholic sodas and iceblocks to younger drinkers.

"Underage drinking is a significant problem in New Zealand. Eight out of ten young people aged 14 - 18 years surveyed described themselves as current drinkers and nearly three out of ten young people had recently been involved in binge drinkers," he said today.

"These new alcoholic products have considerable appeal to underage drinkers. Research in the United Kingdom is particularly concerning as it shows a rise in alcohol consumption and drunkenness in 14 to 16-year-olds associated with the introduction of these products.

"I have written to liquor industry representatives encouraging them to adopt a voluntary code of practice on the naming, packaging and marketing of alcoholic products in order to limit harm from these products. I would also encourage the use of a pre-vetting mechanism for alcohol products as a means of enforcing such a code," he said.

Mr English said most alcoholic sodas were designed to appeal to young drinkers through the addition of alcohol to products normally associated with young people, such as milkshakes and iceblocks. This helped to disguise the taste of alcohol. Colours, the shapes of containers and the graphics on labels also added to the appeal, and may result in more young people drinking alcohol and more alcohol being consumed.

"I have asked the Ministry of Health to identify ways in which the consumption of alcoholic sodas amongst young people could be controlled if the liquor industry is slow to respond to the idea of a voluntary code of practice.

"In the UK various strategies have been introduced including increases in tax, powers to allow the police to confiscate alcohol and conduct controlled purchase operations, and the introduction of a voluntary code.

"The Ministry will also work with the Alcohol Liquor Advisory Council to monitor young people's consumption of alcoholic sodas on an on-going basis to determine trends in consumption and alcohol-related harm.

"Members of the Distilled Spirits Association of New Zealand have already endorsed a Memorandum of Agreement on the naming, packaging and marketing of spirits and liquors and I would urge other industry members to do the same," he said.
