The Minister of Justice, Hon D.A.M. Graham, today introduced a Bill which allows a Judge in exceptionally long trials to discharge two jurors who are unable to continue instead of only one as at present.

'In recent years there have been some very long trials and one due to begin early next year is expected to take 100 days,' he said.

'In trials of that length, in which jurors may fall ill, it may be necessary to allow a verdict to be given by 10 rather than 11 jurors to avoid the trial being aborted perhaps after months of hearing.

'It is very undesirable to require a complainant to have to go through a trial of that length again,' he said.
