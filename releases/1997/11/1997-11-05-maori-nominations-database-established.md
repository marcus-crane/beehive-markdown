The Ministry of Maori Development, Te Puni Kokiri, has established a nominations database to help promote Maori representation on boards and organisations, both of general interest, and of specific concern to Maori.

The Ministry is now calling for candidates who have skills and experience in a wide range of areas from iwi and community development, social services to science and business management to register on the database.

The Minister of Maori Affairs, the Hon Tau Henare, said: "There is an increasing demand for suitable Maori candidates to sit on advisory bodies and Government committees.

"The nominations database is a response to this demand and provides an excellent opportunity for Maori representation on organisations playing a role in New Zealand's economic and social development."

The privacy Act ensured the Ministry had strict protocols about the use of the information, which would be held on database and remain confidential and used only under the terms of consent.

For more information about the database or a copy of the registration form contact: the Nominations Officer, 0800 TPK INF(0800 875 463); your local Te Puni Kokiri office; or through the internet at www.tpk.govt.nz
