Health Minister Bill English today announced approval of a $4 million project to build four new theatres at Nelson hospital.

"These new theatres will provide a much better service for the people of Nelson through better servicing and patient flows.

"One of the theatres will be an obstetric theatre for caesarean sections and the new theatres will also enhance the trend towards day surgery.

"Nelson currently has five theatres spread over three different locations. The existing main theatre block has three theatres which were built in the 1950s and there are problems with poor patient flows, size and risks of cross contamination.

"The Government is committed to bringing our public hospitals up to modern standards and this theatre development is part of an on-going investment programme.

"Last year more than $250 million was invested by our public hospitals and more is planned this year," he said.

Structural work on the new theatres is expected to begin in January 1998.
