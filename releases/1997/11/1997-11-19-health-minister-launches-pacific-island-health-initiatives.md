Health Minister Bill English today launched a $1.8 million health package for Pacific Island people living in Auckland.

"The five programmes in the package all have two vital ingredients. They have Pacific Island people working with Pacific Island people and they link up with all the other health professionals and services already available.

"The last thing we want with any new initiative, especially when it is tailored for a particular population, is to re-invent what we've already got. But at the same time we need public health services that meet all New Zealander's needs..

Home-based support services for Pacific Island children in the first year of life

"Starship Hospital identified a major problem with Pacific Island babies from Glen Innes having many re-admissions in their first year of life. This programme aims to get help to pregnant Pacific Island woman and mothers who perhaps have little or no support at home.

"North Health is contracting with Pacific Health Star which employs a Pacific Plunket nurse and Pacific Island midwife and others. These health workers help Pacific Island women living in Glen Innes with breast feeding, immunisation information, using child car seats, budgeting and other difficulties they may face during pregnancy and with a new baby.

"They will also ensure the woman and her child are put in touch with a GP, Plunket and other public health services," Mr English said.

Health Education programme on child health for Pacific people

"This programme uses three different Pacific Island health organisations to improve children's health.

"The main emphasis will be promoting breastfeeding, healthy eating and a smokefree household as well as preventing respiratory illness and ear infections.

"Many of the messages are simple, the hard thing is getting them trusted and believed then acted upon," Mr English said.

Pacific youth awareness promotion

"Young people are always difficult to get health messages to.

"North Health's research shows special radio programmes will probably appeal most to young Pacific Island people.

"The aim is to promote healthy attitudes and activity in relationships and in relation to sexual health, alcohol, drugs, mental health, stress and nutrition," Mr English said.

Pacific central home care services

"This is really a home-based support services similar to hundreds we have up and down the country but using Pacific Island people to help their own elderly live in their own homes. That difference is important. Many of these elderly people will be much more comfortable and trust a Pacific Island person in their home," Mr English said.

Ethnic specific primary care services for Tongan people

"A major attraction for Tongan people will be the chance to speak Tongan to the nurses and doctors at their new health centre due to open next month.

"It is easy for us to forget the importance of being able to converse about very private matters in your own language and with people who fully understand and share your cultural background and values," Mr English said.
