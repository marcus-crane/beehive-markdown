Opening the Australasian Urban and Regional Information Systems Association (AURISA) Conference in Christchurch this morning Research, Science and Technology Minister, the Hon Maurice Williamson, called on delegates to adopt the foresight practice

Founded in 1975, AURISA's mission focuses on advancing the development and dissemination of knowledge about urban and regional information technologies to meet a variety of management needs.

"Your conference theme, 'Information change - Back to the future' is very timely given the Foresight Project that is currently being undertaken by the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology," said Mr Williamson.

"The aim of the Foresight Project is to stimulate strategic thinking about our industries and economy through to 2010 and beyond, and explore the research, science and technology needs necessary to achieve our national vision.

"The Foresight Project will enable the Government to set priorities for its investment in research, science and technology," the Minister said.
