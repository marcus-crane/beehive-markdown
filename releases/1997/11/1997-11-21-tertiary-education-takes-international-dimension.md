Tertiary Education will take on a greater international dimension, with New Zealand tertiary providers wanting to ensure that this country's standards and qualifications meet global demands," said Minister of Research, Science and Technology Hon Maurice Williamson.

Mr Williamson was speaking to guests at this afternoon's opening of the new Science and Technology Building at the Auckland Institute of Technology.

"The new facility that I am opening today symbolises the commitment of the Auckland Institute of Technology to elevating the profile of technology and science in tertiary education," the Minister said.

"We need to foster dynamism and interaction between research, teaching and on-the-job training to both ensure what is taught is aligned with market demand, and to encourage the view that science and technology are essential.

"AIT has confronted the forces that are shaping the demands made on the education system in a number of ways. This includes investment in the new science and technology facility that I am opening today, said Mr Williamson.
