New Zealand will seek an accelerated breakdown of trade barriers affecting fish, forest products and unprocessed fruit and vegetables at the annual Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) gathering in Vancouver.

Foreign Affairs Minister Don McKinnon and International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith, who will both attend this week's APEC joint ministerial meeting, hoped they could achieve a positive result for New Zealand but warned it will be difficult.

"It is encouraging to see that the fish and forest products sectors have both made a final list of sectors that have attracted the strongest support for early liberalisation," the ministers said.

"However, we expect the discussions to be tough as the various APEC members will all be seeking to get their favoured sectors approved.

"We'd like to see a big group of sectors chosen for accelerated liberalisation as this would give New Zealand the best chance of getting its preferred sectors into the final package." At the APEC leaders' meeting in the Philippines last year, ministers were asked to identify sectors which could be liberalised quicker than the 2010 deadline for developed member economies and 2020 for developing economies.

APEC economies put forward about 60 nominations. This year's APEC chair Canada has now produced a pared down list of around 14 sectors which have attracted the most support for early liberalisation. Fish and fish products and forest products are both on this list.

APEC economies took 97% or $2.2 billion worth of New Zealand's wood and wood products exports in the year to June 1997. APEC also took 86% or nearly $960 million worth of various fish products.

Unprocessed fruit and vegetables is not on the list of 14 but an Australian proposal to liberalise trade in general foodstuffs is.

"We have been working with Australia to merge our proposals," the ministers said.

Meanwhile, Mr McKinnon and Dr Smith said New Zealand will also be looking for significant improvements in the Individual Action Plans (IAPs) of APEC members. IAPs outline the steps being taken unilaterally by members to liberalise trade and investment.

"New Zealand has taken a lead with the Budget's commitment to remove all our remaining tariffs well within the 2010 deadline for developed economies.

"So we want to see other APEC members coming up with bold measures as well." New Zealand also wants the APEC meeting to give a substantial push to World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations on liberalising trade in financial services. The WTO talks on freeing up financial services trade are due to finish in Geneva next month.

"We'd like to see a solid APEC commitment to liberalising financial services as these WTO negotiations enter a critical final phase," the ministers said.
