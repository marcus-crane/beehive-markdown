The Government will not be progressing the development of a youth radio network, says Hon Deborah Morris.

Earlier this year the Minister announced that the Ministry of Youth Affairs, Ministry of Commerce and Treasury would carry out a feasibility study to determine the viability of establishing a youth radio network. The officials working on the project came to the conclusion that such a project would not fulfil the suggested aims, and therefore would not be viable.

"The cost of establishing a youth radio network would be high, with conservative figures suggesting a minimum investment of $4.5 million, with additional running costs of $5.2 million. I am really concerned about the important social issues facing young people, I want to ensure that New Zealand tackles these issues in the most appropriate and effective way, it seems unlikely that a youth radio network would achieve this.

"Young people have said that they would like to see a youth radio network, but many also emphasised that they would use it for entertainment, not education or social information. I don't believe that the Government is in the business of running entertainment, that's the job of the private sector. Already there are over 39 radio broadcasters and 6 television channels around New Zealand that provide programming targeted at young people.

"There was mixed opinion that a youth radio network would be effective in providing solutions to social issues.

"Finally, the FM frequencies that would need to be obtained for a youth orientated network are already held by existing right holders. A programme to clear the 101-108 MHz band is underway. It would be premature for the Government to allocate frequencies as it needs to consider a number of demands.

"Since the introduction of the youth radio concept I have given qualified support. I was supportive of the ideas that were put in front of me, and decided that they were at least worthy of investigation. Those investigations have proved that a youth radio network is not a feasible option for the Government to be involved in.

"Access to the media and broadcasting is a right for young people under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Therefore, I have asked my officials to continue to monitor developments in relation to youth broadcasting to ensure that New Zealand maintains its compliance with the Convention," said Deborah Morris.
