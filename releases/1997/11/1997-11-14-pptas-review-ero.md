The independent Ministerial Review Panel reviewing the Education Review Office has already considered an earlier version of the PPTA's review of ERO, the acting Minister responsible for ERO Wyatt Creech said today. "The government is currently considering the Ministerial Review Panel's report and will release it, along with our preliminary response, in the next 3-4 weeks," Mr. Creech said.

"The Ministerial Review Panel considered the PPTA's submission along with many others and spoke to many people who work in schools every day all around the country."

"This Ministerial Review Panel's review is wide-ranging and contains many recommendations for ERO, the Ministry of Education and schools, which the government is seriously considering."
