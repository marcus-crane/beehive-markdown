New Zealand will donate $100,000 to a United Nations relief fund to help Viet Nam recover from Cyclone Linda, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Don McKinnon announced today.

Cyclone Linda, branded the "calamity of the century" by the Vietnamese Government, killed 390 people, injured 700 and left another 2000 missing in early November.

Mr McKinnon said the economic damage of the cyclone had been put at around $400 million, with 65,000 homes destroyed and over 226,000 hectares of rice fields flooded.

"There is an urgent need for food, medicine, clothing, shelter and sanitation in the southern provinces of Bac Lieu, Ca Mau, Soc Trang and Kieng Gang, which are the areas worst-hit by Cyclone Linda."

Mr McKinnon said the United Nations, which will administer the funds donated by New Zealand and other countries, had estimated that $US12 million was needed for the relief effort.

New Zealand's contribution will come out of the Government's emergency disaster allocation of the Official Development Assistance fund.
