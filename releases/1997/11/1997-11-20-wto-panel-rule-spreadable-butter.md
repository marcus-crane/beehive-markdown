An international panel has been set up to resolve New Zealand's dispute with the European Union (EU) over spreadable and Ammix butter, the Minister for International Trade Lockwood Smith announced today.

The dispute centres around the EU's ruling that the two types of butter do not qualify for reduced duties under New Zealand's World Trade Organisation (WTO) quota access to Europe.

To qualify for the reduced duties New Zealand butter must be made directly from milk or cream -- but the EU has ruled that spreadable and Ammix are not made directly from milk or cream.

"I firmly believe that spreadable and Ammix butter meet the criteria for reduced duties," Dr Smith said.

"New Zealand has been forced to seek a WTO ruling on the matter after failing to reach an agreement with the EU.

"However, EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler and I agreed earlier this year that, in the circumstances, the WTO was an appropriate mechanism for resolving this dispute.

"We have tried to settle the dispute by negotiating directly with the Europeans but it was not possible to reach agreement.

"We were left with no choice other than the establishment of a WTO panel to rule on the matter." Dr Smith said the EU's stance was proving costly for the New Zealand dairy industry.

"The EU's ruling, unless overturned, will restrict the dairy industry's ability to take advantage of technological progress in the future. It is a clear breach of the legal rights that New Zealand has under the WTO agreement and we must have those rights upheld." The WTO panel is expected to complete its work within six months.
