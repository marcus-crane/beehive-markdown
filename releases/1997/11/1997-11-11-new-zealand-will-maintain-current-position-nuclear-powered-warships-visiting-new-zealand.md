Transport Minister Jenny Shipley says the Australian media were misleading and incorrect to suggest that the New Zealand Government has any intention of ending a ban on nuclear-powered warships using New Zealand ports.

Mrs Shipley says she made it clear to the Australian journalists she spoke to yesterday that there is no intention or likelihood that this issue will be addressed again by the New Zealand government.
