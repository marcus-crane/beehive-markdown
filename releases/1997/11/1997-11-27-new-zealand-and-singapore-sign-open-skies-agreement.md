New Zealand and Singapore have today signed an historic "open skies" air services agreement. Transport Minister Jenny Shipley says this Agreement is probably the most open in the world.

"Of most significance is the stripping away of capacity constraints and virtually all limitations on routes, in favour of giving our airlines the opportunity to provide the level and range of services demanded by travellers and traders.

"Airlines of New Zealand and Singapore may fly via any point, and beyond to any point, with no restriction on the traffic carried other than those that may be imposed by third countries," the Minister says.

Requirements for the airlines to file passenger tariffs and cargo rates for government approval have been removed.

Joining with Mrs Shipley in signing the new Agreement was Singapore?s High Commissioner to New Zealand, H.E. PH Lam.

"Singapore is an important bilateral partner of New Zealand, and this new Agreement adds further lustre to our already warm relationship," Mrs Shipley said.

The new Agreement replaces the one signed in 1968.
