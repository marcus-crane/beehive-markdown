Prime Minister-elect Jenny Shipley this morning welcomed the Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom John Prescott to New Zealand for a brief visit.

Jenny Shipley says the UK Government of which Mr Prescott is a key part has much in common with the current New Zealand Government.

"Both acknowledge that a healthy economy is the essential first step, because it enables Governments to spend on priority areas such as health and education.

"Both Governments are also determined to strengthen families, and help people help themselves.

"I look forward to talking with Mr Prescott in more detail in Wellington tomorrow," Mrs Shipley concluded.
