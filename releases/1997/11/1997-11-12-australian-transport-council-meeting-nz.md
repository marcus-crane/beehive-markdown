Transport Minister Jenny Shipley will this week be hosting the meeting of the Australian Transport Council, which brings together the Australian Federal and State Transport Ministers and the New Zealand Minister.

"I welcome the opportunity these regular meetings provide to keep in touch with my colleagues from across the Tasman.

"When it comes to transport, there are many issues where we can share ideas and learn from each other.

"Areas likely to be discussed include the reforms New Zealand has undertaken in the rail and maritime sectors. The Ministers will also be comparing notes on new measures for tackling the road toll.

"I look forward to some interesting discussion on innovative approaches to transport issues," Mrs Shipley said.

Mrs Shipley will be welcoming the Australian Federal Transport Minister Mark Vaile to Auckland this afternoon.

The Ministers will then make their way separately to Queenstown for the all-day Transport Council meeting on Friday November 14.
