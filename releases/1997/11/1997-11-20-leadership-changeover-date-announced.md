The Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Jim Bolger said today that the changeover of leadership will occur on Monday, 8 December.

This will allow him to return from APEC and China and brief Cabinet and Caucus on the important matters covered.

It will also allow for a new Cabinet to be announced after his return, be sworn in on Monday 8 December and for the new Cabinet to meet and complete important work prior to Christmas.

"In advance I wish the new team well," said Mr Bolger.
