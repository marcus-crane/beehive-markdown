International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith remains optimistic that US President Bill Clinton will gain fast-track negotiating authority for trade agreements, despite a setback over the weekend.

"Our information is that a House of Representatives vote on granting the President such authority looks likely to be deferred until next year after fast-track proponents failed to gain enough supporters to guarantee victory," Dr Smith said.

The minister said not getting a positive vote now for fast-track was disappointing for New Zealand because it represented a temporary setback to a possible Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Washington and Wellington.

"The US administration has made it clear that fast-track authority is needed before negotiations can begin on a FTA with New Zealand, " Dr Smith said.

"But I remain hopeful that President Clinton's backers on fast-track will be able to persuade enough members of the House to give their support in the not too distant future.

"My US counterpart Charlene Barshefsky and I have prepared the ground for an FTA and getting fast-track authority is the next major step needed." Under fast-track authority, Congress can only say "yes" or "no" to trade agreements -- it cannot amend them. This means negotiators can work without the prospect of having to shuttle back and forth between trading partners and the Congress.

Meanwhile, Dr Smith said President Clinton's lack of a broad fast-track authority would not hamper New Zealand's efforts to quicken the pace of APEC sectoral trade liberalisation for fish and forest products.

Members of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum are due to meet in Vancouver later this month to consider sectors that will be liberalised quicker than APEC's 2010 deadline for developed countries and 2020 for developing countries.

"In Vancouver, New Zealand will seek to get fish and forest products accepted for accelerated liberalisation," Dr Smith said.

"President Clinton retains fast-track powers left over from the Bush administration in these sectors. So I'll be doing my best to get a good result for New Zealand fish and forestry exporters in Vancouver."
