The government is being challenged to develop a strategy for the wider and more consistent use of information technology (IT) in schools, Minister for Information Technology Hon Maurice Williamson told guests at today's opening of the new UNITEC Student Learning Centre in Auckland.

"Facilities such as this Centre will help UNITEC maintain its position as a leader in learning technologies and higher education," said The Minister.

"UNITEC is a shining example of innovative use of technology in the tertiary sector and has created a benchmark for others to measure their use of technology in learning.

"It is time to invest in the education of our citizens to ensure they are among the most highly skilled knowledge workers in the world.

"The Education Review Office (ERO) and Dr Judith Aitken are to be congratulated for their report 'The Use of IT in Schools' which confirms, children who use computers in schools do better.

"Not because these children come from wealthier backgrounds, but because computers make the learning more effective, more efficient, more relevant and more fun.

"This ERO report will be followed next month by the release of the Futures Trust report 'Impact Education' which discusses the state of information technology in New Zealand schools

"With the release of these two reports I will be asking my Information Technology Advisory Group (ITAG) to develop a strategy to address the education requirements of New Zealanders," said Mr Williamson.
