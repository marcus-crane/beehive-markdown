Employment Minister Peter McCardle announced today that the first five of around 50 Community Broker Organisations throughout the country have been contracted to broker community-based work experience opportunities for the long-term unemployed.

Their appointment follows the Minister's announcement in September that the Government has approved $5.239 million to be spent over the next twelve months on involving community organisations in significantly increasing community work opportunities for unemployed job seekers.

The Community Employment Group (CEG) has already contracted five organisations - known as Community Broker Organisations - in Tauranga (Tauranga Employment Trust), the Hawkes Bay (Hawkes Bay Volunteer Centres' Trust and Hawkes Bay Community Trust) and Auckland (Sport Auckland and South Seas Training and Development Institute). Another 19 organisations are currently in contractual negotiations with the Group.

"These organisations have been contracted to broker community work opportunities for long-term job seekers because they have well established links within their communities, and especially with job seeker groups who may have become alienated from mainstream sources of employment assistance." said Mr McCardle.

"I am acutely aware of the extra strengths that many community organisations have in assisting unemployed job seekers, and this initiative is capturing that strength."

The Minister said the initiative is part of the Government's strategy to maximise the number of job seekers involved in community work as a way to keep them connected with their communities and help them maintain their self-esteem, work skills and dignity.

The Government is aiming to treble the number of job seekers participating in community work to up to 10,000 at any one time by the end of June 1998.

"Keeping unemployed people active in their communities is one of the most exciting aspects of the Government's employment Strategy, and something I am totally committed to." said Mr McCardle.

"This is a win win situation. Our unemployed will benefit with new skills, and the pride in knowing they are helping to make their communities a better place while they look for work, and their communities will benefit from the many worthwhile projects that will be completed." said Mr McCardle.
