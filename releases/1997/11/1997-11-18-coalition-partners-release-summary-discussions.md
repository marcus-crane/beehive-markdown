National party leader-elect Jenny Shipley and New Zealand First leader Winston Peters today released the Summary of Joint Discussion Points, which covers issues addressed in recent meetings.

Both Mrs Shipley and Mr Peters have briefed their caucus members on those discussions.

"It is important for the public to have confidence that the Coalition Government programme will continue in the direction set down in the Coalition Agreement," Mrs Shipley and Mr Peters said.

"The points identified in this document are all areas where the Coalition Government already has work in progress. We have committed ourselves to renewing our focus on these points and delivering results."

"Both parties are determined to put a fresh energy into providing good Government, and focusing on what we have in common rather than our differences," Mrs Shipley and Mr Peters said.
