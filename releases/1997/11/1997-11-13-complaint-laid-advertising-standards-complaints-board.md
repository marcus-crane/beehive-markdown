Health Minister Bill English confirmed today that he had laid a complaint with the Advertising Standards Complaints Board about the advertising campaign being run by drug companies.

"This is a nasty campaign. The drug companies are trying to bully the Government into spending millions more on their products so they can make bigger profits regardless of people.

"The campaign centres around claims that people's choice of drugs will be restricted. This is misleading because there is a clear implication that people will not get the drugs they need. The language used is highly emotive and designed to raise fear and anxiety among people who use these drugs and the general public.

"The claim that "in the next few weeks a Government-affiliated body will begin a deliberate process to reduce the amount we spend on health..." is entirely false. The Government's stated intention is to slow the rate of growth of our pharmaceutical bill, not to reduce it. Any money not spent on drugs will be spent on other public health services and the total budget for health has increased this year and will increase for the next two years.

"One of the advertisements exorts people with high blood pressure to "get angry now". Deliberately trying to raise anxiety in a group of people where the aim is to reduce blood pressure is irresponsible to say the least.

"This year's drugs budget is $750 million. The Government wants to provide appropriate drugs for people's condition and intends to continue spending millions of tax-payer dollars to make sure that people get access to the drugs they need.

"It is interesting that, while there are some concerns among GPs about the availability of drugs, we have not seen any GPs come out in support of the campaign," said Mr English.
