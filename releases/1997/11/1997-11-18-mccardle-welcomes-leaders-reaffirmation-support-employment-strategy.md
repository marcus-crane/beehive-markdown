Minister of Employment Peter McCardle said today he is pleased that the Coalition Leaders Winston Peters and Jenny Shipley are reconfirming their support for completing the detail of the Government's Employment Strategy.

Mr McCardle was referring to the Summary of Joint Discussion Points released today by Mrs Shipley and Mr Peters which covers priority issues addressed between the two leaders in recent meetings.

"I have consistently said that implementing the Employment Strategy must be done properly. This is the most comprehensive reform of Employment policy in our history and our decisions are intended to provide the best structural and policy framework to take us into the twenty-first century.

"The Strategy includes proposals for major restructuring of agencies; an even more radical restructuring to provide regional control of resources; major reform to the Unemployment Benefit; as well as a breakthrough to outcomes.

"Each of these proposals are major in their own right. Together they are the most progressive and far-reaching employment reforms ever undertaken in New Zealand." said Mr McCardle.

"An enormous amount of work has been completed with a wide range of options being put to Ministers for their consideration, and those decisions are well underway.

"The Leaders' explicit support for finalisation of the policy is an expression of the importance of getting through the critical stage we are at now as quickly as possible.

"We are also clearly signalling this message to officials."

Mr McCardle said that he expects to be in a position to make some announcements before Christmas.

"There is simply no question that the whole Employment Strategy is entirely on track for delivery in the second half of 1998, and I am delighted that the Coalition Leaders have agreed to reaffirm the priority the Strategy has for this Government." concluded Mr McCardle.
