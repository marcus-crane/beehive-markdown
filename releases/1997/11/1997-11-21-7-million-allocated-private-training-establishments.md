Education Minister Wyatt Creech announced today that the Government will provide $7 million in funding for private training establishments in the 1998 academic year.

Fifty-five providers are being funded to deliver 195 courses. The funding will provide 2262 equivalent full-time student (EFTS) places.

"The Government is committed to increasing access to tertiary education and training, and funding courses offered by private training establishments helps meet this key goal," Mr Creech said.

"Private training establishments have an important function in meeting the diverse education and training needs of New Zealand's economy. They have a role to play in New Zealand education, particularly in providing courses in niche areas."

The funding is targeted to areas that the Government identifies as high priority. It includes tourism courses (34% of total funding), early childhood education training (15%), trades training (18%), art and design courses (7%) and computer programming courses (6%).

All providers funded are registered with the New Zealand Qualifications Authority and accredited to offer local courses or Unit Standards from the National Qualifications Framework.

The recently published Green Paper on Tertiary Education which reviews aspects of the tertiary education sector suggests private training establishments might be able to play a greater role in meeting the Government's strategic objectives for tertiary education.

Submissions on the Green Paper proposals are open until 15 December 1997.
