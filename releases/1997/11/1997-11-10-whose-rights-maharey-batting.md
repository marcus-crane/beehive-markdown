New programmes and increased Budget funding are clear demonstrations of the Coalition Government's commitment to New Zealand children, says Hon. Deborah Morris, Minister of Youth Affairs.

Ms Morris responded to comments by Labour's Social Welfare spokesperson Steve Maharey, by saying the Coalition Government is committed to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.

"One of Mr Maharey's main criticisms seems to be young people's access to employment. Thousands of young New Zealanders hold after school jobs and benefit from their experience and the chance to earn some extra money.

"I doubt that these young people would see Mr Maharey as batting for their rights.

"This Government values New Zealand's children and young people, as demonstrated by the great progress we have made in just over a year."

This progress includes:

extra Budget funding for Children, Young Persons and their Families Service of $66 million over three years;  
free health care for children under six;  
the South Auckland Wraparound programme with $3 million over three years for at risk youth with multiple needs, Te Whanau O Waipareira has been selected as the preferred provider;  
holding the 1997 Youth Parliament  
the Ministry of Youth Affairs Student Representative scheme  
the conduct disorder programme, located in South Auckland;  
the Iwi Social Services strategy which is underway; the Strengthening Families project - currently underway;  
the "Recognition of Child Abuse and Neglect" handbook launched in June;  
10 new Crime Prevention initiatives targeting Maori in last year's Budget. Three of these specifically target family violence issues with funding of $2.1million over three years;  
New Crime Prevention initiatives targeting Maori announced in the current Budget;  
$10 million for Education's truancy programme.
