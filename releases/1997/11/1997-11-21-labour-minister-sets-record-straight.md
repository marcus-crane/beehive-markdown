The Coalition Government is committed to a fair, flexible and neutral industrial relations environment and the public will be able to make full submissions on any changes to industrial relations legislation, Labour Minister Max Bradford said today in response to incorrect claims from the Labour Party and the Engineering, Printing and Manufacturing Union.

"As both the Labour Party and the Engineering, Printing and Manufacturing Union are fully aware, public consultation is an integral part of any legislative change under our democratic system. Their statements to the contrary are simply irresponsible scaremongering designed to mislead workers and the general public."

Consultation would take place early next year during the select committee process, if and when any legislation is introduced into the House, Mr Bradford said.

"Furthermore, the leaked papers to which Mr Hodgson continually refers, are simply preliminary discussion papers from officials which set out a spectrum of options. Many of those options will be unacceptable to the Government, will not be considered and do not reflect the views of myself or the Government."

"The Coalition Government is committed to a fair, flexible and neutral industrial relations environment. That is what we are currently working to enhance."
