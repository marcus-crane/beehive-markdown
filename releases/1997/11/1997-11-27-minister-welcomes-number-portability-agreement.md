The agreement on number portability reached by Clear and Telecom has been welcomed today by the Minister of  
Communications, Hon Maurice Williamson

"This is a further milestone on the route to full local service competition in telecommunications," said the Minister.

"What I find particularly pleasing is that the two companies with the largest customer bases have now reached agreement, opening the way for further benefits to telecommunications service users from competition.

"I recognise that there are further number portability issues for the carriers to resolve, including longer term technical arrangements for portability and finalising arrangements for portability in a wider range of services.

"I urge the parties to the number portability agreements between Clear and Telecom and Telecom and Telstra, to rapidly finalise implementation details to provide actual portability options to users at the earliest possible date," said Mr Williamson.
