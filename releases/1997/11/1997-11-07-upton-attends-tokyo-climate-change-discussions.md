New Zealand's Environment and Associate Foreign Affairs Minister, Hon Simon Upton, is travelling to Tokyo today to attend a Ministerial meeting on Climate Change.

Negotiations to reach agreement on legally binding greenhouse gas commitments are at a vital stage. With just a month to go until the Conference of the Parties in Kyoto there are still wide gaps between the positions of key players.

New Zealand called for a meeting following the United Nations General Assembly Special Session in New York during June and has been promoting a frank exchange between a small number of Ministers as the best way forward.

The suggestion has recently won important international support and the Japanese government has agreed to host this meeting. New Zealand has played an active role throughout the FCCC process. Mr Upton's presence in Tokyo continues that commitment.
