Cabinet has approved an auction of radio spectrum licences suitable for VHF-FM sound broadcasting, UHF - TV and VHF - TV, Minister of Communications Hon Maurice Williamson announced today.

The on-line auction commences at 10am, Monday 8th December and will also include some management rights suitable for general communications purposes.

This auction will be the first time the Ministry of Commerce has used the internet to dispose of radio spectrum. Prospective bidders who do not have access to the internet will be able to place bids through a national network of contractors.

"The electronic auction is designed to be customer friendly, is simple to use and will take less time to complete than previous fax based auctions," said the Minister.

Bidders must register for the auction before 12pm, Thursday 4th December 1997.

Complete auction details, a catalogue and registration form will be available for download from Monday 24 November at: [http://www.moc.govt.nz/rsm/auction](http://www.moc.govt.nz/rsm/auction%20)
