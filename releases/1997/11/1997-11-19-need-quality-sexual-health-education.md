The abortion figures tabled in Parliament today demonstrate the need to ensure that young people are well educated about sexual and reproductive health and are aware that they have choices, says Hon Deborah Morris.

"A significant number of young people are becoming sexually active at an early age, and evidence suggests that just over one-third of all young people do not use contraception at first intercourse.

"The Government does provide some choice of free contraception, and there are some youth centres that provide advice and contraception. On its own this is not enough. As well as ensuring that we are physically safe, we must be emotionally safe and ready for dealing with relationships and sexual activity.

"Young people need to be aware that they have options available to keep themselves safe. They need to know that it is OK to say "no", but that if sexual activity is on the agenda, information and condoms will be too.

"A recent Education Review Office report showed that approximately 50% of schools were not adequately teaching the sexual health curriculum. I am concerned about the ability of young people to access sex education. However I am hopeful that the draft Health and Physical Education Curriculum Statement will improve access to education about relationships and health.

"Sexual and reproductive health programmes need to be responsive and relevant to the needs of young people. Programmes need to provide confidential contraceptive advice and target younger teenagers.

"Parents have a vital role to play, particularly in teaching their children to have a positive body image and to respect the limits that our bodies impose on us. If we are confident about ourselves, then we are more likely to seek safe options. Self-esteem is central young people wanting to protect themselves.

"While many would prefer that this issue was never discussed, I believe that New Zealand's abortion rate is evidence that we have to be pro-active about culturally appropriate sex education in the context of relationship issues," said Deborah Morris.

Note to Editors:

The general abortion rate has increased from 16.4 per 1000 women of child bearing age in 1995 to 17.7 in 1996.  
For women aged 15 to 19 years the abortion rate increased from 20 per 1000 in 1995 to 22.7 in 1996.  
For women aged 20 to 24 years the abortion rate increased from 29.1 per 1000 in 1995 to 32.4 in 1996.  
A sample of 12-17 year olds from 16 high schools throughout New Zealand in 1992 found that 28% had experienced sexual intercourse. The percentage was highest among young Maori (48%) and was also higher among young women than young men.  
There appears to be differences in condom use between Maori and Pakeha. A study of 12-17 year old high school students found that 70% of Pakeha used condoms compared with 43% of Maori.  
The draft Health and Physical Education Curriculum Statement will be released by the Ministry of Education this month.
