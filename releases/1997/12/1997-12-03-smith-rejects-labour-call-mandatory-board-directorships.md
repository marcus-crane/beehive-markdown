Agriculture Minister Lockwood Smith has rejected Labour's call for the mandatory appointment of Maori, union and dairy directors on the Meat and Wool Boards.

"I subscribe to the view that directors should work in the interests of all board levy payers, not just particular lobby groups.

"However, the primary production select committee has recommended that Maori interests be considered when it comes to Meat and Wool Board directors appointed by the Minister of Agriculture on the recommendation of the boards.

"The committee has said that boards should take account of the desirability of having at least one director qualified to represent Maori interests.

"I support the committee's suggestions on this given the high level of Maori involvement in the agricultural sector," Dr Smith said.

The minister also rejected Labour's call for retention of the one farm-one vote system for election of board directors.

"I prefer a voting system which reflects a farmer's share in the work of the boards, in much the same way that shareholders in a public company get votes according to the level of their interest in the company. It is a more commercial model that will improve accountability." However, Dr Smith said the committee's suggestion for voting rights based on stock numbers may not be ideal.

"Voting rights based on the amount of levies paid may be more efficient and more in line with the philosophy of voting power being related to the level of financial input.

"This is an issue which may be worth more study before the legislation is finalised," Dr Smith said.
