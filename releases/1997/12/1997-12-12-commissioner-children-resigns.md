The Minister of Social Welfare, Hon Roger Sowry, today announced that he has accepted the resignation of Mr Laurie O'Reilly, the Commissioner for Children. Mr O'Reilly's resignation will be effective from 1 February 1998.

"It is with much regret that I have accepted Laurie's resignation who has continued to perform his role as Commissioner for Children while battling terminal cancer for some months.

"Laurie has been a strong advocate for the children and young people of New Zealand. Laurie's energy, enthusiasm and passion for the role of Commissioner has increased the profile of the Office of the Commissioner for Children since he was appointed as Commissioner in 1994."

Mr O'Reilly will continue to contribute to the Fathers Who Care project which aims to gather different views on fathering from children, men and women.

Mr Sowry stated that the Government would be looking to appoint a successor to Mr O'Reilly in the New Year.
