Transport Minister Jenny Shipley has announced that the Government will facilitate the holding of an industry conference on the state of and future for the shipping and ship servicing industries in New Zealand.

"The holding of a shipping conference was a commitment in the Coalition Agreement, and arrangements for the conference have been developed in consultation and discussion with my colleague, the New Zealand First Transport Spokesperson Peter Brown MP, and other senior Government Ministers.

The conference will be organised by the Ministry of Transport and held in Wellington during May 1998. It will be chaired by Mr Basil Logan, and will include papers under the headings of:

Competitive and efficient shipping services  
Ship servicing  
Greater New Zealand involvement  
In announcing the Government's intention to proceed with the conference, Mrs Shipley noted that the New Zealand shipping industry had introduced measures leading to significant efficiency gains in the early 90s and pointed out that the industry needed to demonstrate a continuing commitment to make further efficiencies in its operations.
