Income Support will bring forward the payment of benefits that would normally fall on Christmas Day this year, to ensure that beneficiaries can access their payments on Christmas Eve day, says Minister of Social Welfare, Hon. Roger Sowry.

"The purpose of providing the early payment is to reduce the stress on beneficiaries who would otherwise be prevented from accessing their local banks on Christmas Day.

"As New Year's day also falls on a Thursday, payments due then will also be brought forward so beneficiaries can access their payment on Wednesday 31 December 1997.

"More than 117,000 New Zealanders will be affected by the early payments by Income Support many of whom have been made aware of the change," says Mr Sowry.
