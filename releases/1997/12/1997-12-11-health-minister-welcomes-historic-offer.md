Health Minister Bill English told a rural health summit in Balclutha today that he welcomed the historic offer from the Otago Medical School to help small health services.

"The opportunity being put forward today for the Medical School to work in partnership with rural communities represents a major change in direction for the Medical School. This is a very timely move and one which I welcome.

"The Medical School has acknowledged that, while we need our large hospitals, we can make more progress to improve the health of the community outside the hospital.

"Rural health services have changed significantly over the last few years and local communities now have a lot more say in those health services and how they work. But small communities need support to do this and that is what the Medical School, along with one of the biggest independent practice associations, South Link Health, can provide. There is an enormous amount of experience within these organisations and the existing health centres and that information needs to be shared among all rural communities.

"In return, the Medical School needs the opportunity to train doctors for a different type of health service. The experience our young doctors will get through working in rural health centres will be invaluable for them.

"I am very excited about the opportunities being considered today. Co-operation between the Medical School and the southern community outside of Dunedin will break down the wall that has traditionally existed between them. Today the first bricks are being taken out of that wall.

"No-one is forcing any of these changes. They are being driven by the need to provide better and better services for people," he said.
