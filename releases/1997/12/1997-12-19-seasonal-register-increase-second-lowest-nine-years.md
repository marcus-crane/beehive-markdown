Employment Minister Peter McCardle said today that although any increase in the register was undesirable, the number of people enrolled with the Employment Service in November increased by 1.9% to 173,274, the second lowest increase in a November month in the last nine years.

Mr McCardle said however he was particularly pleased with the significant progress made over the past year in cutting the number of job seekers registered more than four years.

"This register group has been cut by 3300 since November 1996 and has fallen below 11,000 for the first time in many years.

"In addition, the number of job seekers participating in community work through Community Taskforce has increased by around 90% over last year's average.

"Although it is early days, these statistics clearly show that we are already seeing substantial progress in achieving our two big employment objectives of cutting long-term unemployment and maximising the involvement of job seekers in suitable, part-time community work and training." concluded Mr McCardle.

The NZES register is an administrative record of unemployed clients assisted by the Employment Service and is not the official measure of unemployment. The official measure of unemployment is the quarterly Household Labour Force Survey.
