Hon John Luxton, Minister of Commerce, responded with surprise today to comments made by Mr Kirton MP in the media and offered a full briefing to Mr Kirton on the issues involved to help ensure he understood how the Government operated.

Mr Kirton put out a press release today suggesting the Minister of Commerce was turning a "blind eye" to dumping and subsidised peach imports. Mr Luxton, whose officials have been working since 1995 with the issue under the Dumping and Countervailing Duties Act 1988, said today:

"I recall no representations on this matter by Mr Kirton over the last two years.

"If Mr Kirton wishes to get a full briefing to help him understand the issue and also the efforts on behalf of Hawke's Bay growers taken by the Ministry of Commerce and myself, I would be happy to provide him with one.

"The Ministry of Commerce has thoroughly investigated concerns raised by local Hawke's Bay growers into this matter since it was first raised in 1995. The relevant legislation has been followed thoroughly."

Mr Luxton said that Mr Kiton's claims could not be sustained by the facts, and do not reflect any understanding or awareness of the processes involved in the administration of New Zealand's trade remedy legislation.

"This legislation is designed to ensure that New Zealand industries don't face unfair competition. The legislation is fully consistent with New Zealand's international obligations in this area, and with the various treaties involved.

"I am happy to explain these things to Mr Kirton and bring him up to date." More... In response to the particular concerns raised by Mr Kirton, Mr Luxton explained that:

Imports of canned peaches from South Africa have not entered New Zealand without penalty. The combination of the undertakings, the reference price-based duty and the residual 20 percent countervailing duty have meant that the impact of any dumping or subsidisation has been removed. This is totally consistent with the provisions of the Dumping and Countervailing Duties Act.

It is not consistent with either the Act or with New Zealand's international obligations to collect anti-dumping or countervailing duties from goods which are not dumped or not subsidised. Where there is clear evidence that the level of any dumping or subsidisation has changed or has been removed, then the Ministry must reassess the level of duty. This occurred in the case of canned peaches from South Africa because of a combination of exchange rate movements and price changes in South Africa.

Provisional duties were not imposed on canned peaches from Europe because the conditions set out in the Act were not met. These conditions reflect the international rules contained in the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement
