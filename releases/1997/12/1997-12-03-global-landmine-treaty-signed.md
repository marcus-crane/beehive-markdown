Hon Deborah Morris, Minister of Youth Affairs, today signed an international treaty banning anti-personnel landmines. The treaty will be signed by about 120 countries and bans the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines.

There are between 60 and 120 million active landmines scattered around the world, killing many innocent people - often young people and children. New Zealand has been in the forefront of efforts to conclude negotiations on a ban on anti-personnel mines. We deplore the use of these indiscriminate weapons and strongly support the Ottawa Treaty, says Deborah Morris.

"The late Diana, Princess of Wales was an ardent battler against landmines, and I'm sure that many people will see the signing of this as an effort to further her excellent work. The Princess brought this issue to the attention of us all, and I'm sure that her work is responsible for the speed with which this treaty has been agreed to.

"New Zealand is playing its part not only by signing the treaty but by actively assisting work to remove mines. New Zealand Defence Force personnel have contributed to demining operations in Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia and Mozambique" concluded Deborah Morris.
