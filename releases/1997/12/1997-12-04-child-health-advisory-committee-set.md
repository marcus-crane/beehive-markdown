Health Minister Bill English today announced the establishment of the Child Health Advisory Committee, which will develop a National Child Health Strategy.

"The Child Health Advisory Committee will provide expert advice to me, to my Associate Minister, Tuariki Delamere, and the Ministry of Health on the development of the National Child Health Strategy," said Mr English.

"We can improve the health of our children with better co-operation among those who care for children. The Government also needs advice straight from the coal-face to ensure we address the real issues of concern.

"The national strategy will cover all child health services, with a particular focus on services for four priority groups. These groups are Maori children, Pacific children, children with high needs for health services, and children from families at risk.

"Consultation on the strategy will begin early next year when a discussion document will be circulated to interested individuals and groups. This document will outline key issues facing child health in New Zealand, and propose ways in which they could be dealt with. It will seek the views of individuals and groups on the issues and what is being proposed.

"The Ministry of Health has recently appointed a Chief Advisor, Child Health, which meets one of the key commitments for child health in the Coalition Agreement. The establishment of this committee is a further indication of the priority which the Government places on child health," said Mr English.

"Nominations for the Committee were sought from participants at the child health summits and the national Maori child health providers' hui where key child health organisations were represented.

"Members of the Committee have a depth of perspectives, professional knowledge and experience across paediatrics, community child health, general practice, and disability services.

"I am confident that people of the calibre and experience of Child Health Advisory Committee members can help the health and disability sector bring about significant improvements to the health of all New Zealand children," he said.
