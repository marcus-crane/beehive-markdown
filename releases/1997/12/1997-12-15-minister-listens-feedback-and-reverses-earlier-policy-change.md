Employment Minister Peter McCardle announced today that job seekers participating in Community Taskforce will again be able to receive a flat payment of $20 per week to cover work-related costs.

Prior to 1 July 1997, all Community Taskforce participants received a flat $20 per week payment to cover the cost of travel.

However from 1 July, this changed to a reimbursement of actual participation-related costs of up to $20 per week.

"The rationale for the change to a payment of actual costs up to $20 per week rather than a flat payment was to bring the allowance into line with the regime by which travel costs are paid to people in training.

"However following wide consultation, I decided to seek a return to the flat $20 payment, which Cabinet has agreed to."

Mr McCardle said he is particularly pleased with the decision because it will further assist the rapid growth in community workers under Community Taskforce.

"I am pleased to say that the number of job seekers participating in Community Taskforce has already increased by an exciting 52% over last year's average."

The Minister concluded by reinforcing that this decision in no way pre-empts decisions yet to be finalised in relation to the future community wage.
