The new Attorney-General, Hon D A M Graham, said today that he considered it a privilege to be appointed Attorney-General and that he acknowledged the outstanding work of his predecessor Hon Paul East QC over the past seven years.

"Paul East has served with distinction both within New Zealand and when representing the New Zealand Government overseas at the World Court over nuclear testing and as the only Attorney-General to appear in the Privy Council," Mr Graham said.
