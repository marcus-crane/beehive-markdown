Health Minister Bill English today stressed the Government's support for the public health services as he opened a new $9 million emergency and theatre block at Hutt hospital.

"The Government is committed to investing in our public health services. The new building, which includes a modern emergency department, four new operating theatres and an acute assessment unit, shows that commitment in action," Mr English said.

Mr English also announced the Government was providing an extra $8.5 million funding to Hutt Valley Health to carry out further improvements to Hutt hospital.

"We need modern health facilities on hospital sites and in the community. The reliance on the dinosaurs of the past, with their long corridors and wards designed after the war, must give way to the type of buildings our doctors and nurses need to treat today's patients.

"We must also balance the need for high-tech, specialised facilities in central locations with moving more services out to where people live.

"The new Hutt hospital emergency and theatre block is planned to enable staff to treat more patients, more quickly and return them to health faster.

"The new acute assessment unit is an excellent example of meeting today's patient's needs. This unit provides somewhere where a sick person can be watched and assessed in a hospital bed. If hospital staff believe the person needs further treatment or hospital care they can then be fully admitted to the hospital for a longer stay.

"Today's opening was a fitting way to end a year that has been marked by the Government's investment in health," Mr English said.

In the Budget the Government announced an extra $1.5 billion over three years for health, taking the total funding this year to $5.8 billion.

$50 million redevelopment of Palmerston North hospital (the Government funding $22 million)
