"New Zealand will contribute $US25,000 to a United Nations fund set up to monitor the safety of Cambodian politicians returning from exile," Foreign Affairs Minister Don McKinnon said today.

"The New Zealand Government is happy to offer further support to the Cambodian peace process," Mr McKinnon said.

"Our contribution signals New Zealand's ongoing role, in co-operating with countries in the region, to help restore stability.

"We call again on the Government of Cambodia to uphold the Principles of the Paris Peace Accords, protect human rights, implement a cease-fire, and marshal its resources to conduct free, fair and credible elections in 1998."

The UN Trust Fund for Preventive Diplomacy in Cambodia was established recently to keep a check on politicians who have returned to the country to take part in elections planned for May, 1998. Most fled after an outbreak of violence in July this year.

Mr McKinnon said the fund was further evidence that the United Nations was playing a vital role in promoting the restoration of civil society in Cambodia.

"New Zealand's contribution to the trust fund is a gesture of our support for the people of Cambodia, and for the role of the United Nations."

New Zealand's contribution comes from its International Good Government Programme under the Official Development Assistance Programme.
