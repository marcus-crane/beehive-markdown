Associate Health Minister, Hon Tuariki Delamere, has welcomed Te Puni Kokiri's review of the Ministry of Health's contribution towards improving the health status of Maori.

"The review shows the Ministry is on the right track and is already working to overcome the weaknesses that have been identified. The review is an excellent baseline against which future gains can be measured.

"I would emphasise, however, that there is a new mood among Maori which is seeing them take a much greater responsibility for looking after their own health.

"Under the previous Labour administration, there were few, if any Maori health providers. Today, there are more than 250 providers delivering a full range of health services including dental education among young Maori, mental health, alcohol and drug programmes, youth parenting support and prevention strategies for asthma and diabetes.

"The Coalition Government is supporting this Maori drive for self-help with a $26 million programme over three years that will assist the professional development of the staff of the Maori health providers.

"This is not the total spending on Maori health, but is a real sign of the Government's commitment towards improving the health status of Maori," said Mr Delamere.
