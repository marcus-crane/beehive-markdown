Agriculture Minister Lockwood Smith has written to the Otago Regional Council urging it to help develop a sustainable arrangement for funding the regional share of Tb control in Otago.

Dr Smith said Tb vector control in Otago was lagging behind other regions because the council, alone in New Zealand, has refused to fund the regional share.

"The Animal Health Board's funding arrangements for vector control require a regional contribution.

"In other areas, this regional share has been raised by councils using various rating systems.

"But Otago Regional Council has gone out on its own by pursuing a strict user-pays approach, even though local farmers have indicated they're prepared to pay a special rural rate for Tb control.

"We have made excellent progress on Tb control in other regions over the last two years. I want to see Otago enjoy the same benefits."
