New Zealand's next Ambassador to the Islamic Republic of Iran will be Warwick Hawker, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Don McKinnon, announced today.

Mr Hawker, 49, is currently Deputy Head of Mission in Beijing. He previously served as Deputy High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur.

Mr McKinnon said New Zealand had enjoyed a good relationship with Iran for a number of years, and viewed the resource-rich nation as a key Middle East country.

"Iran is a major market for our meat and dairy products and exports such as agricultural and communications technology are showing promise," Mr McKinnon said.

"We also find periodic exchanges of view with Iran on strategic developments in its part of the world useful, especially as it is at the heart of a region which produces so much of the world's oil."

While working in Tehran, Mr Hawker will also be accredited as High Commissioner to Pakistan, a country with which New Zealand has long-established and wide-ranging ties.

Mr Hawker first jointed the Department of Trade and Industry in 1967, serving as Trade Commissioner in Adelaide, Singapore and Suva. He will replace Daniel Richards, New Zealand's current Ambassador to Iran.
