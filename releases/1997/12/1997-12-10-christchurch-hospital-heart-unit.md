Health Minister Bill English today officially opened the Christchurch heart unit.

"The heart unit has only been made possible because the hospitals and people involved were able to put aside their separate interests and work together for the good of heart patients.

"I am delighted to finally open this unit. This Government, in partnership with Canterbury Health, HealthCare Otago, the surgeons and Southern Regional Health has succeeded where successive governments failed for more than 23 years," he said.

"Today also marks the beginning of a joint venture between Canterbury Health and HealthCare Otago which will operate the cardiac service in the South Island. This is a model for regional co-operation which we expect to see used widely in the future.

"Today is a day for the people of Christchurch to celebrate. They have worked long and hard to get this heart unit in their hospital," Mr English said.
