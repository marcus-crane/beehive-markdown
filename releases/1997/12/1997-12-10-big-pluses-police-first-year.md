The first year of the Coalition Government has produced real gains for the Police in their work to make our communities safer, Police Minister Jack Elder said today.

"The Coalition Agreement promised more resources for Police and a tougher approach to law and order, and the Government has delivered."

The Agreement aimed at providing an extra 500 Police on the streets over the three year term of office, and the May Budget provided targeted funding for an extra 200 in the first year. There were 6384 frontline staff at the time of the last election, 6492 at the time of the Budget, and the Government is targeting 6692 by the time of the Budget next year.

"With the graduation of another class of 74 Police constables earlier in the month, the country is well on track to meeting this target," Mr Elder said.

Of this graduating class, 30 officers have been assigned to Auckland, and Mr Elder noted that the Auckland region was now over establishment for sworn staff.

"In fact, all but one of the Police regions are now over establishment," Mr Elder said.

The rate of officers leaving the Police had also dropped sharply in recent months, and is now below its average level of recent years.

The Coalition Agreement on law and order was drawn up with considerable input from former Superintendent Rana Waitai, and former Police Association National Secretary Graham Harding - two people very experienced in practical law and order, Mr Elder said.

"The Agreement states the Government will crack down on gangs, and make it easier for councils to tear down gang fortifications - this has been done.

"Also checked off have been a widening of the Police capacity to use electronic surveillance against organised crime, boosting designated traffic patrol squads, introducing laws to deal with criminals consorting, and trialing the use of covert speed cameras."

The Government will soon be making decisions on firearms licensing following the presentation on the Thorp Report, and in the new year will be looking at the CYPF Act to ensure under 17-year-olds are held properly accountable for their actions.

"As well as boosting crime fighting capability, the Government has invested heavily in crime prevention strategies to stop young people getting involved in illegal activities and has financed the expansion of Youth at Risk of Offending programmes across the country.

"While some civil libertarians have complained about the tougher laws targeting gangs, I believe the majority of New Zealanders will welcome the changes, and the fact the Police now have their highest ever level of funding, and staff numbers are rapidly increasing."

There was a blip in disengagements during a scare campaign that perf provisions were going to be changed.
