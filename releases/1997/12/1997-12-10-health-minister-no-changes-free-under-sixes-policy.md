Health Minister Bill English said today there was no question of the Government changing the free under-sixes health policy.

"Free GP visits and pharmaceuticals for children under six is a non-negotiable part of the Coalition Government's policy.

"I have said a number of times there will be no changes to this policy. I will say again, quite categorically, there will be no changes to this policy.

"Similarly, the Government has no intention of reintroducing part charges for hospital care. Again, this is a key commitment in the Coalition Agreement. The planned breast screening programme for women will go ahead. This is too important for women to be scrapped.

"I have asked the Transitional Health Authority for proposals to find additional funding for elective surgery. The THA's response is still being considered by the Government and no decisions have been made on possible changes to other programmes," said Mr English.
