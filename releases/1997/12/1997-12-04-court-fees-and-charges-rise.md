The Minister for Courts, Hon D.A.M. Graham, said today court fees and charges payable by those who use the court system will rise from the beginning of next year.

The changes will be gazetted today. Leaflets setting out the new fees will be available at all Courts from tomorrow.

Mr Graham said the increases are generally in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index since July 1992.

With the exception of Disputes Tribunal fees, which were last changed in 1988, other fees have remained static for almost six years.
