"The Periodic Report Group chaired by Jeff Todd presents a challenge to politicians and the public alike to seek a consensus on retirement income," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"The report needs to be read and considered carefully over the next few weeks before deciding how we should respond. There is a great deal of detail, a number of suggestions and some proposals for the way forward, all of which need to be considered.

"We must all remember that one of the things that real New Zealanders are demanding is that the politicians reach agreement on this issue. A recent survey conducted for the Office of the Retirement Commissioner found that 85 per cent wanted all political parties to come to a shared agreement on superannuation.

"There is a role for politicians and the political parties, as well as opinion leaders outside parliament and the wider public in reaching a consensus.

"The PRG report presents a number of examples for ensuring an affordable superannuation scheme.

"I have always been of the view that we will only be able to provide security and certainty in the area of retirement income if as many New Zealanders as possible agree on the framework of a superannuation scheme.

"The Government will be making decisions on the way forward early next year. Prior to doing that every option will be considered as to how political parties might work together to progress this issue.

"I look forward to working with the other political leaders in the New Year as we consider how to advance this issue. In the meantime, I would encourage all those with an interest in this issue to read the material over the Christmas break," Mrs Shipley concluded.
