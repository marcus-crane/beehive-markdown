The Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Don McKinnon, today officially welcomed China's Former Vice Premier, Huang Ha, who is visiting New Zealand to celebrate 25 years of diplomatic relations with China.

Twenty five years ago in New York, Mr Huang, Permanent Representative of China, along with his New Zealand counterpart, John Scott, signed the agreement establishing diplomatic relations between New Zealand and China.

Mr McKinnon paid tribute to the 25 year anniversary of the relationship at a lunch in Parliament today.

"Back in 1972, when you both signed the agreement, we were strangers. We continue to cross national boundaries and cultural barriers in an effort to understand each other. The China/New Zealand linkages are now stronger than ever."

Mr McKinnon said New Zealand could be proud of the progress made towards developing the relationship and mentioned growth in a number of areas.

'"Two way trade between China and New Zealand continues to grow and now totals $1.2b. There are currently around 300 New Zealand investment projects in China and China is beginning to focus attention on investment in New Zealand currently investing in two major forestry ventures.

"New Zealand's relations with China will be further enhanced once China becomes a member of the World Trade Organisation," Mr McKinnon said.

"But as I see it, the most important changes over the next 25 years will come from growing contacts and exchanges between people. Increased tourism, education and communications will bring us closer together. "

Mr McKinnon also paid tribute to Rewi Alley, the New Zealander whose 100th anniversary it is this week.

"In a personal way, Rewi Alley did much for New Zealand /China relations by devoting much of his long, adventurous and productive life to China."

Mr Huang is now an Adviser to the Asia 2000 Foundation, an initiative set up by Mr McKinnon in 1996, to increase New Zealand's understanding of Asia.
