The Minister of Maori Affairs, the Hon Tau Henare, today acknowledged the passing of another of Maoridom's leaders, Waikato kuia and land rights campaigner Eva Rickard.

Eva came to the public eye over the fight for the return of the Raglan Golf Course during the seventies and since had championed many a cause all in the name of Maori rights.

Mr Henare said Eva joined a long list of Maori leaders who had passed away this year.

"Not only has the Maori protest movement suffered a great loss, but all of Maoridom will feel the loss," he said. "It won't be the same without her.

"Eva and I may have had our political differences but that didn't mean we didn't respect each other.

"I had absolute admiration for Eva, for her strength and cunning, and I have no doubt her loss will be felt by a number of us, from all walks of life," said Mr Henare.
