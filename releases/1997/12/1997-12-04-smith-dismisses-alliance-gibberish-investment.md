International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith has attacked Alliance "gibberish" over foreign investment.

"Comments in Parliament by the Alliance's 'business development spokesperson' John Wright demonstrate his ignorance," said Dr Smith, who has responsibility for New Zealand's negotiating position over the the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI).

Mr Wright claimed the government had sent Dr Smith "begging" around Asia for "another $100 billion of foreign investment -- overseas debt -- in the next five years".

But Dr Smith said he had only been saying that up to a $100 billion of new investment was needed, although it was recognised that a substantial portion of this would need to come from offshore. More importantly, Dr Smith said, Mr Wright appeared confused between investment and debt.

"If a foreign individual or company brings their equity capital here, creating jobs and paying taxes, this is investment.

"A straight equity investment by a foreign concern in New Zealand does not involve any New Zealander getting into more debt.

"I'm advised that 83% of the direct foreign investment stocks here up till March last year was equity investment.

"The Alliance is either grossly ignorant or is deliberately trying to mislead the public as part of its ill-informed campaign against the MAI and foreign investors.

"The simple fact is that we need substantial ongoing investment if we're to have continuing solid growth in our economy to provide the jobs our young people need.

"In a country with a poor domestic savings record and a population smaller than Sydney we'll have no option but to source a significant portion of that capital from offshore."

Dr Smith said that, if the Alliance truly cared about the well-being of New Zealanders, it should stick to the facts about foreign investment:

- A United Nations report has found a third of New Zealand jobs result from foreign investment.
- Foreign firms have been found to pay their staff 28% more than the average New Zealand wage.
- Foreign investment imports knowledge, skills and new technology.

Dr Smith said Mr Wright had also placed undue emphasis on foreign companies repatriating profits.

"At the end of the day, profits earned by foreign-owned companies in New Zealand generally represent a small fraction of their investments here.

"Capital investment in employment creation, technology transfer and access to international markets are far more important issues.

"Also, corporate taxes paid by overseas companies partly offset the repatriation of profits offshore." One recent survey has suggested 90% of the value added by foreign operations here remained in New Zealand via payments such as wages and tax.
