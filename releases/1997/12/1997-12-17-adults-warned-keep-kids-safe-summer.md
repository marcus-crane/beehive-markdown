With the summer holiday period approaching, Deborah Morris, Minister of Youth Affairs, has given New Zealand adults a stern reminder that what happens to their kids is pretty much up to them.

Speaking to an audience of teenagers and adults at the ALAC-sponsored New Zealand premiere of the new Lee Tamihori movie 'The Edge', Deborah Morris told the young people in the audience "not to go over 'the edge' with alcohol this summer." But she also gave the adults a timely reminder of their responsibilities.

"We learn 10% of what we read, 15% of what we hear, but 80% of what we see and experience. Those figures demonstrate that the role of adults and what they do is much more important than what they say. What could be worse than an adult telling their kids that drink is bad then heading off and getting drunk at the pub or a friend's place?"

Deborah Morris says parents need to think about their kids' safety ahead of, not after, summer holiday parties and get-togethers that could put them at risk.

"We all say that we care for our kids, but we need to be proactive about that and plan for events, not just react when we are called to A&E or the police turn up at the door.

"We must talk to our kids about what they are up to, where they are going and what arrangements they have made. We shouldn't just be dropping our kids off at a party - out of sight, out of mind is just not good enough," said the Minister.

The movie premiere of "The Edge" was attended by the teenagers who played a part in ALAC's Where's that drink taking you campaign of TV and cinema commercials. The campaign aims to make teenagers think about the unwelcome consequences of one too many drinks: being sick, getting into fights, trouble with parents or the police, unwanted sex.

The commercials which have been playing since August around TV programmes and movies that attract a teenage audience are proving effective. Feedback shows that teenagers relate to the 'messages' and don't feel lectured to, but rather are reminded about not letting themselves get into situations where they can be harmed.

Commenting on the Where's that drink taking you campaign, Deborah Morris said it offered a very strong and realistic message to young people.

"Clearly the 'don't drink' message does not work. Already about 80% of 14-18 year olds are drinking alcohol. That's a huge proportion of young people drinking who legally shouldn't be purchasing alcohol at all.

"I don't want to remove alcohol from people's lives, I do however want to change our attitude to alcohol so that all of us respect it and know our limits," concluded Deborah Morris.
