Health Minister Bill English today announced the formation of the Health Funding Authority, which is being set up to replace the Transitional Health Authority.

"The Health Funding Authority will formally take over from the THA on 8 January next year. This is six months ahead of schedule and confirms the progress which has been made by the THA in bringing together the four regional health authorities into one agency.

"The establishment of the Authority achieves another commitment from the Coalition Agremeent, which was that by July next year there would be one funding body separate from the Ministry of Health.

"A seven-member board, chaired by Dr Graham Scott and reporting to me, will run the Authority. This replaces the four regional committees that were set up under the THA as a transition from the regional management structure.

"The Authority will work to achieve the Government's primary objective of improving health status, improve, promote and protect the public health, and to promote the independence of the people of New Zealand. It will also work to improve Maori health status so that Maori have the opportunity to enjoy the same level of health as non-Maori.

"The Government also has specific service expectations. These cover Maori health, mental health, child health, booking systems for elective surgery, community health initiatives, and service coverage.

"Ownership expectations include clear requirements regarding information disclosure, and an immediate emphasis on reducing operating costs," said Mr English.

Health Funding Authority - Crown's Objectives  
The Crown's primary objective is to improve health status, improve, promote and protect the public health, and to promote the independence of the people of New Zealand.

The Crown's objective for Maori health is to improve Maori health status so Maori will have the opportunity to enjoy the same level of health as non-Maori.

Performance Expectations  
The following performance expectations of the HFA Board flow out of the Government's broader strategic direction for the health and disability sector (outlined in Strategic Result Areas).

Service Expectations  
Maori health - contract for services which are responsive and sensitive to the cultural and social beliefs, values and practices of Iwi, hapu and Maori so that they have the opportunity to enjoy the same level of health as non-Maori

this is to include an immediate emphasis on provider development.  
Mental health - improve access to, and co-ordination of, services which contribute to a decrease in the prevalence of mental illness and which contribute to a reduction in the impact of mental disorders on consumers, their families, caregivers, and the general community

this is to include an immediate emphasis on spending the Mason money in a cost-effective way.  
Child health - improve the coverage of services, in particular through targeting those who are in need of additional services, and through identifying cost-effective services that contribute to improving the health status of children and adolescents

this is to include an immediate emphasis on the Strengthening Families strategy.  
Booking systems - ensure that booking systems operate on the basis of clinical priority assessment criteria which are progressed towards national consistency and contract for the provision of a clinically acceptable level of elective surgery on that basis.

Community health initiatives - contribute to the initiation and development of innovative arrangements across organisational boundaries that incorporate community views and bring together a range of services to meet people's needs

contract for the pilot initiatives on integrated care and build on information gained from their evaluation for further developments.  
Service Coverage - clearly articulate service coverage intentions in terms of the range and quality of services, and in terms of access to those services within the available resources, ensuring service coverage delivery, and identify and explain any changes to the service coverage

work with the Ministry of Health to improve specification of service coverage for inclusion in the 1999/00 Funding Agreement, and  
prepare a service coverage document in plain English form for publication by the beginning of 1999/00.

Ownership Expectations  
Strategic direction - ensure that the HFA's strategic direction over the next three to five years is consistent with Government's strategic direction, and that the HFA clearly articulates this direction to the public and providers.

Rationing - demonstrate a commitment to ensuring the greatest improvements in health and independence for New Zealanders by maintaining a robust cycle of assessing health need, and of analysing and prioritising the services contracted for, within appropriated funding levels.

Contracting - further develop and refine contracting methodologies, determine the purchasing approach for each type of service/population, negotiate service delivery contracts and monitor delivery against contracts.

Relationship with providers - ensure contracting arrangements are based on effective relationships, that negotiations are carried out in good faith, and that an environment of cooperation and collaboration is fostered between the HFA and providers. In addition the HFA will contribute to an environment of cooperation and collaboration between providers.

Information disclosure - provide clear medium-term purchasing intentions and share information with CHEs on the analysis of currect and future health needs, the rationing and pricing methodologies.

Financial management and financial performance - operate, and be able to assure the Government of this, a financially sound and sustainable business, within appropriated funding levels

this includes an immediate emphasis on reducing and optimising operating costs.  
Risk management - manage risk by maintaining effective and efficient risk management strategies and processes within the constraints set by the Crown, including budget and the financial operating environment.
