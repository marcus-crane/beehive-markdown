"To further enhance New Zealand relations with Asia, the Government will host a high level delegation from Sarawak, Malaysia's largest province, next week," Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Don McKinnon, said today.

The visit of the Chief Minister of Sarawak, Tan Sri Taib Mahmud, and the Minister of Tourism, Dr James Masing, coincides with Sarawak Week, a venture organised by the Chair of Malay Studies at Victoria University, with the support of the New Zealand and Sarawak Governments. Sarawak Week aims to promote closer economic relations between New Zealand and Sarawak.

Mr McKinnon, said Sarawak, a resource rich province of Malaysia, is developing at a very fast rate and offers potential opportunities for New Zealand businesses.

"We are already making a solid contribution to the State's development with New Zealanders playing an active role in many fields including education, tourism, environmental and business management," he said.

"Geographically Sarawak is well positioned for New Zealand offering close access to other ASEAN countries that we have profitable relations with."

Mr McKinnon said he welcomed further investment in New Zealand by Sarawak. Current active interests here include investments in forestry, fishing and transport.

The Chief Minister will meet with Mr McKinnon and other Ministers on Monday to discuss new potential economic linkages.

Sarawak week will involve a range of cultural and business events in Palmerston North, Christchurch and Wellington.
