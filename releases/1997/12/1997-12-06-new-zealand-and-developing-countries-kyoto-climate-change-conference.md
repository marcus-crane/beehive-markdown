New Zealand's call for the progressive inclusion of developing countries in any legally binding commitment on greenhouse gases is a long standing one, according to Environment Minister Simon Upton.

Mr Upton said that criticism by some developing countries was not unexpected but the problem couldn't be swept under the carpet.

"New Zealand is not calling on developing countries to accept legally binding commitments now," Mr Upton stressed. "We accept that developed countries must take the first step. New Zealand has already tabled a reduction target of minus 5% as a first step.

"But once these steps have been taken, we want to know that there will be a progressive widening of commitments to those developing countries that are rapidly approaching developed country living standards.

"No one expects the poorest countries in the world to do anything. But some countries that are already richer than New Zealand still consider that they're not fully developed. Singapore is the most obvious example. Other countries in the Asia Pacific region are rapidly catching up. There has to be a scheme to include them progressively."

Responding to criticism that New Zealand had created some waves at the conference, Mr Upton said that New Zealand had not gone to Kyoto to sit in the back row and utter mealy-mouthed platitudes. "We have gone to the conference with constructive solutions. We also wish to confront  
the issues directly," Mr Upton concluded.
