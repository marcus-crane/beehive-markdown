Defence has been added to the portfolios of Labour, Energy, Immigration and Business Development Minister Max Bradford.

Mr Bradford said he was pleased to keep his existing portfolios: "Major policy initiatives in all these portfolios are in an advanced stage and I want to see those through to completion.

"I am particularly pleased to take over defence. I have always believed in the need for a strong New Zealand defence force so we have the ability to participate meaningfully in mutual security relationships, particularly with Australia and the Pacific Basin countries, as well as playing our part in the United Nations peace keeping activities," Mr Bradford said.

"I look forward to working with the men and women who make up our defence forces."

Mr Bradford said he felt positive moving into the new year with the new Cabinet and Prime Minister, who have his full support.
