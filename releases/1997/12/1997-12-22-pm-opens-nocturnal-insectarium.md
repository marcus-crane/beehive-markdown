Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today opened the world's first Nocturnal Insectarium, at Nikau Gardens on the Kapiti Coast.

"This project is an innovative and exciting example of "green" tourism," Mrs Shipley said.

"New Zealand has many unique and endangered insects and invertebrates, and it is important that we do what we can to protect and preserve those species.

"Giant Wetas and Land Snails are as much a part of our environmental heritage as the Kiwi and the Kauri. For the sake of future generations of New Zealanders, we must conserve that heritage."

Jenny Shipley says it's especially pleasing to see private enterprise taking an active role in conservation, as is happening at Nikau Gardens.

"Conservation is an area where all New Zealanders can play a part and there is scope for private interests to work alongside Government in achieving goals that are important to all of us.

"This development at Nikau Gardens also shows how conservation and tourism goals can successfully be combined. New Zealand's unique native flora and fauna are a drawcard for international visitors, especially when nature is given a helping hand by skilled landscaping, as has happened in the creation of Nikau Gardens," Mrs Shipley concluded.
