From September next year, people looking for work will deal with just one agency for all their employment, income support and training needs, Employment Minister Peter McCardle said today.

He was announcing a Cabinet decision made this week to integrate, as a one-stop-shop, the present Income Support, New Zealand Employment Service and Community Employment Group by September 1998.

Cabinet also agreed to the transfer of 65% ($121 million) of the Training Opportunities Programme resource from Vote: Education to Vote: Employment.

"These announcements are first-stage decisions resulting from a comprehensive process of employment policy development which has taken place throughout the past year.

"The single highest priority of Government policy is to sustain strong economic growth as a secure basis for on-going job growth and rising living standards for all New Zealanders.

"Achieving that requires continuous emphasis on education and training to provide New Zealanders with a means to achieve their own personal goals, through employment.

"Growth and skills development create new opportunities to help unemployed people, particularly the long-term unemployed, move up from dependence on the state into a new world of opportunity, through participation in the paid workforce.

"The Government's employment objectives are to cut long-term unemployment and maximise the involvement of job seekers in suitable, part-time community work and training.

"The decision to create a single, stand-alone integrated agency increases our ability to achieve these two very important outcomes.

"Together with the planned region by region approach and the replacement of the Unemployment Benefit with a Community Wage, this Government is introducing the most comprehensive package of employment reforms ever seen in this country to provide a better deal for all New Zealanders looking for work or moving from welfare to work."

"A key purpose of the one-stop-shop is to improve the delivery of assistance and support to all working-age beneficiaries.

"This means that people looking for work will have their entire job search needs including income, employment and training referral delivered by one agency, in a personalised way.

They will no longer need to visit a number of agencies for their employment related assistance."

"It is right and sensible that we ensure the delivery of employment, training and income assistance is done in the best possible way to maximise the effectiveness of that assistance in helping each person into work.

Mr McCardle said the new stand-alone organisation will be named at a later date and will be up and running by 30 September 1998.

"In the transition to the new agency, the emphasis will be on ensuring all customers receive improved service with as little disruption as possible.

Mr McCardle said decisions about the introduction of Regional Employment Commissioners and community work and training are expected to be announced by March 1998.
