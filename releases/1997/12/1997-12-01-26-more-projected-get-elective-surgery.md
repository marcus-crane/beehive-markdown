Health Minister Bill English announced today that 26 percent more patients were expected to get elective surgery this year compared to last year.

"Figures I have been given by the Transitional Health Authority show that approximately 100,000 people are projected to get elective surgery this year through the public health service. This is equivalent to nearly the entire population of Hamilton having surgery and is a 26 percent increase over the 1996/97 year. Last year 79,200 people had publicly-funded elective surgery and the year before the figure was 77,200.

"This is a very significant increase. It is also quite different from people's perception of what is happening. People think we are doing less and less in our hospitals, but the opposite is true.

"The increase has been made possible because of the extra money the Government has provided for elective surgery through the Waiting Times Fund."

"In spite of this increase, there are still too many people waiting too long for surgery they need. I am determined that the Government will fund elective surgery as close as possible to the level that doctors agree is what people need.

"I have made a commitment to have the Booking System in place by 1 July next year so that everyone who needs surgery gets it within six months. I believe we need to spend more on elective surgery and this is the highest priority for any extra money for health," said Mr English.
