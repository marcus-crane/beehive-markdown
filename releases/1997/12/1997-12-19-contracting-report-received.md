Health Minister Bill English said today he had considered a report about contracting issues at Capital Coast Health and Health Waikato and decided that, on the basis of the information available, an independent review of the contracts in question was not required.

"The Crown Company Monitoring Advisory Unit has advised that it has not been provided with any evidence of improper, or undue and inappropriate conduct on the part of either company in relation to the relevant contracts.

"I am satisfied that the allegations have been investigated and cannot be substantiated on the information available to date. I have also been advised that the person who made the allegations has been given the opportunity to provide evidence to support his allegations and has not done so," said Mr English.
