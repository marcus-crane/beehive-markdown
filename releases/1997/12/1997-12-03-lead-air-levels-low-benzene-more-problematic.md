Associate Health Minister Hon Tuariki Delamere said today poisonous lead levels in the air have continued to drop significantly, following the switch to unleaded petrol early last year.

"But the picture for benzene and other aromatics is less clear and further investigation should produce reliable information early next year."

The information comes in a report to the Ministry of Health by the ESR.

The Minister said there remains considerable debate about the significance of benzene concentrations in the air, but the report estimates current levels may be responsible for up to three additional deaths per year from leukaemia, out of a total of about 250 deaths each year from this disease.

"The major source of benzene is from motor vehicle exhaust, though cigarettes have been shown to be the largest source of benzene exposure to people who smoke.

"Estimates of the highest annual average levels of benzene are found in parts of Christchurch (Manchester St; 5.2 g/m3, St Albans; 3.4, Riccarton Rd; 12) and Auckland (Penrose; 2.9)."

International guidelines to a safe level of benzene vary between 2.5 g/m3 and 3.24.

The Minister said several Government agencies are working on a vehicle fleet emissions control strategy, the first phase of which focuses on carbon monoxide. It is currently open for public discussion and submissions should be sent to the Ministry of Transport.
