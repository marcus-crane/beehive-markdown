The Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Don McKinnon, today paid tribute to Paul East.

"I am sorry to see my good friend Paul East leave Cabinet but that's politics and every leader must be given plenty of room to move and put their own stamp and authority on the Executive.

"Paul's talent can undoubtedly be used in a variety of fields in and outside of Parliamentary activity.

"He made a great contribution and his sense of humour around the Cabinet table will be missed".
