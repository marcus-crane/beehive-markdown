Health Minister Bill English said today the extra $200 million for health would be used to improve certainty for the public about what elective surgery they can expect from their public health services.

Commenting on Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peter's statement earlier today, Mr English said, he had been working with Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters on the issue.

"I want to be able to make it clear to people that the Government will provide a reasonable level of elective surgery regardless of their income.

"People want and deserve certainty about what their public health service will provide," Mr English said.
