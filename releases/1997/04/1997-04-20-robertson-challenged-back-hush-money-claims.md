Minister of Defence, Paul East, is challenging Labour's Ross Robertson to back up his claims in Parliament that the New Zealand Defence Force paid hush money to complainants of alleged sexual harassment.

"I have asked Mr Robertson (see letter attached) to provide me with information to support his outrageous allegations but so far I have not seen a shred of evidence. He refuses to name his informant(s), the people who supposedly offered the hush money and the names of the complainants.

"It is difficult to see how a thorough investigation into Mr Robertson's allegations can be conducted when he fails to produce any evidence to substantiate his claims.

"I can only assume that Mr Robertson has no real desire to assist the Navy and the Human Rights Commission in their investigations and is more interested in political point-scoring," said Mr East.
