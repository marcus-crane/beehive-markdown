Employment Minister Peter McCardle said today that the unemployment register drop of 5,500 during March is positive news, and consistent with expectations.

\`\`Last month's register fall is encouraging and consistent with other economic indicators, and while the register has increasing complications as one unemployment indicator, the March statistics are positive.'' he said.

\`\`While the register drop is another indication that economic activity is positive, it is critical we concentrate our employment activities on achieving better outcomes for long-term job seekers'', said Mr McCardle.

Mr McCardle said the long-term register still includes 64,902 people unemployed for over six months; a stubborn statistic which reinforces that the Government's plans to focus employment policy activities more determinedly on reducing the percentage of people out of work for a long time is the right way to go.

\`\`In the first instance I would like to see significant progress in assisting the six thousand people who have been out of work for more than four years. Behind that unacceptable statistic are real people with real employment needs.''

The Minister also said that work to develop the details of the Government's employment strategy is fully under way, with policy development due for completion by the middle of the year.
