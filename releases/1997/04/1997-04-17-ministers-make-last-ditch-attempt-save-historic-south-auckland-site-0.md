The Minister of Maori Affairs, the Hon Tau Henare, and the Minister of Conservation, the Hon Nick Smith, have agreed to jointly seek legal clarification of the issue at the heart of plans to route a sewer pipeline through a historic archaeological site in South Auckland.

"We are concerned that this important archaeological site will be destroyed by the pipeline. We are also sympathetic to Waikato Maori concerns over the inappropriateness of a major sewer line crossing a wahi tapu site. However, we are constrained in what can be done by the law."

It is proposed that the pipeline will cross the Matukutureia archaeological site on the Matukurua Stonefields, an area historically and culturally significant to local Maori. It was also recognised as nationally and internationally significant in a recent report by the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment. Watercare Services Ltd is nearing completion of the long-awaited South Western Interceptor and to expedite construction of the final 5 km it proposed to route the pipeline across part of the Ma tukutureia site.

"We have received conflicting advice whether or not Watercare Services Ltd has obtained the necessary consents. This must be clarified and we are seeking advice on how best to do this. If necessary we will to seek a declaratory judgement from the High Court to settle this matter."

"We recognise the need for proper sewerage treatment systems for the burgeoning Auckland population, but want to ensure that any construction avoids adverse impacts on cultural or environmental values."
