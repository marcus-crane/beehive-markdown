The latest round of allocations from the Government's Waiting Times Fund were announced today by Health Minister Bill English.

The 23 contracts approved in principle by Mr English today will mean a further 7,600 people on waiting lists will be offered procedures and treatments.

"A total of 239 applications worth $102,623,000 have now been contracted by the Ministry of Health. These contracts will provide an additional 65,404 treatments and assessments, which is a significant reduction to the waiting lists.

"I have been very impressed by how quickly applications have come in and been able to be approved for Waiting Times Fund money. We can now provide people with more certainty and clarity about the procedures or treatments they are waiting for," said Mr English.

A total of $130m was allocated to the Fund when it was set up on 1 July last year. A further $150m over the next three years was allocated in the Coalition Agreement.

Some of the latest applications have been approved in principle subject to final details being negotiated, in particular to ensure the procedures or treatments can be provided at a better price and delivered in a shorter timeframe. The details of the latest approvals are:
