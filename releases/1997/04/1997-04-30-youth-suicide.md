The Ministers of Health and Youth Affairs today called for government agencies, communities, parents, teachers and young people to work together to prevent youth suicides.

Health Minister Bill English and Minister of Youth Affairs Deborah Morris said: "Each youth suicide death is a tragedy. Open communication is the key to preventing these unnecessary deaths. We need better awareness of suicide signals and better co-ordination of prevention efforts if we are to save these lives.

"The Government is committed to mobilising its agencies to do what it can to reduce the youth suicide rate. However, it will take a co-ordinated approach of government agencies working with those in direct and daily contact with young people to reduce the rate," the Ministers said.

New Zealand's youth suicide rate had continued to rise according to the official 1995 figures that Mr English released today.

In 1995, 156 people between the ages of 15 and 24 committed suicide, compared to 137 the year before.

"The Ministry of Youth Affairs is leading a group of government agencies in developing a Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy. The main aim of the strategy is to co-ordinate efforts and outline practical ways to reduce the likelihood of youth suicide," the Ministers said.

"The Government has recently increased funding for youth and child mental health services highlighted in the Mason report. In May a new mental health awareness curriculum will be introduced to secondary schools.

"The Government is also funding one stop youth health shops. These centres provide a place where young people can feel comfortable to talk about their issues to health professionals and peers.

"Social Welfare, through the Community Funding Agency, has funded $3 million for a variety of youth life skills and self esteem programmes throughout the country to date this financial year.

"But these initiatives will not solve the problem on their own," the Ministers said.

"It is up to each and every one of us to open our eyes to the emotional state of our young people, to open our ears to listening to what they are really saying, and to spend time with them.

"At the same time, parents and families of young people who have committed suicide must remember that there are a multitude of complex influences on a young person. This means that no matter what a parent, family or friends did, by themselves they probably could not have prevented what happened. This is why we must implement a co-ordinated strategy on this vital issue," the Ministers said.
