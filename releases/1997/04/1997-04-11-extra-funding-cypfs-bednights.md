Roger Sowry, Minister of Social Welfare, has today announced that the Children, Young Persons and their Families Service will receive an additional $1.32 million in the current 1996/97 financial year for the purchase of out-of-family bednights.

Mr Sowry says that the extra funding is required as there has been an increase in demand for out-of-family care for children and young people who cannot be safely cared for within their families.

CYPFS contracts though the New Zealand Community Funding Agency to purchase bednights from community providers such as Barnados, Open Home Foundation and the IHC. The extra funding, approved by the Cabinet earlier this week, will enable CYPFS to purchase an additional 38,610 bednights from these providers.
