The Coalition Government's agreed position is that: "\[W]hile there is some support in the community for decriminalising cannabis, this is not an option the Government intends to pursue."

At today's meeting of the Communications Committee the cannabis issue was discussed.

Offices are advised by the Committee that further comment from Government members, especially from Ministers, on this matter will not be helpful, and that if questioned the best response is that decriminalising is not on the Government's agenda and that if pressed for their personal view to say that it is not a constructive issue to be debating at this time.
