International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith says he is \`\`extremely disappointed'' over an Australian draft assessment recommending a continuation of the ban on exports of New Zealand apples to Australia.

But, with a potential market worth millions of dollars at stake, Dr Smith is vowing to continue the fight for access and he will raise the issue with his Australian counterpart Tim Fischer during trade talks in Canberra on Wednesday.

Dr Smith's comments came after the announcement that the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service (AQIS) has formally recommended that the import ban on New Zealand apples stays in place.

A final decision on the issue will be made after a two month public consultation period.

Despite the latest setback from AQIS, Dr Smith said New Zealand's access case remained \`\`very strong''.

\`\`I am confident that our position can withstand international scrutiny. We hope to persuade AQIS to reconsider its position.

\`\`I and my officials will also be actively pressing the Australian government to reject the AQIS recommendation to continue to exclude New Zealand apples from the Australian market.''

Australia has banned imports of New Zealand apples for decades because of fears they might introduce the disease fire blight to orchards across the Tasman. New Zealand has been pushing for access since the 1920s.

Research findings by New Zealand and international experts have maintained mature apples do not carry the fire blight.

Australia is a party to the international Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures which came into effect in 1994.

The agreement states that any bans must be on good scientific grounds.

New Zealand re-applied for permission to export apples across the Tasman after the agreement came into effect.
