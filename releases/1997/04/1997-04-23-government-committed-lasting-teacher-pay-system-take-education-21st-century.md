Work towards developing an integrated teaching service and a unified pay system is designed to ensure that the teaching workforce is in the best position to respond to changes in education as we move towards the 21st Century, Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

Mr Creech is welcoming the release of the Unified Pay System Working Party's issues document.

\`\`The establishment of an integrated teaching service and a unified pay system where a teacher's pay is not determined by which sector they teach in, will be an important development for the country's education system.

\`\`We face big challenges in the future, including rising school rolls, changes to the curriculum, and the use of information technology. We have to make sure schools and teachers can respond quickly to the changes and to meet recruitment and retention needs.''

Mr Creech said the teacher unions and the Government made a commitment during the negotiations of the two employment contracts to work towards an integrated teaching service and a unified pay system.

\`\`The Government believes it is very important that education sector groups have the opportunity to develop the framework for an integrated teaching service and unified pay system. That is why we set up the unified pay system working party.

\`\`I am disappointed the secondary teachers' union the PPTA has decided to turn its back on the working group. The working party gives all education groups, including the PPTA the perfect avenue to influence the shape of the integrated teaching service and the unified pay system,'' Mr Creech said.

Mr Creech said the working group is committed to advancing the issues surrounding an integrated teaching service and unified pay system in a sound and sensible way.

\`\`I hope all in the education sector, especially secondary teachers carefully consider the issues raised in the discussion document released today.''

The next step is to work towards the more detailed and practical issues associated with the design and implementation of a Unified Pay System.

Mr Creech said there will always be differentials in teachers' pay but in future it needs to recognise such factors as qualifications, experience, job content, skills and competencies and performance and not just in which sector they teach.

\`\`I hope the work of the working party process and work from hereon can develop a framework to assist both unions and the Government resolve employment contract issues in the industrial negotiations due to start later this year.''
