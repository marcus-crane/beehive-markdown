Deborah Morris today supported the move by Roger Sowry, Minister of Social Welfare, in his announcement of an increase in funding for the purchase of out-of-family bednights.

"The funding was desperately needed, and this will be a positive move for the safety and development of young people," says Ms Morris.

"When visiting a project in Waitakere, West Auckland, last Monday, I heard first hand the difficulties and pressures facing the organisations who are caring for young people in need of out-of-family support. I hope that this increase helps move toward further supporting this vital level of care."
