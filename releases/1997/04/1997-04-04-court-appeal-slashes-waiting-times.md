The Minister for Courts, Hon D.A.M. Graham, says the number of criminal appeals awaiting hearings in the Court of Appeal dropped dramatically last year.

'There were 204 criminal appeals awaiting a hearing at the beginning of 1996,' he says.

'By 31 December the number had fallen to 131.

'Overall the average time between hearing and delivery was six days.'

Mr Graham says over the last two years, the Court of Appeal on average heard 588 criminal appeals each year.

'Despite the rising number of appeals it is pleasing to note that two thirds were finalised within 25 weeks of filing and judgment was delivered on average by the Criminal Appeals Division within six days of the actual hearing.'

Mr Graham says the courts will continue to improve the service provided to the public.
