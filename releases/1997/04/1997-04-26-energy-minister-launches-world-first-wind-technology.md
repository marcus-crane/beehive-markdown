Innovative technology is creating the potential for wind to be a competitive energy source in New Zealand, Energy Minister Max Bradford says.

Speaking at the launch of Vortec Energy's prototype wind turbine near Auckland today (subs: Saturday), Mr Bradford said the energy industry needed to explore every avenue that contributed to lower CO2 emissions.

In New Zealand, current best estimates were that wind power could be produced in the range of 6 to 8 cents per kilowatt hour, Mr Bradford said.

"But I understand it is hoped the Vortec 7 prototype turbine will demonstrate the ability of full-sized machines to produce electricity at about 4 cents per kilowatt hour."

If the turbine performed to expectation it would put wind power on a competitive footing with other forms of power generation.

"I hope, for the future of environmentally friendly and efficient energy generation in New Zealand, all those expectations are realised."

The innovative wind turbine was an example of what a competitive market and private sector can do to generate innovation, Mr Bradford said.

"Opening up energy markets to competition has led to a burst of innovation and focus which would do more for energy efficiency and conservation than 50 years of centralised Government control of the sector ever did."
