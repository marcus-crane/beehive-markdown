Energy Minister Max Bradford is going to the electricity industry to encourage initiatives which will help households reap the benefits of competition in the electricity industry.

"It is time to get among the industry players and reinforce the message that we must achieve across-the-board competition in the energy market. The onus is on power companies to make it happen," Mr Bradford said.

"Over the next few months I intend to meet with power companies to actively encourage the rapid development of new technology and other initiatives which will bring competition to all customers, not just major consumers."

Mr Bradford is to meet Tauranga-based TrustPower next week to see its new metering trials and discuss the possibilities for bringing competition to all customers. TrustPower is one of a number of energy companies investigating new technology and other initiatives.

"New metering technology is one of the keys which will open the door to competition for domestic customers," Mr Bradford said.

1997 would prove a challenging year for the electricity industry, Mr Bradford said.

"The market is still young, but there is an expectation that all consumers must start to see the benefits within the next year," Mr Bradford said.

"I want to encourage companies to actively work to that end. Ultimately, a fully functioning competitive market is in the interests of all New Zealanders - industry, businesses, households and electricity companies.

"A return to the regulatory, Government-controlled electricity environment we once had, which stifles innovation and development, will benefit no one. But unless domestic power consumers see the benefits of competition soon, the Government will come under pressure to regulate the electricity sector," Mr Bradford said.

A competitive energy market was essential to help New Zealand retain its competitive position against the rest of the world, Mr Bradford said.
