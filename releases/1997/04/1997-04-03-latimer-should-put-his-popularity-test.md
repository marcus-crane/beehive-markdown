The Minister of Maori Affairs, the Hon Tau Henare, said Maori Council chairman Sir Graham Latimer should put his theories on Maori representation in Government to the test at the next election.

Mr Henare was responding to comments made by Sir Graham about forming a new Maori political party.

"Maybe it's time for Sir Graham to come out from the behind the powerbase he has, that is the Government and self-appointed postings he holds, and put his self-appointed-spokesman-for-all-Maori role to the whim of voters in a general election," said Mr Henare.

"According to some commentators and people like Sir Graham, Maori, are not happy with the performance of this Coalition Government.

"The question of this Government's performance will be put to the voting public of New Zealand to determine at the next general election.

"Maori gave Labour well over half a century to address issues of justice and social inequities for Maori and every time the crunch came we were conveniently placed on the shelf for another election campaign.

"New Zealand First, and in particular this Coalition Government, will not need so much time, and will continue to be accountable to voters."

Mr Henare said despite Sir Graham's assertions to the contrary, there would not have been any benefits for Maori if the constituent Maori MPs remained independent.

"Sir Graham says the people are critical, not him. I say the people are watching with a keen interest and will not be overly alarmed by his and the Opposition's continued attempts to undermine me or the initiatives I expect to put in place over the coming years.

"What use would we \[constituent Maori members] have been shouting and ranting from the Opposition benches," he said.

"You just need to look at the Labour front bench to realise we wouldn't have been effective at all."

The Minister said Sir Graham had been caught in a tirade of rhetoric normally resigned to the ill-informed.
