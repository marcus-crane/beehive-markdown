International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith has strongly rejected a Labour allegation that he has acted treacherously in his response to the arrest of Dairy Board officials in London.

\`\`Labour's agriculture spokesperson Jim Sutton is making a highly partisan interpretation of my statements concerning the case so that he can score cheap political points.

\`\`I am in no way ignoring the fate of the arrested Dairy Board officials.

\`\`While I do not intend to become involved in the court case involving the six officials, I have publicly stated my concern and I am monitoring developments very closely.

\`\`I have also said I am seeking more detail about the butter matters and that if the case raises any broad trade policy issues then the government will respond.''

Dr Smith said the government was already taking a case to the World Trade Organisation over spreadable butter exports to Europe.

\`\`Where trade policy matters are involved we have clearly shown we are prepared to take a firm line,'' Dr Smith said.

The minister also pointed out that Mr Sutton appeared to have incorrectly linked the court case with the spreadable butter row when no such link had been established.
