Prime Minister Jim Bolger today confirmed that Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto will visit New Zealand on 29 and 30 April.

"I look forward to reaffirming the close ties between New Zealand and Japan during Prime Minister Hashimoto's visit" said Mr Bolger.

The last time a Japanese Head of Government came to New Zealand was former Prime Minister Miyazawa's visit in 1993.

"Our bilateral relations with Japan are of prime importance to New Zealand", the Prime Minister said. "At every level, the relationship has never been closer."

Japan is New Zealand's second largest trading partner, and a significant source of inbound tourism and foreign investment. Cultural, educational and people-to-people links with Japan have multiplied in New Zealand in recent years. More New Zealand school children now study Japanese than any other foreign language.

New Zealand also co-operates closely with Japan on regional matters, where both countries share a common interest in the stability and development of the Asia Pacific region.

During his day long official visit to Wellington Prime Minister Hashimoto's programme will include meetings with the Prime Minister, Ministers and Leader of the Opposition, an address to a state luncheon, a joint media conference, and a Ministerial Dinner at Premier House.
