Deborah Morris today announced the selection of Matthew Nippert to represent the Minister during the Youth Parliament on 26th and 27th May.

Matthew is in his first year at Victoria University, studying Commerce and Politics.

Matthew took part in the Ministers' Youth MP selection day which was held at her Out of Parliament Office on Saturday. During the selection day, participants discussed topical youth issues, heard from Margaret Austin, looked at environmental, personal and social issues, took part in a Cross City Challenge, and debated issues surrounding the Treaty of Waitangi. Finally, the participants were grilled at a press conference by TV reporters, Leigh Pearson and Sean Plunkett.

"The participants were great and were all really keen to be a Youth MP. It was good to see a healthy interest in politics and Parliament, and I was really impressed by those who attended, it was a very difficult decision to make," said Ms Morris.

Matthew now has 5 weeks to prepare himself for the Youth Parliament, and it is expected he will use this time to gather the opinion of other young people in the Wellington area. Youth MPs are being encouraged to form a support group, including the appointment of a press officer.
