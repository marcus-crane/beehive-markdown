State Owned Enterprises Minister Jenny Shipley, Forestry Minister Lockwood Smith and Environment Minister Simon Upton are today releasing material requested under the Official Information Act on Timberlands West Coast.

The Ministers have been asked for all documents, including reports, briefing papers, memos and correspondence on Timberlands West Coasts indigenous logging operations and plans.

The Ministers say the documents show Timberlands West Coast is abiding by the West Coast Accord.

The Ministers are aware of the concerns raised by protesters over rimu logging operations in the Charleston Forest. The Ministers are also aware of the arguments against re-negotiating the West Coast Accord put forward by supporters of the Accord.

The Ministers say they will give all sides of the issue due consideration.

The Accord was negotiated between the Government, conservation groups, local authorities and sawmilling interests in 1986, and resulted in the permanent protection of over 120 thousand hectares of native forest to date, while allowing the overcutting of rimu in limited areas for a specified time.
