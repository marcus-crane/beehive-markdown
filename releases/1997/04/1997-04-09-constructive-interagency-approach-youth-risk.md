The Hon Deborah Morris today stated she believes that Social Welfare, Health and Education Departments are well on the way to developing a constructive interagency approach to dealing with youth at risk.

Ms Morris recognises that issues raised in the Centre for Research Evaluation and Social Assessment report, commissioned by the Ministry of Youth Affairs, were not new and confirmed what were previously anecdotal reports.

"Coordination between government agencies is nothing new, but the Coalition Government has taken some bold steps to improve cooperation between government agencies. Unless there is cooperation, we will be unable to deliver the services that our young people need," said Ms Morris.

Departmental Chief Executives are holding regular meetings focusing on better coordination and encouraging best practice.

"The Government cannot provide prescriptive programmes to tackle this situation. Systems can't just be pushed into communities quickly, as we need local solutions to target local and individual needs. In order for this process to work , agencies must "buy" into the process, creating an organic approach, growing from the community, rather than a top down prescription." said Ms Morris.

Ms Morris concluded by saying, "On Monday I visited a project in Waitakere, West Auckland, and the leaders of that project were involved in an initiative that the local authority has taken in bringing together the three key government social services agencies. They are now looking to develop a new model of practice to ensure that young people at risk receive the services that they are entitled to. I will be continuing to push for further interagency cooperation."
