\`\`Following a long period of consultation and consideration of all the views expressed, the Government has made a decision for future schooling in the Wainono area'', Education Minister Wyatt Creech announced today.

\`\`I am well aware that the ongoing and prolonged discussion and negotiations over schooling in the Wainono area have placed a strain on the community. The time has come to resolve the matter.

\`\`Hook, Hunter and Otaio primary schools will close, and a single Wainono school retained at Makikihi school,'' Mr Creech said.

\`\`There has been a gradual but steady decline in enrolments at the schools. The decision on the future of schools in the Wainono region takes the most sensible education option.''

As at 1 March 1997 there were a total of 55 students attending the four schools. 15 at Hook, 16 at Makikihi, 13 at Hunter, 11 at Otaio.

The decision follows consultation and discussion with the community, dating back to before 1989.

In late February Mr Creech wrote to the Board of Trustees of Hook, Hunter, Makikihi and Otaio primary schools setting the process to resolve this longstanding issue by advising the Boards of possible closure.

Mr Creech said he had given full consideration of the responses from the school boards and decided the option of a school at Makikihi school is the best one.

\`\`Now the decision to close the three schools had been made the Ministry of Education will work with the schools' boards of trustees over the timing of the closures and most suitable transport arrangements for the children.''
