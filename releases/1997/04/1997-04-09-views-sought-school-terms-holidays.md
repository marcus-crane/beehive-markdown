Education Minister Wyatt Creech is encouraging schools, education groups and parents to have their say on next year's school terms and holiday dates.

Mr Creech has released a discussion paper 1998 School Terms and Holiday Dates with an accompanying Comments Sheet which proposes possible term dates for 1998.

The Minister is required by law to announce the 1998 term dates by the end of June.

\`The discussion paper is designed to canvass people's views about the proposed term dates for 1998. This year, all state schools are observing four even terms of 10 weeks. I want to know what people think about the proposal to follow the same pattern in the future, or whether it is more important for Easter to always be in the holidays.'

(If the term lengths remain an even ten weeks, every fifth year Easter would have to be in term time.)

Mr Creech said he was also seeking input on when external exams in secondary schools should begin and end, and whether primary and secondary school terms should be the same length.

\`I am particularly concerned about how external exams in secondary schools fit in with term dates. Depending on the final dates which are set for 1998 consideration is being given to starting and finishing exams a week later than usual. This would increase the examination preparation time for schools and students in the fourth term.

\`I welcome suggestions as to how the school term and holiday arrangements can be improved. The final dates, when set, impact on a lot of people, and I want a practical solution which works for schools and communities.

\`Decisions made as a result of the public submissions and consultation would set the pattern for the future and provide more certainty about the timing of school terms and holidays.'

The discussion paper is being sent to all schools and public libraries today, with responses due in to the Ministry of Education by 9 May 1997. The submissions will be considered before the final dates are set by the end of June.

Copies of the paper will be also be available from local Ministry of Education Management Centres.

The proposed term dates are as follows:  
TERM 1  
Primary  
Wednesday 28 January to Thursday 9 April (102 half-days) Secondary  
Tuesday 3 February to Thursday 9 April (94 half-days)
