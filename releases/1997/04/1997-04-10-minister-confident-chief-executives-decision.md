The Hon Deborah Morris today said she is satisfied with the steps taken by her Chief Executive, Catherine Gibson, concerning staff employment matters within the Ministry of Youth Affairs.

"Many may have been frustrated by the length of time since this issue was originally raised, but I feel confident that appropriate measures have been taken, and that correct procedures have been followed in investigating this case. It was vital to ensure that the process was fair, to the employee concerned, the Ministry and the State Sector," said Ms Morris.

"This review has been solely the responsibility of the Chief Executive of the Ministry of Youth Affairs, with support from the State Services Commission. The accountability process for employment matters is clearly set out in the State Sector Act 1988."

"Through this process, lessons have been learned, and I am confident that the Ministry, in conjunction with the State Services Commission, have ensured that improved employment procedures are now in place."

"I am satisfied this matter is now settled, and I will not be making any further comment." concluded Ms Morris.
