Winston Peters said the improvement in the merchandise trade surplus for the third quarter in a row, revealed in the release today of the Balance of Payments figures for the December quarter 1996, was very encouraging.

"The Government is keen to see this trend continue. Today's figures confirm the Government's view that the economy is on the right track."

The Treasurer also noted that the current account deficit to GDP ratio, which came in at 4.2 percent for the year, was better than market expectations.
