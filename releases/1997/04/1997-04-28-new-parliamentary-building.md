The Government has confirmed the decision to proceed with the construction of a new Parliamentary building, to the west of Parliament House.

The initial multi-party decision to go ahead with the new building was announced in February 1995, with the design released in November 1996.

Chair of the Ministerial steering group overseeing the project, Don McKinnon said the proposal for the new building had undergone further review by Cabinet and officials over the past two weeks.

The Treasurer had questions about spending on the planned building in the context of this year's Budget and requested a thorough review.

\`\`Cabinet has been advised that the savings from the alternative to the building would be unlikely to exceed $3 million. We have considered the options and weighed up the costs and benefits and decided that on balance the building should proceed.''

\`\`The proposed building is not a palace. It is not luxurious. There are no glass atriums, marble topped desks or gold plated taps. Such claims by political opponents are just grandstanding,'' Mr McKinnon said.

The building is of a functional design, with office space for 400 staff, 26 ministers, a Cabinet room and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.

The budget has been capped and indexed at $94 million, spread over five years. The cost of the building includes site preparation, demolition and construction costs, fit out and furniture and $11 million of GST.

The proposal has been reported on by Treasury on a number of occasions. In December 1994 Treasury stated that the building was the most flexible and least risky of the options being considered. In April 1996 $15 million was shaved off the price tag.

Mr McKinnon said while the cost of the building has been capped at $94 million, the Government would be keen to receive tenders that come in well below that figure. Tenders for the project will be called for by mid May.

**Background Note on New Ministerial Building**

- In 1991 it was clear there would not be enough room for MPs and more accommodation would be needed. Then the country voted for MMP, putting more pressure on the already tight office space.
- The new building was identified as the best proposal as part of a long term accommodation strategy for Parliament.
- The budget for the new building will be spread over five years and has been capped and indexed at $94 million. The figure includes, site preparation, demolition and construction costs, fit out, furniture and $11 million GST.
- At this stage in the project, $11 million has already been spent or committed, including $3 million paid to Radio New Zealand in compensation for its move to another site.
- The building is not a palace. The building is functional and designed to be flexible enough to respond to the needs of future Parliaments for at least 50 years. It has no atriums, marble topped desks, gold plated taps. In April 1996, an independent analysis was done of the project and $15 million shaved off the total costs.
- A comparison with the Majestic Centre building in Wellington show that construction costs are $2,347 per square metre compared with $2,021 at the Majestic Centre.
- Construction of the new Ministerial building is scheduled to commence in July 1997, with project completion expected in December 1999. On completion the building will house, 400 staff, including the Prime Minister's Department and Cabinet Office and 26 ministers.
