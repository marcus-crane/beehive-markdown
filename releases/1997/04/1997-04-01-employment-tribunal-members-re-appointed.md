Labour Minister Max Bradford today announced the reappointment of five Employment Tribunal members.

The members are: John Haslemore, Rosemary Monaghan, Yvonne Oldfield, Ian McAndrew and Thomas Skinner.

"The reappointment of these members will maintain the balance of expertise and experience necessary for the continued effective operation of the Employment Tribunal," Mr Bradford said.

The five members, whose warrants expired in March or are due to expire in May, have been reappointed for further one-year terms of office.
