Prime Minister Jim Bolger today announced the appointment of Anna Kominik to the position of Prime Ministerial Press Secretary.

In recent times Anna Kominik has served as a Political Reporter for Wellington Newspapers based in the Parliamentary Press Gallery. She joins the Prime Minister's Private Office staff with a substantial journalistic background including a work experience programme for INL on the New York Post.

Ms Kominik fills the position vacated last week by Therese Anders who has recently joined New Zealand Airways Corporation as Communications Manager.

The Prime Minister says he's very pleased he's been able to attract to his team the services of a practical newspaper journalist with excellent writing and communication skills.

"This is an important job that requires considerable maturity and responsibility and I know that Anna will more than fit those requirements".

Anna takes up her position in the Prime Minister's Office next Monday.
