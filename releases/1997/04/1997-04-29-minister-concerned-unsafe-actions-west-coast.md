State Owned Enterprises Minister Jenny Shipley has repeated her call for those concerned about indigenous forest logging on the West Coast to put safety first.

\`\`I am deeply concerned that an explosive was attached to a gelignite fuse found on a helicopter leased by Timberlands West Coast for its logging operations.

\`\`This incident follows hard on the heels of vandalism of other Timberlands West Coast equipment, and the firing of a flare at a helicopter while it was flying, which Native Forest Action protesters have publicly accepted responsibility for .

\`\`It's up to the Police to establish who was responsible for the latest incident, and to take the appropriate action.

\`\`I repeat my statement after the first incidents, that it is unacceptable to put lives at risk with irresponsible or illegal behaviour.

\`\`I am well aware that some people have strong feelings about the logging of indigenous timber. They have every right to express their views and the Government has never attempted to stop any peaceful and responsible protest actions.

\`\`Timberlands West Coast also has every right to go about its lawful business without its workers and contractors being put at risk by highly irresponsible actions.

\`\`The West Coast Accord was signed to secure the future of large areas of native forest as reserves, while still allowing West Coasters to have access to their resources to provide jobs. As a result 120 thousand hectares is now protected for future generations.

\`\`The West Coast Accord as it stands is a legal contract which Timberlands is obliged to abide by. Illegal and irresponsible actions will not change that.

\`\`Timberlands has consistently done everything possible to ensure the safety not only of its own contractors and workers but also the safety of other people in the area. Members of Native Forest Action and others in the forest must realise they themselves are responsible for their own safety. I urge them to put the safety of themselves and others first, \`\` Mrs Shipley concluded.
