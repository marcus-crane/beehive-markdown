Deborah Morris today welcomed the report of the Liquor Review Advisory Committee, but is concerned with several of it's recommendations.

"I support the recommendation to lower the drinking age to 18, however, I believe that there should be no exceptions to this age. Allowing the exception is likely to result in more people under the age of 18 accessing alcohol in unsafe situations.

Given the wide support, from all sectors, even those who submitted that the age remain at 20 years, it is surprising that the Committee did not recommend the introduction of a national identity card.

The exception and the failure to recommend an identity card are contrary to pleas from the Police to make enforcement of the law easier.

The Ministry of Youth Affairs and myself have consistently advocated a risk management approach to the lowering of the drinking age. This approach recognises that many young people drink now and would be better protected from harm if it was acknowledged and catered for. Instead of trying to prevent young people from drinking, we suggest that the focus be on helping young people to make healthy choices.

I support the recommendation by the Committee to establish new public health and social education programmes targeting alcohol abuse. I would also encourage expansion of existing education programmes, particularly those aimed at young people, whether or not the age is lowered," said Deborah Morris.
