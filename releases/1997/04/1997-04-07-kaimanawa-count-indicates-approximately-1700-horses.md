The Minister of Conservation Nick Smith today released the initial aerial count of the wild horse population in the Kaimanawa ranges. He emphasised that comparative analyses of counting methodologies must now take place to confirm the reliability of these initial data.

"This figure of 1700 is based on the simple count from the helicopter observers. It will now be compared using a series of alternative methods intended to provide some cross checks of the count. It is expected these results will be available towards the end of the month, then final decisions will be made about the means of managing the wild horse population."

Of the approximately 1700 horses counted in the aerial survey, around 200 were on private land adjoining the defence area. Foals made up around 13% of the total horses in the initial survey.

The government remains commited to the Kaimanawa Wild Horse Management Plan which sets a maximum sustainable horse population at 500.

"The numbers are such that significant control of the horse population will need to take place this year. Animal welfare considerations mean this must occur between May and July. My strong preference is for a muster but final decisions about the control of the horse population will be made after further consultation with interested groups and advice on the logistics of a muster operation."
