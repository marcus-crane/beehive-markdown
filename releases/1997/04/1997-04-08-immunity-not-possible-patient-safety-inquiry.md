Health Minister Bill English said today he had been advised immunity from prosecution could not be granted to people appearing before the inquiry into patient safety at Christchurch Hospital.

"It is not clear on what basis immunity is being sought, or the extent of the immunity sought. However, the Minister of Health has no power to grant immunity from civil or criminal prosecution to any person.

"I am confident that the principles of natural justice will ensure that a fair and just result is obtained for persons affected by the inquiry at Christchurch Hospital," he said. Mr English said the Health and Disability Commissioner had a range of options open to her in the exercise of her functions, but it was not appropriate for him to comment on the exercise of the Commissioner's discretion in relation to her statutory options.

Mr English also released today a copy of a letter he has sent to Labour Leader Helen Clark asking her to intervene in the campaign being conducted against the Commissioner, Robyn Stent.

"Labour's health spokesperson, Lianne Dalziel, has and is continuing to actively campaign against the Commissioner.

"Mrs Stent is conducting her inquiry under the powers given to her by Parliament. It is totally inappropriate for a member of Parliament to be attacking the Commissioner in this way.

"I have asked Helen Clark to intervene. The people of Christchurch deserve reassurance about their hospital and the best thing that can now happen is that everyone support this inquiry and allow it to proceed," said Mr English.

(attached - letter to Helen Clark)

8 April 1997

Rt Hon Helen Clark  
Leader of the Opposition  
PARLIAMENT BUILDINGS

Dear Ms Clark

I am writing to express my concern at the campaign being conducted by Labour, in particular by your health spokeswoman Lianne Dalziel, against the Health and Disability Commissioner.

The Commissioner, Mrs Robyn Stent, is an independent Statutory Officer established by Parliament. She is conducting her inquiry into patient safety at Christchurch Hospital under the powers given to her by Parliament. By continuing with its campaign against the Commissioner's inquiry, Labour is showing no respect for the intent of Parliament or the conventions of respect and dignity for Statutory Officers.

Ms Dalziel has actively campaigned against the Commissioner, initially to try and stop her carrying out an inquiry and now to try and stop her seeking to recover costs related to the High Court action. It is totally inappropriate for a member of Parliament to be attacking the Commissioner in this way. The High Court has confirmed the right of the Commissioner to carry out the inquiry and the issue of costs will similarly be dealt with by due legal processes.

As leader of the Labour Party I ask you to intervene in this matter. The people of Christchurch deserve reassurance about their hospital and the best thing that can now happen is that everyone support this inquiry and allow it to proceed.

Yours sincerely

Hon Bill English  
Minister of Health
