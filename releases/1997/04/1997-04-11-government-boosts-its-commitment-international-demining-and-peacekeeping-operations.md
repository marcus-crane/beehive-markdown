Minister of Defence, Paul East, announced today that the Government was increasing its support for international demining operations and extending New Zealands contribution to peacekeeping in the former Yugoslavia.

New Zealand Defence Force personnel are currently taking part - under the United Nations umbrella - in a demining programme in Mozambique and a peacekeeping operation in the former Yugoslavia.

The Government has agreed to extend New Zealands participation in the Mozambique demining programme until 31 January 1999 and will continue contributing six military observers and one staff officer to peacekeeping in the former Yugoslavia until 31 March 1998.

At the same time the Government has agreed to support a demining programme in Laos. New Zealand will provide a Defence Force Officer as a logistics/procurement adviser and a second officer, if required, to act as a national technical adviser for a period of two years until 30 June 1999.

"The New Zealand Government is opposed to the use of anti-personnel landmines and is determined to keep the issue at the forefront of international attention. We want a global ban and the Government will continue to work with like-minded countries towards the complete elimination of these mines.

"New Zealand is proud to have been actively engaged in mine clearance efforts by the international community over many years. We have made a significant contribution and our defence force personnel have an excellent reputation in mine clearing work. By continuing our commitment to the Mozambique programme and providing expertise to Laos we are giving our defence personnel the opportunity to build on their reputation in this area, gain further valuable professional experience and contribute in a humanitarian role to the stability of both these regions.

"Similarly by continuing our peacekeeping role in the former Yugoslavia we are contributing to the stability of that region and visibly demonstrating our commitment to the work of the United Nations," said Mr East.
