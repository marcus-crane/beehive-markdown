International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith has taken a firm line on access for New Zealand apples when he met his Australian counterpart Tim Fischer today in Canberra.

The meeting allowed the two ministers to discuss issues of mutual concern regarding the World Trade Organisation and the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum, and to focus on areas of joint activity such as the CER dialogues with the AFTA countries in South East Asia and the MERCOSUR countries in South America.

Dr Smith said he and Mr Fischer had had an \`\`excellent exchange'' on trade issues facing Australia and New Zealand.

\`\`Overall our relationship with Australia is in excellent shape. We are working well together on the international scene and throughout the region.''

The discussions provided a good opportunity to review the bilateral trading relationship ahead of the annual CER trade ministers' meeting later this year.

\`\`CER continues to deliver impressive results for both countries,'' Dr Smith said.

\`\`Both Tim Fischer and I were able to reaffirm the importance of CER. We were able to exchange letters marking the achievement of further progress towards our joint goals of establishing full free trade in services across the Tasman.''

But Dr Smith also took the opportunity to raise New Zealand's concerns over the draft Australian risk assessment which on Monday recommended a continuation of the ban on imports of New Zealand apples to Australia because of fire blight.

\`\`I raised apples in a forthright manner and put our case in full to Tim Fischer. He now has a full appreciation of our position that the science underpinning the Australian draft is in no way robust.

\`\`New Zealand's case for access is in contrast very strong. We will be commenting in detail on the Australian draft and hope these comments will be taken into account by the Australian government in reaching a final decision on apple access.

\`\`We hope that the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service will reassess the position taken in the draft and allow New Zealand apples access to the Australian market,'' Dr Smith said.

Dr Smith also planned to raise the apples issue with the Australian Agriculture Minister John Anderson during his visit.
