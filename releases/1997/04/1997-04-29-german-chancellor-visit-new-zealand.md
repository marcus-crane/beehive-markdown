Prime Minister Jim Bolger said today that German Chancellor Helmut Kohl would visit New Zealand from 7-8 May - the first visit by a German Chancellor to this country.

Receiving a world statesman of Dr Kohls standing in New Zealand will be an honour as well as an opportunity to further the excellent relations which exist between our country and Germany, Mr Bolger said.

Dr Kohl will arrive in Wellington on May 7, accompanied by his Minister for Education, Science, Research and Technology Dr Jrgen Rttgers, officials and a delegation of twelve senior German business representatives.

During his two day visit, Dr Kohl will hold talks with Mr Bolger and will participate in meetings between his business delegation and their New Zealand counterparts.

Mr Bolger will also host a state dinner in honour of the German Chancellor.

Germany is the fourth largest economy in the world and New Zealands biggest trading partner in Europe, after the United Kingdom. Its peaceful reunification in 1990 symbolised the transformation of Europe following the end of the cold war and underscored the positive role which Germany plays in European and world affairs.
