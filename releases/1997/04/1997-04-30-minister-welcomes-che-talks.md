Health Minister Bill English today welcomed the initiative of Western Bay Health and Eastbay Health to investigate ways to improve health services in their region.

"I have been advised that the two Crown health enterprises have started talks to investigate the potential benefits of their two organisations working closer together.

"The chairmen of both organisations, Avon Carpenter from Western Bay and Robin Wray from Eastbay, have indicated there are a number of options for improving health and disability support services provided in the coastal Bay of Plenty.

"I understand that the community, staff, other health care providers, the shareholders, and the funding authority will be consulted over the proposal.

"The enthusiasm and willingness of both parties to investigate ways to ensure appropriate and consistent health services are provided in the coastal Bay of Plenty is to be welcomed. This initiative is consistent with Government policy which encourages co-operation and collaboration between publicly funded health and disability providers," said Mr English.
