New Zealand's embassy in Tehran has been asked to investigate media reports that Iran has imposed a ban on imports of New Zealand goods, International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith said tonight.

\`\`New Zealand and Iran have a long-standing trade relationship and I would be very disappointed if Iran were to impose economic sanctions against us,'' Dr Smith said.

Iran's reported action came after New Zealand, along with a number of other countries, decided to withdraw its ambassador temporarily for consultation in the wake of a German court ruling implicating Iran in the murder of Kurds in Berlin. No other country was said to have been the subject of a similiar trade ban.

But Dr Smith said no formal communication had been received from Iran about a suspension of trade.

\`\`I hope cool heads will prevail. Iran is important to us and I have no doubt that our relationship with that country and Construction Jihad Minister Forouzesh in particular will enable us to work through any difficulties in a short time.''

Dr Smith noted that New Zealand had traded with Iran through good and bad times in the past and had resisted pressure to join trade sanctions against Tehran.

\`\`Successive New Zealand governments have thought it inappropriate to damage the interests of private companies in both countries. We did not believe in witholding food from the Iranian population.''

New Zealand companies trading with Iran who were concerned about the reported ban should contact the Middle East Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT), Dr Smith said.

New Zealand's exports to Iran last year were worth almost $170 million.
