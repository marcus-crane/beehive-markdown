The Government has the power to ensure consumers get a fair deal from electricity companies, Energy Minister Max Bradford said today.

"It is well within the Government's ability to control monopoly pricing by electricity companies," Mr Bradford said.

"The Alliance has made spurious claims that the Government can no longer control monopoly electricity prices because of the expiry of transitional provisions in the Electricity Act," Mr Bradford said.

"As usual the Alliance is not switched on to reality."

An active Government monitoring programme requires electricity companies to disclose information which will expose whether they are abusing their monopoly positions, Mr Bradford said.

"Domestic customers will be able to find out whether they are being treated fairly. If they do not start to see the benefits of competition soon, the Government will be under pressure to step in."

Under the Commerce Act the Government has full powers to impose price controls in markets where competition is limited and where price control is considered to be in the best interests of consumers. (mtc)

Those controls can be introduced by a straightforward Government decision and implemented by the Commerce Commission.

Contrary to Jeanette Fitzsimmons' claim, no Commerce Commission enquiry is required unless the Government requests one.
