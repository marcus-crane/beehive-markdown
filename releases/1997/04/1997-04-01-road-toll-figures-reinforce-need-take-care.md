The epidemic of road deaths must not be allowed to continue, Transport Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

Figures released today show a 20 per cent increase in the number of people killed on the roads in the first three months of this year.

The figures for the Waikato region are especially shocking. In that region, there have been 32 fatalities so far this year, compared to 12 at the same time last year - an increase of 167 per cent.

Its also worrying to see a 59 per cent increase in the number of 25-39 year olds killed on the roads. The 43 deaths in that age group is up from 27 at the same time last year.

Over the whole country 144 people have been killed on our roads, compared to 120 at the same time last year. Thats despite a low road toll over the Easter weekend, and shows that all New Zealanders must renew their efforts to drive safely.

The Coalition Government is doing what it can, through measures such as the hidden speed camera trial which includes Waikato, and the driver licensing review.

But all drivers must also keep safety in mind whenever they are behind the wheel, Mrs Shipley concluded.
