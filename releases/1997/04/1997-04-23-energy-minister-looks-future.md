Early criticism of the electricity market reforms has been proved wrong; it is time to look ahead with less cynicism and more determination, Energy Minister Max Bradford says.

"The industry should be under no illusions about the Government's determination to see small consumers get choice over their electricity supplier, and control over their power bills," Mr Bradford told the Institution of Electrical Engineers today.

"The critics said we would run out of water in our hydro lakes without Government control, but in the driest year since 1974, the South Island hydro lakes are 40 per cent fuller than they were before the 1992 winter power crisis."

Some of the credit had to go to the new wholesale market, Mr Bradford said.

Prices had mirrored lake levels and the market was producing the right economic signals, creating far greater ability for power companies to plan for and manage risk.

"The critics also said the private sector would not build new power stations in time to meet increasing demand. But new stations are being built - more efficiently and faster than they could be under Government control."

Real competition in generation was starting to emerge from private sector development, putting pressure on existing state-owned stations to become more efficient, Mr Bradford said.

"The early critics have been proved wrong. It is time to be less cynical about future developments in the industry," Mr Bradford said.

"Fifteen years ago, if someone had described today's super-hi-tech telephones people would have laughed. Yet it is a much smaller step to introduce hi-tech customer-owned electricity meters which carry out all manner of different services."

Such technology was essential to bring choice and control to all electricity consumers. There was a vast array of proposals to facilitate competition being developed by industry players, Mr Bradford said.

"However, all the technology in the world won't help when some companies persist with uncompetitive practices.

"We may need to adopt some innovative measures to overcome barriers to competition and give consumers choice and control," Mr Bradford said.
