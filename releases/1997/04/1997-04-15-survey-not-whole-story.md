The Treasurer, Hon. Winston Peters, today welcomed the results of the FPG-Westpac Household Savings Survey, saying they were good news.

However, he said the results were not the whole story.

The question is, can we voluntarily save enough to cope with changing demographic patterns? Also, where is the evidence that the savings shown up by the survey will be used for retirement income? Mr Peters said that by year 2040 there is expected to be about two working age people (or potential workers) for every superannuitant compared with five working age people we have today.

Obviously if we do nothing, we will end up needing to spend a lot more on health and New Zealand Superannuation at a time when there are fewer people of working age to pay for it.

Mr Peters said the Westpac-FPG survey provided no cause for confidence that todays voluntary savings would give everybody a comfortable retirement in the inevitable event of the current scheme being reduced in scale and generosity.

Much of the increase in household net worth came from house price increases arising from high immigration between 1994 and 1996.

Do we have a Hansel and Gretel situation where they have to eat the house?

Also the biggest leap in savings appears to have come from bank deposits.

Bank deposits are not normally used for saving for retirement and to make the situation worse, there has been a drop off in savings in unit trusts and investment funds, both long-term savings vehicles, Mr Peters said.

A real worry is that bank deposits could easily disappear through increased spending.
