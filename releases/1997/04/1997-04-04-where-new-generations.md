Hon Deborah Morris will address a luncheon of 150 Head students from Auckland secondary schools, on Monday 7th April 12.30pm. The luncheon will take place at the Kingsgate Centre, Downtown, Lower Albert Street, Auckland.

The students will have, earlier in the day, participated in a forum, organised by the Rotary Club of Auckland. The students will discuss a variety of issues that they see of relevance to young people today, and how they are going to tackle the future for the New Generations.

The Minister of Youth Affairs issued the delegates with a challenge. A challenge to participate in their local communities, to start talking and taking action for young people.

"I promise to speak out for you in Government. I promise to work to improve the image of young people in the media. I promise to listen to young people."

"These are fairly big promises for a politician to make, and these are followed by a whole range of commitments that we have already made to New Zealand, in our Coalition Agreement, between New Zealand First and National."

"So, in return for my promises, I want you to commit to do things for yourselves. I want you to go out there and lobby for what you want. This isn't a political thing, well at least not in a Party sense. This is about ensuring that we are looking after, and planning for, our future generations."
