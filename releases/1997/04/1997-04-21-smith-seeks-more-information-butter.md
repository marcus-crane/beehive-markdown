International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith is seeking more detail about the butter matters being disputed by the Dairy Board and British authorities.

\`\`If the case raises any broad trade policy issues then the government may need to respond and I have asked my officials to keep in close touch with the Dairy Board over the coming days.

\`\`I want to determine whether there are any matters where it would be appropriate for the government to be involved in sorting out our trading relationship with Britain and the EU.''

But Dr Smith said the government did not intend to become directly involved in the case of six Board officials arrested in London.

\`\`The charges relate directly to a dispute between the Board, a privately owned entity, and the UK authorities. It would be highly inappropriate for the government to interfere in the actual case before the UK courts,'' Dr Smith said.

\`\`We are of course concerned about the arrests and we will be monitoring developments closely.''
