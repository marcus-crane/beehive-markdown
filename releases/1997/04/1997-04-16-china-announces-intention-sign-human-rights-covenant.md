\`President Jiang's announcement is an encouraging indication of China's approach to human rights guarantees for all its citizens,' said Foreign Minister Don McKinnon, welcoming the announcement by Chinese President Jiang Zemin that China intends to sign the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights before the end of this year.

\`\`This Covenant, together with the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, provides the international baseline for human rights,'' the Minister said. \`\`Acceding to the Covenants is something New Zealand has been encouraging China to do for years. Such a commitment from the Government of China - on behalf of a quarter of the world's population - is a piece of good news.''

\`\`It takes China another big step forward along the way to full participation in the international community, this time in the field of human rights which has often been a contentious one for China,'' Mr McKinnon said. \`\`It also gives us cause for hope that China will in due course become party to the civil and political rights covenant.''

\`\`I am particularly pleased that the news coincides with this week's visit of the Chinese Minister of Justice, Mr Xiao Yang, to New Zealand. His visit marks a new stage of cooperation and dialogue between our two countries on legal and judicial issues in general. This is an area in which New Zealand believes that extending our contacts and improving our mutual understanding in this area can do nothing but good for the overall relationship with China.'' the Minister concluded.
