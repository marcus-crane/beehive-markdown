Transport Minister Jenny Shipley says the Governments of New Zealand and Hong Kong have agreed to further free up air services arrangements between the two parties following recent discussions.

The new arrangements significantly increase the capacity that the airlines of both parties, currently Air New Zealand and Cathay Pacific, can offer, and will allow for medium term growth in demand from consumers. It will give the designated airlines flexibility to plan ahead and make longer term commercially-based decisions.

The arrangements also give the airlines new routing opportunities via Australia.

The Minister says the opening of the new Chep Lap Kok airport in 1998 will also allow for more flexibility in the air links between New Zealand and Hong Kong.

The potential to expand air services with Hong Kong will further facilitate access to a key and growing source of tourism for New Zealand, and provide a gateway to the rest of China, post-June 1997. The airlinks should also enhance trade and business relations. It is a win-win situation for both sides, as Hong Kong enters a new era, Mrs Shipley concluded.
