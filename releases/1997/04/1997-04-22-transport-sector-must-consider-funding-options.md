\`\`The Government will next month be releasing a range of options for how New Zealand should fund and manage our roading network. The options will range from creating a new SOE to retaining the status quo'', says Transport Minister Jenny Shipley.

Speaking to a conference on land transport in Wellington, the Minister said that the Land Transport Pricing Study options document, which is to be released next month, will spell out five options.

\`\`The Coalition Agreement places considerable emphasis on the efficient management of our roading infrastructure as a strategic asset to support New Zealand's economic growth.

\`\`New Zealand's economy will have grown by 28 percent by the end of this decade if current projections are correct. Many argue that road development has not kept up with this growth.

\`\`Many submissions in the earlier stage of the Land Transport Pricing Study have said they believe if we are to design an efficient system of roading management and funding then it may well be necessary to look at existing institutional arrangements.

\`\`It seems to me the choices are quite clear. We can go for a modification of the status quo, or a mix of Local Authority Trading Enterprises (LATEs) and SOEs, or one SOE handling both state highways and local roads.

The Minister says the study raises the option of putting an end to paying for roading through rates. This issue was raised in submissions from major road users, such as the Manufacturers Federation and Federated Farmers.

\`\`Currently home and land owners pay 300 million dollars towards the roading network through rates, yet it is clear that there is a very significant variation across the country in the proportion of rates going to roading. In some rural areas 70 per cent of land rates go towards roading, while in other areas only 15 per cent of rates go to roading.

\`\`The Land Transport Pricing Study concludes that we must ensure that on various classes of road, users directly pay the proper costs for their road use.

\`\`It's fair to say that some of the options are likely to lead to an increase in road user charges and petrol tax, but the overall economic effect may well be small if we are prepared to take out the roading component of rates. These are all complex matters which must be considered and resolved later this year.

\`\`In general, New Zealanders have no regard for whether they are driving on a local road or a state highway. They simply want us to respond to their need for an efficient and effective roading network so they can go about their business with the least possible hassle, at the least possible cost.

\`\`Full details of the options, including costings, will be included in the paper being released next month. Submissions will close in mid-August so that Government can take final decisions towards the end of this year, for implementation in mid-1998. I expect everyone to go through the benefits and costs of the options before coming to a conclusion,'' Mrs Shipley concluded.
