The Coalition Government is committed to continuing its crime prevention programmes in partnership with local communities, the Prime Minister said today.

Speaking at a meeting of the Prime Ministerial Safer Community Council at Premier House, Mr Bolger said the Coalition Government fully supported the national Crime Prevention Strategy, the Crime Prevention Unit and the Safer Community Council programme it operates.

"Coalition Agreement initiatives complement the Crime Prevention Strategy, said Mr Bolger.

"In addition to areas which are already strategic priorities for the Crime Prevention Unit - such as addressing family violence and youth at risk - the needs of victims of crime are specifically addressed.

"Violence prevention and education programmes within schools and the community are supported and a more co-ordinated approach to family services is proposed.

"Other supportive proposals relate to additional police resources, consideration of alternatives to prison, and a focus on youth offending."

The Prime Minister announced that responsibility for the Crime Prevention Unit would remain with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet until the year 2000, after that its location would be further considered.

"It is clear both from reports on the Safer Community Council programme, and also from the views of those involved with individual councils, that it would be premature to move responsibility for the Crime Prevention Unit from my Department.

"Having been involved with Safer Community Councils over the last six-and-a half years I am committed to the programme and look forward to its further development."

Mr Bolger thanked all representatives from the 57 Safer Community Councils throughout New Zealand for their continuing support.

He said they were key link people between the community and the Government, and their effort and commitment was crucial to making the programme work.

"I am well satisfied that the commitment is there and so are the results, into the longer term.

"As a result of the Crime Prevention Strategy and in particular the work of Safer Community Councils there is now a changed perception of crime prevention. It is now seen as an issue which both government and the community can jointly own and address."
