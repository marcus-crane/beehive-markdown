Employment Minister Peter McCardle announced today that the appointment of Local Employment Co-ordinators is no longer restricted to government officials.

\`\`The move to allow professionals from outside the Government Service to lead the Local Employment Co-ordination Groups is a positive step towards greater community involvement and a more regionally focused approach to attacking unemployment.'' said Mr McCardle.

Local Employment Co-ordinators were established early in 1996 as part of the Government's response to the findings of the Employment Taskforce, and were appointed to facilitate improved co-ordination of local employment support services.

\`\`Currently there are 37 Local Employment Co-ordinators throughout the country, each convening a local group consisting of representatives of Government and other organisations,'' said Mr McCardle.

\`\`When the Local Employment Co-ordination initiative was implemented, it was decided that Co-ordinators should, in the initial instance, be Government officials.''

\`\`It is sensible and timely to open those co-ordination roles up to the wider community and to allow some of the talents across the country, who are not public servants, to make a contribution in the area of employment.'' said the Minister.

Mr McCardle said that the longer term vision for Employment Policy would feature a region by region approach, enabling different regions to adapt to the needs of their local labour markets and job seeker registers, and that opening up the Local Employment Co-ordinator positions was consistent with this direction.

\`\`I am convinced that broadening the pool of potential Local Employment Co-ordinators is appropriate at this time, especially as we move towards greater local control of employment resources, and the appointment of Regional Employment Commissioners later this year.'' concluded Mr McCardle.
