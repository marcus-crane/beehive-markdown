The Population Conference is a major focus of Immigration Minister Max Bradford's portfolio this year.

"It is the first time in history that New Zealanders have sat down to consider the issues of population, immigration and the wide-ranging impacts they have on our country's economy and society," Mr Bradford said.

"This conference will have far reaching implications for New Zealand so it is time to make haste slowly," Mr Bradford said.

"Solid research and good baseline information are critical to the success of the conference and will raise public understanding of immigration and population issues."

Planning and consultation were well underway for the conference, which would be held later this year, rather than next month, Mr Bradford said.

In the meantime, immigration will remain at its current level of 35,000 per year, as detailed in the Coalition Agreement.
