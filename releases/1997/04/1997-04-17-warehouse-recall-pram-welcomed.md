The Minister of Consumer Affairs, Hon Robyn McDonald today welcomed the recall by The Warehouse of the Tommee Tippee 2-way Deluxe Pram, Model H361.

"I am very pleased with the approach taken by The Warehouse in their prompt action with this product recall," said Mrs McDonald.

"The voluntary recall eventuated from a recent survey by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs of prams and strollers currently on the market following which concerns were raised about the Tommee Tippee model. Details of this model can be found in newspapers nationwide or at your local Warehouse store.

"The in-depth investigation I initiated in February on prams and strollers, and the examination of voluntary and mandatory standards for these products, is still progressing and I believe it will be another few weeks before it is finally concluded," said the Minister.
