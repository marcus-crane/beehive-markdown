\`Potent symbols of the battle against tyranny, and the part played by New Zealanders in that battle' commented Foreign Minister Don McKinnon after attending early ANZAC Day commemorations in the northern French town of Le Quesnoy and Longueval on Sunday. The commemorations were attended by the French Minister for Veterans Affairs, M. Pierre Pasquini, who accompanied Mr McKinnon throughout the day.

\`These towns are small. But they loom large in the shared history of New Zealand and France. They are a very moving reminder of the huge sacrifice made by New Zealanders in the cause of freedom in Europe' Mr McKinnon said.

\`Le Quesnoy was in fact liberated in 1918 by soldiers from the New Zealand Division which scaled the ramparts of the town using ladders' Mr McKinnon explained.

\`But young New Zealand paid a heavy price in France' Mr McKinnon said. \`Among 48,000 casualties in France and Belgium, some 12,500 New Zealanders were killed. Most lie in French soil, over 1000 in unmarked graves' Mr McKinnon continued.

\`But they are not forgotten. At Longueval M. Pasquini and I laid wreaths to honour the fallen at a memorial for those unknown soliders' Mr McKinnon said. \`We will remember them and the ties of blood which unite New Zealand and France.'
