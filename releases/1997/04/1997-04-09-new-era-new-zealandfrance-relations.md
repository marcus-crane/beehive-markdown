\`Solidly back on track' was Foreign Minister Don McKinnon's description of New Zealand's relationship with France in Paris today following discussions with his French counterpart Foreign Minister de Charette.

\`In M. de Charette's words, a \`new era' has opened in our bilateral relations' Mr McKinnon said. \`The difficulties over nuclear testing are now well behind us. We are now both focussing on what we can do bilaterally, regionally in the Pacific and internationally.'

Mr McKinnon commented that the recent visit to New Zealand by a high level economic mission from France demonstrates that there is considerable potential for increased business cooperation between French and New Zealand companies. \`We can work together both in Europe and New Zealand and with an eye to Asia' Mr McKinnon said.

The two Ministers discussed people-to-people exchanges between France and New Zealand under the framework of a working holiday scheme which the government is developing.

M. de Charette also announced his intention to visit New Zealand later in the year. \`This will be the first ever visit by a French Foreign Minister to New Zealand' Mr McKinnon said. \`He will be warmly welcomed.'

In addition to the Foreign Minister Mr McKinnon had wide ranging meetings with the French Development Cooperation Minister, Jacques Godfrain, and the Minister for Overseas Territories, Jean-Jacques de Peretti. Discussions focussed on cooperation in the Pacific. Both Ministers accepted invitations to visit New Zealand.
