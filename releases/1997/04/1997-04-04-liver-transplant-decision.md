Health Minister Bill English today welcomed the decision to provide liver transplants in New Zealand for recipients aged seven years and over.

"This is very good news for potential recipients, their families and the Auckland HealthCare professionals who prepared the bid to conduct this work.

"This contract will improve access for New Zealanders to liver transplant services. It will save people the trauma of leaving the country at a time when they are often desperately sick," Mr English said.

"The open competitive tendering process also shows the quality of the New Zealand bids and how a bid from this country was able to win over bids from overseas.

"I would also like to acknowledge the skill and professionalism of the team from Capital Coast Crown health enterprise who prepared the other New Zealand tender. They like the Auckland team put a great deal of effort into ensuring an internationally competitive bid," Mr English said.
