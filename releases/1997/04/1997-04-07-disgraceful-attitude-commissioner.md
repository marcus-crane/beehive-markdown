The atttitude of Labour's health spokesperson, Lianne Dalziel, to the Health and Disability Commissioner's inquiry in Christchurch was disgraceful and incomprehensible, Minister of Health Bill English said today.

"It is disgraceful that an independent statutory officer should be subject to such personalised, almost hysterical harrassment by a politician. No statutory officer has ever been subject to such harrassment," he said.

"Ms Dalziel and her colleagues show no respect for the intent of Parliament or the conventions of respect and dignity for statutory officers.

"Labour's attitude is incomprehensible because it is actively opposing the Commissioner flexing the muscle Parliament gave her. Labour has never explained why it so vehemently opposes Parliament's agent doing the duty Parliament gave her.

"It appears this campaign against the Commissioner is motivated by a desire to raise Ms Dalziel's profile and to express Labour's personal dislike for the Commissioner.

"The public of Christchurch deserve reassurance about their hospital. I invite Labour to support this inquiry," said Mr English.
