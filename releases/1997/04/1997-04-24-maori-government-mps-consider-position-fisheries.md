Maori MPs from both New Zealand First and National met this morning to talk through some of the issues surrounding the question of allocation of the Maori fisheries assets.

The Minister of Maori Affairs, the Hon Tau Henare, said the MPs decided to continue discussions over the next two weeks to develop a position on the allocation issue.

"It was reconfirmed that all Government Maori MPs are of the opinion that quota belonged to hapu and iwi as a treaty right," said Mr Henare.

"We're mindful of the position of urban Maori and it's an issue we'll be considering in our deliberations over the ensuing weeks."
