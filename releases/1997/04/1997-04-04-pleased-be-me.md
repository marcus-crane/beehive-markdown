Hon Deborah Morris will launch a new Family Planning Association video on Monday 7th April at 5pm. The launch will take place at Ponsonby Intermediate School, Auckland.

The video, "Pleased to be me", is aimed at helping young people develop self-esteem and communication skills. The resource gives teachers and youth workers a tool to open communication about sexuality, puberty and relationships with 11 - 13 year olds. "Pleased to be me" deals with issues like appearance, body image, relationships, peer pressure and sexuality.

Ms Morris was pleased to launch the video, which she sees as an excellent example of an early intervention programme, ensuring that young people are equipped with the information they need to make informed decisions.

"Over recent months, I have been supporting this type of approach \[early intervention] in a variety of fields. I've been promoting better education programmes and earlier intervention in the areas of alcohol, drugs, smoking and crime."

Ms Morris also discussed the issue of youth crime, lowering the legal drinking age, the media image of young people and youth participation.
