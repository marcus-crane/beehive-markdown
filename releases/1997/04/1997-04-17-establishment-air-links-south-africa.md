The Governments of New Zealand and South Africa have negotiated an air services agreement providing for the commencement of services between the two countries by New Zealand and South African airlines, Transport Minister Jenny Shipley announced today.

This is an important development in our relationship with South Africa, and will be the first bilateral treaty to be concluded between New Zealand and the new South African Government. This agreement will add real substance to the spirit of co-operation established at the Prime Ministers meeting with President Mandela in Cape Town in August 1996.

This air services agreement is also the first New Zealand will have with an African nation.

The agreement will enhance the opportunities for New Zealand and South African airlines to offer more frequent and more convenient travel options to travellers.

There has been marked growth in travel between New Zealand and South Africa in recent years, resulting from increased sporting contacts and tourism, as well as immigration.

The potential to develop air links with South Africa will facilitate access to the African continent, enhancing trade and business relations with that part of the world, Mrs Shipley said.

The arrangements which have been agreed provide for New Zealand and South African airlines to offer any number of services they wish by way of code-sharing with each other. In addition, the airlines are entitled to code-share on up to seven services per week operated by third country airlines. Each countrys airlines are also entitled to operate up to three services per week with their own aircraft.

The nature of the route suggests that the commencement of services is most likely to be by way of code-sharing.

The new air services arrangements with South Africa are consistent with the Governments policy of seeking to free-up and improve international air service linkages between New Zealand and the rest of the world. The Government is pursuing opportunities to further enhance air services arrangements with our key trade and tourism-generating markets. This will bring benefits to business and to New Zealanders travelling for personal reasons, Mrs Shipley concluded.

New Zealand currently has 30 bilateral air services agreements.
