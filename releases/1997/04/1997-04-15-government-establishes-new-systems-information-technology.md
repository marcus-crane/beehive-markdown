The Government is improving its approach to information technology, State Services Minister Jenny Shipley and Information Technology Minister Maurice Williamson said today.

The State Services Commission has asked all government departments and ministries to report to it on what they are doing to prepare their computer systems for the year 2000.

The Government has also asked for a stocktake of all information technology projects and a new system for monitoring projects. The State Services Commission is leading an inter-departmental group working on those issues.

The year 2000 presents a challenge for all IT systems, and many will need re-programming to get past the turn of the century. We want to make sure all parts of the state sector are prepared for this.

The Government also wants to ensure it gets value for money from IT developments. IT is the second most expensive resource in Government departments after staff and a major vehicle for departments ongoing search for productivity and efficiency gains.

Both the private and public sectors have encountered problems with the introduction of new technology, and this has shown there is a need for tighter scrutiny of this area. It is timely for the Government to do a stocktake, so it can ensure that all current and future IT projects are handled as wisely as possible, the Ministers said.

The InformationTechnology Policy Unit of the Ministry of Commerce has already begun to scrutinise all proposed IT projects costing more than one million dollars, on an interim basis.

The inter-departmental group led by the SSC will report back shortly on the options for setting up an ongoing co-ordination and monitoring process.
