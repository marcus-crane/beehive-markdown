$300,000 grant from New Zealand Overseas Aid will be used to help repair and rebuild schools in the Yasawa islands of Fiji following damage caused by Cyclone Gavin, Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs Simon Upton announced today.

\`\`The Yasawas were among the hardest hit islands and some village schools were almost totally destroyed,'' Mr Upton said. \`\`New Zealand has a long tradition of assisting Pacific Island countries recover after natural disasters. With basic infrastructure restored the Yasawa islanders will be able to resume their normal lives. Repairing schools will benefit children and their communities.''

Schools in Fiji rely on support from their local communities as well as central government, but money is short after Gavin caused around 25 million dollars worth of damage.

More than 800 children attend the schools in the Yasawas which New Zealand money will help repair.
