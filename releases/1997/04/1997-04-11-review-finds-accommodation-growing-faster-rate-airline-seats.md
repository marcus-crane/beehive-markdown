Tourism Minister Murray McCully says the growth of accommodation facilities in Christchurch and Queenstown at a faster rate than growth of the number of airline seats available is the main cause behind recent claims that airline capacity to New Zealand was inadequate.

Releasing a Review of Aviation Capacity by the NZ Tourism Board, Mr McCully said the situation was "a complete reversal of two years ago when there were not enough hotel beds for the number of visitors who flew to New Zealand".

"Back then, everyone was worried that we had not invested in enough visitor accommodation and in response to these concerns, a lot of capacity came on in a big hurry," he said. The Minister of Tourism sought an urgent report on airline capacity to New Zealand following claims that international visitors were prevented from visiting because of a shortage in airline seats.

"Obviously I took the concerns very seriously because we do not want to impede visitors from bringing foreign exchange into the country." Mr McCully said he also met and sought anecdotal information from the Inbound Tour Operators Council (ITOC) and the Hospitality Association of New Zealand (HANZ). "I am satisfied that they had some legitimate concerns which we need to note." The Tourism Board Review says the hotel sector responded to market signals two years ago that there were not enough beds for visitors then by increasing rooms, but that increase surpassed the airline capacity increase. Extra rooms were provided for an additional 29,000 visitors compared to a corresponding increase in airline seats of only 17,000 during the same period.

Mr McCully said cases reported to him on a lack of airline seats being available for the numbers wanting to visit here had occurred in peak season which was understandable, and could be minimised in future if the situation was closely monitored.

"The solution is to encourage charter flights during peak season," he said. "For example, during the period where there was a shortage in seats during the last Christmas-New Year holiday period, a number of airlines such as Britannia brokered charter-flights.

"I understand that everyone who applied and met the normal standards to run chartered flights was approved by the Ministry of Transport."

Mr McCully said he was not critical of Air New Zealand making its own judgement call on how many seats it would make available for tourists wanting to visit this country.

"The Government sold its interest in Air New Zealand and embarked on an aviation policy that gives little protection to the national flag carrier.

"Having sold our interest I could hardly treat Air New Zealand like a Government department and ask it to lease another aircraft to solve the problem.

"Our policy is to maximise access to the New Zealand market so international airlines can use their commercial judgement as to the level of service they provide.

"We are committed to maximising economic benefits for New Zealand by advocating liberalisation of air services, including moves to lessen barriers to competition.

"We also want to remove or reduce capacity restrictions to allow airlines to offer the amount of capacity they consider to be warranted on a commercial basis, which is a lot more liberal than many other countries", Mr McCully said.

The report says 23 airlines currently fly to New Zealand and a further seven have code-share arrangements with airlines that fly to this country.

Mr McCully said it was possible that capacity would be tight over peak periods and that the solution was to use New Zealand's liberal aviation regime to increase air capacity including charters.

"I want to assure the industry that the NZ Tourism Board will closely monitor the situation and work in with airlines, including charter operators, to ensure capacity problems are minimised," he said.
