The Government is giving schools the opportunity to sell off their surplus property and keep half of the proceeds.

"Boards of Trustees will be able to choose whether to put their share of the proceeds towards a property project at their school or to invest it," Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

"Until now, this land tended to have become frozen. It seemed to just sit there because there was no incentive for an individual school to dispose of the land. If they did all the proceeds went to the Crown and they received no benefit."

Schools can use this process to dispose of buildings or land no longer needed for educational purposes.

"Giving schools the ability to release surplus property and keep half the proceeds is a win/win arrangement for the individual school and the school system generally," said Mr Creech.

"The scheme will enable schools with surplus property to make decisions about the fate of the property and how best to invest the proceeds from any sale. It fits in with their self management opportunities."

The Minister of Education said some Boards of Trustees had already indicated an interest in such a scheme, which would be entirely voluntary.

"Before any sale is approved, the Ministry of Education must first be assured that the property is not required for the delivery of the curriculum or to meet roll growth pressures within the next ten years," said Mr Creech.

"Schools which do not have surplus property still stand to benefit. The Ministry's share of the proceeds will be ploughed back into new property projects in schools. This will speed up the provision of modern facilities to support the delivery of the curriculum."
