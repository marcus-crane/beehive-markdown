Transport Minister Jenny Shipley today announced that she has appointed Auckland lawyer Howard Keyte to the Board of the Land Transport Safety Authority.

Mr Keyte is currently Vice Chair of the Auckland Regional Services-owned Yellow Bus Company. He replaces another Auckland lawyer, David McGregor, who is stepping down after four years on the LTSA.

Mrs Shipley has also re-appointed Dunedin businesswoman Noeline Munro to the LTSA.

The Minister also today announced the appointment of Auckland businessman Douglas Hudson to the Board of Maritime Safety Authority. Mr Hudson is the Managing Director of Fullers Cruise Boats, and has lengthy experience in the maritime sector.

Mrs Shipley has also re-appointed Nicky Jenkins to the MSA.

The Minister says the safety authorities perform an important function for the transport industry and the travelling public.

"I am pleased that people of this calibre have agreed to make their experience available in the public interest."

These appointments have been agreed to by both coalition partners, National and New Zealand First.
