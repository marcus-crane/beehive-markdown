International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith has signed an Air Services Agreement with South Africa in Cape Town today.

The agreement, which makes it possible for the airlines of each country to commence services between New Zealand and South Africa, was signed for South Africa by Transport Minister Mac Maharaj.

Dr Smith, who is in South Africa on a trade mission, and New Zealand's Transport Minister Jenny Shipley hailed the agreement as a very positive development in relations between the two countries.

"It will help New Zealand build a stronger and broader relationship with the new South Africa.

"Efficient air transport links stimulate growth in two-way trade in goods and expand tourism markets. That is good for both our economies," the ministers said.

"The potential to develop air links with South Africa could also facilitate access to other parts of Africa by New Zealand business travellers and tourists." Dr Smith and Mrs Shipley noted the bilateral agreement was the first to be concluded with the new South African government and it was the first of its kind with an African nation.

The ministers noted that an air services agreement did not automatically mean the beginning of flights between the two countries.

"The agreement gives flights the go-ahead - now it'll be up to the airlines themselves to get them off the ground."
