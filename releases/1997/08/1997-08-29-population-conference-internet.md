People all over New Zealand and the world are now able to find out about the Population Conference through the Internet, Immigration Minister Max Bradford said today.

"The Population Conference on November 13 and 14 is an important event for New Zealand and New Zealanders," Mr Bradford said.

The Population Conference would be the first time New Zealanders had set out, armed with the latest research and facts about current and future demographics, to discuss the economic, social and international issues relating to population change and immigration, Mr Bradford said.

"The conference is an event which relates to all New Zealanders. We have set up a Population Conference Web Page so that as many people as possible can access the latest news and information on the conference as it develops."

A number of top specialists have been lined up to speak at the conference. Information on key speakers should be available by the end of next week.
