Agriculture, Forestry and International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith will arrive in Johannesburg on Sunday to lead the first full-scale New Zealand trade mission to South Africa since the end of apartheid.

"This mission is a response to the growing trade links between New Zealand and South Africa since the lifting of apartheid-related sanctions," Dr Smith said.

In 1993, the year New Zealand eased sanctions, exports to South Africa were valued at just over $37 million. In the 12 months till June this year they reached $71 million worth. Imports of South African goods grew from $36 million to $64 million worth.

"I'll be doing all I can on behalf of New Zealand business to further develop these trade links during my time in South Africa," Dr Smith said.

Sixteen business people are travelling to South Africa on the mission. They will receive extensive economic advice, business briefings and presentations from sector groups, as well as attending individual appointments.

The mission is mostly made up of companies selling agricultural products and technology, as well as telecommunications and other technical equipment.

These areas are ones where South Africa needs help because its development of technological expertise lagged behind the rest of the world during the period of sanctions. Members of the mission will be looking to supply consultancy services, as well as products.

Dr Smith said he will also hold a series of meetings with his agriculture, forestry and trade counterparts in the South African government.

"As major agricultural exporters, New Zealand and South Africa have a common interest in breaking down barriers to free trade in farm products. I'll be using my visit to explore further avenues for cooperation on trade issues." South Africa's bid to join the Cairns Group of leading agricultural producers will be discussed.

"We are very supportive of South Africa joining. Having South Africa aboard would strengthen the Cairns Group ahead of important World Trade Organisation negotiations on agricultural trade liberalisation in 1999," Dr Smith said.
