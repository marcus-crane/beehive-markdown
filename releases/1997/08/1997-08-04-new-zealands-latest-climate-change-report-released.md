The latest information on New Zealand's approach to the risk of climate change is now available.

"Climate Change: the New Zealand Response II", New Zealand's second National Communication under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, is now available the Minister for the Environment, Hon Simon Upton, said today.

The report contains details of New Zealand's policy approach to climate change, including the use of planted forests as carbon sinks. It provides an up-to-date inventory on New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions and removals by planted forests, information on the likely impacts of climate change on New Zealand, and a summary of New Zealand's contribution to climate change science and monitoring. The communication also provides the context for New Zealand's emissions, reviews the effectiveness of the policies implemented so far, and outlines the domestic policy issues currently under consideration.

The Second National Communication comes three years after the FCCC took effect (and the publication of New Zealand's first Communication) and a similar time before the year 2000 target date for "developed country" commitments.

"The Communication provides a timely mid-course report on New Zealand's progress towards meeting all its commitments under the FCCC," Mr Upton said. "This includes the commitment to contribute to the financial mechanism to assist developing countries in complying with their obligations. It is also a timely report with the Kyoto conference to set new legally-binding targets coming up in December. This week New Zealand officials are at a meeting in Bonn, Germany, in preparation for the December conference."

New Zealand's current commitment under the FCCC is to aim to return emissions of all greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000. New Zealand's Gross Carbon Dioxide emissions are expected to rise 22% between 1990 and 2000, but total greenhouse gas emissions (Carbon  
Dioxide, Methane and Nitrous Oxide) are expected to rise only 2% over the same period.

With respect to net emissions, the Minister stressed that New Zealand's position with respect to carbon dioxide is better expressed in terms of cumulative net emissions rather than simple net emissions.

"A 'cumulative net' emissions approach \[Journalists should refer to pages 9 and 78 for more details] compares cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide with the increase in planted forest stocks in the same timeframe," Mr Upton said.

"Climate Change: the New Zealand Response II. New Zealand's Second National Communication under the Framework Convention on Climate Change" is available available from the Ministry for the Environment at a cost of $14.95.
