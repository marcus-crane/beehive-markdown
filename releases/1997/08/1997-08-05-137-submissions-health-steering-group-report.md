Health Minister Bill English said today the Government had received 137 submissions on the Steering Group report on implementing the Coalition Agreement.

Submissions closed on Friday, but the Government would accept late submissions received by 7 August, he said.

"The submissions are now being analysed. A preliminary analysis shows that comments were received over the whole range of recommendations made by the Steering Group as wells as comment on issues not directly related to the Group's recommendations.

"The main areas of comment were about the level of funding for the sector, contracting, issues around the establishment of the single funding agency, Crown-owned provider issues, and whether boards for the funder and providers should be appointed or elected.

"The process from here is that an analysis of submissions will be prepared for the Government to consider. Following that, final decisions will be made regarding the implementation of the Steering Group report.

"In the seven months that I have been Health Minister we have made real progress towards implementing the Coalition Agreement on Health.

"We have implemented the policy of free GP visits and prescriptions for children under six successfully and on time. The Transitional Health Authority took over the functions of the four regional health authorities, as planned, on 1 July. In the Budget, hospital part-charges were abolished and health was allocated roughly the additional funding laid out in the Coalition Agreement.

"The Steering Group report was completed on time. The process of making the Crown health enterprises non-profit organisations is on track to be completed by 1 July next year.

"I am very pleased with this progress. These policies have been welcomed in the health sector and have represented real opportunities to build a better public health system," said Mr English.
