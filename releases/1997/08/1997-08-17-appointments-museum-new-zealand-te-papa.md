TONGAREWA BOARD ANNOUNCED  
Hon Christine Fletcher, the Minister of Cultural Affairs, announced today that the Governor-General has re-appointed Sir Hamish Hay and appointed Mrs Rosalind Burdon as members of the Board of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. Sir Hamish has been reappointed for a nine month term of office expiring on 31 March 1998 and Mrs Rosalind Burdon for a term of two years and three months commencing after the retirement of Sir Hamish on the Board.

"The contribution of Sir Hamish over the last five years has been highly regarded, both as the Boards initial Chair and then as a member. Sir Hamish has brought valuable expertise to the Museum during the difficult stages of establishing the new institution. I considered it important that his experience was not lost to the Board, so I am pleased he has agreed to continue to serve on the Board until after the opening of the Museum in February 1998'' said the Minister.

She went on to say \`\`I am equally pleased that Mrs Burdon has agreed to fill the vacancy provided by Sir Hamish's retirement from the Board in March next year. Mrs Burdon has an extensive knowledge of New Zealand arts, an ability to effectively promote these interests and extensive experience on a range of boards, including being the current Chair of the Christchurch Arts Festival. She will be a valuable member of the Board during the Museum's first years of operation''.

The Museum is nearing the end of an intensive establishment phase. The major tasks confronting the Board at the present time are the completion of the exhibitions in the new Museum building in preparation for the opening early next year, and continuing to seek sponsorship to meet its fundraising targets. After the new building opens on the Wellington waterfront the Museum will be fully operational and the Board will enter a challanging new phase.
