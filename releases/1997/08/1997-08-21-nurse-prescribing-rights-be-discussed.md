Health groups are being asked for their views on the circumstances in which nurses could be given the right to prescribe drugs, Health Minister Bill English said today.

"The possibility of extending limited prescribing rights to nurses and other health professionals has been discussed for many years.

"I am strongly supportive of the idea because I believe it would bring some real benefits for the public.

"For instance, giving nurses some rights to prescribe drugs could improve care for patients in isolated communities and where there are transport difficulties. Equally, it could provide more flexibility within the system in the same way that many GPs now work with practice nurses to provide a more effective and efficient service for their patients.

"But there are also quality and safety issues associated with doing this, so there needs to be wide discussion about all the issues before a decision is made," he said.

In January Mr English agreed to set up a working group to advise the Director-General of Health on the safety, education and other relevant issues which would need to be resolved before nurses could be given limited prescribing rights.

The group's draft discussion paper is now being circulated within the sector for comment. A final discussion paper, which will be circulated to a wide group of health professional organisations and consumer groups, will be provided to the Director-General of Health by October this year.

Issues discussed in the draft paper include:

what form limited prescribing rights might take  
which prescription medicines nurses could prescribe  
the competencies required by nurses to safely prescribe these medicines  
the education and experience needed  
the review and monitoring mechanisms needed.
