Health Minister Bill English today acknowledged the work of former Labour health spokeswoman Lianne Dalziel.

"Lianne and I had our disputes. But there is no doubt that she had a wide knowledge of the health sector and a commitment to it.

"Her replacement, Annette King, is going to have to work pretty hard to show she has a similar level of commitment to the sector.

"It is easy in an area like health to focus on the ambulance-chasing stories. It is much harder to actually understand the sector and understand the complexities within it.

"There is a growing consensus view in health on the direction of the public health sector. The challenge for any spokesperson is to steer a path through the political agendas, which exist in health as much as anywhere else, and get to the heart of what the issues are.

"There are 60,000 health professionals in New Zealand who get on with the job of providing services every day. It is easy to lose sight of that and focus on the negative issues," said Mr English.
