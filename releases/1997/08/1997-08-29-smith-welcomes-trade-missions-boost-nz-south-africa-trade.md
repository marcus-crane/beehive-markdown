Exports to South Africa are set to receive a substantial boost as a result of a visit by a New Zealand trade mission, International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith announced today.

In an interim report, the delegation's business leader Bill Gallagher said that extra annual export trade worth between $7 million and $10 million could stem from the visit.

"Even a $7 million increase would represent a 10% increase in our annual exports to South Africa," said Dr Smith, who led the mission to South Africa last week.

"The object of the mission was to kickstart a major expansion in two-way trade. So it's very pleasing to hear that substantial headway has been made towards that goal.

"The anticipated rise is mainly in exports of manufactured products, meaning the increased export trade in this sector could be as high as 25%." One telecommunications firm in particular -- Exicom Technologies -- was expecting to double its $3 million worth of annual exports in the next year or so.

But Dr Smith said all 16 delegates on the mission had reported good prospects and opportunities to establish new business or expand existing trade.

"A few have also reported prospects in other African countries serviced by South Africa."
