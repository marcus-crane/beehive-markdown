New Zealand computer company PC Direct has confirmed a major sponsorship agreement with Team New Zealand for the  
defence of the America's Cup.

Opening PC Direct's new Direct Support Centre in Albany today, Minister for Information Technology Maurice Williamson praised PC Direct's sponsorship of Team New Zealand and the company's strong emphasis on customer focus.

"The Information Revolution is creating immense opportunities and PC Direct can justly reflect on its substantial contribution to the information technology sector which in turn is putting New Zealand in the foreground of the future.

"Innovation is certainly no stranger to this company, so it came as no surprise to learn Team New Zealand had chosen PC Direct to be the official supplier of personal computers for the Cup Defence in the year 2000.

"I know Sir Peter Blake is thrilled to have a local company supplying the leading edge information technology to Team New Zealand and I wish PC Direct fair sailing for the Cup Defence Project and ongoing market growth both here and in Australia," Mr Williamson said.
