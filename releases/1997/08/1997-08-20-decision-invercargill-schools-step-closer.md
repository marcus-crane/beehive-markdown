The Minister of Education has taken the next step towards settling the future of secondary schooling in south and east Invercargill.

""I have written to the boards of trustees of Cargill and Kingswell High Schools to tell them that, based on information I have received to date, I am satisfied that each school should be closed," Mr Creech said.

As required by the Education Act 1989 the schools have 28 days to respond with any further arguments for staying open.

"The schools currently have room for about 800 more students than required. The over capacity will get worse as the trend of falling enrolments continues with Invercargill's decline in population.

"It has taken a long time to reach this point," said Mr Creech. "The Ministry of Education began working with schools in south and east Invercargill in 1995, in the hope of reaching a local solution to the problem of excess school accommodation in the area.

'I have carefully considered all the information provided to me about the possible closure of the schools."

Mr Creech said the boards now have a further opportunity to provide him with any additional views or comments they may have about the proposed closures.

"I expect to make a final decision as soon as possible after the boards have responded to this invitation. There has been a long period of uncertainty for students, parents and teachers in Invercargill and I want to end this at the earliest practicable time.

"If my final decision is that both Cargill and Kingswell should close, I would then go on to consider the alternative proposal for the provision of education in the area and would inform the community of this immediately," concluded Mr Creech.
