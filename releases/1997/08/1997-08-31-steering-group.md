Health Minister Bill English today announced the results of the consultation group formed to examine the Coalition Agreement on health.

"The Steering Group was diverse in its membership and yet surprisingly unanimous its findings. It included 13 people drawn from across the health sector.

"The Steering Group has endorsed the Coalition Government's move to encourage greater cooperation and better relationships between players in the health sector and a focus on improved health.

"The group acknowledged rationing of services will always be necessary in the public health system and argued for rationing decisions to be made more transparent. It also urged evolutionary change in the sector to minimise costs, disruption and uncertainty," Mr English said.

"The Government has endorsed the Steering Group's report and made some early decisions where legislative change is needed. These changes will be set in place during the first half of 1998," he said.

"The Government has decided to implement the Steering Group's report as follows:

the single organisation established to fund health services will fund the best mix of health services to maximise health within available resources (transition already underway with establishment of the Transitional Health Authority to replace the four RHAs)  
the Funder will be a Crown entity with a Board appointed by the Minister of Health  
the legislation will include a provision to appoint a Commissioner to run the Funder in the case of significant failure  
Public hospitals (and associated community services) will become not-for-profit companies with Boards appointed by the Ministers of Health and Finance  
Public hospitals (and associated community services) will provide a range of services agreed with the Funder.  
"The Government will be giving further consideration to a number of issues that are unlikely to need legislative change:

ways to ensure the Funder can be effectively held to account  
roles and responsibilities of the Ministry of Health and the Funder (to minimise duplication and bureaucracy)  
how to improve cooperation and information sharing among the 23 organisations running our public hospitals and community services.  
"In health we have met every deadline set in the Coalition Agreement to-date. The Steering Group report and the subsequent 157 submissions on it, enable us to now get on with the rest of the work," Mr English said.
