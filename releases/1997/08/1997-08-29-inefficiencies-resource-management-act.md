The Minister for the Environment, Simon Upton, warned today that the commitment to better environmental outcomes could well be lost sight of because of an increasingly restive debate about inefficiencies in the Resource Management Act and some "wilfully silly practices and rules" instituted in its name.

He told a Resource Management Law Association conference in Queenstown that unless communities whom the Act was supposed to serve could make sense of it, "we risk undermining an act that could provide us with a unique way to sustain our environment and our competitive  
trading position as a clean source of food and other products."

Widely different approaches to the Act by councils raised barriers to consistent implementation and were a major hidden cause of frustration to resource users who were happy to embrace its environmental goals, he said.

"The environmental effects of changing resource use are, of course, a legitimate matter for enquiry," he said. "But dressing up prejudices about particular uses in environmental garb, and claiming that some are 'inefficient' goes beyond the competence of even the most well-informed  
council.

"Neither governments nor councils have the information to make these assessments - particularly when rapidly changing technologies and environmental practices can render planning wisdom obsolete with breath-taking speed.

"Councils should, in my view, resist the temptation to pronounce on the efficiency of any particular resource use. Their business is with the effects of any propose use."

Mr Upton said reference in the Act to "the efficient use and development of natural and physical resources" had been designed to limit excess regulation but was in practice being used to generate more rules.

Mr Upton said bringing together 50 odd statutes into the Resource Management Act had generated some efficiencies by creating a more integrated, rational, and coherent statutory regime.

"However, if you believe many of the letters that land on my desk, far from creating the streamlined system its architect's envisaged, the RMA has resulted in near paralysis.

"Such claims are, in my experience, extreme but not wholly inaccurate. Even accounting for the fact that we are still in a transistionary phase reality is falling well short of expectations."

Mr Upton made four observations based on the feedback he was getting:

There was unquestionably a lack of clear standards and guidelines which could guarantee the protection of the environment and on which resource users could rely.

The requirement for consultation was often identified as a contribution to inefficiency yet recent experiences with regulatory controls imposed on landowners with inadequate consultation proved precisely the opposite. Consultation before rules were put in place provided one of the greatest potential opportunities for making progress.

There were still far too many rules being proposed that had absolutely no plausible foundation in the RMA and had nothing to do with environmental effects. He cited the Ashburton plan which gave a "mind-numbingly detailed prescription for protecting retailers in the central  
business district."

Many councils were taking an "incredibly cautious approach." Environmental. Management was largely about risk management. "Councils are able to be as risk averse as they like but the consequence of extreme risk averseness is that the status quo prevails over innovation and change - even change for the better."
