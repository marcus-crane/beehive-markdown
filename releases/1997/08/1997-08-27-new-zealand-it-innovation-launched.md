Minister for Information Technology Hon Maurice Williamson has today launched New Zealand's first internet - based educational interactive revision programme.

Passing Potential has been produced by Textus Publishing, a New Zealand based company specialising in the design of  
interactive software for use in revision and tutoring on the internet.

"The launch of Passing Potential represents a great step for New Zealand students gaining access to the IT tools necessary for the Knowledge Society," said the Minister.

"I believe the greatest impact Information Technology is going to make on society will be in education and it is vital that our future 'education resource' contains tools that are interactive rather than passive.

"Today education is taking place for people where, when and how they wish to learn," said Mr Williamson.
