Prime Minister Jim Bolger will visit Tonga, Niue and Samoa in late August.

"New Zealand has very close and friendly links with these countries and it's important that we keep in touch on a regular basis," Mr Bolger said.

"I look forward to talking with the three leaders about issues of common interest."

During his four day visit to the Pacific Isalnds, the Prime Minister will visit New Zealand-funded development assistance projects and discuss development priorities. In Samoa, he will also take part in a ceremony to mark the 35th anniversary of the Treaty of Friendship between New Zealand and Samoa.

The Prime Minister will also discuss regional issues likely to be taken up at the annual South Pacific Forum Heads of Government Meeting, to be held in Rarotonga in September.
