Education Minister Wyatt Creech said Government decisions had not been made about proposals that might be included in the upcoming review of tertiary education.

"A draft report released today has not even been to Ministers. It is an officials draft paper which canvasses some issues facing tertiary education.

"The emotive comments and reaction following the release of the draft officials paper are premature and misleading. I am very concerned at the manipulation of the issues by those who have chosen to leak selected items in order to try to push an agenda," Mr Creech said.

"The Government wants a full public discussion on all the options that might contribute to better educational outcomes in the tertiary area. We will pull all the issues together in the form of a green paper. The green paper will be released for full public consultation and submission.

"Final decisions will only be made once full consultation has taken place."

The Coalition Agreement committed the Government to a comprehensive review of tertiary education.

"New Zealand needs to ensure that the tertiary education system is in the best shape to meet the demands of the future and to encourage increased student participation."

Mr Creech said proposals in the draft paper were nowhere near as radical as some critics were suggesting.

"Many of the comments have been blatantly self serving.

"There is already competition in tertiary institutions. There is also currently a form of entitlement system operating in tertiary institutions. The funding follows the student. The entitlement proposal may have different incentive effects, but would not introduce competition in a way that the 1989 reforms has not already facilitated."

Mr Creech said the Ministry of Education in its approach to the Green paper has run a reasonably open process. It has met with a wide range of people and groups with an interest in tertiary education and has heard a wide range of views on the issues involved and how they might be approached.

**Attached Question and Answers Regarding the Tertiary Review**  
Q. Why have a tertiary review?

A. The present system was largely designed nearly 10 years ago. As we move into the next century it is important to assess the challenges that lie ahead and the extent to which any of the current policies need amending.

Q. What are the objectives of the review?

A. We want a world class system that delivers highly skilled New Zealanders and where barriers to participation are minimised. The Government wants to see New Zealanders encouraged to keep investing in developing their skills and a highly responsive high quality sector that offers students choices that meet their needs. There should also be cost effective management by tertiary institutions.

Q. Are you looking for a competitive model?

A. The reality is that we already have competition - both at home and increasingly from overseas. Such competition will increase over the next 10 years. Why shouldn't New Zealand students have a wide choice of learning opportunities available to them? Education is now a lifelong thing. We have a very diverse range of students with a very wide range of interests and needs and employers who will want to see their staff develop skills in a wide range of areas.

We are now in a world where a student has the opportunity to access a range of providers e.g. Distance learning. We have polytechs, universities, and Private Training Establishments providing an ever increasing choice.

Q. Is it being proposed to adopt the Health model?

A. No.

Q. Are you going to propose a voucher system?

A. First the present Equivalent Fulltime Tertiary Student (EFTS) system and the study right policy is an entitlement based approach. While it is acknowledged as substantial improvement over the previous systems a number of criticisms have been made of it suggesting that scope for improvements exists. For example, it is time based in a world where we are more concerned about the knowledge and skills that someone acquires rather than the time they have spent studying.

Officials will look at a range of possible options. The public will be consulted fully about any change.

Q. Are you looking to a commercial model for tertiary institutions

A. No. Universities are not businesses. They are not and should not be profit driven. They should though operate in a manner that makes them accountable for the quality of the education opportunities they provides our students and for the research they undertakes. There should be high degree of financial accountability for the large sums (over $1 billion) of money the Government spends.

Q. Will this mean higher fees and reduced participation?

A. The objective is to provide affordable opportunities for all New Zealanders to access a quality tertiary education. We want as many people as possible to take part in tertiary study and training. Ultimately the Government will strike a balance between the subsidies it provides students and its approach to student income support. -i.e. its allowances and loans policy.
