A new education service and web site on global issues is being launched next Tuesday (5 August) by Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Upton.

The new services are part of the non-profit independent Development Resource Centre.

"These facilities will help New Zealanders gain a better understanding of the issues confronting developing countries and their relationship with countries like New Zealand," Mr Upton said.

"All too often the concerns of the developed world dominate our news and thoughts. The Development Resource Centre is working to redress the balance."

The Centre provides information and seminars about issues such as sustainable development, developing countries and human rights and is funded by a number of non-governmental organisations and individuals.

It has recently received funding from New Zealand's official aid programme.

"This support has enabled the DRC to improve technologically, and to develop new education services aimed at schools, teachers and New Zealanders working in developing countries," said Jonquil Brooks, DRC Director.

The DRC offers a comprehensive library and electronic information service, a Directory of New Zealand Aid and Development Organisations and courses and seminars for teachers, businesses, consultants and interested individuals.

The Development Resource Centre is open every weekday. It is on Level 6 of Rossmore House, 123 Molesworth Street, Wellington, ph (04) 472 9549, fax 472 3622, e-mail drc@apc.org.nz.

The launch of the DRC's education service and web site takes place at 4.30pm on Tuesday August 5. The Web site address is:
