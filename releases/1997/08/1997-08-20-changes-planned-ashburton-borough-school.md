The Education Minister has approved Ashburton Borough School's application to provide Year 7 and Year 8 (Form One and Two) classes.

The primary school will be able to offer the additional classes to students from the start of the 1998 school year.

"I realise that there are strong views about whether the school should be able to teach Year 7 and 8 students. In making this decision I have carefully weighed all the arguments and believe the change is in the best interests of the community," Mr Creech said.

Mr Creech said he had noted the strong support from the Ashburton Borough School parent community for the school to offer the additional classes.

"Given the size of Ashburton Intermediate school I am confident that the change will have little effect on that school.

"During this first phase of the current review there has been extensive consultation with the local community about the best way forward for the provision of education in the Ashburton region.

"There is further potential for improvements to the way education is delivered in the Ashburton area to benefit students and to ensure a more effective use of resources," Mr Creech said. "The Ashburton Borough decision can be seen as a catalyst for these further developments. "

The Ministry of Education and the local steering committee will now continue with the wider review of the provision of education in the region.
