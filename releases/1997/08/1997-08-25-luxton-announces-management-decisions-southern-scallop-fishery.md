The Minister of Fisheries, the Hon John Luxton, made decisions regarding the management arrangements for the 1997-98 commercial southern scallop and Nelson/Marlborough dredge oyster fisheries recently.

The open season for the Southern Scallop Fishery will run from Sunday 24 August 1997 to Thursday 18 December 1997. Commercial scallop fishing will be able to occur at anytime during this period, apart from any Friday or Saturday when beds are rested. The actual start of commercial fishing will depend on the quality of scallops which is being monitored by industry. The recreational season will continue to run from 15 July to 14 February of the following year, with a daily quota of 50 scallops per person.

This year the Nelson/Marlborough dredge oyster season will be split into two phases. The first will start on 1 October 1997 and continue until the end of the scallop season (18 December 1997).The second phase will be from 1 March 1998 to 31 August 1998. All catches will be counted against the Total Allowable Commercial Catch (TACC), which will remain at 505 tonnes (greenweight). Recreational fishers will continue to enjoy a year round fishery and a daily quota of 50 dredge oysters per person.

The overlap of the commercial seasons for the two fisheries will allow for considerable rationalisation of harvesting. It will lead to less dredging time overall, and ensure that scallops seeded in early 1998 are not subsequently disturbed by oyster dredges used by oyster fishers.

The southern scallop fishery is supported by a rotational fishing and enhancement regime in Golden Bay. This arrangement provides for the sustainable utilisation of the fishery as required under the Fisheries Act 1996. This year the rotationally open areas are to be Area C (Golden Bay) and Areas E and I (Tasman Bay). Internal industry arrangements will ensure that dredge oyster fishing only occurs in Areas C, E and I for the 1 October to 18 December 1997 period.

The Minister of Fisheries has also decided to allow a limited scallop harvest from Area B (Golden Bay) of 39.6 tonnes (meatweight). Area B was successfully seeded with scallops in 1996 and many of these scallops have already grown to harvestable size. Also there has been an additional natural settlement of scallops in this area during 1997. The limited harvest is intended to have the effect of reducing the density of larger scallops to allow the younger scallops to grow through to legal size next year, and to produce high meat yields. More.... Mr Luxton emphasised that the decision to open Area B is based on the need to provide for the sustainable utilisation of the fishery, after considering relevant factors such as the current distribution of scallops in the Bay. The actual rotational arrangements will continue to be based on a three year cycle in this fishery, as modified by any relevant factors pertaining to any particular year. This system has been in place since 1989 and the decision is a continuation of that approach.

The Minister noted that recreational fishers will have access to scallops in all of Area B throughout the recreational season, as well as sole access to Area C for the first two months. In addition, the latest biomass survey results indicate that there is a substantial patch of scallops in Area C that are not expected to reach the legal size until the end of the year. These scallops should therefore be able to support a recreational fishery in Area C for the remainder of the 1997-98 season after commercial fishing has ceased.

The Marlborough Sounds has yet to be fully included into a rotational fishing and enhancement programme, and therefore a catch limit is required to ensure the sustainable utilisation of the scallop fishery. The commercial catch limit at 57.5 tonnes (meatweight), on the basis of results from a biomass survey. It should also be noted that the commercial sector have also agreed to voluntarily close Waitata Bay (Pelorus Sound) and all of the Bay of Many Coves (Queen Charlotte Sound).

The Minister has decided to retain the existing TACC of 720 tonnes (meatweight) for the 1997 fishery. The rotational fishing arrangements, in combination with the two catch limits for Area B and the Marlborough Sounds, mean that the TACC has less relevance in this fishery than in others. In addition, actual catch levels are difficult to predict due to seasonal variations in both scallop meat yield and survival rates. For this reason the Minister agreed to continue with an industry lease back arrangement, whereby quota is made available to fishers as dictated by in-season fishery performance within the open areas.

"The management decisions outlined above have been made after considering the views of all stakeholders in the two fisheries, and of tangata whenua. The consultation process that has been followed this year is the first for these fisheries that has had to conform with the Fisheries Act 1996. I have been heartened by the level of co-operation between interests in this fishery, and would like to acknowledge the efforts of the Challenger Scallop Enhancement Company Ltd, the Challenger Scallop and Dredge Oyster Recreational Advisory Committee, the Top of the South 8-Iwi Fisheries Consultative Committee and the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society in reaching such a high level of consensus over management proposals.

"This level of co-operation is precisely what is required to assist in the sustainable utilisation of our fisheries resources." Mr Luxton concluded.
