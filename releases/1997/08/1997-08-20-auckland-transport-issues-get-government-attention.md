"Auckland clearly needs major new investment in its transport network, including another harbour crossing and improvements to other key motorway linkages," Transport Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

Mrs Shipley this morning toured the city's main thoroughfares to get a first hand impression of Auckland's rush hour conditions.

"It is clear that traffic congestion is an issue for Auckland. The city's local authorities have been working with the Ministry of Transport on the best options for tackling these issues. Auckland's problems will be solved by a combination of attention to practical changes in behaviour, strategic planning of new infrastructural investment,and decisions that will be taken as a result of the Land Transport Pricing Study.

"The Government through the Land Transport Pricing Study is looking at the whole issue of how roads should be funded and managed in the future. This three year study will be concluded by the end of the year, and we will then be able to look at how best to provide for Auckland's needs.

"Auckland people must accept that part of the answer lies in their own hands. Those frustrated by congestion should give serious consideration to whether they can help themselves by using public transport, car pooling, or travelling at a different time of day.

"There is no single answer to traffic congestion. New Zealanders' ongoing passion for their cars has seen the number of vehicles on our roads increasing by 3.9 per cent each year , with the number of vehicles on Auckland roads up eight per cent.

"We must work together on a range of measures," Mrs Shipley concluded.
