New Zealand will host two further meetings aimed at resolving the Bougainville dispute, Foreign Minister Don McKinnon announced in Port Moresby today.

The decision to host the talks followed a request from Prime Minister Skate.

"I have been very impressed with the positive approach taken by Mr Skate, Bougainville Minister Akoitai, Foreign Minister Genia and other senior ministers," said Mr McKinnon.

"Our willingness to help where we can is well-known and I was very happy to agree to Mr Skate's proposal."

The next meeting would bring together senior officials from the PNG Government, the Bougainville Transitional Government, Bougainville Revolutionary Army and Bougainville Interim Government. It was likely to take place before the end of September. Mr McKinnon confirmed the meeting would be held at Burnham Camp.

The main aim of the talks would be to prepare for a meeting of political leaders - also to be held in New Zealand later this year.

Mr McKinnon will have the opportunity of further discussions with key players when he visits Bougainville on Friday. He returns to New Zealand on Saturday.
