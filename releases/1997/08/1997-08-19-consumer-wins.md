Another win for the consumer is how Minister for Communications Maurice Williamson described the new SmarTel Phone Card at its launch in Wellington earlier today

"The consumer is winning by call savings delivered through the card which reduces phone rates by up to 60% depending on the phone used and the time of day," the Minister said.

"This is an information technology product that has a dynamic future in the retail and business sector.

"We have today added another dimension to deregulation within the telecommunications industry and I predict in the near future greater access to an increasingly wide range of products.

"These 'next generation' phone cards can be used from approximately one million phones in New Zealand and more than 100 million phones around the world. This is opposed to the relatively small number of public phone card call boxes for the older style product," Mr Williamson said.
