The deadline for people to have their say on the future of the country's qualifications policy has been extended, Education Minister Wyatt Creech announced today.

The consultation green paper setting out proposals to advance New Zealand's qualifications into the 21st Century was released early in June with submissions due to close on September 1 1997.

"The Government is now preparing the next consultation green paper reviewing tertiary education, which will be released in the next month. The submissions on the qualifications green paper will be extended four weeks from the release of the tertiary review document.

"There is a degree of overlap between the two. The qualifications paper sets out criteria and processes for recognising qualifications quality. The tertiary review will extend the approach to the quality of teaching and provision of the qualifications." Mr Creech said the extended submission time will ensure an informed response to the qualifications green paper.

A revised date for submissions will be announced once the tertiary review green paper is released.
