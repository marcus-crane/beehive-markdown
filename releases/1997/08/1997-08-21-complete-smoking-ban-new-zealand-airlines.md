Transport Minister Jenny Shipley has taken the necessary steps to ban smoking on flights by New Zealand airlines to and from Japan and Korea, with effect from 1 November 1997.

"This will mean we will soon have a comprehensive smoking ban on all services by New Zealand airlines," Mrs Shipley said.

All other routes operated by New Zealand international airlines have been non-smoking since 1 January 1997.

"Passengers and crew are likely to notice an improved atmosphere with the absence of tobacco smoke. The effects of smoking are that much more unpleasant in the confined area of an aircraft."

"This decision means New Zealand will be in compliance with moves by the World Health Organisation and the International Civil Aviation Organisation to rid the skies of this health and safety hazard," Mrs Shipley said.

Air New Zealand has since 1992 been voluntarily reducing the number of services on which smoking is permitted, and will extend the smoking ban to its flights to and from Japan and Korea from 1 November.

The Minister's official designation of the Japan and Korea routes as non-smoking gives legal authority to the ban, and provides penalties for non-compliance.

Smoking on domestic air services has been banned since 1990.
