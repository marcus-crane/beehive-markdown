Health Minister Bill English today released a report assessing the treatment of Jacko Paki by mental health services at MidCentral Health.

The inquiry was conducted by the Wellington Region District Inspector of Mental Health, Helen Cull QC, and a psychiatrist Bridget Taumoepeau. It was instigated following concerns being raised after the conviction for rape of Mr Paki and looked at his treatment by MidCentral's mental health services.

"This report lists serious inadequacies in Mr Paki's management and treatment. It also identifies specific problems that must be addressed. MidCentral has indicated it is committed to doing this and has already started this work.

"The CHE has been put on notice to make sure it delivers on this commitment," Mr English said.

"Central Transitional Health Authority is working with MidCentral to ensure its mental health services meet appropriate standards for treatment and care.

"I have asked the Director of Mental Health to closely monitor progress and report to me over the next six months," he said.

"The inquiry accepted that the crime could not have been predicted. But it makes it very clear that Mr Paki's psychiatric illness and drug addictions could have been better managed.

"The list of inadequacies of Mr Paki's treatment in the inquiry is clearly unsatisfactory. There are important lessons for community mental health workers, police, corrections, drug and alcohol services and CHE mental health services arising from this inquiry," Mr English said.

"The inquiry does not make any findings of negligence on the part of any individual. It does however, present a number of concerns about the adequacy of the clinical standards of those involved in the care of Mr Paki. The Director of Mental Health Janice Wilson is taking independent advice about what further action, if any, should be taken," he said. "The inquiry also raises issues relating to the adequacy of treatment of people with a psychiatric illness and a drug or alcohol addiction. Two months ago Central THA announced funding for a training programme for the assessment and treatment of individuals with dual diagnoses.

"Training is the first step towards the appropriate management of this group of people. MidCentral Health will have access to this programme," Mr English said.
