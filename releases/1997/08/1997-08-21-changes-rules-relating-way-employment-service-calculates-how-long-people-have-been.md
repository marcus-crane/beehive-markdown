Employment Minister Peter McCardle today announced changes to the rules relating to the way the Employment Service calculates how long people have been registered unemployed.

"Because the Government's Employment Strategy is founded on reducing long-term unemployment, considerable work has been carried out to ensure that the length of time job seekers have been seeking work is more accurately captured, and that each job seeker's length of registration better reflects the level of assistance they need."

"As a result of the administrative changes, the way the Employment Service re-enrols people who return to the register after leaving for short-term jobs, training or other reasons has been improved to ensure that their total duration of unemployment is more accurate."

Mr McCardle said the changes have been introduced from 1 July 1997, and the overall number on the register has not been affected.

Registered unemployment rose by 800 over the month of July to 163,426.

"The changes to the way we measure duration of unemployment mean we now have a clearer picture of the challenge we face in reducing long-term unemployment and we will be intensifying our energies on reducing this unacceptable and stubborn statistic." concluded Mr McCardle.
