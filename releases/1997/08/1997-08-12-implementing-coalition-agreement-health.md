There has been a good deal said about implementing the Coalition health policy. The fact is implementation is well underway and I am committed to completing what I have set out to do.

Coalition Agreement Achievements  
By July 1998 there will be one funding body separate from the Ministry of Health which will carry out functions determined after consultation with the health sector and a review of the current system. Transitional Health Authority set up 1 July 1997 replacing the four Regional Health Authorities. (Consultation covered by Steering Group.)

A major change that occurred smoothly and on time. The transition to the national funder is now underway and likely to occur in practice well ahead of the official 1 July 1998 timeframe.  
Free doctors visits and prescriptions for children under six years old. Implemented 1 July 1997.

Significant for the way the Government was able to work with GPs.  
Increased resources will be made available to address major issues in delivery of mental health services. In 97 Budget $15m extra p.a, allocated with more additional money earmarked in planning levels.

Also in the last 8 months the Mental Health Commission has been established with its legislation now introduced.

Mason money spending enabling new services to be set up.

Completion of a major audit of CHE-based acute mental health services and now using THA and Mental health Commission to implement recommendations.  
Removing the competitive profit focus for Regional Hospital and Community Services, replacing it with a requirement to carry out its activity in a businesslike fashion. Legislation preparation on track to be implemented by 1 July 1998.  
Increase waiting times fund by $50M in 1997/98. Achieved a three year commitment to the increase:  
1997/98 $35m  
1998/99 $45m  
1999/00 $70m.  
Remove income and asset testing for long stay geriatric public hospital care services and asset testing for long say geriatric private hospital care. Income and asset testing for public hospitals abolition announced in 97 Budget to be implemented 1 October 1998.

Asset testing for private hospitals abolition announced in 97 Budget to be implemented 1 October 1998.  
The Coalition Agreement refers in several parts to a comprehensive review of health policy - current practice and structures and what is proposed in the Coalition Agreement. In line with the first deadline in the Coalition Agreement for any sector, the Health Steering Group reported on its review work.

The 13 members were drawn from across the diverse range of views in the sector.

Membership agreed by both Coalition partners.

The group produced a remarkably consensus view which:

Confirmed:

direction of Coalition Agreement

collaborative, cooperative focus

not-for-profit company structure for CHEs

services focused on health outcomes.  
Abolition of user charges in public hospitals. Announced in the Budget and took effect from 1 July 1997.  
Increased resources will be made available to provide Maori leadership within the health sector, and enable the continuing growth and development of Maori health service provision by Maori. Maori Provider Development Programme established with $7.5m in 97/998 and $10m thereafter.

Maori health Commission established.  
Increase baseline funding to Vote: Health after full consideration is given to sustainable funding work being undertaken. Received in the 97 Budget the money set out in Coalition Agreement.

Increase:  
97/98 $300m  
98/99 $480m  
99/00 $750m.  
Private sector involvement in services usually provided by the public sector will be subject to criteria set by Government. Criteria established and agreed by both Coalition partners.

Impractical to require Ministerial approval for every application. Applying an audit trail system with two criteria:

Must improve health outcomes

No increased financial risk to the Crown considered over a 10 year period.  
The Minister of Health will be responsible for the whole publicly funded health sector and the publicly owned health providers. In last government - Minister of Health, two Associate Ministers and a Minister for Crown Health Enterprises.

From December 1996 one Minister of Health and one Associate Minister of Health.  
Reconsider the decision to unbundling ACC funding from CHEs for acute and some elective surgery. Reconsidered and stayed with decision for ACC to purchase electives.
