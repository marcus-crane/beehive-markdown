Sir Ronald Davison's findings from the Commission of Inquiry into Certain Matters Relating to Taxation (the report of the Wine-Box Inquiry) will provide the New Zealand public with continued confidence in the institutions of the State, the Prime Minister, Jim Bolger said today.

Sir Ronald found that there was no evidence of unlawful conduct, impropriety or incompetence on the part of the Inland Revenue Department or the Serious Fraud Office. His report was tabled in Parliament today.

The report cleared corporates and individuals of conspiracy to defraud but drew attention to the high tax levels and inadequacy of the tax laws in the 1980s.

Mr Bolger said the Government would consider the report's findings and recommendations in depth.

"There are possible implications in this report for the administration of the tax system which the Government will need to address.

"It is my intention to establish a committee of Ministers to investigate these issues and report to the Cabinet in due course," Mr Bolger said.
