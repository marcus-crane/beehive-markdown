Substantial tariff reductions for a range of agricultural, forestry and manufactured exports to China are another feature of New Zealand's new trade deal with Beijing, says International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith.

Last week, Dr Smith announced from Beijing that the breakthrough agreement had achieved a major boost for wool exports to China, New Zealand's biggest wool market. The deal came during bilateral negotiations in Beijing connected to China's accession to the World Trade Organisation.

In Wellington today, Dr Smith released further details about the agreement, saying he hoped other major exporters like the Dairy Board would gain substantially.

"The Dairy Board has targeted China as a market offering substantial long-term growth. But high tariffs on dairy products have stunted dairy exports to China.

"So I hope the tariff reductions will help the board's efforts to expand its share of the vast Chinese market.

"I also hope the cuts will allow other sectors to boost their exports." Tariffs on butter and cheese are due to fall from 65% to 25%, from 35% to 25% for milk powder and from 30% to 20% for liquid milk.

Meat, forest products and fruit and vegetable exporters are amongst many others to gain from the deal.

For example, the tariff on beef will drop from 50% to 25% and from 45% to 20% for sheepmeat.

The apple tariff will drop from around 40% to 30%, while the kiwifruit tariff is due to fall to 30% from 55%. Frozen vegetable tariffs will fall from 22% to 20%.

Forest product tariff reductions are: wood in the rough, 2% now (1% finally); veneer sheets 12% now (6%-12% finally); particle board 22% now (17%-18% finally); fibreboard 22% now (12%-15% finally); plywood 20% now (12% finally); wood pulp 2% now (1% finally); paper up to 20% now (11% finally); wallpaper and writing paper 35% now (19% finally).

The agreement also features tariff reductions on a wide range of manufactured products. When it joins the WTO, China will reduce current tariffs on these goods by 50% of the difference between the current tariff and the final tariff.

The other 50% of the difference will be phased out over two years.

Exporters requiring details of how the new tariffs will be applied can contact the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

If any other country negotiates better tariffs than these during their WTO negotiations with China, New Zealand will get the benefit of them.
