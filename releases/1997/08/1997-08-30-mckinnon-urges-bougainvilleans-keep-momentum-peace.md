The Foreign Minister Don McKinnon yesterday urged Bougainville groups to keep up the momentum and maintain pressure on their leaders for a peaceful resolution to the nine-year secessionist conflict on the island of Bougainville.

In the wake of successful meetings with Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Bill Skate and other senior ministers earlier in the week, Mr McKinnon flew to Buka and the main island of Bougainville yesterday.

In Buka he met with Gerard Sinato, the Premier of the Bougainville Transitional Government and other leaders. Following Buka he travelled by helicopter to two villages on Bougainville to meet with leaders of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army and its political wing the Bougainville Interim Government.

Hundreds of people turned out at the meetings to welcome Mr McKinnon and show support for the role New Zealand is playing in the Bougainville peace process - in particular hosting last month's peace talks at Burnham Military Camp, near Christchurch.

"It is becoming very obvious that most people on the island want peace," Mr McKinnon said. "The devastation that ongoing conflict brings is clear for all to see. Basic necessities such as medicine, clothing and education are just not available for most Bougainvilleans."

"Everyone would be winners if reconciliation was achieved and reconstruction of the island could begin."

Following a request from Prime Minister Skate, New Zealand has agreed to host a second and third round of talks, this time between the PNG Government and Bougainville groups. The talks will be held at Burnham Camp - possibly as soon as mid-September.

"The New Zealand Government has always expressed a willingness to assist and I am very happy to agree to Mr Skate's request to host more talks ," he said.

Mr McKinnon returns to Wellington at midnight tonight.
