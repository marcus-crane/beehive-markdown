The Education Minister today released robust research which clearly shows that since 1990 there has been a real increase in the money schools get to cover their day to day running costs.

Mr Creech strongly contested claims in comments from the School Trustees' Association that the Government is short-changing schools with Operations Grant funding.

The Minister had asked the Education Ministry to research the real value of the grant following claims and counterclaims made at the time of the Budget.

"The analysis from the Ministry of Education is clear and unambiguous. Which ever way you look at it, since 1990 there has been a real increase in the Operations Grant.

"The size of the increase depends on the price index used. But the result is same, ranging from a small increase in real terms using the Consumer Price Index to a 4.6% increase using the Producer Price Index."

1990 1998 %change  
Nominal $689.32/pupil $801.71/pupil 16.3% rise  
Underlying Inflation $703.74/pupil 2.1% rise  
Producer Price Index $720.98/pupil 4.6% rise  
CPI $691.39/pupil 0.3% rise

Mr Creech said substantial extra resources have been set aside for the Operations Grant. This year's Budget contained $61.7 million extra over three years, and last year's also injected substantially more into the grant.

"In addition the 1997 Budget included an extra $350 million over 3 years which will feed directly into schools to help them deliver education.

"There seems to be continual disagreement about Government funding levels. We should in fact be taking a step back and ensuring that schools have the resources they need to provide a good learning environment.

"The way the Operations Grant is worked out is a far too complex. More than 20 different components make up the funding formula. This may be causing the concern and confusion. I have asked my officials to come up with a transparent and simple means of calculating the funding.

"I want schools to have the confidence to plan for the future knowing that the Government will appropriately fund their operating costs. I have tried to instil some confidence by making a commitment that the Operations Grant will automatically be looked at during each Budget round.

"After all it is what schools get in their pockets that count. I want to ensure that the Government is giving them the appropriate level of funding." concluded Mr Creech.
