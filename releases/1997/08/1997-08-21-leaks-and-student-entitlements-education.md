About 27% of New Zealand's young people who leave school go on to university or polytech. Almost three-quarters do not. Amongst those are high proportions of Maori and other minority groups whose traditional level of skills has been way below what it should be. New Zealand has to address that.

How do we do it?

We have at least a couple of choices. We could continue the status quo. It has not worked all that well - participation is now levelling out - but it is the status quo and its disturbs little if you leave it as is.

Or we could be bold. We could set up accounts and say to every young person: "When you leave school the taxpayer will put a sum of money in your education account for you to train. Everyone should do it; no exceptions.

In a briefing paper, the Ministry of Education has suggested these entitlements as a way of solving the problem. It is worth thinking about. We may decide it's not the right thing to do, but at least we should consider it.

Some double-dealing official leaked a half-baked paper on the issue. That kind of dishonesty is all too rife in our society these days. Leakers always put a one-sided political spin on their release. They sprinkle it with emotive words like "voucher" and "privatisation" even if there is nothing of the sort. It is easier to win political points that way.

Such people hope to pre-empt and shout down the debate. They are wasting their time. We are determined that the public will get to hear both sides of the argument. Privatising is selling institutions. That is not going to happen. Neither will tertiary institutions be profit-making. These deceptions are put out by self-interested parties to try to stop people looking at an idea.

I was amused to see the Opposition criticisms. In the UK, the new Labour Government has announced its intention to implement just such a programme, as has now Australia.

The Government has made no decisions in this area. Indeed, the only decisions to be made now are what to include in the upcoming discussion document - (the "Green Paper"). Final decisions will not be made until after public submissions on the Green Paper have been received and analysed.

The objective is straightforward: to build up participation in post-compulsory education and training.

The idea is simple enough. As an inducement to get into training, every young person would get an entitlement towards the cost of further education and training when they leave school. There would be every encouragement to get that young person to use their entitlement on a course that would build up their skills.

At present about 16% of 18 to 24 year olds go to university. Typically, a university student receives about $30,000 from the taxpayer. Graduates can also expect to earn considerably more than the average income during their lifetime. Some, like lawyers, accountants, doctors, dentists and so on do particularly well over time.

About 11% of 18 to 24 year olds study at polytechnics and Colleges of Education. Typically, polytechnic students get $15,200 of taxpayer money spent on them, and College of Education students $24,000. They too can expect to earn more than the average income during their lifetime.

The remainder of young people do not access the tertiary funding pool for education and training when they leave school. It is important for our future that we get as many of these people as possible participating in post-school education and training.

It is foolish to dismiss out of hand any proposal designed to improve the education, skills and employment prospects of all young people. Getting more people into tertiary education and training would provide an important boost.

I have had a number of representatives from polytechnics already write to me to support the idea as being in the best interests of young New Zealanders. The fears from university sources that any changes will undermine their position are unfounded. They give me the impression that their major concern is to preserve their position by protecting their institutions at the expense of others. They dress up their concern as preserving "quality" and "academic freedom".

The real question should be whether the proposal offers new opportunities and hope to young people to get into training. If it meets that test, it is a good idea. More than anything else people should have the opportunity to think about it without the debate being warped by the dishonesty and deceit of these unscrupulous leaks.
