The Minister of Maori Affairs, the Hon Tau Henare, today announced the appointment of Janet Winter-Love as Executive Director of the recently formed Maori Education Commission.

Ms Winter Love brings with her a broad understanding of Maori education, and education policy in general. In addition, previous senior management positions with the Education Review Office and the Ministry of Education, and work with major government commissions, makes her the ideal appointee to this very important role.
