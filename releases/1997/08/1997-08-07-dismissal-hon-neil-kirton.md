The Prime Minister announced today that he had been informed by the New Zealand First Leader, Hon Winston Peters that he was not prepared to have the Hon Neil Kirton continue as Associate Minister of Health and that Mr Kirton wished to resign as Minister of Customs.

As Prime Minister, I have advised the Governor-General to remove Mr Kirton immediately from his Ministerial responsibilities.

I have taken the necessary steps to allocate the duties involved on an acting basis, subject to further discussion between the leaders of the Coalition Parties. I have asked the Hon Tuariki Delamere to act as Minister of Customs in the meantime. I do not propose to appoint a new Associate Minister of Health immediately.
