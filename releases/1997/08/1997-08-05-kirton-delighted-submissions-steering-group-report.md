Associate Health Minister Neil Kirton today said he was delighted with the number of steering group report submissions which supported the health policy outlined in the Coalition Agreement.

"The submissions clearly show that the health sector support the general principles outlined in the Coalition Agreement.

"I am delighted with the number of submissions. A lot of people and organisations have taken the time to comment on the report.

Mr Kirton said he would be looking at the submissions carefully and then meeting with other Ministers to discuss how they could be reflected in the legislation that is introduced to the House.
