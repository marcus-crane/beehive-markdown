New Zealand will host the major Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings in mid September 1999, Prime Minister Jim Bolger announced today.

"In 1999, New Zealand will take its turn in hosting and chairing the APEC process. This gives us a great opportunity to provide leadership to the Asia-Pacific's most dynamic regional grouping," Mr Bolger said.

"Together with the America's Cup defence, Sydney Olympics and the Millennium, our APEC year will mark an exciting end of the decade for New Zealand."

Mr Bolger said APEC had set itself the unique goal of free and open trade and investment by 2010 for developed and 2020 for developing member economies.

"During 1999 APEC will also want to focus on, and contribute to, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) process as it gears up for a further set of global trade negotiations commencing at the turn of the century."

The annual APEC work programme leads to a Ministerial Meeting of the Foreign Affairs and Trade Ministers of the eighteen member economies, followed by an informal meeting of the leaders of those economies.

The meetings will be held in Auckland in mid-September 1999. The Foreign and Trade Ministers meeting will be held from September 10-11 and the APEC leaders meeting will be held on September 13.

The APEC meetings are being held earlier in the year than usual to avoid clashes with the 1999 General Election and the defence of the America's Cup beginning in November that year. The earlier date is also intended to alleviate pressure on Auckland hotels and other facilities.

"The exact venues for the meetings are still to be finalised," Mr Bolger said. "As with the Asian Development Board of Governors Meeting and the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in 1995, a task force will be created in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade to organise the APEC meetings."

APEC comprises Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, and the United States of America.

APEC members are called "economies", not "countries" in recognition of the different status of Hong Kong, China and Chinese Taipei (Taiwan).
