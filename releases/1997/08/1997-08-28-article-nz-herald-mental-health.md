The Herald ran a series of articles last week on mental health. Today the Minister of Health, Bill English, gives his views.

(* Molly not her real name changed for confidentially purposes.)  
Molly* was less than five foot tall and her body was failing - cancer was winning its battle but her voice was strong: "I'm so glad to have my own little flat, my garden and my cat".

For most of us, this woman did not have much to be happy about. But for her the freedom to live in the community after more than 50 years in mental institutions meant life, what was left of it, was to be celebrated.

I believe people with a mental illness deserve to be treated with dignity and have access to quality services. That is why I launched national standards for mental health services last month. In the past, there haven't been clear, accountable standards for mental health services.

Mental health services in our Crown health enterprises are on notice to meet those standards in the next 12 months. Other providers must meet them in the next two years or they won't win the contracts.

Of course in health we can always think of extras we would like to provide. But the fact is we work within a limited budget. This year it is $5.8 billion. That's more than ever before but the expectations and demands for health services, physical and mental, are growing ever faster. New Zealand is no different to any other country in this regard.

We will spend $440 million on mental health services this year. Last week The NZ Herald referred to 20 percent of past health funding going to mental health. That percentage was misleading because it included all the money the government still spends on the disability support, intellectual disability services, care for the elderly and the huge overheads that were involved in up-keeping often old and out-dated buildings.

In the past decade the shift in mental health funding has been more to putting the person with the right skills in front of a person who needs help so people can live as independently as possible in the home of their choice.

The Government is committed to funding mental health services and in real terms it has been increasing that funding at a faster rate than for the rest of health over the last five years.

There has been a lot of comment on the Mason money which was additional money specifically ring-fenced for new mental health services. That money was slow to hit the ground and I was one of the main critics of the delays. But by the end of the last financial year 90 percent of that money was committed. Any unspent Mason money from one year will be automatically carried forward into the next year's budget.

What else is changing is we are increasingly listening to consumers - the people who have or are experiencing a mental illness - about what they want. More consumers are becoming involved in planning and advocating for improved mental health services.

Too often our public institutions have unconsciously organised services to suit traditional professional practices. This has to change and we have a lot of work to do to change it.

When I meet consumers they are very clear that they do not want to go back to the old days when they and their problems were often locked away. They also speak very practically and reasonably about what they expect and what they are currently getting.

The providers who are listening to the consumers are the ones making the greatest progress and often it is the little things that count. One woman told me how she dreaded a CHE mental health worker calling every week because the name of the CHE was written across the side of the car. She felt that signwriting broadcast her problems to her neighbours. She is now supported by another provider that deliberately uses unmarked cars.

There are numerous examples of mental health services getting more in step with consumers needs. One organisation's mental health workers helped some people who were hardened drug users as well as having a mental illness where decades of help had failed, by going to the pub with them.

These people were long term patients of a mental hospital. They were to be moved out into the community but without something different happening in their community care they would be definite revolving door candidates.

The mental health workers looked at where these people were going home to and what they did. The ex-patients faced days of videos and being stoned. Life picked up on Thursday, Friday and Saturday night when the routine changed to the public bar of the pub with more booze and more drugs.

The workers changed their hours so they could go with them to the pub and help them think of alternatives to the booze and drugs. It was the same bars and they were still among their same friends but they were encouraged to play darts and pool and to slowly move towards thinking about how they wanted to spend their time and what work they could do. It worked and these ex-patients have not needed readmission to an acute service because someone took the time to work with them.

Asylums kept people like these locked away for decades, often when there was no clinical need to do so. The shift to community care means people with mental health problems are more visible to the rest of the community. They are moving in next door, getting jobs and educating themselves in mainstream institutions. It is this visibility that encourages the public to comment on the adequacy of the mental health system.

It is this increased visibility and participation that stigmatises and marginalise people with mental illness who live in the community. It is a social responsibility shared by all New Zealanders to ensure that people with mental illness get the same opportunities to experience a good quality of life as anyone else.

The only way to address the 'not in my backyard syndrome' is to let the facts and better information dispel what are usually irrational fears. The link between mental illness and violence is remote. A violent act is much more likely to be committed by someone who does not have a mental illness than someone that does.

People need to remember they are hundreds of times more likely to be victims of drink driving than any incident involving a person with a mental illness.

However, an incident involving a person with a mental illness will always receive a lot of publicity because we go through an exhaustive series of reviews to examine what happened and how things can be improved in future. This means the news stories do not die away quickly. We do not go through that level of scrutiny when a drunk climbs behind the wheel and subsequently kills or maims.

This year the case of Jacko Paki became synonymous with the perceived breakdown in mental health services. Certainly Paki should have been managed and treated better. But rather than a total systems failure, his case highlighted a specific service's failures that had to be and is being put right.

We need to keep things in perspective. The mental health system is in transition from the days of institutional to community care. There are pockets of excellence, there are thousands of people receiving good care and there are areas that need addressing right away.
