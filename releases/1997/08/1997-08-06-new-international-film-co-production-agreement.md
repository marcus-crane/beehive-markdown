A new international agreement has  
been signed in Rome which will provide a boost to the growing New Zealand film  
industry.

The Agreement between New Zealand and Italy concerning  
co-production of films will provide new opportunities for the film makers of  
both countries to work together in the development of projects produced and  
financed jointly by each country.  
The Agreement was signed by the  
Italian Deputy Prime Minister, who is also the Minister of Culture, and the New  
Zealand Ambassador to Italy, on behalf of the New Zealand Government.

Minister of Cultural Affairs, Hon. Chris Fletcher, says the Agreement  
will reinforce the warm relationship between the two countries through the  
medium of film. "The Agreement establishes a valuable additional source of  
finance and production support for film makers and will be mutually beneficial  
for the film industries of each country. This Agreement has the potential to  
lead to increased film production, improved employment opportunities and higher  
foreign exchange earnings."8

New Zealand already has co-production  
agreements with Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada and France. These  
agreements have been successful in generating film productions with estimated  
total budgets in excess of $150 million.

The New Zealand Film Commission  
will administer the Co-production Agreement on behalf of the New Zealand  
Government, and in Italy, the Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri,  
Dipartimento Spettacolo (Prime Minister's Office, Entertainment Division) will  
be the responsible agency.

\`\`I would like to pay tribute to the Film  
Commission for its initiative in promoting the idea of an agreement in  
consultation with its Italian counterpart. The Commission has worked closely  
with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Ministry of Cultural  
Affairs to negotiate the final text of the Agreement and is to be congratulated  
for its efforts'' the Minister said.
