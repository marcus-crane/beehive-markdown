Prime Minister Jim Bolger today welcomed moves to begin providing a $3 million crime prevention programme for South Auckland young people at risk of offending.

The $3 million "Wraparound" programme, first announced in this year's Budget, will focus on providing intensive care and therapy for young people in Otara and Mangere with a range of health, education and social problems.

Mr Bolger said the programme catering for up to 100 young people at any one time was the largest of a range of initiatives for South Auckland and forms part of the Government's three-year $8.7 million crime prevention package.

The package was developed under the auspices of the Crime Prevention Unit of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet in conjunction with the Ministry of Youth Affairs and other Government agencies.

The programme aims to reduce behaviour leading to truancy, school expulsions, teen pregnancies, accidental deaths and suicide.

Mr Bolger said the Government was committed to prevention as an answer to crime in the community.

"We don't want more prisons. We want more programmes to identify youngsters at risk of offending and we want to turn their energies into more productive and fulfilling activities. Imprisonment must be seen as the last resort, not the first.

"I am confident that these programmes will make a difference and, if successful in South Auckland, we will be looking at extending the concept to other communities," Mr Bolger said.

The crime prevention package for South Auckland also includes:

a community based Police youth aid programme based on successful programmes already running in Mt Roskill, Ponsonby and Dunedin;  
a youth worker employed under an Internal Affairs community worker project scheme, to work specifically on crime prevention; and  
funds for a community crime prevention programme designed for Maori youth by Maori groups.
