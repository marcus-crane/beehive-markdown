New funding arrangements for health related research were announced today by the Minister of Health and the Minister of Research, Science and Technology.

Commencing this year $26 million of health research funding will be transferred from Vote: Health to Vote: Research, Science and Technology.

"The major benefit from this shift is the Government can now take a strategic approach to its whole science and technology portfolio including health research," Research, Science and Technology Minister Maurice Williamson said.

"Already over $5 million in new public good health research funding has been announced in the Budget.

"Health research will now benefit fully from the Government's commitment to increased funding through the science envelope, as set out in the strategy document RS&T: 2010 - The Government's Strategy for Research, Science and Technology in New Zealand to the year 2010" Mr Williamson said.

Health Minister Bill English said in the past research funding had tended to get buried in the large Health Vote.

"With this change there can be a proper focus on research priorities across the board. We've also put safeguards in place to ensure that research to inform health policy will continue to get support.

"The Health Research Council will continue to act as the body that distributes health research funds, Mr English said.
