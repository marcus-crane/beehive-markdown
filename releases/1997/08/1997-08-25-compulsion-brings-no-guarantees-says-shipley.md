"The proposed compulsory Retirement Savings Scheme offers no more certainty than current arrangements, " State Services Minister Jenny Shipley said tonight.

At a public meeting in Eastbourne, Mrs Shipley noted that a recent survey showed that 60 per cent felt the proposed scheme would be no safer from political interference than the present scheme.

" The White Paper clearly states that future governments may change the parameters of the RSS. Future politicians may well decide to increase your savings target, or reduce the amount of the top-up, or make you save a higher percentage of your wages each week if economic or political conditions change.

"The White Paper also makes it clear that your savings are not guaranteed by the Government, despite Winston Peters' claim in Tauranga at the weekend.

"The Government is assuring New Zealanders they will get a pension, but the Government is not guaranteeing that it will protect their compulsory savings.

"The only vote being held in September is on whether people support or oppose the proposed Compulsory Retirement Savings Scheme as defined in the White Paper. I will continue to argue that "NO" is the best answer.

"The most important thing now is for everyone to make sure they send a clear message to politicians by voting. Regardless of whether they support or oppose the proposed compulsory RSS, they must send a message that leaves current and future governments in no doubt about what New Zealanders think," Mrs Shipley concluded.
