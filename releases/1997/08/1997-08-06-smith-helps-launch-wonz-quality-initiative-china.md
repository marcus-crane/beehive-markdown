International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith has today helped Wools of New Zealand (WONZ) launch its Fernmark quality programme in China.

Dr Smith spoke at a WONZ seminar in Beijing attended by Chinese wool importers, processors and government officials.

The Fernmark initiative is aimed at ensuring high quality standards are met by New Zealand exporters sending wool to China. Wool bought from exporters accredited to the Fernmark programme is guaranteed to meet WONZ quality criteria.

WONZ will be working with Chinese importers to demonstrate the benefits of purchasing Fernmark wool with a guaranteed quality, rather than purchasing wool from New Zealand or elsewhere simply on price grounds.

"The Fernmark initiative is exactly the sort of thing needed if we are to expand our presence in key export markets like China," Dr Smith said.

"I applaud the way WONZ is seeking to extract the maximum value from the Chinese market, which is New Zealand's biggest for wool exports.

Dr Smith will attend a similiar WONZ seminar in Shanghai tomorrow.
