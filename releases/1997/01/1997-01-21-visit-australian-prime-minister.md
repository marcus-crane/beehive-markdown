Prime Minister Jim Bolger said today that the Australian Prime Minister John Howard would visit New Zealand from 15-17 February.

"John Howard and I have met three times in the last year and this visit will build on those previous meetings.

"We have agreed that every year we will set aside time for New Zealand-Australia Prime Ministerial talks.

"We have established an excellent working relationship in areas of interest to both our countries.

"Our relationship with Australia remains our most important political and economic linkage.

"The visit will provide an opportunity for me to discuss with Mr Howard a wide range of issues of shared interest."

The programme for the visit will be announced in February.
