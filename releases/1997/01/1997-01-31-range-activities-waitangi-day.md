A range of Waitangi Day activities around the country have Government input this year.

As well as Ministers being present at commemorations in Waitangi and Wellington, there are a range of other events around the country which have received some Government funding.

The Minister responsible for the Waitangi commemorations, Rt Hon Don McKinnon, said Ministers would be going to Waitangi for the traditional commemorations, and also be present in Wellington for a formal ceremony hosted by the Governor General at Government House.

"At Waitangi the Government will be represented by the Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters and other New Zealand First Ministers and MPs, as well as myself, three National Ministers and several Parliamentary colleagues.

"A number of senior politicians from other parties are also planning to be at Waitangi.

"This year's commemorations at Waitangi have a simpler format than previous years. The people of Tai Tokerau are committed to rebuilding the commemorations, after the experience of 1995," Mr McKinnon said.

A committee led by Pita Paraone of Tai Tokerau has planned the day, in consultation with the Taumata Kaumatua and Te Kawariki.

"Usually we work on it together, but the elections and subsequent political events interrupted that process in September. Pita has kept us in touch as the planning progressed, and he and his team have had support from a range of Government departments," Mr McKinnon said.

In Wellington, the Prime Minister will represent the Government at a function hosted by the Governor General, Sir Michael Hardie Boys, at Government House. The guest Maori speaker will be Dr Ngatata Love, of Te Atiawa, who is currently the chief executive of Te Puni Kokiri and was formerly the Dean of the Faculty of Business Studies at Massey University.

"We have been actively encouraging communities around New Zealand to commemorate Waitangi Day in their own way. For this year the amount of funding available for that purpose was doubled.

"As a result there are 26 other events around the country - from Kaitaia to the Chatham Islands - which have some Government funding. It's good to see communities around the country commemorating Waitangi Day in their own special way.

"One of the biggest events is Porirua City's Festival of the Elements, a multicultural festival which last year on Waitangi Day attracted over 20,000 people," Mr McKinnon said.
