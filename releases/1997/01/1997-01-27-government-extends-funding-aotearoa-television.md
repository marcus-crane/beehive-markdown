The Government will extend funding to Aotearoa Television Network until the end of June, the Minister of Maori Affairs, Hon  
Tau Henare and the Minister of Communications, Hon Maurice Williamson announced today.

The Ministers say Cabinet has committed $4 million dollars, comprising $2 million from the Consolidated Fund and $2 million  
from the Broadcasting Licence Fee through New Zealand On Air.

The Ministers say by the end of the funding period the Government expects to have determined its long-term policy towards  
Maori television.

This funding is part of the Governments commitment to the promotion of Maori Language and culture and is part of the  
Governments commitment to partnership under the Treaty of Waitangi.
