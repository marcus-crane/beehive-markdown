Education Minister Wyatt Creech today released a survey of primary schools in Auckland which confirms that primary teacher supply in the region is well under control.

As far as can be ascertained, every primary school class in Auckland has a trained and qualified teacher in front of it, said Mr Creech.

Responses from 369 primary schools in Auckland showed the schools had only 15 primary classes which they had been unable to staff with trained and qualified teachers.

With the Ministry of Education help, every one of those positions has been filled by a trained and qualified teacher.

There do not appear to be any untrained staff in front of Auckland primary school students, Mr Creech said.

Slightly over half (188) of the Auckland primary schools reported employing 499 overseas teachers who have arrived any time since January last year. (Out of a total of about 5,750 primary teachers in the Auckland area).

Contrary to claims and what can only be described as scare-mongering over the past few weeks the schools do have the right number of trained and qualified teachers.

The lack of requests from schools for the 40 teachers in the Governments Auckland Supply Group, set up to cover any unforeseen vacancies in the first month of term, is further confirmation of the results of the survey. So far, just one of these teachers has been deployed, while four of them are considering possible permanent appointments.

The Ministry has extended the availability of the Auckland Supply Group teachers to outside the Auckland area, and to cover professional development release time for beginning and overseas teachers and where schools have special circumstances because of the large number of overseas or beginning teachers employed for which current entitlements are not sufficient.

Mr Creech rejected criticism about the quality of overseas teachers.

Overseas teachers bring a strength and diversity to our schools which should be welcomed. If properly supported by everyone, they are a considerable asset to our childrens education, he said.

A satisfactory start has been made to the school year. The Government is determined that teacher supply efforts will be sustained with the focus shifting to ensure teacher quality is maintained and schools have adequate relief teaching lists.

The Ministry also holds a list of 38 primary and secondary teachers seeking work in the Auckland area. Other Ministry management centres have similar lists and are able to help schools as they advise of difficulties. Recruitment agents also have lists of good teachers looking for work, many can start tomorrow.

Mr Creech said he was encouraged by the fact school boards, principals, and recruitment agents had acted swiftly enough to ensure they had enough teachers.

The full range of government initiatives to assist with teacher supply around the country will remain in place to help schools recruit good quality staff to their schools and to cover any vacancies with trained and qualified teachers until vacancies are filled.
