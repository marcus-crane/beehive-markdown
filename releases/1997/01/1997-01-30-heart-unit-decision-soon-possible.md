Health Minister Bill English said today he wanted to see a decision on the provision of heart surgery in Christchurch as soon as possible.

"In order to progress this I have directed the Southern Regional Health Authority to continue with its tender process for cardiac surgical services.

"This process was rightly put on hold by Jenny Shipley in November as a matter that the incoming Government should deal with. We are now in a position to move on this issue and I would like to see a decision made as soon as possible, said Mr English.

"The next step is for the health authority to go back to the parties concerned to verify whether its preferred tender is still viable. For legal reasons the tender process needs to be completed.

"Christchurch people want a heart unit service in their city and they have waited far too long for a decision on this. Associate Health Minister Neil Kirton and I will be looking to see a solution put forward which meets the needs of the people in Christchurch and which will work. We want to see this happen as quickly as possible," said Mr English.
