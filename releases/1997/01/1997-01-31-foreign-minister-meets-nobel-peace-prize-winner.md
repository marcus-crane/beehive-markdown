In an informal meeting Foreign Minister Don McKinnon today spoke to Jose Ramos Horta, a prominent spokesperson for East Timorese independence and 1996 co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, for nearly half an hour.

McKinnon said he had listened carefully to Mr Horta's views on East Timor. He impressed on Mr Horta the need for all parties to work constructively and realistically to resolve their differences.

"I was very interested to hear Mr Horta's assessment of the tripartite discussions taking place under the United Nations and those between the East Timorese factions," Mr McKinnon said.

"New Zealand's policy of listening to all points of view applies equally to this situation. It's very easy to take a black and white approach to this issue, and we both recognised the point that this is a complex issue and that progress is being made towards its resolution."

"I told Mr Horta the Government supports the tripartite talks among the Indonesians, the Portuguese and the United Nations Secretary-General. Their objective is a just, comprehensive and internationally acceptable outcome on East Timor," Mr McKinnon said.

"We also endorse the Secretary-General's moves to encourage reconciliation among the East Timorese factions themselves, a fact I would hope to raise with the Secretary-General at the next opportunity".

"The Asia-Pacific region has had this issue on its plate for many years and we all want to see it resolved. Whenever I meet Indonesia's Foreign Minister Ali Alatas we discuss East Timor and I register New Zealand's concerns about human rights issues and our wish to see progress towards a long term solution," Mr McKinnon concluded.
