Prime Minister Jim Bolger and wife Joan will be visiting Antarctica next week to attend the anniversary commemorations of the setting up of Scott Base 40 years ago.

The official party, which includes United States Ambassador Josiah Beeman and Sir Edmund Hillary, leave Christchurch on Wednesday morning for a three day stay as guests of Antarctica New Zealand.

The Prime Minister will unveil a commemorative plaque on Scott Base, visit the South Pole and inspect a number of scientific projects during his time on the ice.

Mr and Mrs Bolger return to Christchurch on Saturday evening.
