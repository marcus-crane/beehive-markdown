Foreign Minister Don McKinnon will meet the Australian Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer, in Adelaide on Thursday.

"I'm looking forward to seeing Mr Downer in his home town this week" Mr McKinnon said.

"The very close relationship between Australia and New Zealand means there's always plenty to discuss at these meetings.

"As usual we'll cover the foreign policy horizon - particularly South Pacific and South-East Asian issues, and developments in disarmament and the United Nations. And of course we will spend time on CER and defence issues.

"This is the first of several high-level meetings between New Zealand and Australia since the forming of the coalition just before Christmas. It's an opportunity to take stock of progress on key issues in advance of the forthcoming visit to New Zealand of Prime Minister Howard next month" Mr McKinnon concluded.

The meeting between Mr McKinnon and Mr Downer is part of a pattern of regular meetings between the Foreign Ministers of Australia and New Zealand, held approximately every six months and alternating between the two countries.
