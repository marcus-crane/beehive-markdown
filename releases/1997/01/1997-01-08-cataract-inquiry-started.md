The Minister of Health, Bill English, announced today that he had initiated an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the cancellation before Christmas of cataract operations in Southland.

The inquiry will be conducted by the Chief Medical Advisor at the Ministry of Health, Colin Feek.

"Dr Feek will be contacting all the parties involved to get a clear understanding of what happened and why these operations were cancelled. The outcome I am looking for from the inquiry is a clear set of guidelines covering the use of specialists for one-off Waiting Times Fund work," he said.

"The events in Southland created a great deal of confusion and concern for patients. Many of them had been waiting a long time for their operation.

"I want to make sure that patients are not let down again. We need to be able to get the benefits of some innovation in the use of specialists without the uncertainty for patients which occured on this occasion."

Mr English said he hoped the inquiry would be finished by mid-February.
