In a break with tradition the International Monetary Fund released a summary of its review of the New Zealand economy today which strongly endorses the country's economic performance, Treasurer Winston Peters says.

This is the first time the IMF's summary of New Zealand has been released publicly under a new policy for reporting on member countries.

The paper resulting from the IMF's Article IV Consultation with New Zealand is more good news for New Zealand, Mr Peters said.

"The IMF's executive directors have commended us for our rigorous macroeconomic policies, including our transparent policy setting process and public sector accounting framework.

"The directors note that our monetary policy framework has successfully maintained price stability and the Reserve Bank inflation target has built credibility and reduced inflation expectations," Mr Peters said.

"The paper is also complimentary of New Zealand's improvement in education standards that is vital for future growth."

Mr Peters said the IMF's report is further evidence that New Zealand is on the right track in terms of economic policy.
