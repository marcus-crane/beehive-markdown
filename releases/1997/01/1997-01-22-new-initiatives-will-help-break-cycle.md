Long-term and intergenerational welfare dependency is one of the greatest problems facing New Zealand today according to Social Welfare Ministerial pre-election briefing papers released today.

"One of my highest priorities is to ensure that the programmes and initiatives offered within Social Welfare are focussed to break the cycle of welfare dependency," says Social Welfare Minister Roger Sowry.

"We already have a number of pilot programmes in place specifically targeted to move people from welfare to work, education or training. Programmes like Compass for sole parents have been very successful and are making a real difference to the lives of parents and their children.

"The focus of Income Support is also changing. Each customer will soon have one-to-one service with a staff member. This way each customer will be guaranteed access to their full entitlements, there will be less need for emergency payments and benefit crime will be reduced."

One of the Coalition Government's major initiatives is the "Strengthening Families" strategy with objectives to prevent at-risk families from entering into a cycle of disadvantage and to help families who are already trapped in a disadvantaged state.

"This will involve much greater cooperation between the health, education and welfare sectors.

"We have identified a range of trial programmes that are currently being reviewed, and I am looking forward to the result of those trials. The sooner we can make decisions on these programmes, the sooner we can help people improve their lives," says Mr Sowry. ENDS
