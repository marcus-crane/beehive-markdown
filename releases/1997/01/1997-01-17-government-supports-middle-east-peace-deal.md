Foreign Minister Don McKinnon has welcomed the accord on Hebron negotiated this week between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.

"This deal, which comes after months of difficult talks brokered principally by the US but involving other important regional players including Jordan and Egypt, is an important step towards a lasting and secure Middle East peace," the Minister said. 'New Zealand is delighted that an agreement has finally been reached."

"However active cooperation on both sides will still be essential to ensure the peace process is not derailed again. And support and commitment from within the broader region will be necessary too," Mr McKinnon said.

The agreement just struck between Israel and the Palestinian Authority requires Israel to withdraw its troops from 80 percent of Hebron within ten days and implement the first of three subsequent West Bank redeployments by 7 March.

Hebron, a flash point on the West Bank, was scheduled to be given self-rule last year. But a spate of violence and escalation in fighting in the middle of last year seriously threatened to derail the whole peace process. A summit in Washington last September got negotiations on track again.

"The latest deal on Hebron is a key result of that process," Mr McKinnon concluded.
