The Government will have up to forty emergency standby primary teachers available in Auckland during the first month of the new school year.

Education Minister Wyatt Creech said the Auckland Teacher Supply Group will assist primary schools which had a serious staffing need despite doing everything possible to get teaching staff.

Mr Creech said the emergency teachers could cover vacancies not covered by other means or where a teacher due to fill a position was delayed until after the start of the term.

Former senior Auckland principal Bob Baird has been contracted to manage the last resort emergency pool. The majority of the teachers were from around New Zealand or Australians.

The Ministry of Education will provide the teachers with accommodation, transport, meals and other support during the month, said Mr Creech. We anticipate that some will move from the pool into long-term relieving or permanent jobs.

Mr Creech said Aucklands size, growth rate and school population increase of 4.9% had led to some schools facing staffing difficulties which were greater than elsewhere in the country.

The emergency teacher pool was part of a new package of assistance approved by the Government to help boards, principals and teachers in Auckland. In addition:

Three primary school principals have been seconded to the TeachNZ Northern Office for term one to help overseas teachers with classroom or personal problems or principals manage staffing pressures.

The Auckland College of Education Advisory Service has taken on two experienced senior educators for the first half of the year to support overseas teachers in the areas of the New Zealand curriculum, classroom management and classroom administration.  
Settling into a new school, new city and new country all at once can be stressful, said Mr Creech. While many schools are very good at helping overseas teachers settle into their new lifestyles, numbers, time and circumstances may see some teachers or principals wanting to take advantage of this extra off-site advice.

Some schools will have several overseas teachers, and this assistance will ease the burden on principals and management teams in schools from the beginning of the term, he said.

The new support adds to the twenty other current initiatives to ensure every class has a teacher.

Mr Creech said information before Christmas showed there was enough local and overseas teachers available to fill demand.

It will become clearer in the next two weeks whether schools have acted quickly enough to fill the vacancies. Once principals return to their desks this week they will also have a better idea of how many teachers have picked up jobs over the holidays.

While schools may still have vacancies, there are also many good quality teachers seeking jobs - both from within New Zealand and overseas.

The Ministry of Education is also ensuring all schools have specific advice on how to deal with any unexpected vacancies.

Ministry Advice to Principals on Dealing with an Unexpected Vacancy  
Principals returning to school to find an unexpected vacancy may need to act quickly. The Ministry of Education has provided this checklist to help them in their search for a relieving teacher:

Take time to analyse your position. How much time have you got? Does the position need to be filled on a short or long term basis?  
Refer to your relievers list  
Try your nearest College of Education. Are there any graduates still looking for jobs? Have they run a retraining course recently?  
Ask your school staff to tap into their networks  
Contact other colleagues/principals for possible relievers  
Advertise in the local paper or on your local radio stations job line  
Contact staffing agency for a local/overseas teacher to fill the vacancy  
Advise your nearest Ministry of Education TeachNZ liaison officer about your difficulty.  
Consider an uncertificated teacher until a certificated one is available  
Consider a short term reorganisation to help cover the vacancy  
Contact The Correspondence School. It can provide assignment resources and a phone link between one of its teachers and a school anywhere in the country at 24 hours notice.  
In Auckland, call on the emergency standby pool via the Ministry of Education
