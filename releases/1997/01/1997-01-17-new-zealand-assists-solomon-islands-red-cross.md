Foreign Minister Don McKinnon announced today that New Zealand would contribute $20,000 to the relief programmes of the Solomon Islands Red Cross.

"The damage inflicted by Cyclone Fergus at Christmas put more pressure on the limited relief funds of the Solomon Islands Red Cross," Mr McKinnon said, "and this grant is further recognition of their good work."

The islands of Rennell, Bellona and Guadacanal were declared disaster areas after Cyclone Fergus claimed two lives, swept away homes and destroyed valuable food gardens. The Solomon Islands Red Cross is among the agencies providing short-term food relief for affected villagers.
