Priority will be given by the Ministry of Womens Affairs to addressing the gender pay gap between men and women.

Womens Affairs Minister Christine Fletcher, said today the Ministry had identified productivity differences, occupational segregation and discrimination as three specific areas contributing to the gap.

The Ministry will be looking at options which might be effective in eliminating gender based discrimination in remuneration and employment.

Women have made progress on this issue over the past decade. We want to keep up the momentum through a combination of education, research and encouragement of equal employment opportunity policies.

The Minister said no measure on its own, including legislation, was likely to be effective. We have to keep moving ahead in all areas through persuasion and education.

The Select Committee, will continue to monitor the progress in Womens Affairs issues and statistics. I will continue to discuss these issues with womens groups.
