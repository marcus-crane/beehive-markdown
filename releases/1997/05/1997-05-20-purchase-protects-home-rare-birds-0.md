The Minister of Conservation Nick Smith today announced the purchase of 151 hectares of podocarp forest on the banks of the Whataroa river, that will provide a permanent winter home for some of New Zealand's rare birds.

"Since human habitation we have reduced the forest area of New Zealand from over 70 percent to less than 30 percent. This has resulted in a huge loss of habitats for our native birds. This block of tall dense podocarp forest has an outstanding conservation value and will provide an important winter habitat for birds like robin, falcon, parakeet and kaka."

The forest is perched on a lateral moraine of the former Whataroa Glacier. The forest is situated at Abut Head on the north bank of the Whataroa River near to Saltwater Scenic Reserve and Saltwater Ecological Area. It is of outstanding value for nature conservation and was a valuable addition to public land by the Government's Forest Heritage Fund.

"This is a major purchase of land, where conservationists and our native flora and fauna are the real winners. Conservationists have long sought the protection of the three privately owned sections at Abut Head and the purchase of one of those blocks from the Paynter Timber Group is welcomed. This purchase shows the value of the Forest Heritage Fund.''

The block was no longer required by Paynters who offered it to the Crown for protection. The settlement was finalised at the beginning of May. The adjoining section owners are understood to be pursuing sustainable management of their forests under the Forests Amendment Act. That action combined with the current purchase would ensure the Abut Head forests would remain intact.
