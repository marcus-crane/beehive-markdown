The Coalition Government has given the go-ahead for the Auckland Regional Services Trust (ARST) to establish a divestment unit, to investigate the sale of the Yellow Bus Company, Transport Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

\`\`The Coalition Government has made it clear to ARST that if any sale takes place it will have to be consistent with the principles set down in the Coalition Agreement. The Coalition Government also expects that any money from any sale would be spent on Auckland's priority areas such as traffic congestion, so that the people of Auckland benefit directly.''

Mrs Shipley says ARST has been instructed to proceed with the divestment process provided for in the Local Government Act. This will see it set up an independent divestment unit, of people with skills in valuing and selling shares or businesses, to prepare a divestment plan.

\`\`Once a divestment plan is prepared, by October this year, the Government will check to see whether any proposed sale is consistent with the Coalition Agreement. . \`\`Auckland is the only place in New Zealand where the divestment process required by the Local Government Act has not been completed.

\`\`The ultimate use of those funds would be considered as part of the review of ARST's future role and functions. The money from this sale will be spent on the people of Auckland, one way or another,'' Mrs Shipley concluded.
