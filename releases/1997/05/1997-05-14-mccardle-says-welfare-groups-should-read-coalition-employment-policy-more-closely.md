Opponents who claim that unemployment will not be solved by the Government's plans to involve the unemployed in community work and training should take a closer look at the Coalition Employment Policy, Peter McCardle, Minister of Employment said today.

\`\`In basing their opposition to the Government's employment plans solely on this one aspect of the employment strategy, they are overlooking several critical points,'' said Mr McCardle.

\`\`Firstly, the Government has quite clearly said that it is economic policy that will reduce unemployment in this country. An economic environment that enables business growth and industry prosperity is the key to generating job growth.''

\`\`Secondly, the Government has made its employment policy objectives quite clear. The first is to reduce the percentage of long-term unemployed people and the other is to enable job seekers to maintain their motivation, dignity and connection with the workforce by involving them in community work and training.'' said the Minister.

Mr McCardle said it would be simplistic for any government to purport that involving the unemployed in community work and training is a solution to unemployment.

He said that opponents need to put aside their pre-occupation with anti-\`\`workfare'' campaigns and consider the benefits that the entire employment policy will have for job seekers.

\`\`This Government aims to have a balanced and personalised approach to addressing unemployment that is not derived from any punitive motivation, but rather will deliver better outcomes for those job seekers most in need.''
