The selection process is now complete, with all 120 MPs having selected a young person to represent them in the 1997 Youth Parliament on 26th and 27th May.

The Youth Parliament, to be hosted by Hon Deborah Morris, provides a unique experience for young people to get together in a national forum, learn about the workings of Parliament and debate an issue on the floor of the House of Representatives.

The line up of Youth MPs is impressive, and no doubt many of the "real" MPs will be feeling a bit nervous once the nation sees the quality of possible future Parliamentarians.

Deborah Morris's own Youth MP, Matthew Nippert, is looking forward to the day.

"I want the Youth Parliament to look at the issues that are important for young people, and raise the profile of those issues.

"It will be really impressive if we can steer the debates and get the MPs to hear our concerns," said Matthew Nippert, Youth MP.

The topic for debate at the Youth Parliament will be decided next week once the Ministry of Youth Affairs compiles requests from the Youth MPs.

Matthew Nippert, a first year Victoria University student, wants to debate student loans and students allowances, as he believes that the cost of tertiary education is too high.
