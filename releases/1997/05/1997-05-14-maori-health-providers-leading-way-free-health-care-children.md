Maori health providers leading the way in free health care to children

Maori health providers are leading the way in free health care to the general public the Minister of Maori Affairs, the Hon Tau Henare, said today.

Mr Henare said the health reforms initiated by the previous Government enabled Maori to participate in providing health services to Maori like never before.

At the primary level that involved making GP services more accessible to Maori as a first port of call, rather than a last resort.

"The result has not seen a significant shift in the statistics immediately, but you can guarantee further downstream the effect on the health of our people will be meaningful," said Mr Henare.

"In some cases that's free health care fullstop - children and adults.

"So I'm a bit bewildered by suggestions that some GPs may have to charge some child patients a top-up charge on top of the generous government subsidy of $32.50 when a particular Maori health provider I know of in West Auckland can offer free health care to children on a subsidy of $25."

The service provided in West Auckland by the Waipareira Trust was available to both Maori and non-Maori.

"Free doctors' visits to children under six was a key plank of New Zealand First's during the last election and is obtainable if the GPs want it to become a reality for all New Zealanders.

"What the general public, the consumer, should be doing is asking their family doctor if their service is free. If not, why not, and if they're not satisfied to find another doctor.

"Between 80-95 per cent of the country's doctors are expected to sign up to an agreement with the regional health authorities to provide free health care to our nation's children. The other 20 per cent are still negotiating a settlement.

"If Maori health providers like Waipareira can do it, and be successful, and also expect to be better off financially after the the Government's offer of $32.50, why can't the GPs?"
