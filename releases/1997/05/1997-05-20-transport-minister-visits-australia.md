Transport Minister Jenny Shipley will make a four day trip to Australia this week, to attend the regular Australian Transport Council meeting and to visit Victoria to look at ACC and road safety issues.

\`\`The six-monthly transport meetings are a good opportunity for New Zealand ministers to exchange views with Australian federal and state ministers, who are facing many of the same issues.''

\`\`I have talks scheduled with the federal Minister, John Sharp, on matters of mutual interest.''

On her way to the meeting in Cairns, Mrs Shipley will spend two days visiting the state of Victoria, to have a first-hand look at the road safety programme there.

\`\`The Coalition Government is determined to get the road toll down in this country, and I am interested in investigating how the Victorian state government has dealt with issues such as penalties for dangerous drivers, and policy and public education on road safety.''

Mrs Shipley will also be looking at Victoria's accident compensation schemes, in her role as Minister for ACC.

\`\`It's a good opportunity for me to see how others are managing the challenges of providing fair and affordable accident compensation. The Victorians have advanced a number of issues that are part of our coalition agreement on ACC,'' Mrs Shipley concluded.
