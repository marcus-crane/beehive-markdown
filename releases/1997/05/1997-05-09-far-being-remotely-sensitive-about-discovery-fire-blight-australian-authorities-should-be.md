\`\`Far from being remotely sensitive about the discovery of fire blight, Australian authorities should be grateful that a keen eyed New Zealand scientist was about and able to bring the disease to their attention'', Simon Upton suggested today.

\`\`Both countries have an interest in knowing when their biosecurity systems might have failed and in learning for the future'', concluded Mr Upton, New Zealand's Minister for Biosecurity.
