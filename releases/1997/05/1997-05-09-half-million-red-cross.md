Associate Foreign Minister Simon Upton today announced a further grant of $150,000 to the New Zealand Red Cross to support the cost of sending New Zealanders to work in relief operations overseas. The contribution brings total Government contributions this year to $500,000 - the highest ever level.

\`\`New Zealand Red Cross workers have an outstanding reputation in some of the world's most difficult and dangerous relief operations,'' Mr Upton said. \`\`Not only are they very committed but they are using traditional New Zealand common sense and adaptability to save lives and improve living conditions for some of the world's most vulnerable people.''

The grant, from New Zealand's Official Development Assistance programme, will assist the Red Cross to send more New Zealanders with professional, medical and logistical skills to work in relief operations in over 16 countries around the world on assignments which include refugee resettlement in Rwanda and bringing relief supplies to remote villages on the island of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea.
