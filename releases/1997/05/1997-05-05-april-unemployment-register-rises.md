Employment Minister Peter McCardle said today that the registered unemployment statistics for April 1997 rose by 5130 to 157,841, an increase of 3.4% over the month.

\`\`While I am naturally disappointed to see any rise in the register, analysis of the change indicates that it was due in part to the end of some seasonal employment, slower economic growth, and to technical changes in the administration of the register.''

\`\`In regard to the latter, new enrolments were only 423 higher in April 1997 compared to April 1996. However, the number of people who left the register last month was more than 8000 fewer than in April last year.''

Mr McCardle said that a number of other factors during April, including changes to work-test procedures and the addition of newly work-tested beneficiary groups from April 1, also contributed to the increase in the register.

\`\`New beneficiary groups who began joining the register contributed nearly 900 new enrolments over the month.''

Mr McCardle said he would continue to concentrate employment policy on achieving better outcomes for long-term job seekers and reducing the percentage of long-term unemployed; while the Government will continue working to achieve the stronger economic growth essential to reducing the overall level of unemployment.
