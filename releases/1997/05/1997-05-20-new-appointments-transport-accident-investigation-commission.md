Former Transport Minister Bill Jeffries has been appointed as Chief Commissioner of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC), Transport Minister Jenny Shipley announced today.

Mrs Shipley says the Coalition Government has also appointed Auckland aviation consultant Norman Macfarlane as a commissioner.

The TAIC was established in 1990 as an independent body, to determine the circumstances and causes of incidents and accidents with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future. It covers aviation, rail and maritime accidents.

Mr Jeffries will replace current Chief Commissioner Malcolm Dunphy of Wellington, who has completed two three-year terms on the TAIC, and Mr Macfarlane will replace John Keegan, who has also served two terms as a Commissioner.

\`\`Bill Jeffries has a great deal of relevant experience, both as a former Minister of Transport, Civil Aviation and Meteorological Services, and as a barrister. That experience will be valuable in his leadership of the TAIC.

\`\`Norman Macfarlane is a Master Mariner and a Member of the Chartered Institute of Transport, and also brings a great deal of useful knowledge of the industry to the TAIC,'' the Minister concluded.
