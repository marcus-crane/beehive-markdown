The Coalition Government will take a four-pronged approach to strengthening education and schools in the South Auckland suburbs of Mangere and Otara.

"There have been too many reports criticising the quality of education provided in Mangere and Otara. The most recent was in August last year when the Education Review Office highlighted the need for urgent solutions," said Education Minister Wyatt Creech.

"It is all too easy to point out the problems. Solutions are much harder. They require consistent, focused effort.

"The Coalition Government is determined to lift educational achievement in Mangere and Otara. I am concerned that parents and students by-pass their local schools to get their education. We want them to choose their local schools because the standards are high.

"While there will be significant extra resources for the initiatives, the solution is not to just 'throw money at the problem'. This must be a community-wide effort. The schools, the communities and Government agencies need to play their part. They need to get into action and work together to get solutions."

There are four strands to the initiatives:

INSIDE THE SCHOOL GATE

Schools do not have the same difficulties or needs, therefore across-the-board interventions are not appropriate.

Two highly-skilled coordinators will be appointed (one for each community) to work out exactly what each school needs to improve, and to work with the school to get results.

The coordinators will help schools determine the specific support, training, advisory, professional and technical services needed to improve their school.

Coordinators will work with individual schools and with clusters of schools to develop action plans to lift the quality of education. Contracts, with agreed milestones, will be drawn up to give effect to the action plans.

Rigorous monitoring and assessment of progress will ensure each school is accountable for any extra funding made available.

THE STRUCTURE AND TYPE OF SCHOOLS

Initiatives to improve schooling in Mangere and Otara must include a coherent plan developed with the community to cover the nature and structure of schooling in the area.

The Mangere Schooling Development Plan, which is well advanced, will be completed to finalise the best way to structure schooling in Mangere.

An Otara Schooling Development Plan will be developed in consultation with the community to work out the best and most effective way to structure schooling and use the schooling resources in Otara.

THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

The Ministry of Education will work more closely with key agencies, particularly Health and Social Welfare to coordinate their efforts and support improved education in Mangere and Otara.

OTHER GOVERNMENT POLICY

New initiatives in programmes such as Special Education 2000, Teacher Supply, Maori Education Strategy, the Pacific Island Education Plan will contribute to raising educational achievement in Mangere and Otara. So will new resourcing for schools to be announced in the Budget.

"The education problems in Mangere and Otara have a long history and will not be resolved overnight," Mr Creech said.

"What we are putting in place is designed to get to the heart of the problems faced, rather than attack the symptoms. They cannot be solved by one simple Government intervention to make everything work.

"The Government is prepared to spend substantial amounts of money and effort to support schools, but we have to be confident that it will make a difference."

Mr Creech said each school and community will have to come up with solutions that work best for them.

"The solutions will have to be backed by a strong and tangible commitment and an accountability to implement any agreed strategy."

Funding for the initiatives is part of the budget for the Schools Support Project, to be announced in the June Budget.

"The nature of the response to issues in Mangere and Otara reflects the thrust of the Coalition Government's Budget," Mr Creech said. "We want to work with and support communities to solve the problems, but we also recognise the need for parents and students to play a part as well."
