The Government has announced details of Phase Two of its Special Education 2000 package which provides assured and consistent resourcing for students with high and very high special educational needs throughout their schooling.

The new policy was released by the Education Minister Wyatt Creech today during a visit to Wellington's Naenae Intermediate School.

"This step represents major progress for special education in New Zealand. It reflects the priority the Coalition Government is giving to improving education," Mr Creech said.

Phase Two of Special Education 2000 is focused on students with high and very high needs. It follows the first stage announced in last year's Budget which provided $55 million in additional funding over three years to supply a Special Education Grant for students with moderate needs such as learning and behaviour difficulties.

Students have high or very high needs because they require intensive support to assist their learning or to meet personal assistance needs at school.

The five key components of the new Special Education package are:

The Ongoing Resourcing Scheme - funding for students who have ongoing special education needs will follow them wherever they go to school and throughout their school years. To ensure the details are right a trial-run of the Ongoing Resourcing Scheme process will be conducted.

Assistance for students whose high special education needs can be met through an intensive programme over a limited period of time. Final decisions have yet to be made but the proposed initiatives include:  
Support for students with severe behavioural difficulties: Behaviour Intervention Support, Centres for extra support and special education teachers. Support for students with significant speech or language difficulties: The focus would be on children in their early years where the impact is the greatest.

More help for children with special education needs in early childhood:  
It is proposed that services be increased to provide more co-ordinated specialist advice and support, teaching and paraprofessional support to children up to the age of five.

Professional development and training on special education for boards of trustees, principals and teachers.

Monitoring and evaluation to ensure the success and ongoing development of the programme to ensure it is effective.  
"The Coalition Government plans to substantially increase the services for students with high and very high needs. In a bid to make sure we have the details right we will conduct a trial-run of the Ongoing Resourcing Scheme process for establishing the eligibility of students with ongoing needs," said Mr Creech.

"The trial-run will be conducted over the next three months and once completed final decisions will be made on the shape of the initiatives for all high needs students. \`\`We want to make absolutely sure we have a fair and transparent way of doing this,'' Mr Creech said.

Mr Creech said the Government was determined to correct what it sees as the current inequity in special education support where support levels vary depending on where a child is at school. This new initiative provides consistent support across the board.

The indicative level of funding for Special Education 2000 will be released in this year's Budget.
