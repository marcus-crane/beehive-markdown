Responding to Labour's suggestion that the Government's plans to require unemployed job seekers to be available for community work and training may breach international labour conventions, Employment Minister Peter McCardle says Mr Maharey is attempting to make a big deal out of nothing when he suggests information that has been withheld from the response to his Official Information Act request ought to be released.

\`\`A small portion of information was withheld on the legitimate grounds that to release it would pre-empt the work of Officials on the proposed structure of that particular aspect of the employment strategy. Nor would the release of such information at this time be in the best interests of public debate on the final structure of the policy.''

\`\`I would add that on both points I have had no disagreement from the Ombudsman.'' said Mr McCardle.

Mr McCardle said that Labour's criticism of the Community Work and Training proposal was a transparent attempt to create opposition to an initiative that the vast majority of the public, employers and job seekers welcome.

\`\`Everyone I speak with, including interest groups, the unemployed, employers and the general public, understand that it is a nonsense to pay fit and able job seekers to lose touch with the work ethic, lose their motivation, their dignity and their self-esteem.''

\`\`The Government's commitment to involving job seekers in suitable part-time community work or training while they are looking for permanent work has widespread support.''

\`\`I am determined to address the stubborn long-term unemployment statistics that this country still faces which were created by the last Labour Government and I am not going to be distracted by futile attempts to derail what is just one component of a comprehensive employment strategy.'' concluded the Minister.
