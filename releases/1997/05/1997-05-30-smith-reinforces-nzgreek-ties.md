Ties between Greece and New Zealand remain close, says International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith.

Speaking at the end of an official visit to Athens from May 28-29, Dr Smith said: "I was impressed by the warmth of the Greek people towards New Zealanders. They have clearly never forgotten the contribution of Kiwi soldiers in Greece and Crete during World War Two."

Dr Smith said he had two primary objectives for his visit to Greece: to reinforce the longstanding friendship between the Greeks and New Zealanders and to learn how well this Mediterranean member of the European Union was coping with agricultural trade reform.

"It is important that we do not think of the EU in terms only of the larger countries like France, Germany and Britain. If reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is to succeed, countries like Greece must be committed to the process too.

"I was encouraged by the comments my Greek trade and agricultural colleagues made. As National Economic Under-Secretary Baltas put it, despite adaption difficulties, the trend towards more open competition is inevitable. He added the process was moving faster than expected. Of course, in my view, it has to." Dr Smith said he was pleased to hear the Greek Deputy Minister of Agriculture indicate subsequently that the Greek Government foresaw a time when subsidies would no longer exist in farming.

While in Athens, Dr Smith also held discussions with representatives from the Athens Chamber of Commerce. The Athens chamber is the largest in Greece with 55,000 members. Dr Smith said the business people were particularly interested in how New Zealand had coped with economic reform.
