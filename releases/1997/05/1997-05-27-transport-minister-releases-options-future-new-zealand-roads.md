"As the New Zealand economy continues to grow, large parts of our country's roading network are struggling to cope with increasing traffic. We need to come up with a management and funding system that will meet the demands of the future in an economically sound and sustainable way", Transport Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

Mrs Shipley today released a discussion document which presents five options for funding and managing the country's roading network, drawn from the results of the four-year Land Transport Pricing Study.

"Currently funding comes from fuel taxes, heavy vehicle road user charges and rates. There is evidence as a result of the study that some road users pay more than their share, and some considerably less.

" This final stage of the pricing study invites all road users to be involved in deciding how we should deal with road funding and management in the future.

"The five options range from the status quo, to a fully commercial model, where the roading network would be transferred to either one or a number of commercial enterprises, jointly owned by both central and local government. Some options would see road users pay more of the cost of roading, while others see rates removed from road funding.

"I invite everyone to take a constructive approach as they consider each of the options.

"If we do not take steps to improve the roading system it will not be able to support continued economic growth. Congestion, unsafe road conditions and pollution will all become an everyday part of driving if changes do not occur," Mrs Shipley said.

The "Options for the Future" document is available from the Ministry of Transport, and submissions can be made before August 15. The Government will then discuss the submissions with an advisory panel of sector group representatives, before making final decisions in October. Any major changes will occur during 1998-99.
