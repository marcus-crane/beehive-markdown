Employment Minister Peter McCardle said today a computer error meant that the actual number of registered unemployed at the end of April 1997 was 6104 less than stated in the New Zealand Employment Service's mid-May release of statistics. There were 151,737 people registered with NZES at the end of April 1997. This represents a drop of 974 from March to April this year.

"I understand from officials that a change to a computer programme caused the register to be overstated by 6104 at the end of April." said Mr McCardle.

"The correct figures now show that registered unemployment actually fell slightly over the month, despite the end of some seasonal work and the arrival of newly work-tested beneficiaries onto the register."

"The Employment Service has corrected the mistake, and I have made it very clear that I expect future figures to be an accurate total of the numbers registered as unemployed."

The Minister concluded by saying that the New Zealand Employment Service would be in a position to release the corrected regional statistics in conjunction with the May register release on Thursday 12th June, 1997.
