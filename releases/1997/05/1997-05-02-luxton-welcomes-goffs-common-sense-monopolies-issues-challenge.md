Minister of Commerce and Industry, Hon John Luxton today said he welcomed the common sense of Labour s Phil Goff on monopolies, but challenged the Labour Party to get consistency into its policies.

Mr Luxton's comments follow a story in The Independent newspaper today (page 2) reporting that Mr Goff (perhaps NZs Tony Blair) was preparing a private members Bill seeking to remove lawyers' monopoly over conveyancing.

\`\`Phil Goff does talk some sense even if he appears to be at odds with his party. As he rightly says, \`\`There is no justification whatsoever for lawyers to have this monopoly.''. He knows that monopolies mean more expensive goods and services for New Zealand families.

\`\`But New Zealanders would also benefit from the innovation, the drive and Kiwi ingenuity that monopolies prevent. We underestimate the lost opportunities because of monopolies. All New Zealanders are paying a high price for this through not only higher prices, but less choice, delays, and opportunity costs.

\`\`I have had my officials working on the conveyancing monopoly for some time. I am pleased that Mr Goff has shown he will now be a strong supporter of any moves to free New Zealanders of monopolies.

\`\`I expect him and his Labour colleagues to support moves to address these and other monopolies imposed by legislation on New Zealanders in areas such as pharmacies, optometrists, registered teachers, local government, and the like.

\`\`I am surprised though that Mr Goff's Labour Party appear to oppose deregulation of another obvious monopoly, NZ Post.

\`\`And only last year Labour forced pointless legislation through Parliament to give monopoly rights to registered teachers and thus restrict the ability of subject specialists to teach our children, which inhibits their education.

\`\`With Phil Goffs common sense leadership, I look forward to supporting Labours efforts to now also repeal this Act and further tackle other monopolies.

\`\`Perhaps this parliamentary term will see more progressive reform than first thought given such a meeting of minds on all sides,'' Mr Luxton concluded.
