Employment Minister, Hon Peter McCardle announced today that the Community Employment Group is moving quickly to co-ordinate a government response to the closure of Heinz-Wattie's petfood and prepared foods operation in Gisborne.

The closure, announced by the company yesterday, is expected to cause a loss of up to 170 jobs, although up to 100 new jobs could be established with the new operation in Hastings.

\`\`Community Employment Group staff intend to meet with Gisborne's Mayor, representatives of Heinz-Wattie and worker representatives, and to co-ordinate a response by Government Agencies in the city over the next week.''

\`\`I understand that the Community Employment Group Advisor who has flown to Gisborne today to co-ordinate the response has been involved in co-ordinating such initiatives during a number of major redundancies throughout New Zealand over the last few years.'' said Mr McCardle.

\`\`He also played a key role in the aftermath of last year's Mt Ruapehu eruptions, helping to ensure that those workers affected by business closures in the region, as well as businesses threatened with collapse at the time, had access to appropriate government support.''

The Community Employment Group is a service of the Department of Labour which works with communities and groups to create local opportunities for employment and positive activity leading to self-sufficiency. It has also developed expertise in helping communities respond to large-scale redundancies.

\`\`I am confident that the Group will make every effort to co-ordinate government assistance in Gisborne so that the effect of the closure on the community can be minimised.'' concluded Mr McCardle.
