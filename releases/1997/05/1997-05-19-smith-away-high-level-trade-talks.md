Helping break down barriers to agricultural trade will be the top priority for International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith during an overseas mission which begins tomorrow.

A meeting of the Cairns Group of leading agricultural producing nations in Rio De Janeiro on June 5-6 will focus on these barriers. Dr Smith said.

"Our agenda will include what progress has been made on implementing the agriculture trade liberalisation commitments from the GATT Uruguay Round negotiations.

"The Cairns Group considers it vitally important that all nations stick to their commitments. We'll also look ahead to see how we can further dismantle barriers to agricultural trade," Dr Smith said.

Before the Cairns group meeting, Dr Smith will also be in Rio De Janeiro on June 4 for the inaugural CER/MERCOSUR Ministerial Meeting. This will bring together the trade ministers of the CER partners, Australia and New Zealand, along with their counterparts from MERCOSUR, the free trade group linking Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.

"I hope that this meeting will lead to a work programme for closer trade and economic cooperation and integration between the MERCOSUR and CER economies," Dr Smith said

On May 26-27 the minister will attend the annual OECD Ministerial Council meeting in Paris. The gathering, which will concentrate on global economic matters, will also look at ways to further strengthen the multilateral trading system.

The first part of the overseas work programme involves annual bilateral trade talks with the United States in Washington on May 21-23. A range of bilateral trade issues are due to be discussed and there will be exploratory talks on a free trade arrangement between New Zealand and the US.

Bilateral trade issues affecting Mexico and New Zealand are also due to be discussed in Mexico City on June 2.

On May 29 Dr Smith will be in London to attend the highly symbolic closure of New Zealand's Debt Management Office (DMO).

While in London -- and also during a visit to Greece -- Dr Smith will meet trade counterparts and reinforce New Zealand's interests in trade with Europe.
