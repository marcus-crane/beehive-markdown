Employment Minister Peter McCardle said today he was amused that Labour's employment spokesperson was not able to tell the difference between a leak and public consultation.

"Mr Maharey seems to think that an invitation from the Employment Steering Group to over 480 organisations nearly two months ago, including the CTU, Employers Federation, Local Authorities, employment and training delivery organisations and other interested community groups across the country, seeking their input into the development of the Government's Employment Strategy, is some sort of secret squirrel exercise."

"The opportunity for these groups to have their say also includes a number of hui being run by the Steering Group, as well as several job seeker focus groups. The survey also featured in a number of widely-distributed publications several weeks ago." said Mr McCardle.

"There is wide public interest in the Government's employment strategy and many groups have been keen to contribute to the policy development process even from the earliest stages. Naturally I welcome their input."

"I suggest Mr Maharey continue to dedicate his energies to distancing the Labour Party from the Labour Party that not only delivered us over 100,000 more unemployed, but far worse, increased this country's socially destructive long-term unemployment figures by over 600%." said Mr McCardle.
