The Alliance and the PPTA are shamelessly politicking by planning their own reviews of the Education Review Office, the Minister responsible for the Office Brian Donnelly said today.

In the past two days the PPTA has announced that it is planning its own 'independent' review of ERO, and Alliance MP Liz Gordon has called for the Education and Science Select Committee to enquire into the Office.

"These Johnny-come-latelies are three months too late. They have obviously called for these reviews because they don't like the fact that ERO identifies problems that schools have the power to fix themselves. Unlike these politicians, ERO doesn't simply blame the Government and call for more funding as the solution to every problem," Mr Donnelly said.

"It was New Zealand First policy to review ERO, and that was written into the coalition agreement."

"I have put in many hours of work with officials and other ministers this year to develop the terms of reference and identify independent people who could do such a review."

"I shudder to think what biased results the PPTA and Liz Gordon, who have shown themselves to be quite antagonistic to ERO and its chief executive, would come up with."

"For a review to have any credibility, it will have to be an open process, carried out by respected, independent people."
