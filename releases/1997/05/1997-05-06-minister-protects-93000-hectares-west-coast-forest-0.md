Conservation Minister Nick Smith today formally protected 92 945 hectares of native forest on the West Coast at a special ceremony at Maruia.

"This is a huge achievement for conservation. It is the largest number of reserves ever to be set aside for permanent protection at one time in New Zealand, and consists of 55 ecological, wildlife and scenic reserves of predominantly beech and podocarp forest. The land area exceeds that of Tongariro National Park."

The gazetting of these reserves was a Coalition Government commitment and the Minister is pleased the Government has delivered on such a significant conservation landmark so early in its term. The ceremony and signing today at Marble Hill, Maruia was attended by some of the original signatories to the Accord, who then proceeded on a short tramp through the beech forest.

"The battlelines were drawn here at Maruia between foresters and greenies two decades ago. The plan was to clearfell these forests to produce sawlogs, chip and pulp for export. It ignited a nation-wide controversy culminating in the signing of the Maruia Declaration and the presentation in 1977 to parliament of one of the largest ever petitions."

The West Coast Accord, signed in 1986, identified these areas for protection and for the phasing out of unsustainable logging. There has been a huge amount of protracted and complex work required to identify, survey and make the necessary legislative changes to enable these reserves to be gazetted today. The Minister paid tribute to the original signatories of the Accord and Dr Roger Blakely who led the negotiations.

A decade ago, the West Coast Accord represented a huge step forward. Subsequent legislation now requires that all native forests be managed sustainably but the law exempts overcutting of 7000 ha of West Coast forests until 2006. This is a source of current controversy and an issue the government will need to work through.

"I am concerned about the continued overcutting of our native forest on the West Coast. I am here to learn, look and listen. I look forward to receiving advice from the West Coast Conservation Board following their site visits today. The current logging controversy should not overshadow the size of today's conservation achievement. This is a milestone on New Zealand's road to a sustainable future. I am confident that future generations will thank us for taking this step."
