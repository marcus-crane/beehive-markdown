Prime Minister Jim Bolger is to visit Melbourne for the launch of the second ANZAC frigate \`\`Te Mana'' from May 9 to 11.

Mr Bolger today confirmed that \`\`Te Mana'' would be officially launched by the Maori Queen, Dame Te Atairangikaahu at a ceremony to be attended by the Australian Prime Minister John Howard and New Zealand's Minister of Defence Paul East.

Mr Bolger will also hold private discussions with Mr Howard over lunch on May 10.

\`\`I am looking forward to meeting Mr Howard for the second time this year and further developing our excellent working relationship,'' Mr Bolger said.

\`\`We will cover a wide range of issues of mutual interest including bilateral and regional matters.

\`\`The meeting will also provide a good opportunity to update each other on developments since Mr Howard's visit to New Zealand in February.''

Mr Bolger will also meet with the Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett during his two-day visit.
