Prime Minister Jim Bolger today announced the appointment of Michael Wintringham as State Services Commissioner and Chief Executive of the State Services Commission.

Mr Bolger said Mr Wintringham brings to the position a broad range of experience at the most senior levels of Public Service, as well as successful practice in the private sector.

\`\`This experience combined with his skills in policy advice and relationship management, will ensure the public sector continues to provide a modern and relevant response to the requirements of the government,'' Mr Bolger said.

Mr Wintringham is currently the Chief Executive of the Ministry of Housing, a position he has held since June 1996.

Prior to that, Mr Wintringham spent three years as Assistant Auditor General in the Office of the Auditor-General and from 1991-1993, was Health Reforms Coordinator in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.

Mr Wintringham also spent four years with Hay Management Consultants, first as a consultant and later as a director of the firm and manager of its Wellington office.

Mr Wintringham has previously held various positions within Treasury, including a four year secondment as Economic Counsellor at the New Zealand Embassy in Washington.

Mr Wintringham will replace Commissioner Don Hunn when he retires from the position later in the month.

The Commissioner has a key management role in the Public Service.

The Commissioner is responsible for appointing chief executives and operating the chief executive performance management system, as well as developing and maintaining appropriate values and standards of behaviour in the public sector.

Mr Hunn has recently been undertaking major work on improving the accountability of senior executives in the public sector.

Mr Wintringham's experience would ensure that focus continued, Mr Bolger said.
