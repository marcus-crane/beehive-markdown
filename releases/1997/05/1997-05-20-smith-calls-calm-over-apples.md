International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith has called for calm over the discovery of fire blight symptons in Australia by New Zealand scientists.

"I can understand how upset Australian growers are about this.

"But much good can come of it, as Australia's Primary Industries Minister John Anderson has acknowledged. It means Australia will be looking at stopping the spread of the disease earlier than might otherwise have been the case.

"I hope all involved in the issue on both sides of the Tasman can work together constructively to determine the exact extent of the problem in Australia and what measures are needed to combat it."
