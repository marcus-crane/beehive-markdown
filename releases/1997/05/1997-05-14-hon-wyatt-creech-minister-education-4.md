Education Minister Wyatt Creech has considered a viability report on Petone College and agreed the school should work with other schools to provide more opportunities for its students.

The viability report was commissioned by the Ministry of Education and the Petone College Board of Trustees to analyse problems at the school and to identify ways of strengthening education at the school.

Petone College has capacity for about 900 students. Its current roll is 247. The Lower Hutt sub-district contains approximately 6000 secondary aged students.

"I am very concerned that significant numbers of students by-pass Petone College to enrol at Hutt Valley High, Naenae College and other Wellington secondary schools," Mr Creech said. "The trend needs to be turned around.

"Recent action and new initiatives introduced by the school board of trustees, principal and staff already appear to be bringing positive changes to the school. However the roll is still too low to provide the depth and range of curriculum needed to be able to attract more students.

"I have decided that the best option for the school and the local community is for the board to consult with other schools and groups in the area to develop partnerships to provide greater opportunities for students."

Mr Creech said he had asked the Ministry of Education and the Petone College Board of Trustees to meet and develop an action plan to show how this can be done, when and at what cost.

The Ministry of Education will be reporting to the Minister at regular intervals on progress.

"This move will ensure there is an ongoing provision of secondary education for the Petone Community. It is an important step forward for Petone College. I hope the local community will get behind the Board of Trustees and support the work it does do to improve the education provided by the school.
