International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith has successfully persuaded the OECD to undertake analysis aimed at contributing to the WTO's Agricultural Work Programme on trade liberalisation.

"There is a traditional reluctance, especially in Europe, to do anything in the field of agriculture," said Dr Smith, who has been attending the OECD's Ministerial meeting in Paris.

"But the logic of the OECD using its analytical expertise in this area is inescapable. I was pleasantly surprised that a number of EU members supported the proposal."

Dr Smith there was a lot of discussion at the meeting about the possibility of a new round of multilateral trade negotiations beginning at the turn of the century.

"If that is to happen, and I think it is inevitable, then a lot of work has to be done before then. Agricultural issues are becoming more complicated and I am confident that the OECD will be able to make a substantive contribution here."

Dr Smith was also a lead speaker on economic growth and social cohesion, which was the other main item on the meeting's agenda.

"OECD countries take a lot of interest in the reforms New Zealand has undertaken and the results we have achieved," the minister said.

"It is a credit to us to be asked to lead the discussion on this item. While the debate showed some difference of opinion on the speed and vigour with which reforms can be introduced, no-one now seriously questions the direction New Zealand has taken."

New Zealand was singled out for praise by the OECD for its job policies. A report on implementation of the OECD Jobs Study recommendations -- released just before the meeting -- commended New Zealand, along with the UK, Holland and Ireland, for our achievements. The report emphasised the reduction in unemployment in New Zealand since 1991.

"Other countries are amazed at what has been achieved in this respect," Dr Smith said.

The minister took the opportunity in Paris to have a number of one-on-one meetings with other ministers.

"In particular I had some good discussions with US Secretary of Commerce Bill Daley and World Trade Organisation director-general Renato Ruggiero."
