New Zealand has some really ridiculous regulation on its books, Minister of Commerce and Industry Hon John Luxton said today.

For example we have the ELECTRIC-TRAM DRIVERS (MEDICAL EXAMINATION) REGULATIONS 1957, which regulates one eyed tram drivers.

If a one eyed person wants to drive an electric tram but they havent done so before, then they cant. But if they have driven one before then they can. If they break this regulation they are liable for a fine of 5 pounds.

Obviously, like much regulation, this isnt quite an up to date, relevant or useful regulation.

I believe much regulation has been passed to try and cure the problems of the past, but infact ends up preventing progress in the future. Since 1987 Government has enacted over 1600 new or amended statutes and over 3700 new or amended regulations.

I am not sure that this helps kiwi ingenuity and innovation. We need to have more consideration of all the wider costs and benefits of proposed regulation before we as politicians rush into passing them.

Perhaps we politicians need a regulation on one eyed politicians. I wonder if are any ex tram drivers as MPs.

We need to revisit some of these old ridiculous one eyed regulations that need patched up, Mr Luxton concluded.
