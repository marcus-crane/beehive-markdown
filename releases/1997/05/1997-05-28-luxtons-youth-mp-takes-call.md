The Minister of Commerce, Hon John Luxton, welcomed the arrival of Sean Teddy, Youth MP this week.

Sean, Deputy Head Boy of Matamata College, took Mr Luxton's place in the debating chamber this Monday and Tuesday when the second Youth Parliament convened in Wellington. The country's MPs got two days off their parliamentary duties when 120 young people replaced each politician in select committees and a general debate to learn about Parliament and the way the country is governed.

Sean said that his visit had been a great chance to see inside the processes of Parliament and Government, and that the Minister's Office was "way cool".

The Youth MPs, selected through various debating and essay competitions, represented their electorates, rather than their real-life counterparts, and debated the introduction of universal student allowances, a move the coalition government has stopped short of promising in its first term.

Mr Luxton welcomed the opportunity to talk through the issues with his youth representative, who saw the opportunity with the Youth Parliament to play an active role in the issues concerning all young people.
