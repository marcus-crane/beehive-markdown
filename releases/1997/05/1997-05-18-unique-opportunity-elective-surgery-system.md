Health Minister Bill English said today that the implementation of the elective surgery Booking System was a unique opportunity to get a system in place that was fair for all New Zealanders waiting for surgery.

"New Zealand is ahead of other countries in what we are trying to do with the Booking System in that we are working towards a system which is consistent right across the country.

"People need certainty about what they can expect from the public health service and they also need to know they are being treated fairly. I want to see someone in Auckland assessed and scored on the same grounds as someone needing surgery in Southland.

"This is a different approach than what was originally planned with the Booking System, in that the original plan would have seen a different assessment and scoring systems developed by each regional health authority.

"With the establishment of the Health Funding Authority we have the opportunity of integrating the four systems. A study based on the system developed in the northern region, which has been reported in the media today, shows there are some problems that need ironing out.

"It also shows that we need the help of hospital specialists to get the best system developed. It is important that we get the input now into problems with the four systems and I am pleased that this study has been done. Doctors are taking the issues seriously because they can see benefits for their patients if we get it right.

"Moving to a single system has slowed up the process of implementing the Booking System to some extent. We have had to look at the best features of the four systems and work out a way of integrating them into one scoring system. Hospitals will continue to implement the systems they have been working on, but over time these will shift towards a new, single system for assessing and scoring people's need for surgery.

"On 1 July, which the Booking System starts, a significant number of people waiting for elective surgery will be able to be booked, and we will be able to advise other people that they fall below the clinically acceptable level for surgery. However, there will still be a number of people on waiting lists. As more and more hospitals have their Booking Systems in place across all specialties the number of people on waiting lists will reduce," he said.

Mr English said the HFA would brief journalists in more detail on Wednesday about progress with the Booking System.
