On the eve of the Queen's Birthday weekend holiday, Transport Minister Jenny Shipley is urging New Zealanders to drive safely.

"Holiday weekends, particularly if the weather is bad, often have a high toll of avoidable deaths and injuries.

"After a particularly poor start to this year's road toll, in May there has been an improvement. There have been 36 deaths in May so far this year, compared to 42 on the same date last May. I appeal to all New Zealanders to drive carefully this weekend so the numbers keep improving, and families are spared the agony of avoidable deaths.

"While I am pleased to see that the number of alcohol related deaths has fallen over the past seven years, unfortunately speed is still the most common contributing factor to road deaths.

In 1995, 221 people were killed in speed related crashes, with 178 speed-related deaths in 1996. In comparison, in 1995 200 people were killed in alcohol-related crashes, with 147 alcohol related deaths in 1996.

"To reinforce the message that speed is dangerous, I'm considering recommending to Cabinet that we introduce an Australian initiative, where the demerit points for speed offences were doubled over a holiday weekend period.

"In the Australian state of Victoria the Roads Minister temporarily doubled the demerit points over the Easter period. That was accompanied by a major advertising campaign, to ensure the public was aware of the move, and enhanced enforcement. As a result, the Easter road toll was just a third of the level of previous years (four deaths this Easter, compared to 11-12 in previous years). Drive carefully this holiday weekend", Mrs Shipley concluded.
