Concern about the hours schools are open has prompted the Education Review Office Minister Brian Donnelly to ask ERO to investigate how schools are meeting their legal requirements.

"Now that we have standard dates for school terms it will be clear to parents, boards of trustees and principals exactly when their schools should be open for instruction," Mr. Donnelly said.

"Under the Education Act 1989 primary schools are required to be open for instruction for 197 days, while secondary and composite schools have to be open for 190 days."

"Essentially the Government is purchasing these amounts of learning times for students and, as such, students are entitled to this amount of tuition."

"Anecdotal evidence suggests that some schools might not be providing students with the full amount of tuition to which they are entitled."

"I have asked ERO to find out how boards are managing their obligations to be open for instruction, especially at the beginning and end of the year. I've asked the Chief Review Officer to provide information on the number of days lost, and what might be causing any shortfall in learning time."

"The initial report, which is due at the end of the second term, will focus on the beginning of the school year in secondary schools. I intend to ask ERO for a similar report on primary schools at a later date."

"Research is quite clear that engaged academic learning time is a significant factor in achievement levels. I want every student to have the maximum opportunity for learning in our schools."

"There may be workload issues involved, or it could be that Boards of Trustees are not fully aware of their obligations. It's possible that the law may place contradictory demands upon Boards."

"There would also seem to be a tension inherent in the fact that parents are legally required to ensure that their children attend school on every day it is open for instruction."

"Therefore, I have asked for reports at both the middle and the end of the year, which will provide in-depth information on the issue."

"At this stage I am seeking an enhanced awareness of all parties of the issue."
