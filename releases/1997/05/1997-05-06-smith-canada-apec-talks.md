International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith leaves for Canada today to attend the APEC Trade Ministers meeting in Montreal on May 9-10.

Prior to the APEC gathering, he will meet with Canada's International Trade Minister Art Eggleton to discuss a number of bilateral trade issues.

The APEC Trade Ministers gathering will review the trade liberalisation Individual Action Plans (IAPs) of member economies.

"We'll be taking a lead in announcing in broad terms the ways in which New Zealand will be improving its IAP. I will be pressing other countries to upgrade their plans.

"We must ensure there is no loss of momentum to the APEC trade liberalisation process," Dr Smith said.

"Ministers will also be discussing further ways for APEC to contribute to multilateral liberalisation under the World Trade Organisation umbrella."
