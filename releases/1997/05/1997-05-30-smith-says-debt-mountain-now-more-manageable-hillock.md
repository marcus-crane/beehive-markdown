The mountain of foreign debt that had towered over the New Zealand economy was now a far more manageable hillock, International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith said at the historic closure of New Zealand's Debt Management Office (DMO) in London.

"British capital and the City obviously played a central role in the development of the New Zealand economy once European settlement began," Dr Smith said.

"So in a sense it's a sign of our economic maturity that we feel we no longer need this office." The DMO had previously maintained a presence in the major financial centre of London to help manage billions of dollars worth of foreign currency debt.

Net foreign currency debt was $16.3 billion in 1992.

But now that this net foreign currency debt has been eliminated in the wake of the Forestrycorp sale the London operation is no longer considered necessary.

Eliminating net foreign currency debt was "a very gratifying milestone" for the government to pass, Dr Smith said.

"It meant we had effectively insulated our small country's external indebtedness from the fluctuating vagaries of the international foreign currency markets." Dr Smith said the coalition planned to keep up the assault on debt.

"Our objective, outlined in this year's Budget Policy Statement, is to steadily reduce gross public debt to 30 per cent of GDP, against its current level of 37 per cent. We want to get net public debt down to 20 per cent of GDP, compared to the 27 per cent I mentioned earlier. We'll do this by continuing to run operating surpluses.

"Once those targets have been met we intend to gradually reduce the size of our operating surpluses through a mix of increased government spending and tax cuts."
