International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith says the APEC Trade Ministers meeting in Montreal this weekend has been very successful.

The meeting discussed Individual Action Plans or IAPs which outline APEC members' plans to free up trade.

Dr Smith said the \`\`lethargy'' that appeared to be around regarding these IAPs had been resolved at the meeting.

Improvements to IAPs were now due to be tabled in August, the minister said.

Dr Smith has also held bilateral discussions with Canada, China, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand.

Detailed discussions with China, which focused on access for New Zealand wool exports and China's accession to the World Trade Organisation, had made \`\`good progress'', Dr Smith said.

In talks with his Canadian counterpart Art Eggleton, Dr Smith again raised New Zealand's concerns about Canada's system of paying farmers for dairy exports.

New Zealand believes the system means high prices paid for domestic supplies of milk products by Canadian consumers cross subsidise export prices, allowing them to be held artificially low.
