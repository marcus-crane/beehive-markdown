The Minister of Tourism Murray McCully has announced new appointments to the New Zealand Tourism Board.

The new Chairman is Auckland businessman Bryan Mogridge.

Based in Auckland, Mr Mogridge is the retiring Chief Executive of Corporate Investments Ltd and is known for his six-year role as Chairman of the New Zealand Wine Institute. He is the former Chairman of the Food & Beverage Exporters Council of New Zealand.

\`\`Mr Mogridge will bring a broad range of experience to the position and will provide a fresh approach to the challenges that lie ahead in our growing tourism industry,'' Mr McCully said.

The New Zealand Tourism Board will see two other new faces: Director/Shareholder of Fullers Northland, Michael Simm and Jim Boult, Managing Director of Shotover Jet, who is also chairman of the listed Baycorp Holdings Ltd.

Not so new to the New Zealand Tourism Board is former Deputy Chairman, Michael Wall, who returns as a member of the Board.

Mr McCully has paid tribute to two outgoing NZ Tourism Board members, the former Chairman Norman Geary and former Deputy Chairman Barry Thomas.

\`\`Both Mr Geary and Mr Thomas played key roles in making the New Zealand tourism industry the success it is today," Mr McCully said. " I look forward to working with the new team to help sustain and strengthen that success into the next century.''
