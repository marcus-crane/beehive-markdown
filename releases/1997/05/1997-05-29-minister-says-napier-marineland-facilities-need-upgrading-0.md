The Minister of Conservation Nick Smith today gave conditional approval for Napier's Marineland to obtain two further fur seals from the wild for display and breeding purposes. Mr Smith also approved a permit to allow Marineland to continue to hold its existing dolphins, seals and sea lions in captivity. The permits are subject to Marineland investing in upgrading facilities to an acceptable standard.

"Marineland has been subject to a rigorous inspection by Department of Conservation staff as part of the permit process. DoC and Marineland have worked together to establish an agreed set of standards for marine facilities and this now needs to be implemented. The animals were found to be healthy and receiving a high standard of care from the dedicated and professional staff at Marineland. However, the fur seal facilities are not good enough to hold another two seals. They are too small and fail to provide a natural or stimulating environment for the animals."

The approval to capture additional fur seals from the wild is on the basis of the upgrade. The permit allows two sick or injured female pups that would be unlikely to survive in the wild, to be taken under DoC supervision. The Minister said he was satisfied that the taking of the fur seals would have absolutely no effect on the wild seal population.

The applications have been subject to a public process of consultation which generated a wide variation in responses. These ranged from those who strongly supported Marineland to those who opposed wild animals being held in captivity.

"The conditions on the two permits pose a difficult challenge for Marineland and the Napier community. The cost of the upgrade is likely to be significant but is necessary if the best standards of animal welfare are to be maintained. Public attitudes to zoos, and in particular to holding marine mammals in captivity, has changed dramatically since Marineland was established. Many New Zealanders hold the view that if you want to see the dolphins, seals or sea lions you should visit them in their natural habitat and not hold them in concrete and steel cages. This change in attitude to animals in captivity means that the Marineland facilities must measure up to the best international practices."
