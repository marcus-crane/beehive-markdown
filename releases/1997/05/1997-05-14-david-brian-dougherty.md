The Minister of Justice, Hon D.A.M. Graham, said today he had asked the Ministry of Justice for a report on the case of David Brian Dougherty who spent three years in jail before he was acquitted on rape and abduction charges.

Mr Dougherty was sentenced to seven years and nine months imprisonment in 1993. The Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal the following year. In 1996 he successfully petitioned the Governor-General and the case was referred to the Court of Appeal which quashed the convictions and ordered a new trial. Last month a High Court jury acquitted Mr Dougherty on both charges.

'Mr Dougherty's case raises a number of issues which require further investigation and I have asked my officials to make further inquiries and report back to me.

'The issues are complex, and while I don't want the case to drag on it will take the Ministry several weeks to complete its investigation.'

Mr Graham said he would be making no further comment on the case until the report had been received and considered.
