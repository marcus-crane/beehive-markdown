Health Minister Bill English today announced the membership of the committee that will oversee the setting-up of a National Blood Service by 1 July next year.

"The National Blood Service is being set up in response to widespread support for a nationally co-ordinated service.

"The new national service will increase the safety of New Zealand's blood service, increase the efficiency of the service by cutting down on product wastage, and introduce a greater range of blood services to more people.

"The National Blood Service Establishment Committee will act as both an advisory committee and establishment board. One of the first things it will do is to advise the Cabinet by the end of October on the best way to structure the new blood service," said Mr English.

The three members of the committee are the chairperson, Wayne Boyd, Dr John Carter, and Victor Klap.

Wayne Boyd is a professional director with wide business knowledge and experience. He was a director at Capital Coast Health between 1994 and 1997.

Dr John Carter is a clinical haematologist with Capital Coast Health. Dr Carter was co-author of the Review of the Blood Sector, 1996, which recommended that a national blood service be established.

Victor Klap was chief executive of Southern Regional Health until recently. He is highly experienced in health sector and government processes.

"Given the collective experience of committee members, I am confident that they will be able to set up a national blood service that will service all New Zealanders well," said Mr English.
