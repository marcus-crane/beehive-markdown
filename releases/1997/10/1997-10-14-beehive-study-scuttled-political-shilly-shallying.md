Prime Minister Jim Bolger said today it was pointless to proceed with a feasibility study to move the Beehive and complete Parliament House in the 1911 design.

"The other political parties are now publicly failing to back their own unanimous decision made in the Government Administration Select Committee just three months ago.

"The multi-party members of that select committee unanimously recommended that Government investigate the possibility of shifting the Beehive and completing the original South Wing of Parliament House.

"The Government agreed to carry out the feasibility study but it now appears that the other political parties are no longer keen on the idea raising the question as to whether the Government Administration Select Committee should revisit the issue again.

Mr Bolger said the question of how to resolve the need for more Parliamentary accommodation remained unresolved.

"It has always been up to Parliament to decide how to provide necessary Parliamentary accommodation.

"Therefore it is still up to Parliament to decide where we go from here."
