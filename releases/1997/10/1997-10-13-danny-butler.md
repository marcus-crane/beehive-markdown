Immigration Minister Max Bradford has been asked to intervene after the Court of Appeal rejected a further bid by Irishman Danny Butler to claim refugee status.

Mr Butler's lawyers contacted the Minister with a request for a special direction today.

Mr Bradford said he would carefully consider Mr Butler's case - including the Court of Appeal judgement - over the next few days before making a decision.
