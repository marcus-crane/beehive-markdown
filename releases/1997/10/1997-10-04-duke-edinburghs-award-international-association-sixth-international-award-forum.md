Prime Minister Jim Bolger today  
announced that Their Royal Highnesses The Duke of Edinburgh and The Prince  
Edward will attend the Duke of Edinburgh's International Award Forum in  
Wellington from 31 October to 5 November.

Prince Philip, who founded the  
Award, will chair the Forum and will participate in a Gold Award presentation  
ceremony in the Capital, while Prince Edward will participate in Gold Award  
presentation ceremonies in Christchurch and Dunedin.

Mr Bolger said he  
was delighted that Their Royal Highnesses were able to attend the Forum.

"Communities around the country have benefited enormously from the Award  
programme, with more than 600,000 hours of voluntary and community work carried  
out each year."

Mr Bolger said he would be meeting with The Duke of  
Edinburgh during his visit to the United Kingdom for CHOGM later this month and  
they would be making a joint announcement about the International Forum.
