Hon John Luxton, Associate Minister of Agriculture today announced details of the Kiwifruit Summit which was signalled in the Coalition Agreement.

The Minister announced today that the Summit would be held on 30 and 31 October at the Bay Court Hotel, Tauranga. The theme of the Summit is: "Kiwifruit: Stage Three and Beyond. Status Quo, Corporatisation or Deregulation"

The Minister has recently posted over 2500 letters inviting growers and others to the Summit.

The 30th October will be chaired by Mr Luxton and is a full day of interesting and thought provoking speakers talking about and updating you on issues within the industry such as corporatisation and deregulation. The first day is wrapped up with a panel discussion where you can put your comments and questions to a panel of speakers.

The same night a dinner has been arranged at the same venue for those who wish to continue the day's discussions in a less formal setting.

The 31st October is a half day chaired by the Hon Tuariki John Delamere and will involve workshops coordinated by an independent facilitator.

The Summit will be wrapped up by the Treasurer, Hon Winston Peters.
