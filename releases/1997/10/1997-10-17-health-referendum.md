Health Minister Bill English said today any public debate on health funding needs to be honest, get past cheap slogans and equip the public to grapple with wider issues.

"In health, it's easy for politicians and others to wade in with a cheap slogan on a 10 second sound grab for television or radio and slant public opinion," Mr English.

"A referendum would need to be backed by information that helped the public understand how much more taxes they would be paying. People would need to be told what they could expect from our public health service from that increased taxes.

"I'm advised that family on an income of $30,000 could need to pay about an extra $15 a week to fund the proposed increase in the referendum question," he said.

"Any increase will hit middle New Zealanders. They need to think about how they want any increase in their taxes to be spent.

"I can imagine some people putting a good case for improved education for pre-school children. Others would argue for more police, better youth justice, or spending the money on Maori land claims. Some people would equally argue poor health had links to poverty and propose benefit increases," Mr English.

"We all need to be considering how can we get the greatest social cohesion in our country the from way we collect and spend taxes," Mr English.
