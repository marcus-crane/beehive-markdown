The Government has approved $18.5 million in extra funding for the New Zealand Police for the 1997/98 financial year, Police Minister Jack Elder announced today.

Mr Elder said the extra money increased Police operational funding from $683.70 million on budget night to $702.2 million, excluding GST.

"Our decision to give extra funding shows the Government has been responsive to the Police's submissions, and to concerns expressed by community groups about the need for additional resources.

"The Coalition Government's commitment to enforcing law and order is reflected in this funding - the highest annual budget the Police have ever received," Mr Elder said.

"The additional funds, plus the commitment in the Coalition Agreement to provide 200 extra police officers and new crime prevention initiatives this year, is good news for police and for all New Zealanders."

The increased numbers of frontline officers will result in safer communities, and Police will be able to have more officers working on their high-priority areas. These are to target repeat and serious offenders, implement crime prevention strategies, improve road safety and target organised crime and gangs."

Mr Elder said the Government and Police had worked together to find a fiscally responsible solution which would provide Police with additional funds at a reasonable long-term cost to the tax payer.
