The Government is making sound progress in the development of the industrial relations initiatives in the Coalition Agreement, Labour Minister Max Bradford said today.

The process and timeline for examining the issues raised by the proposals in the Coalition Agreement and developing options are as follows:

In November, Cabinet will consider papers on issues and options for bargaining, and on a review of personal grievance provisions. This will involve reviewing relevant court decisions in each area to consider whether they demonstrate any problems with the legislation.

The annual review of the Minimum Wage will also be considered in December. Submissions from employer and union groups have already been sought.

A further review of the Holidays Act is in progress. Earlier reviews were limited to technical issues in 1993 and to quite specific proposals in 1995. This review goes back to first principles to consider a new Holidays Act. A consultation document setting out options for change to the Holidays Act will be released in November. Submissions will be called for before Christmas.  
Mr Bradford said he expected any changes to the legislation would be able to be considered early in the New Year.
