The Minister of Social Welfare Roger Sowry announced today that long-standing urban Maori social service provider Te Whanau O Waipareira has been selected as the preferred provider for the Wraparound programme.

The Wraparound programme will target South Auckland youth at serious risk of self-harm and criminal offending. It is one of the Government's crime prevention initiatives announced in this year's Budget.

$3 million over three years has been provided for this service by the New Zealand Community Funding Agency.

"Waipareira Trust has been chosen from a very strong field of community based and specialist organisations to deliver the programme," says Mr Sowry.

Waipareira Trust is currently involved with a wide range of social services involving economic development and education services and is an approved child and family support service provider.

The Trust, which operates the educational facility at the Northern Residential Centre under contract to the Children, Young Persons and Their Families Service, also runs TOPS programmes in Otara and Mangere.

Wraparound will cater for up to 100 young people aged 13 to 18 years with a history of criminal behaviour and health, mental health, drug and alcohol or educational problems.

Most referrals will come through Police, the Children Young Person and Their Families Service, schools and mental health services.

"Each person will have a highly skilled support worker to lead them through their present challenges and enable them to participate positively in society," says Mr Sowry.

Waipareira Trust will be confirmed as provider subject to successful contract negotiations involving DSW, CYPFS and North Health which begin next week.
