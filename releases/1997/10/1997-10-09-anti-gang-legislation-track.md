Legislation giving Police more powers to deal with gangs and criminal organisations has been toughened up during the select committee process, Police Minister Jack Elder said today.

The Harassment and Criminal Associations Bill has been amended by a supplementary order paper changing some of its original provisions and which delay its report back to the House, but Mr Elder said he was confident the Bill would give the Police practical and well-reasoned powers to deal with gangs.

"The Bill essentially deals with four areas; it streamlines the procedure for authorising electronic eavesdropping on criminal organisations, it changes the law regarding the searching of vehicles, it introduces a new law regarding harassment, and it makes it easier for local bodies to remove gang fortifications."

Mr Elder said the Police had expressed satisfaction with the way the Bill had progressed through the select committee stage, and were very happy with the result.

"In particular, the new power to stop and search vehicles on the suspicion of carrying stolen property is welcomed by the Police. The change, which was proposed by the Police, will make the work of front line officers much more effective."

Another aspect of the Bill would make it easier for Police and local government to remove gang fortifications, Mr Elder said.

Application could be made to a district court for a removal order, which could be issued if the court believed the premises were being used by people in the commission of offences, and the fence was being used to facilitate the concealment of suspects or facilitate the commission of offences.

Judges are also to be given greater power to issue non-association orders to convicted criminals.

Mr Elder said the Bill relates closely to several key Coalition Agreement targets relating to law and order.

"The Coalition Agreement explicitly states the Government will move to adopt a stronger approach to law and order, while at the same time introduce strategies to attack crime at its roots."

The Agreement stated the Government would ensure greater resources were available for policing gangs, widen the Police capacity to use electronic surveillance against organised crime, ensure there are laws to deal with criminals consorting and ensure there are powers to remove gang fortifications.

"While I understand the concerns of civil libertarians relating to Police powers, there is such a level of public concern at the activities of gangs and other crime organisations that the Police must be given effective legislative backing in their work."

Mr Elder said he believed the Bill represented an appropriate balance between safeguarding civil liberties and providing an effective legal framework to counter criminal organisations.
