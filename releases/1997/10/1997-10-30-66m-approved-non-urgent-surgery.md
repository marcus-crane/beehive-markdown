Health Minister Bill English announced today he had unfrozen applications under the Government's Waiting Times Fund and approved a further $66 million of contracts to help people on waiting lists.

"This new round of approvals will see an additional 10,000 people getting initial assessments and a further 18,800 getting procedures, including surgery. This amount of assessments and procedures will have a real impact on waiting lists and will see operating theatres busy around the country.

"I have unfrozen applications under the Fund because I am confident that Crown health enterprises and the Transitional Health Authority are on track to have the Booking System in place by 1 July next year.

"Following my letter in September I have had confirmation from all the CHEs and from THA that they are working constructively on implementing the Booking System. This is the only fair and consistent way to spend money on non-urgent surgery so it is imperative that we are able to implement it.

"The Government is committed to providing a reasonable level of non-urgent surgery for New Zealanders. Within the health budget we have the job of ensuring there is sufficient funding to make sure we provide this level of non-urgent surgery," said Mr English.

A total of $130 million was allocated to the Fund when it was set up on 1 July 1996. A futher $105 million was committed in this year's Budget. Today's announcements mean:

a total of $190 million of the $235 million Fund is now committed  
this will see 51,000 assessments and 55,800 treatments provided
