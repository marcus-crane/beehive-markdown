"A great road safety result" is how Transport Minister Jenny Shipley is describing the recent trend in the number of road deaths.

"Over the last five months (May to September) 189 New Zealanders were killed in road crashes. That is an improvement on the same period last year, when there were 210 deaths," Mrs Shipley said.

"As at today (Friday October 17) there have been 12 deaths this month, compared to 23 at the same point in October last year.

"A mix of road safety advertising and enforcement programmes appear to be resulting in many drivers taking more care.

"With New Zealanders now starting planning for their Labour weekend break, it is time to remember the four "lifesavers" that help keep the road toll down:

Buckling up the safety belts  
Sticking to the speed limits  
Staying alert and taking notice of the road conditions  
Staying sober behind the wheel  
"Most New Zealanders are driving safely, but there are still some who put all of us at risk by their actions. The Government is working on a package of measures targeting dangerous drivers, as we seek to keep the road toll on a downward trend," Mrs Shipley concluded.
