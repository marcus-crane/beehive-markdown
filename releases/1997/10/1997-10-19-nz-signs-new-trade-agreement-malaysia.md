New Zealand and Malaysia have signed a new, improved trade and economic cooperation agreement, which replaces the old, outdated agreement signed in 1961 - before Malaysia even existed in its current form.

Signing the agreement with his Malaysian counterpart Dato' Seri Rafidah bt Aziz in Kuala Lumpur on Friday, International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith said Malaysia was New Zealand's biggest export market in South East Asia and our tenth largest globally.

"In the year to June 1997, New Zealand exports to Malaysia were worth $486 million, an amount certainly worth developing," Dr Smith said.

"New Zealand business is planning to expand its exports to Malaysia with the Dairy Board, for example, keen to develop a long-term market for liquid milk.

"It's important that the framework underpinning our trade relationship now includes services and investment and has been brought into line with World Trade Organisation rules.

"The agreement also establishes a Joint Trade Committee to meet every 18 months to discuss measures to expand trade and investment and promote further economic cooperation. It puts our trade relationship on a sound footing for a new era."
