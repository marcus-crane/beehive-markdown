Police Minister Jack Elder said today no changes to the provisions of the Perf disengagement scheme were planned, although he remained concerned at the numbers of officers leaving.

"I am waiting for the findings of the Police disengagement summit, which has been studying the reasons for the historically high numbers of officers leaving. The summit includes representatives from Police, the police unions and other interested parties."

Police National Headquarters will be evaluating the results of the summit to see why officers are choosing to leave the Police, and if there is anything that can be done to reduce the numbers disengaging. No changes will be contemplated before then, Mr Elder said.

"As I announced earlier this year, there will be no reductions in the provisions of the Perf scheme for officers employed under it."

The Police Employment Rehabilitation Fund was started in 1984 by the Labour Government following the stress on officers during the Springbok tour. It allows officers with a psychological or physical disability, and who are under the age of 50 to leave with a lump-sum payment. Employment under the scheme was ended in 1993, when the current Police Superannuation Scheme was introduced.
