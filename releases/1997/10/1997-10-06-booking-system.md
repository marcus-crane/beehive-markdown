Health Minister Bill English said today no patient waiting for surgery would suffer from his temporary hold on Waiting Times Fund applications.

"Patients can only benefit from this. They deserve a fair system that gives them some certainty when waiting for surgery. That is what I am committed to putting in place by 1 July next year," Mr English said

"If you are limping around your house in pain, you deserve to know whether the public will pay for your new hip. If the public system will pay you need to know when the operation will be done.

"The booking system will mean the person in most need medically, not financially, gets treated first. This is not about any form of means testing. It is about when a doctor says a person with these symptoms needs treating before someone else," he said.

"Our public hospital doctors and nurses have already done a great deal of work getting a booking system in place. My message to hospitals last month was that I was withholding approving any more Waiting Times Fund application until they had confirmed they are on track to meet the 1 July deadline.

"I expect the Transitional Funding Agency and the CHEs to come back to me shortly confirming they are working on a booking system. As soon as that happens those CHEs will be able to have their applications for more Waiting Times Fund money approved.

"Some doctors have already commented that they do have reservations about whether there will be enough money for the operations they believe should be publicly funded," Mr English said.

"I agree that this is an issues. I understand their reservations because in the past non-urgent surgery has been the first to get the squeeze when too much has been spent on other areas in health such as pharmaceuticals.

"I'm not prepared to let that continue," Mr English said.
