It was the height of hypocrisy for a member of the Opposition to criticise the Government on the issue of road safety, Police Minister Jack Elder said today.

He was responding to criticism of the Government's road safety policy from Labour spokesperson George Hawkins.

"It was under a Labour administration that New Zealand suffered its highest ever death toll on the roads, in 1987, when 795 people perished.

"Last year, under the revised Police road safety strategies, this had fallen dramatically to 515.

Between 1987 and 1995, there was a fall in fatal accidents per 10,000 vehicles from 3.9 to 2.5, and a decrease in injury accidents from 92.2 per 10,000 vehicles to 71.6

This is an especially striking achievement considering the big increase in the number of vehicles on our roads following the arrival of used Japanese imports, Mr Elder said.

"The only figures that Mr Hawkins can come up with that compare unfavourably with in recent years are those for all accidents, including fender-benders, which was due to a rise in non-injury accidents between 1992 and 1996."

Mr Elder noted that there was a sharp fall in fatal accidents and accidents causing injury over the same period.

"Mr Hawkins is gratuitously insulting to Police officers when he implies they do not take road safety seriously and regard it as 'a wretched punishment'."

Mr Elder said Police regions were boosting dedicated traffic patrols according to the local commanders' perception of the need.

"The Police now employ a sophisticated range of road safety techniques, including laser speed detectors, speed cameras, booze buses, checkpoints, advanced alcohol analysis equipment, and of course, all Police officers now enforce the road laws, not just the small number of the former Traffic Officers."

The Police now provide a 24-hour road safety service, unlike the old Ministry of Transport officers, who operated limited hours, he said.

Regarding the money received from speed camera fines, Mr Elder said this went a small way to off-setting the $3.1 billion cost to the nation of road accidents last year.

"All New Zealanders should be grateful to the Police for their magnificent achievement in reducing the human suffering on our country's roads.

"George Hawkins statements should be recognised for the political posturing they are."
