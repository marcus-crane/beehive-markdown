Health service had provided Northland man Rau Williams with the best possible care.

"I feel sad for Mr Williams' family and friends as well as every doctor and nurse who has cared for Mr Williams," he said.

"It has been upsetting for everyone involved, including myself, to see the personal issue of Mr Williams' death, which should have been accorded dignity and respect, played out in such a highly public way.

"The doctors' decision in regard to Mr Williams' care has been the most thoroughly scrutinised medical decision in New Zealand history. Two High Court hearings, the Court of Appeal and the Human Rights Commission have been over the particulars of this case and each authority backed the doctors' decision," Mr English said.

"Doctors do not hesitate to tell the Government when they need more money for their patient's care and yet in this case independent renal specialists who examined the case backed the decision.

"We need to remember that everyday in the public health service, doctors and nurses must tell patients, like Mr Williams, that they are so sick that even the best medical care in the world will not save their lives.

"I want to express my appreciation to the staff of the Northland Health who stayed committed to giving Mr Williams the best care possible despite all the public pressure and political manoeuvring," said Mr English.
