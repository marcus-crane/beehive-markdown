Minister of Corrections, Paul East, today congratulated the Department of Corrections on its progress since being established on 1 October 1995.

"The Department of Corrections has made headway in dealing with difficult issues such as drugs in prisons and getting all inmates doing a full day's work within the next five years," said Mr East. "The Department is in a good position to reduce the rate of criminal re-offending."

Mr East said the first two years of operation represented good news for law abiding citizens and bad news for those determined to continue to break the law.
