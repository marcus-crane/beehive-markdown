"The draft National Land Transport Strategy (NLTS) has been released today, so interested parties can further consider this overall transport framework alongside the major road management and pricing issues currently being considered by the government," Transport Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"By the middle of next year, the final agreed NLTS will give us an overall framework for decisions about land transport into the next century. It will take an umbrella approach to all forms of land transport, including cars, trains, trams, buses, bicycles, motorcycles, trucks, trailers, pedestrians and harbour ferries.

"Roading is just one part of that, and the road reform programme the government's considering takes into account the direction of the draft NLTS."

Mrs Shipley says decisions on the future funding and mangement structure of the roading network are still due to be made before Christmas.

"We have consulted widely already both on the options for road reform and on the shape of the draft NLTS, and I am confident the two programmes are taking a consistent approach."

Mrs Shipley says the draft NLTS is a wide-ranging document, tackling issues such as economic efficiency, safety, the environment and access to land transport. It represents an emerging consensus, but at this stage it is not Government policy. Once public submissions are received and have been considered, and the Government has reached conclusions on the roading reform programme, it will make final decisions on the overall strategy by about the middle of next year.

"The document's overall vision is to achieve a land transport system that meets the demands of people, business and communities at reasonable cost.

The draft NLTS has been developed over the past year by the Ministry of Transport in close consultation with representatives of central and local government, the transport sector and other interested groups.Public submissions can be made to the Ministry of Transport before 19 December 1997.

DRAFT NATIONAL LAND TRANSPORT STRATEGY  
Questions and Answers  
What is the National Land Transport Strategy?

It sets out the strategic direction of where land transport policy will be heading in the next ten years and the following decades. It is a policy framework which includes a vision, goals, objectives, measures and targets.

Why have a Strategy?

Having a strategy for where land transport is heading as a whole will make systems more efficient. Each region and each mode of land transport will be linked into the Strategy. It will turn an ad hoc approach to land transport into one with long-term direction.

What does land transport incorporate?

Land transport includes all the structures and systems that help move people and goods on the land. Cars, trains, trams, buses, bicycles, motorcycles, trucks, tractors, pedestrians, and even harbour ferries make up this network.

Is the Draft Strategy Government policy?

No, it is not Government policy  
The draft Strategy is being released for public comment.  
Public meetings will be held throughout the country.  
Public submissions will be received and analysed.  
A workshop will be held in March 1998.  
The target date for the final Strategy is May 1998.  
At that point, the Strategy will become Government policy.  
Who put together the draft Strategy?

The first workshop, which was held a year ago, was where the direction of the Strategy was first developed. There were 150 people who attended. They included representatives from central and local government, transport companies, environmental groups, safety agencies and others with diverse interests in transport.

The Transport Strategy Group was formed out of the workshop to further develop this set of ideas. This group consisted of over 40 organisations and there has been much discussion to reach the first draft.

What is the vision?

A land transport system that meets the demands of people, business and communities at reasonable cost.

What are the four main areas tackled in the draft Strategy?

economic efficiency  
access  
safety  
environment  
What are the goals?

To achieve economic efficiency, and where funding mechanisms are necessary they are to be efficient and effective.  
To facilitate access to opportunities that meet the needs of people, business and communities.  
To reduce levels of risk, driven by a firmly established safety culture.  
To avoid, remedy or mitigate the adverse effects of the land transport systems on the environment.  
How can we ensure these goals are reached?

The draft Strategy includes objectives, measures and targets. These have been developed so that there are checks in place to make sure the goals are reached.

How does Road Reform fit into the picture?

Road reform deals with roading which is part of what the National Land Transport Strategy covers.

This draft Strategy will be taken into account when the Government makes its Road Reform decision later this year.
