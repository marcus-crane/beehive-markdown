The Government's financial statements released today provide further reassurance that economic growth forecasts are on track, said the Treasurer Winston Peters today.

The results for the first three months of the current financial year, are in line with the Budget forecasts and will be welcomed by the business and financial sectors.

"These results include a positive operating surplus, net Crown debt $223 million lower than forecast and an improved net worth situation.

"These figures demonstrate the success of the Government's prudent approach. The public and businesses, in particular, can be assured that we will continue working hard to maintain fiscal discipline.

"The favourable tax revenue result and the positive surplus is a further encouraging sign that the Government's sound and balanced policies are contributing to steady and sustainable growth," said Mr Peters.
