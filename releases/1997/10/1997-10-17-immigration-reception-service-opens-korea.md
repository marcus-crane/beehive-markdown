The government has confirmed that the new immigration reception facility at its embassy in Seoul is now operational.

The decision to establish a basic immigration facility was announced jointly by International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith and Immigration Minister Max Bradford in June.

Confirming that a staff member had now been recruited for the new reception facility, the ministers said they saw it as a positive move for the education sector in particular.

"The reception service enables prospective Korean students to lodge their student visa applications with the New Zealand embassy," Dr Smith said, noting this would remove any disadvantage New Zealand education providers had experienced in the Korean market.

While processing of visa applications would still be in Hong Kong, students would receive a prompt and reliable standard of service without the need to courier their own documents.

The reception facility will also be able to handle inquiries from prospective long term migrants in Korea.

"Long term migrant numbers from Korea have dropped in recent years but Korea remains an important long-term potential market. The new reception facility will enable us to be more active in responding to changes in the level of interest," Mr Bradford said.

The NZ Immigration Service office in Seoul was closed last December following a fall-off in residence applications and the introduction of visa-free entry for Korean tourists. The resulting drop in visa revenue forced the closure of the office. As a result of the closure, the processing of all Korean applications (mainly student visas) was shifted to Hong Kong.

Mr Bradford and Dr Smith explained that under the new arrangement visas are still processed in the NZIS Hong Kong office but Koreans are able to lodge their application with the New Zealand embassy in Seoul and have their queries answered by the specialist receptionist.

Mr Bradford said the reception service would also be able to cater for a Working Holiday Scheme between Korea and New Zealand. Once finalised, the scheme would allow 200 New Zealanders and Koreans to visit each others' countries for a working holiday.
