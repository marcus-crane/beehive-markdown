Housing permits data out today reflects increased confidence and an economy in significant growth mode, Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer, Winston Peters, said today.

Mr Peters said the figures published by Statistics New Zealand showed new dwelling units approved were up by 48.4% last month compared to September 1996.

"The sharp jump in the number of new dwelling units authorised in September is encouraging. Clearly the impact of some very large apartment projects in Auckland city and Rodney have had an impact.

"However, it is noted that even allowing for this, the latest figures are still about 25% higher than just over a year ago, continuing the strength since June," said Mr Peters.

He was also pleased to note that his local Tauranga district recorded one of the largest increases in new dwelling consents- up from 139 in September 1996 to 243 last month..

"This is a reflection of continuing confidence and investment in one of the fastest growing areas in New Zealand, Mr Peters said.
