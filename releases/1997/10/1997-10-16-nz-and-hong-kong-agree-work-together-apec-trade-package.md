The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and New Zealand will work together to promote a trade liberalisation package which could mean cheaper fish, forest products, fertiliser and engagement rings, among other things.

International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith met in Hong Kong yesterday with his HKSAR counterpart Denise Yue.

Dr Smith says he and Miss Yue agreed that Hong Kong and New Zealand should work together to gain support for a sectoral package which will be put before APEC leaders at their meeting in Vancouver later this year.

"Over 60 proposals have been put forward for trade liberalisation which span a wide enough range of products that each APEC country should see some benefit from endorsing the package.

"The sectors which appear to have the most support and momentum include toys, chemicals, fish, forest products, fertiliser, environmental technology and services and gems and jewellery.

"It's Hong Kong's and New Zealand's intention to work towards trade liberalisation for these sectors as soon as possible.

"That could mean cheaper prices for New Zealand consumers in a range of products and better opportunities for exporters of fish and forest products," Dr Smith said.
