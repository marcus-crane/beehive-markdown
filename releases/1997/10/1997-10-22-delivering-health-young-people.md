In the interests of improving approaches to youth health delivery, the Ministry of Youth Affairs hosted a meeting today of people responsible for youth health services.

Welcoming them to the Ministry of Youth Affairs, Hon Deborah Morris confirmed her commitment to a coordinated approach to youth suicide prevention, the importance of information sharing and everyone working in the youth sector supporting each other.

"It is time for youth health to become a priority in this country. Youth issues may not be the most attractive focus for politicians, yet the health and well-being of young people impacts on all of us.

"Research has shown that young people want health services especially for them, which are youth friendly, free, easy to access and which provide as many services as possible under one roof," Deborah Morris said.

One of the methods of achieving this has been the concept of One Stop Shops. One Stop Shops offer the services of nurses and GPs, specialist services (such as sexual health, contraception, drug and alcohol, mental health) counselling, referral to external specialist services and they also provide a wide range of information on issues such as education, health, justice, income support and recreation.

"If we expect to improve the status of youth health we have to let young people design their own services. We have to listen! That is a challenge for a lot of decision makers," Deborah Morris said.

The meeting today enabled people from around the country to share information about approaches to youth health issues and the practical steps they are taking to meet the diverse needs of young people. Input from the various sectors will contribute to the Ministry's policy work and provides and opportunity for best practice models to be developed.
