The Education Minister is encouraging as many people as possible to consider playing a role as a member of their local school's Board of Trustees.

"A good strong board of trustees can make all the difference to the school and its students," Mr Creech said today as he launched the campaign for the 1998 school trustees election.

"I place immense importance on the spirit of co-operation between schools and the community, and on parents having a major say in deciding what is best for their children's education. It is what Tomorrow's Schools is all about."

Mr Creech said cohesive, supportive communities and families mean vibrant schools. Good schools add strength to families and communities.

"Communities take ownership of situations, take initiatives to solve problems, and make the best use of available funds to ensure their children fulfil their potential."

Mr Creech said becoming a school trustee often gives a person new skills and training.

"The Government believes that getting the community and parents involved at the ground level can produce powerful results for young people and the community. School trustees play a key role in strengthening the school's position in the community."
