Health Minister Bill English said today 16 of the country's 23 Crown health enterprises had already committed to a booking system.

"I expect the remaining CHEs to respond shortly.

"Today I have written to the 16 CHE's who have already responded, telling them they should now go ahead and apply for money from the Waiting Times Fund.

"New Zealanders deserve certainty and fairness from their publicly funded health system. They need to know what the public system will pay for.

"At present we have got too many people who live in hope that they will get an operation because they are on a waiting list. I am not prepared to stand by while people are told they are on a waiting list when there is little hope they will ever see an operating table.

"The booking system is the first step to providing more honesty and certainty to people waiting for non-urgent surgery.

"Once we have the booking system in place we can then work out how much it will cost to pay for a level of non-urgent surgery that people would reasonably expect from the public purse.

"Armed with that information we can then take a harder look at other health spending to see how we can spend money in ways that helps people in the most need," Mr English said.
