Health Minister Bill English said today this Government was committed to non-profit hospitals.

"New Zealand's hospitals are not profit driven," Mr English said.

"I want New Zealanders to be as free from illness and disability as possible. Our hospitals play a part in this. They are about people not about profit. This was stated in the Coalition Agreement and it has not changed.

"The Government set out its expectation for Crown health enterprises in a letter sent in February. The wording of that letter was carefully negotiated between former Associate Health Minister Neil Kirton and myself to ensure there was no reference to profit," he said.

"CHEs were reminded the Government placed an emphasis on CHEs cooperating to improve the quality of care, and on them providing the most effective healthcare to the greater number of people. They were also told any involvement with the private sector would need to meet the Coalition Agreement's criteria and that they needed to act in a businesslike manner.

"The letter stated CHEs were expected to achieve a satisfactory return on equity. The letter has been publicly available since April. It was not confidential," Mr English said.

"The word 'commercial' was never used in any Government letter to the CHEs. That word was used by the Crown Company Monitoring Unit in its advice to Mr Kirton and myself on the business plans. The CHEs did not receive that document.

"The Government has also been clear with CHEs that any surplus they do achieve is for them to reinvest in buildings, equipment, staff training and other things to ensure we maintain a strong public health service," he said.

"Of course, the only surpluses a few CHEs have achieved have been very small. Those CHEs are to be congratulated for spending just less than what the Government pays them for the services they are contracted to provide.

"What we are talking about with CHEs is simple household economics of not spending more than what you get in," Mr English said.
