Prime Minister Jim Bolger has announced a doubling in the number of young Britons able to take working holidays in New Zealand each year.

The announcement will take the number of working visas available to 4000 and followed Mr Bolger's meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair at No.10 Downing Street earlier this week.

Working holidays in Britain are part of the traditional Overseas Experience enjoyed by young New Zealanders.

"Increasing the number of young Britons able to have working holidays here reflects the special nature of our relation with Britain.

"Prime Minister Tony Blair and I agreed that working holidays are good for both New Zealand and the United Kingdom, as they forge increased understanding and personal links between the two countries," Mr Bolger said.

The increase in British visas will be implemented in two stages. The first extra 1000 visas will come into effect from February 1998 and the second 1000, from September 1998.
