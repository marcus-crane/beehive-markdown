The Minister of Maori Affairs, the Hon Tau Henare, today slammed the opposition parties attitudes towards consultation with Maori over the proposed Multilateral Agreement on Investment.

"Labour, in particular Mike Moore, continues to be paternalistic, pedantic and condescending to Maori by suggesting in the House today there be should no consultation full stop.

"Attitudes like his are typical of the big white brother who knows better than the niggers and that is the hallmark of the Labour Party that has tied its Maori members in straitjackets," he said.

"I'm committed to going out to Maori and asking them what they want, and consultation will take place with Maori within the next couple of months.

"The MAI is simply a proposal at this stage and has huge implications for Maori in key areas of development so they need to be satisfied, and so do I, that it doesn't impinge on their developmental and treaty rights.

"Safeguarding their treaty right is a key area of concern. But there may be others, that's why consultation is necessary.

"Mike Moore, a supporter of the MAI, said in a newspaper column last week:.. treaty issues are protected, reserved and not covered by the agreement; there is no need to go to a series of expensive hui.

"If that is the case Mr Treatygate, turn to your Maori caucus and tell them that. The same members who have already expressed at select committee level grave concerns with the MAI and I'm sure would support consultation with Maori at the least."
