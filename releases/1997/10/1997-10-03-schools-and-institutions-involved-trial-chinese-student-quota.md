Four hundred places for Chinese students have been allocated to more than 100 New Zealand schools and tertiary institutions as part of a trial relaxation of restrictions on Chinese students, Immigration Minister Max Bradford said.

"New Zealand and its schools, polytechnics, universities and other education institutions will benefit from a relaxation in Chinese student policy. China's economy is enjoying high growth rates and New Zealand stands to gain increased revenue from the sale of educational services, trade, economic and cultural links," Mr Bradford said.

Mr Bradford said the latest figures estimated that education services earned New Zealand around $300 million a year in foreign exchange. He said the Government aimed to facilitate entry for foreign students.

People from most countries can study in New Zealand for up to three months on a visitors permit, and for longer periods a student permit can be applied for.

"In an ideal world that would apply to all countries, but the reality is we have to balance risks against benefits. Those risks include a high incidence of overstaying from some countries.

"In 1992 our Chinese student policy was tightened in response to political instability in China. However, this year - given China's increased political stability and economic growth - we agreed to relax restrictions for a trial quota of 400 Chinese students entering New Zealand.

"Huge potential exists in the Chinese market - if the risks don't outweigh the benefits."

A large number of educational institutions indicated an interest in the trial quota and places have been allocated to more than 100.

The schools involved in the trial will report to the Immigration Service which will monitor and evaluate the one-off quota of 200 tertiary students, 100 secondary school exchange students and 100 full fee paying secondary school students.

Their information will help the Government assess whether Chinese student policy should be liberalised on a permanent basis.

At present there are strict restrictions on the entry of Chinese tertiary students including that they must be 29 years old or younger, have a university degree or equivalent and have English language skills. For the trial quota of tertiary students, the age restriction is to be raised to 35 years and the requirement for an undergraduate qualification removed.
