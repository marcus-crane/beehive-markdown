Minister of Commerce and Industry, Hon John Luxton met His Excellency Pengiran Dr Haji Ismail, the Minister of Development of Brunei Darussalam, in Wellington today.

"This visit is important and enhances what is already a very good relationship between our two countries," Mr Luxton said today.

The Ministers had wide ranging talks covering economic and education links, in particular ways to strengthen the relation ship between the two countries. Some New Zealand companies have had long standing connections with Brunei Darussalam in infrastructure development such as roading, housing and energy. The visit by the Development Minister should consolidate New Zealand's reputation for expertise in these sectors.

The Ministers also talked about tariff reform and South East Asia currency developments among other issues.

His Excellency Pengiran Dr Haji Ismail was guest of Honour at a Luncheon hosted by Mr Luxton at the Beehive, and was introduced to the House prior to question time in Parliament.

The Brunei Darussalam Minister is on a five day tour of New Zealand with a group of officials and business people from his country. They will also visit Rotorua and Auckland before leaving on Thursday.
