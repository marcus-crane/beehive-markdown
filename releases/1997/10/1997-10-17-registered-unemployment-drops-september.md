Employment Minister Peter McCardle said today the number of job seekers registered with the New Zealand Employment Service fell by 665 during September to 169,959.

"While it is increasingly difficult to use registered unemployment statistics as an indicator of the labour market outlook, there have been a number of other positive economic indicators in recent months."

"In addition, positive prospects for job growth over the next three years have been forecast by several agencies recently, projecting growth of around 100,000 new jobs over the next three years."

"This confirms the thoroughly good sense of the Government's twin strategies of providing real jobs through stronger economic growth, while attacking long-term unemployment and increasing long-term job seekers' active involvement in their communities." said Mr McCardle.
