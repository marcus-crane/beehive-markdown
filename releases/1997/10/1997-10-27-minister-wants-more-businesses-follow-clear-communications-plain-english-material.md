The Minister of Consumer Affairs, Hon Robyn McDonald today said that she would like to see more New Zealand businesses follow the example set by CLEAR Communications with their achievement of the "Plain English Campaign" quality symbol - the Crystal Mark.

"I am very pleased that CLEAR Communications took the initiative to work with the Plain English Campaign based in the United Kingdom to ensure that their customer contract met the high standards set to provide clarity in both design and language," said Robyn McDonald.

"I do believe that there is a growing impetus and demand from New Zealand consumers for material that can be easily understood so that they can far more readily know, in particular, with customer contracts, what they are agreeing to.

"The Ministry of Consumer Affairs promotes the need for plain English in customer communications and more businesses are beginning to see the importance of reviewing their customer material.

"I congratulate CLEAR Communications on being the first New Zealand recipients for the "Plain English Campaign" quality symbol - the Crystal Mark in New Zealand and encourage other businesses to endeavour to achieve the Crystal Mark," said the Minister.
