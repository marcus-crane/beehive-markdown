Health Minister Bill English said today the new Dannevirke hospital showed what a community could achieve when it worked in partnership with the Government.

"I'm pleased to be able to open the hospital today. Dannevirke is a great example of how a rural community can work with the Government to get the health services it needs," Mr English said.

"The new Dannevirke hospital is all about people. Hardworking people made it possible. They turned their anxiety at the old hospital's closure into action. The people of Dannevirke are better off today because they now have certainty about their town's health services and they have them on one site, close to the town's centre.

"This is going to succeed because the community is behind it, and the Government is behind the community," he said.

"I expect there will critics of this hospital because it has involved change and in the end great progress. But I expect to be busier answering calls from those other rural communities who are already queuing up to see what they have to do to get modern health services in their towns.

"Some of these communities will end up with health services run from Government-owned buildings, others will have community trust premises and others will be like Dannevirke and have doctors and others forming private ventures.

"What Dannevirke shows is it doesn't matter who owns the bricks. What matters is who pays for the health services New Zealanders deserve to have publicly funded.

"In Dannevirke, as in the rest of New Zealand, there is no doubt the Government will pay for the public health service. This year the Government increased what we spend on that service by $1.5 billion over the next three years," Mr English said.
