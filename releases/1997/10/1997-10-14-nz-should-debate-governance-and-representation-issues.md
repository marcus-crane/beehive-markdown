"New Zealand should retain a proportional representation system of some type, but seriously question whether we need 120 MP's, " Transport Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

In a speech to the Auckland branch of the Institute of Directors this morning Mrs Shipley commented on the strengths and weaknesses of the first year of MMP in terms of how well it had served us with respect to governance and representation.

"In general MMP has delivered benefits to New Zealand, by bringing a much broader cross-section of New Zealanders into Parliament. It is a good thing that the views, from the far left to the far right are more proportionately represented by women and men, Maori and other ethnic groups than ever before.

"This will assist our country in addressing the complex social problems which currently perplex many of us. We need the role models presented by some stunningly effective people, for example Pansy Wong, Georgina Te Heu Heu, Donna Awatere-Huata and Nanaia Mahuta, as we tackle the issues ahead of us.

"The vast majority of the new MPs are doing a good job on behalf of their constituencies, regardless of whether they are electorate or list MPs. Unfortunately their hard work is not attention grabbing. Sadly the media focuses on conflict rather than the constructive contributions many are making to the challenges and opportunities our country faces.

"I believe we do have to review whether it is necessary to have 120 MPs, in terms of both the cost and the contribution they can make.

"If we are honest with ourselves, having 55 list MPs has meant that in some cases smaller parties had to dig deeply to fill their allocation. We have seen that clearly demonstrated on a number of occasions.

"It's my personal view that we could still get the proportions right with 66 electorate MPs and 33 list MPs, in a total parliament of 99 MPs.

"The public debate on this issue is timely. Any change to MMP must be fully considered, and any modification or alternative thought through carefully.

"The whole country and the whole Parliament will need to be involved in considering these issues. We will need to reach a consensus on the number of MPs, the type of proportional system and the timing of any changes."

While advocating some change, Mrs Shipley cautioned people not to expect that reform of the electoral system will solve all the problems associated with governing the country in the interests of New Zealanders.

Mrs Shipley says improved representation enhances the parliamentary process, but good governance has a further dimension, requiring:

A clear vision of the type of New Zealand we are seeking to achieve, with benefits clearly understood by New Zealanders.

A programme based on the principles of honesty, fairness and responsibility in economic and social terms which is planned, presented and followed through by Ministers.

A team united by their commitment to the programme and their determination to make a success of it in policy and administrative terms

And most of all an understanding that good governance requires discipline and an absolute commitment to collective responsibility.  
"The public are entitled to know that members of the Government are working in the best interests of the country, and not their own or their political party's best interest.

"New Zealand is facing a challenge as we approach the turn of the century.

"This country will only prosper and succeed if people feel rewarded in a personal and collective sense for the effort they put in. I believe that only the centre right can deliver this future. The centre left must be forced to say what it stands for, not what it is against, and how they plan to pay for their promises.

"The next two years will be a tough contest politically. The centre right must deliver through clear policy and good governance. It will be an interesting contest and an important opportunity for New Zealanders to consider how their future can best be secured," Mrs Shipley concluded.
