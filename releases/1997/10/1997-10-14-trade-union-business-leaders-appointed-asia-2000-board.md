Council of Trade Unions head Ken Douglas, ANZ Bank Managing Director David Airey, and ASEAN New Zealand Business Council Chair Lex Henry have been appointed to the Board of the Asia 2000 Foundation, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Don McKinnon said today.

Announcing the appointments from Tokyo, Mr McKinnon said the collective expertise of the new trustees would be an asset to Asia 2000, adding more skills and experience to an already high-calibre Board of Trustees.

"Asia 2000 was set up three years ago to enhance New Zealanders' awareness of the importance of our links with Asia," Mr McKinnon said.

"New Zealanders' knowledge and understanding of Asia is increasing all the time because of the Asia 2000 business, education, media and public affairs programmes."

Mr McKinnon said the new trustees bring strong credentials and enormous experience to Asia 2000 and this would strengthen its contribution to the New Zealand - Asia dynamic.

In welcoming the new members Mr McKinnon also paid tribute to outgoing members Grame Ansell, Rick Christie and Rob McLagan, who have completed their term of two years.

"They have played key roles in the establishment of Asia 2000 and should be very satisfied with what has been achieved. We are very grateful for their invaluable contribution."

Ken Douglas will be well-known to many New Zealanders for his wide international labour experience. As well as presiding over the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, Mr Douglas has a specific interest in the events of the region as President of Asia Pacific regional organisation of the International Council for Trade Unions. Mr Douglas is also a member of the Prime Minister's Enterprise Council and and of the Trade Development Board (Tradenz).

David Airey brings to the Asia 2000 Board strong corporate experience in Australia and New Zealand where he has held a number of executive positions. Before his appointment as Managing Director of ANZ Banking Group he was CEO of the Bank of Melbourne and, before that, Managing Director and CEO of the Rural Bank Limited.

Mr Henry chairs the ASEAN New Zealand Business Council and is a Director of Bell Gully's Asia Group. He has worked in the Asia region as an investment banker and diplomat, advising government on trade, fiscal and industrial policy matters. He also co-chairs the CER/AFTA Ministerial Advisory Group, and chairs the International Business Councils' Committee of Chairpersons.
