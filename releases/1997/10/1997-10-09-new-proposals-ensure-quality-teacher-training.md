The Government Green Paper which reviews the way teachers are trained and sets out possible improvements for the future has been released by the Minister of Education.

"There is general consensus in the education sector that teacher training needs to be reviewed. We have to ensure our new teachers get the right training and that those already in the workforce continue to update their skills," Mr Creech said.

"The extent to which our education system succeeds ultimately depends on the quality of teaching in our classrooms. We need well trained, well informed teachers who can achieve results for young people in a rapidly changing environment."

Mr Creech said the Green Paper reviewing teacher education is an opportunity for the general community to give their views about the quality of teaching in New Zealand schools and what we should expect from teachers.

The review examines both pre-service and in-service teacher education, to determine whether the $125 million the Government spends each year on teacher education produces the best results.

"It also considers the importance of quality teachers on the Government's overall objective of raising student achievement," Mr Creech said.

At any one time over 9,000 people are in teacher training.

The Green Paper seeks feedback from the public on what standards should be expected of trained beginning teachers.

It also proposes that most of the funding for teacher professional development be given to schools to manage.

In order to maintain quality in the existing teacher workforce the Government contributes over $60 million a year to teacher professional development. This amounts to about $1500 a year for every full-time teacher.

"I support the idea that decisions about what kinds of professional development are best suited to individual teachers and their schools are best made at the local level," Mr Creech said.

The Green Paper also recommends the establishment of a professional body to set professional standards for teachers.

The functions of the professional body would include the registration and re-registration of teachers. The professional standards would provide a framework within which more specifically performance related criteria could be developed.

"This approach complements the initiative to develop a unified pay system within an integrated teaching service.

"While this Green Paper sets out the Government's general thoughts and strategies, it is not set in concrete," said Mr Creech. "We are saying to teachers, schools and to the community: Here is our thinking on the importance of quality teachers. Now the Government wants to hear from you, and to know whether you think we've got it right."
