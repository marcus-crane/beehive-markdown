New Zealand's Minister for Information Technology has been awarded this year's Service to the Citizen Award, at the 3rd Annual International Summit on Service to the Citizen in Denver, Colorado.

Mr Williamson, the first person outside of the United States to receive the Award, has been recognised for his vision and leadership in service delivery of information technology.

American Vice President Mr Al Gore in a special message to the Summit praised Mr Williamson's information technology foresight and leadership.

"His diverse portfolio, including research, communications, information technology, and local government experience, is a testament to the multi-disciplinary effort needed to make government work better and cost less," said Mr Gore.

While attending the Summit Mr Williamson gave a keynote address on the "Delivery of Government Services in a Digital World."
