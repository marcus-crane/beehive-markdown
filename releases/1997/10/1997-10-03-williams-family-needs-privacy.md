Health Minister Bill English today asked that Northland man Rau Williams and his family be allowed some privacy in coming to terms with Mr Williams' illness.

"Mr Williams' case has been looked at in great detail, first by other renal physicians in New Zealand, then by the High Court, and now by the Human Rights Commission. There has been extensive, and quite frequently ill-informed, discussion about it on talkback radio and in the media in general.

"Yesterday the Human Rights Commission confirmed Northland Health's advice that Mr Williams has serious and multiple underlying medical conditions. Renal dialysis will not save his life.

"There is nothing to be gained by further litigation.

"Members of Mr Williams' immediate family accept that he has had the highest quality care possible and that he will continue to receive excellent care. It is now time for the politicians, the public, and the media to allow the family some privacy in coming to terms with his illness.

"The insensitivity that continues to surround Mr William's case is making a sad and distressing time even more difficult for him, his family, and the staff who continue to provide excellent care and support for him," said Mr English.
