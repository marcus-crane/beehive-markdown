Health Minister Bill English and Associate Health Minister Tuariki Delamere announced today that two community representatives are to be appointed to each of the boards running New Zealand's hospitals.

The Government will invite local councils within each Crown health enterprise region to nominate representatives after publicly advertising for interested people. They will be appointed by the shareholding Ministers. Current local body representatives will not be eligible.

"These nominees will take a full role in the board of each CHE. They will certainly not be token appointments," said the Ministers.

"There has been significant public interest in the idea of having community representatives on hospital boards. We are very pleased to be able to announce this initiative.

"Our public health service of the future is about partnerships. Last year health professionals were appointed to the boards of all CHEs. This initiative is a further step in the direction of achieving a partnership between the Government and the community," they said.

Mr English said boards would also be encouraged to set up community stakeholder groups.

"These groups have been successfully established by Taranaki Health and Southern Health.

"People really want to understand what their local hospital is doing. In Taranaki and Southland there are now groups of 30 to 40 people who are briefed in detail by the hospital's board and management and who can then communicate more widely within the region."

The Ministers said the other important plank of today's announcement was tighter information disclosure rules between hospitals and the Government's funding body, the Transitional Health Authority.

"We will now require hospitals and the funder to share information, which will reinforce the Government's instruction that they are to operate in a co-operative and collaborative way.

"The funder will have to share information on current and future health needs, rationing methodology, purchase intentions, and pricing methodology.

"For their part, hospitals will have to share information on their business plans and unit costs for the service units forming the basis of the contract. Hospitals will also be expected to implement a common method of costing their services," said the Ministers.

Mr Delamere noted he was particularly pleased that these important steps towards strengthening public confidence in the health system had been made possible by the co-operative working relationship between the two health Ministers.
