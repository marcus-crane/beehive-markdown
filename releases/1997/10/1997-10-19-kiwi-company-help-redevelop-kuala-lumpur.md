A New Zealand company will play a major role in the ongoing redevelopment of downtown Kuala Lumpur.

The company is Carson Group which signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Malaysian company Barb Holdings at a ceremony on Friday, overseen by International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith and his Malaysian counterpart Dato' Seri Rafidah bt Aziz in Kuala Lumpur.

"I'm delighted that this deal has come to fruition," Dr Smith said.

"I met with both companies earlier in the year in Wellington when they were only just beginning their relationship. I'm pleased to have been part of the process and to have been able to officiate at the signing ceremony.

"Carsons will provide project management for the multi-million dollar redevelopment of the Chow Kit area of downtown Kuala Lumpur and is committed to further projects in Malaysia where management technology and human resource development skills are required.

"It certainly has the capabilities, having been involved in the refurbishment of parliament and the construction of the Museum of New Zealand. The new joint venture is an example of New Zealand's committment to Malaysia." While in Kuala Lumpur, Dr Smith visited three other New Zealand ventures in Malaysia.
