Education will be strengthened at five South Auckland schools through extra Government funding of up to $9 million over three years, Education Minister Wyatt Creech announced today.

The Southern Cross Campus in Mangere, and Tangaroa and Hillary Colleges in Otara will receive the funding to provide a better education for the young people in the schools.

"The new funding includes additional support and training for teachers to deliver the curriculum, extra training for Boards of Trustees, extra support for students to meet their learning needs and more investment in school property."

The financial support for education in South Auckland is part of the Government's School Improvement and Support policy to help schools with long-term and severe needs.

An extra $30 million over three years was announced in this year's Budget for the School Improvement and Support policy.

"All five schools have been working with the Ministry of Education to develop and implement plans to improve the way their Boards of Trustees operate and improve how the schools are managed. The plans include measures to raise student achievement and strengthen school community relationships.

"We have been monitoring the five schools in South Auckland closely over the last few years. As Minister of Education, I am very pleased that they have made significant progress. With the right support and involvement from the community and Government they have the potential to continue improving," said Mr Creech.

"The student rolls have stabilised, and new appointments to senior management positions have also helped strengthen the schools.

"The time is now right for the Government to ensure that the improvement continues. The injection of such a large level of resources signals a major Government commitment to giving sustained support to schools in Mangere and Otara.

"The parents in the Mangere and Otara communities should already be noticing changes in the schools. They should have greater confidence that their children will have every opportunity to do well at these schools."

Mr Creech said a significant amount of the resources allocated to the Southern Cross Campus would bring three schools together on a middle and senior school site.

The campus comprises Southern Cross Junior School (formerly Southern Cross Primary), Southern Cross Middle School (formerly Mangere Intermediate) and Southern Cross Senior School (formerly Nga Tapuwae College).

"To continue to tap into the extra funding, each of the five South Auckland schools will have to provide comprehensive progress reports to the Ministry of Education twice a year, and once a year they will be independently audited.

"The checks will monitor improvement in student achievement as well as in management and governance so the Government can be assured that the financial assistance is getting the desired results," Mr Creech said.

"This is the first group of schools to have their business cases approved under the School Support policy," said Mr Creech. "Work is underway with other schools in other parts of the country to help them put forward business cases for consideration."

A business case is an agreement between the Ministry of Education and a school's Boards of Trustees where extra investment in the school is tagged to specific actions to improve the delivery of education.
