Prime Minister Jim Bolger said he was disappointed by Labour Leader Helen Clark's personalised attack on him today.

"I would not normally respond to such invective but I was extremely surprised by Ms Clark's comments today.

"Her comments, while colourful, are merely petty politicking and do no credit to the New Zealand Labour Party or to the Parliament of New Zealand.

"For the benefit of Ms Clark, my reference to Mr Blair's speeches in recent weeks have simply served to point out that all progressive Governments are facing similar challenges and are prepared to explore new ways of addressing these.

"I had an enormously positive meeting with Mr Blair yesterday in London - worthy of the warm relations that exist between both our countries. I look forward to seeing him again at the CHOGM in Edinburgh," Mr Bolger said.
