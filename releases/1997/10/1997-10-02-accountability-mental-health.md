Health Minister Bill English announced today the Ministry of Health has laid complaints about individual psychiatrists and nursing staff who were responsible for the care of Jacko Paki.

"Letters have been sent to the Medical Council and the Nursing Council about the standard of care these individuals provided for Mr Paki," Mr English said.

"I said when releasing the District Inspector's report that fairly basic steps in the treatment of Mr Paki appeared not to occur. I asked the Ministry to look into this further and the decision has now been made to lay complaints.

"The decision to take this further action provides an opportunity for the full assessment of the actions of individual psychiatrists and nursing staff involved, taking into account the circumstances in which they were working.

"This is an important step which will provide for a fair hearing whilst ensuring, if necessary, individuals will be held to account for their actions," he said.

"At the same time MidCentral had to address the management and systems issues that have been identified by the District Inspector's report.

"I am advised MidCentral appointed a new Mental Health manager in July. The Crown health enterprise has implemented changes to address other recommendations of both its own and the District Inspector's inquiry. It is also working through the remaining issues that have been raised.

"Both I, and the public expect the same standards applied in mental health as in any other health service," Mr English said.

"In mental health we have to rely on psychiatrists making assessments. I will support their judgements when they have done their professional best, even if, with hindsight it is shown that decision could have been better.

"What I will certainty not support is lapses in professional standards. It is simply not acceptable when basic steps are not taken. In those cases I will demand personal accountability," Mr English said.
