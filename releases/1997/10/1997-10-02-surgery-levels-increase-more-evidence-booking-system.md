Health Minister Bill English today released information which showed that the amount of non-acute surgery being done in public hospitals was increasing.

"In the last year hospitals did four percent more non-acute surgery than the year before. If this is adjusted to take account of how complex the cases were, the increase was 7.6 percent.

"Non-acute surgery is all the surgery that is arranged, including surgery people are on a waiting list for. Anybody who needs surgery immediately because of an acute condition will have their surgery straight away.

"While I am pleased that we are doing more surgery, people are getting conflicting messages because the impression given is that we are seeing cuts in services.

"People need certainty about what they can expect from the public health system. They also need to know that they are being treated fairly or consistently when they need surgery. The only way to fix this is to have a Booking System in place which will give some certainty for people.

"As well as waiting lists for surgery, we now also have data on the number of people waiting for outpatient appointments for surgery from 1993 to 1997. This provides further strong evidence of the need for Booking Systems for non-urgent surgery.

"This information has never been collected and released publicly before. These are the people who are waiting for an appointment with a specialist to find out whether they are going to need surgery.

"I have been warned that the data is considered to be historically inaccurate by both the New Zealand Health Information Service which collects the information and the hospitals which report it.

It is very difficult to get a consistent picture from the data, but it would appear to indicate an increase in the number of people waiting for outpatient appointments. It shows that the number of people waiting for outpatient appointments has grown from nearly 49,000 at December 1993 to 52,500 at December 1996.

"I am advised that most of the increases are due to a combination of better returns being prepared and hospitals reporting surgical outpatient waiting list data for the first time.

"Some of the increase will also be due to the fact that we are doing more surgery in our hospitals. Any increase in people on waiting lists, at any single point in time, may simply reflect more people being seen and treated.

"The apparent increase in the number of people waiting for assessments and the lack of reliability of the figures concerns me. Again, it means that people are on waiting lists without any degree of certainty about how long they will have to wait and whether they are being treated the same as someone in a different part of the country. These are people who don't yet know whether they need surgery or not.

"The only fair and consistent way to do it is to have a system which gives people some certainty about when they are going to be seen.

"The intention is that once the Booking System has been introduced in July next year, people will know how long they will wait for their initial appointment and assessment and, if they need surgery, how long they will wait for that surgery," said Mr English.
