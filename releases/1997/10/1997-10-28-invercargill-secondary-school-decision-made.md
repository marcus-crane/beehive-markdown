A new Form 1 to 7 high school, to be called Elizabeth Park College, will be established in Invercargill in 1999, Education Minister Wyatt Creech announced today.

The school will occupy the site in Regent Street currently used by Kingswell High School, and will replace the Form 3 to 7 Kingswell and Cargill High Schools.

Today's announcement by the Minister of Education follows a review of the provision of secondary schooling in south and east Invercargill.

Mr Creech said the change would resolve the difficulties created by the falling school rolls, especially in southern and eastern Invercargill. Cargill and Kingswell High Schools currently have unoccupied space for 800 more students, and the over-capacity was getting worse because of the city's declining population.

"The Ministry of Education first began working with schools in south and east Invercargill in 1995 in a bid to find local consensus on how to resolve the problem of too many schools and classrooms for the number of students,'' said Mr Creech. \`\`Unfortunately, this was not possible, so it has fallen on me as Minister to resolve the issue in a way that is best for the future secondary school students of Invercargill.

\`\`I can fully understand that many locals will be sad to see the end of two proud schools which have held the respect of their communities,'' said Mr Creech, \`\`But, given the present and expected numbers of students in the area, this decision had to be taken.

\`\`Elizabeth Park College will open at the beginning of the 1999 school year, with Cargill and Kingswell High Schools being formally closed the day before the new school opens.

\`\`This will allow time for all the necessary arrangements to be set in place, such as the appointment of a board of trustees, staffing appointments, and decisions about the school's facilities.

\`\`The period of uncertainty for students, parents and teachers in Invercargill is now at an end. I hope that all those involved with Cargill and Kingswell High Schools will work together to ensure a smooth transition to the new schooling arrangements.

\`\`It is now up to the people of Invercargill to join together to see that their new College has the best possible beginning.''
