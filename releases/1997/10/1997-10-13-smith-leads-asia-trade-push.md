International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith is spearheading a fresh New Zealand push to increase trade with Asia.

Tomorrow, he leaves on a two-week mission that will involve accompanying business delegations to Korea, the Philippines and Vietnam.

"These are growing markets where the business community feels my involvement will add value to their exporting effort," Dr Smith said.

"Latest figures show that seven out of our top 11 export destinations are in Asia -- exports to these seven were worth more than $6.6 billion in the year to June or just under a third of all exports by value. So I'm keen to do all I can to help New Zealand business build further upon this very solid foundation."

The trade delegations to Korea, the Philippines and Vietnam will be mainly promoting New Zealand beef, building products and telecommunications equipment.

Before embarking on the trade missions, Dr Smith will attend trade-related events in Hong Kong and Malaysia.

In Hong Kong, Dr Smith will deliver a key note speech to the prestigious World Economic Forum's East Asia Summit.

"I'll be emphasising the key role that free trade will have to play in Asia's economic development over the next decade," the minister said.

In Malaysia, Dr Smith will attend the second ministerial meeting involving members of the Asean Free Trade Area (AFTA) and the CER partners, Australia and New Zealand. The AFTA-CER dialogue aims to reduce trade barriers between the two free trade areas.

"Last year's inaugural ministerial meeting got this promising dialogue off to a healthy start. I'm confident this year's gathering can help maintain the momentum to increased cooperation," Dr Smith said.

The minister will also sign a Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement with Malaysia, while he will hold discussions about such an arrangement with Hong Kong.

"This is positive for us, as these types of aggreement enable New Zealand to hold regular bilateral consultations with its trading partners and provides for dispute resolution on trade matters," Dr Smith said.
