Minister for Racing, Tau Henare will represent New Zealand racing interests at the 1997 conference of Australian racing ministers, in Melbourne on Friday.

This is the second time that the New Zealand racing minister has been invited to the conference, which is being hosted by Victorian racing minister, Tom Reynolds MP.

\`\`I consider Mr Reynolds' invitation to be a clear indication of the important role that New Zealand plays in the wider Australasian racing industry,'' says Mr Henare.

\`\`It is widely accepted that the New Zealand racing industry competes in a very tough Australasian market. This competition is not only evidenced by events such as the Melbourne Cup and the Interdominions, but also in the breeding industry.

\`\`Australian owners always feature strongly at this country's various yearling sales. Furthermore, leading New Zealand trainers have established stables across the Tasman to ensure that their horses are appropriately turned out for racing. Similarly, Australian trainers are establishing bases in New Zealand,'' says Mr Henare.

\`\`The Conference provides an excellent forum for Australasian racing ministers to meet and to examine issues facing the region's racing industry''.
