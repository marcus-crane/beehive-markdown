Health Minister Bill English announced today the $28 million redevelopment of the Sunnyside and Princess Margaret hospitals.

"I visited Sunnyside in May and said publicly some of the facilities were a disgrace. Staff were doing a good job in difficult circumstances but the fact remained the public health system had to provide better for patients and staff," Mr English said.

"I am delighted to announce the Government has agreed to the redevelopment. People involved with both hospitals have put a great deal of work into this project over a long time. I am pleased we can now front up with the cash to enable them to proceed.

"The Government will contribute $9 million over three years. The remaining finance will be raised through the sale of surplus land at the Sunnyside site and through borrowing.

"The plans include renovating Princess Margaret so that it can cater for people with mental health problems that would currently be catered for at the run-down Sunnyside site. Accommodation for older people's health will also be up-graded at Princess Margaret. A secure unit, acute and specialists facilities will be renovated and retained at Sunnyside which will cater for up to 110 people," Mr English said.

"Sunnyside hospital is made up of out-dated and dilapidated villas that span over 50 acres. This type of complex, with such things as communal showers that provide no privacy for patients, belongs to a bygone era in mental health care.

"This redevelopment will enable staff to provide the sort of care a modern public health system should be providing," he said.

"It is interesting to note today that as I am announcing this new health project in the south today the Prime Minister Jim Bolger is opening a Super-clinic in Manukau.

"The Government is also building a brand new regional hospital in Hawkes Bay. A new hospital has just opened in Dannevirke. We are spending $3 million up-grading facilities at Kenepuru Hospital in Porirua.

"We have also announced a $52 million redevelopment of MidCentral hospital site in Palmerston North and are considering a major project to revamp central Auckland hospitals.

"As well there are several smaller communities such as Balclutha planning new health centres for their districts. This year the Government ear-marked $630 million for capital development in health over the next three years. This proves the Government's long-term commitment to our public health system," Mr English said.
