Health Minister Bill English said that he had received a proposal today for the joint provision of services by Lakeland Health and Eastbay Health.

"People living in these areas need certainty and security about what public health services are available to them.

"These communities have more sick people than most around the country, so we need to make sure we use public health funds effectively.

"Eastbay Health has been a successful, well run organisation, but its financial outlook is not good, and the same is true of Lakeland. Continual financial losses undermine public certainty about the hospitals. The two boards, along with managers, doctors and nurses have worked hard to find an answer.

"The report sets out how to get the best hospital services for the funding available. We also want to take the opportunity to provide stronger, more integrated community-based services in the areas served by Eastbay and Lakeland.

"The sooner decisions are made the better, so the community can be secure about its public health services."

Mr English said he hoped to be able to make a decision on the proposal within the next few weeks.
