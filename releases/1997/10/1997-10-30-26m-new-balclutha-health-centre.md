Health Minister Bill English announced today that financial support for a new health centre in Balclutha had been approved by the Government.

"Funding of $2.6 million towards the cost of the development has been approved under the Community Trust Assistance Scheme.

"The health centre will be run by the Clutha Community Health Trust. In addition to the Government's support, which will be by way of a suspensory loan, the Trust will raise the remaining capital costs through the private sector.

"A range of services will be provided at the new centre, including medical inpatient beds, a minor procedures theatre facility, basic trauma and stabilisation emergency services, maternity beds, community services, radiology and laboratory services, assessment, treatment and rehabilitation beds, and rooms for visiting clinics.

"The Trust will contract with Southern Regional Health to provide services from the centre.

"I know that people in Balclutha will feel a great sense of excitement that there is now certainty over the publicly-funded health services for the area. People have been waiting a long time for this decision.

"This is the right outcome to give the people of Balclutha a modern health centre that has the flexibility to meet present and future needs.

"The members of the working party must be congratulated for the foresight they have had to proceed with this scheme and for the sheer hard work they have put in to make it happen."

Mr English said that the health centre should be operational by late-1998.
