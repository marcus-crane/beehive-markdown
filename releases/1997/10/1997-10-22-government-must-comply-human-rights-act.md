The Minister of Justice, Hon D.A.M. Graham, said today Cabinet had agreed that Government policy and practice will be required to be non-discriminatory under the terms of the Human Rights Act, unless specifically exempted by legislation or regulation.

The Consistency 2000 project required the Human Rights Commission to examine and report on all legislation, regulations, policies and practices by December 1998.

'Following Cabinet's decision, the Government intends to introduce legislation relieving the Commission of this responsibility,' Mr Graham said.

'Chief Executives will now be responsible for managing their departments' legal risks in meeting the requirements of the law regarding human rights.

'This includes responsibility for the new grounds of discrimination after 31 December 1999.'

Mr Graham said Cabinet's decision requires a report from him by the end of February on discussions with other Ministers on the scope of specific exemptions relating to their portfolios which will require statutory or regulatory action.

This exercise will involve departmental officials and the Human Rights Commission.

'Those exemptions will have to be justified,' Mr Graham said.

The report will also establish mechanisms to assist departments to comply with the Human Rights Act wherever possible.

The Government intends to make it clear that existing and future legislation or regulations are not overridden by the Human Rights Act.

Mr Graham confirmed that before introduction all Government bills must be vetted for compliance with the Bill of Rights Act which contains the same anti-discrimination grounds as the Human Rights Act. The Attorney-General is required to bring any breach to the attention of the House.

All regulations are referred to the Regulations Review Committee which can scrutinise them on a number of grounds, including whether the regulation trespasses on personal rights and liberties. If thought necessary, any member of that Committee can move that a regulation be disallowed.

Existing legislation and regulations will remain in force and any possible conflicts with the Human Rights Act will be addressed as they are amended.

NB: A Q&A summary on the Human Rights Act and Consistency 2000 is attached to this Press Release.

Questions about the Government's decision regarding Government Compliance with the Human Rights Act

What discrimination is prohibited under the Human Rights Act 1993 and in what activities?  
The Human Rights Act prohibits discrimination in several areas of public activity, on the following grounds:

sex  
religious beliefs  
colour  
ethnic or national origins  
age  
employment status  
sexual orientation  
marital status  
ethical belief  
race  
disability  
political opinion  
family status  
The areas of public activity concerned include:

employment matters  
access to places  
provision of goods and services  
accommodation  
access to education  
However, the general rule against discrimination is subject to a number of specific and general exceptions.

What exceptions exist under the Act?

The Act provides a series of specific exceptions tied to particular areas of activity or particular grounds. Below are examples of some specific exceptions.  
Employment matters:

it is not unlawful to employ a person on the basis of their age or sex if it is a genuine qualification for the job concerned (in the acting profession, for instance);  
different treatment based on sex is permitted where it is a position in an organised religion and the religion's rules require such treatment (priests, ministers and rabbis, for instance);  
a person with a disability may be treated differently where the performance or job could only be done by creating an unreasonable risk of harm to that person or others.  
Access to places, vehicles and facilities:

it is not unlawful to provide separate facilities for each sex for reasons of public decency and safety (separate lavatories for men and women, for instance);  
the Act does not require that special access facilities be provided to persons with disabilities unless it is reasonable in the circumstances to do so.  
Provision of goods and services:

courses or counselling involving highly personal matters may be restricted to persons of a particular sex, race, ethnic or national origin, or sexual orientation;  
insurance policies may differentiate between sex and age groups if the differentiation is based on relevant statistical data relating to life-expectancy, accidents or sickness (there are often lower premiums for people who are young and healthy, for instance).  
Accommodation:

a person wishing to share residential accommodation may discriminate on the prohibited grounds;  
hostels may provide accommodation only for persons of the same marital status, sex, or religious or ethical belief, or for persons with a particular disability, or for persons in a particular age group.  
Access to education:

a school for one sex, race, or religious belief, or for students with a particular disability, or for students of a particular age group may refuse admission to someone on these grounds (this allows for girls-only and boys-only schools, for instance);  
educational training, facilities and financial grants may be offered to persons only within a particular age group or above a certain age.  
The Act also provides some general exceptions that allow positive discrimination where it is done to assist a person or group of persons who require assistance to achieve an equal place with other members of the community. One example in the Act permits Crown work, training and employment assistance schemes to determine eligibility on the basis of age, employment status or family group.

The Act currently permits discrimination if it is contained in legislation or regulation. Examples are:

Immigration Act  
Marriage Act  
Matrimonial Property Act  
Social Security Act

Why are exceptions required for some Government activities?  
An important part of what the Government does is to decide, in a world of limited resources, who will get access to which public goods and services. There is also a limited re-distribution role for Government, as it seeks to make certain that the burdens and the benefits of our society are distributed in ways that our society considers fair. In doing these things, Governments often take into consideration age, disability, marital status, or employment status of people as a means of deciding, for example, who should be eligible for government assistance and what level of assistance they should receive.

There are plenty of current policies which 'discriminate' in this way:

free doctor's visits only to children under six  
unemployment benefit only to those who don't have a job  
superannuation payments only to people over a specified age  
different student allowance rules for students who are under 25 years of age  
different benefit entitlements for single people, married people, and two single people sharing a place to live  
medical tests for getting a driver's licence for those over 71  
more favourable immigration treatment to people from some countries  
All of these are covered by exceptions in the Human Rights Act or are authorised under other legislation.

The challenge is to make certain that when such decisions are taken, human rights are taken into account and the proposed exception can be shown to be justified.

In the past, have individual Ministers, when implementing Government policy, been able to discriminate?  
Yes, although only on some grounds.

Will they be able to discriminate on these grounds in the future?  
No, they won't.

To what extent will the Government itself be subject to the Act, and how will future exceptions be processed?  
The Government is properly subject to the Act in matters of employment, access to buildings, accommodation, etc. But there are areas in the delivery of services such as welfare benefits, health and education where finite resources mean that rationing is inevitable. The Government must be able to do this. In the future where current exceptions are not adequate or where in the past the Minister has made decisions to discriminate any discrimination will have to be authorised by legislation or regulation. By doing that, there will be a transparent process to enable the public to make submissions and be heard. Accordingly it is proposed to restrict any proposal which might discriminate to those areas: a. Approved by Parliament by enacting legislation (The Attorney General must advise Parliament where a Bill may breach the Bill of Rights which contains the same prohibitions on discrimination as the Human Rights Act). b. Approved by the Executive Council by promulgating regulations (all regulations are referred to the Regulations Review Select Committee which can require a regulation to be debated in Parliament on a motion for disallowance of the regulation).

Both procedures allow public input.

What examples are there of specific exceptions the Government may propose which will require legislative authority?

Payment of Social Welfare discretionary benefits such as emergency benefits and special benefits to those people most in need and at rates appropriate to individual circumstances.

Payment of school transport assistance for students in rural areas.

Subsidised tuition costs for some people who are enrolled in tertiary education.

What is Consistency 2000?  
The Human Rights Act requires the Human Rights Commission to identify all the legislative provisions and all the government policies and administrative practices which conflict with the Human Rights Act, and report the results to the Minister of Justice by 31 December 1998. The Human Rights Commission named this project 'Consistency 2000'.

After the Human Rights Commission has, with help from all government departments, completed Consistency 2000, the Government has until 31 December 1999 to respond to the results. This would involve weighing up the public interest and other policy issues in order to decide where unreasonable discrimination needed to be remedied to comply with the Human Rights Act and in what areas of government activity an exception from the Human Rights Act was needed.

So what is proposed now?  
It has been decided that the very detailed and centralised approach of Consistency 2000, conducted all at one time, is not justified. Legislation to relieve the Human Rights Commission of the responsibility to conduct the Consistency 2000 review before the end of 1998 will be introduced.

Chief Executives of every government department will be responsible for making sure that their department is complying with the Human Rights Act.

Existing legislation will be checked for compliance as it comes up for amendment. The work done to date on the Consistency 2000 project will be utilised. There may need to be some new exceptions to cover areas like income support system and some areas in education. These will be authorised by legislation or regulation (see 10. below).

Section 151(1) will be retained and will not expire on the 31 December 1999 as presently provided. This section provides that the Human Rights Act shall not limit or affect the provisions of any other Act or Regulation in force.

What about conflicts which have already been identified?  
These are likely to be areas of current policy and practice not authorised by legislation or regulation and which involve legitimate discrimination. These will need specific exceptions passed through legislation or regulations. These will be discussed with relevant Ministers and officials will be required to report back on the scope of specific exceptions by 28 February 1998.
