The Minister of Youth Affairs today welcomed the announcement that proof-of-age cards will be available in 1999 from driver testing agents.

As well as providing photographic driving licences, the LTSA will offer the opportunity to anyone, regardless of whether they have a drivers licence or not, to obtain a secure and nationally recognisable proof-of-age card.

Earlier this year the Liquor Review recommended to lower the legal age at which you can buy alcohol, from 20 years to 18 years.

Hon Deborah Morris said, "I welcomed the recommendation to lower the age for purchasing alcohol, but with two qualifications. Firstly that there should be a national proof-of-age card, and secondly that there be no exceptions to the age at which you can purchase alcohol."

"I have consistently called for the introduction of proof-of-age cards because as the law currently stands, there are a number of exceptions to the legal age of 20. This makes it very difficult to enforce the law and results in under-age people accessing liquor.

"It is interesting to note that calls for proof-of-age cards have come from all quarters - including the Police, retailers, the alcohol industry and young people themselves. There appears to be a consensus that if we adopt a risk management approach, then we can empower young people to drink more safely.

"The introduction of a nationally administered proof-of-age card will introduce safeguards for retailers and hosts while allowing those who are legally entitled to purchase alcohol to do so," said Deborah Morris.
