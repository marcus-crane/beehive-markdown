"Wool producers are desperate to see the Wool Board face up to the challenges of the next century and provide a lead," Transport Minister Jenny Shipley told the board's annual conference in Wanganui today.

"Our farmers and the products they produce will always be a core part of our economy, but as with all other sectors of the economy there is no reward for standing still. The challenge is to grow the business, in full or in part.

"The reality of the next century is that New Zealand's trading partners in APEC and the World Trade Organisation may well expect us to end the Producer Boards' monopolies where they exist and possibly the statutory authority which boards currently enjoy. If free trade agreements are an available option, then it may be not a question of if, but a matter of when the Government would want the producer boards to move.

"Those in the wool industry should see this as a challenge, not a threat. If a producer board is a skilful marketer, and working with producers to find new and better ways of doing things, then it has nothing to fear from competition.

"The other challenge for the Wool Board is to recognise the role of the women in our rural communities.

"As Minister of Women's Affairs, last week I released a report on the opportunities for, and constraints on, rural women in New Zealand. That report recognised the essential nature of the work rural women do, which came as no surprise to any of us. It is a fascinating report and is worth reading. It also highlighted the poor representation of rural women on agricultural industry governing bodies.

"I am sure the male members of this board are competent and capable and represent their communities well, but I cannot believe there are not women with equal skills. This is not only a matter of representation, but a matter of the contribution a female mind can bring as we face the strategic challenges of how to get "stretch" in the industry.

"As we approach the turn of the century all organisations, including the Wool Board, need the perspective, experience and insight of women as well as men.

"I find it disappointing in this day and age that the only woman member of the Wool Board is a Government appointee. It is a challenge for the whole farming community.

"Stock numbers and current market indicators demonstrate that the wool industry is in for another demanding year, yet the product and its potential still leaves us with real opportunities to show a good return to farmers. This will only work if industry issues are addressed. The auction system, marketing and brand issues should all be on the Wool Board's agenda, " Mrs Shipley concluded.
