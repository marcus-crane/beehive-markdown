Simon Upton, Minister for the Environment, announced today that New Zealand had for the first time secured a position on the Bureau (the governing body) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC is the key international body assessing the science of climate change. Dr Martin Manning from the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) was elected to the Bureau at the 13th Plenary of the IPCC held recently in the Maldives.

The IPCC, which is sponsored by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), is the key body providing scientific advice to the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC). The IPCC has been responsible for providing comprehensive scientific assessments on climate change, and other reports and technical papers which are assisting international negotiations under the FCCC. These negotiations are due to reach a critical stage in Kyoto in December this year with a legally binding agreement for greenhouse gas emissions reduction scheduled for completion.

Dr Manning is a project director and senior scientist with NIWA where he is responsible for a wide range of research programmes. He was elected as Vice-Chair of IPCC Working Group Two. He is one of only 30 members elected from countries throughout the world. Working Group  
Two will consider the vulnerability and impacts aspects of climate change as a contribution to the planned IPCC Third Assessment Report to be finalised in the year 2000/01. The last comprehensive assessment of climate change science was completed by the IPCC at the end of 1995. Dr Manning has long been associated with IPCC activities, including as an expert reviewer, and as a New Zealand delegate to meetings and workshops.

"It is important that southern hemisphere countries are represented on the IPCC Bureau as the science issues in the two hemispheres are of a different nature, not only because the southern hemisphere is largely ocean, but also because its countries are more reliant on agriculture and forestry than the industrialised north," Mr Upton said. "Dr Manning will bring a wealth of experience to the IPCC Bureau. His international science  
reputation, particularly in atmospheric chemistry, together with his involvement in national climate change science advisory bodies, in both New Zealand and Australia, will be invaluable."
