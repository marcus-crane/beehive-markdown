New Zealand's next Ambassador to Brazil will be career diplomat Caroline Forsyth, Foreign Affairs Minister, Don McKinnon, said from Tokyo today.

New Zealand's Ambassador in Santiago, Chile, is currently cross-accredited to Brazil, but with the opening of a new Embassy in Buenos Aires shortly, arrangements have been made with the Brazilian Government for Ms Forsyth to be cross-accredited from Buenos Aires.

"The creation of another Latin American post will allow us to give Brazil more of the diplomatic and trade policy attention it deserves," Mr McKinnon said. "I look forward to increased cooperation between us in a whole range of areas."

"Brazil is a major agricultural exporter and, like us, a member of the Cairns Group of countries seeking liberalisation of agricultural trade. We share a lot of the same trade interests."

Brazil is the fifth-largest country in the world. It is one of the largest industrialised economies in Latin America and, with Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, is a member of the Southern American Common Market (MERCOSUR).

The continued success of its economic restructuring programme, and its war on inflation and fiscal management mean that Brazil can be expected to continue as a significant and expanding trading partner. In 1997 New Zealand exported $106.8 million worth of goods to Brazil and imported goods totalling $72.8 million. Both the Dairy Board and Fletcher Challenge have significant investments in the Brazilian economy.

Brazil and New Zealand also share interests in United Nations reform, the law of the sea, and Antarctic issues.

Brazil opened an Embassy in Wellington with a resident Ambassador earlier this year.
