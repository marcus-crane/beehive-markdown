The new Social Studies curriculum document launched today challenges students to investigate issues in society, and to explore different perspectives and values, Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

Mr Creech released the finalised social studies curriculum Social Studies in the New Zealand Curriculum at Martinborough School in the Wairarapa this morning.

For primary school children, it is the first new social studies curriculum for 35 years. Secondary school students had a revision to their curriculum seven years ago.

"The new curriculum will help students develop inquiring minds both about themselves and about their community," he said. "It will help them to make decisions, solve problems, and work co-operatively with others.

"Through this curriculum, students will learn about New Zealand and what it's like to be a New Zealander. They will also have the opportunity to study communities and societies in places beyond our shores, including the Pacific, Europe and Asia," Mr Creech said.

The new curriculum clearly states the Government's expectation of student achievement for years 1-13 and provides clear direction for teachers on what students should achieve.

Through the curriculum students will find out how individuals, groups, cultures and societies interact in their different environments. It aims to enhance students' understanding of their cultural heritage and to develop respect for cultural diversity.

Young people will find out about economic processes and economic activities.

"The final social studies curriculum statement has undergone extensive consultation, discussion and debate. In a somewhat unusual move two drafts of the statement were released," Mr Creech said. "During the development of the document, 370 official submissions were received, and hundreds of meetings were convened throughout the country to hear the views of interested people.

"I think the final social studies curriculum statement we have now contains the right balances."

There will be a transition period of two years before the statement is mandatory from the beginning of the year 2000. This transition period will provide schools with time to trial the statement and plan for its full implementation.

Schools will receive the document next week.
