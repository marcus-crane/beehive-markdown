New Zealand's new High Commissioner to Niue will be career diplomat, Michael Pointer, Foreign Minister Don McKinnon announced today. "New Zealand's relationship with Niue is one of particular closeness, stemming from the special constitutional link, strong family ties and shared historical development," Mr McKinnon said.

"Niue is very much part of New Zealand's extended family. That has been underpinned over the years by a sizeable Niuean community in New Zealand and excellent rapport between the leaders of the two countries" said Mr McKinnon. Referring to Niue's economic reforms, Mr McKinnon said that within the South Pacific region Niue had made impressive headway in public sector restructuring.

The Minister said that Development Assistance would remain an important element in the relationship. "Over recent years there has been a conscious decision to move away from budget support and give increased emphasis to private sector development. I am confident that there are good opportunities for Niue to expand further its private sector." Mr McKinnon cited the tourism sector as one of particular potential for Niue.

Mr McKinnon said that Mr Pointer, who has considerable experience in South Pacific affairs was ideally placed to undertake his appointment. Mr Pointer has worked in the South Pacific and Development Cooperation Divisions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. He has also previously undertaken an attachment with the South Pacific Commission in Noumea.
