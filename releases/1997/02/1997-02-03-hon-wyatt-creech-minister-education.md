The Education Minister today warned against drawing conclusions from the initial results of the Principals Federation survey of primary schools.

We need far better quality information upon which to base our thinking, Mr Creech said.

The Principals Federation has responses from 800 out of a total of 2,240 primary schools. Thats just 35% of all primary schools. The survey results fail to depict the full picture and therefore I do not believe they add much to constructive debate about the situation in our schools.

For example the survey quotes that the schools have just over 500 permanent positions filled by relievers.

Mr Creech said that in reality there have always been permanent positions filled by relievers.

The survey actually significantly under-reports what is a fairly normal state of affairs. Two years ago for example, when people did not consider there to be a teacher shortage, more than a quarter (6250) of the 22,000 primary teachers were on some sort of limited contract.

The survey also states that there are 172 overseas teachers in the 800 schools - when in fact we know in Auckland there are close to 500 overseas teachers.

Mr Creech said the Ministry of Education was conducting a comprehensive survey of all schools and their staffing situation. The results are due next week.

I am concerned about some ill-informed claims about the quality of teachers. Overseas teachers must be fully trained and qualified to be registered here. They are receiving additional support from the Education Ministry to inform them on the New Zealand curriculum. The bottom line is that these teachers have similar levels of training and qualifications to New Zealand teachers.

The suggestion that overseas teachers were paid more than their New Zealand colleagues is simply incorrect. In fact in some circumstances New Zealand graduate teachers are entitled to extra provisions under their employment contract to assist them relocate to jobs.

Mr Creech said there would be ongoing efforts to ensure teacher quality is maintained and that schools have adequate relief teaching lists.
