The design and plans submitted during the competition for the new Parliamentary Building project will be displayed in a public exhibition.

The winning design released last November was chosen following a competition between six design firms.

A panel of experts and politicians decided the Designgroup proposal best met the detailed set of conditions and criteria needed to ensure the building met the needs of an MMP Parliament.

The exhibition of all competing entries will also include plans and other background information explaining how each design firm responded to the specific requirements needed in the new building.

The exhibition will be held in March in The Beehive Foyer.

Meanwhile work is progressing to advance the building project.
