"Nigeria. Nuclear Safety Standards. Disarmament. The UN. The new Clinton Administration. These are the themes which will be on my agenda over the next ten days," Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said today, on the eve of his departure for Europe and North America.

"First up I attend a meeting of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group on Nigeria". CMAG is charged with monitoring Nigeria's progress towards democracy and determining the duration of Nigeria's suspension from the Commonwealth. Mr McKinnon is the Vice Chair of CMAG.

"In Vienna - where the International Atomic Energy Agency is based and where negotiations take place on nuclear safety and liability for nuclear accidents - I will have the opportunity to reinforce New Zealand's concerns on issues like the transport of nuclear waste. At the Conference on Disarmament and in meetings with key senior figures in Geneva, I will be making very clear New Zealand's stance on disarmament issues, especially the future agenda on nuclear disarmament and landmines".

"The next leg takes me to New York. There I'm meeting Kofi Annan, the new Secretary-General of the United Nations. Kofi is a good friend of New Zealand's and I am looking forward to reviewing with him the options for reform and strengthening of the United Nations". Mr Annan was appointed to the Secretary-General's job in December last year, replacing Boutros-Boutros Ghali.

"Finally in Washington, I will meet key members of the second Clinton Administration, as well as key House representatives".

Mr McKinnon is in London 17-18 February; Vienna 19 February, Geneva 20-21 (am) February, New York 21-24 February and Washington 25-26 February.
