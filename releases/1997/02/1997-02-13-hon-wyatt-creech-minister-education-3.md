The Ministry of Education's teacher survey paints a pleasing picture for schools with the number of vacancies lower than a normal situation, Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

\`\`The quality data in the comprehensive survey of schools goes a long way towards dispelling the myth that schools would not have enough teachers.

\`\`The staffing situation is better than it has been in recent years. That is despite the fact that since 1995 we have need about 2,500 additional teachers in our classes because of roll growth and improvements to teacher:pupil ratios.''

Mr Creech said he was encouraged by the figures which show schools have their staffing well under control.

\`\`For example the 578.2 teacher vacancies compares to the 700 vacancies the Ministry traditionally expects to be open at any one time.

\`\`The school year has started on a positive note, and I will be ensuring that every effort is made to keep on top of the situation as the year progresses. Further work will be done to ensure staffing levels continue to be appropriate, with initiatives planned to ensure there is a suitable reserve of relief teachers.

\`\`The Ministry will continue to monitor schools with staffing concerns, and give assistance where necessary,'' Mr Creech said.
