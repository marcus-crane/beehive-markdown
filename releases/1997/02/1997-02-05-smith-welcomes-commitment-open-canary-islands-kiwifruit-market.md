Agriculture & Trade Minister Lockwood Smith today welcomed the commitment by European Union Agriculture Commissioner, Dr Franz Fischler, that the kiwifruit market in the Canary Islands would be open to New Zealand kiwifruit exports within weeks.

The potential trade is estimated to be worth around $1million annually.

This is welcome news for the New Zealand kiwifruit industry, Dr Smith said.

The way that this problem has been resolved, illustrates how New Zealand can work constructively with the European Union in many areas to liberalise trading conditions, Dr Smith commented.

New Zealand has been pressing the EU since 1994 to lift a quarantine restriction which has kept New Zealand kiwifruit out of the Canary Islands market, which falls under Spanish jurisdiction.
