The Minister of Fisheries, John Luxton and Minister of Conservation, Nick Smith today announced they will review the by-catch numbers of New Zealand sealions in the sub antarctic islands.

The Minister of Fisheries set the maximum allowable level of fishing related mortalities at 79 New Zealand sealions for the current fishing season, and this will now be reviewed. The review follows the death of hundreds of sealion pups and a unknown number of adult sealions around the Auckland and Campbell Islands. Scientists are yet to establish the cause of the deaths. "Reviewing the by-catch level is a responsible and precautionary approach.

I have asked the Department of Conservation to develop proposals for a new catch limit based on a revised estimate of the population of sealions in the sub-antarctic islands", said Mr Smith. "Our squid industry is very important for exports and jobs. We need to work through this complex issue carefully.

I hope to receive advice on possible options in the next couple of weeks", said Mr Luxton. The Ministers announced they would also consider other options in reviewing the current management arrangement for the squid fishery.

The squid fishing season around the Auckland and Campbell Islands has only started in the last week. To date there has been little fishing activity in this area.
