Education Minister Wyatt Creech has asked the Ministry of Education to report to him on the issues being raised in the media relating to a job training course offered by the Te Wananga O Aotearoa.

If the preliminary media reports are correct there is cause for serious concern about an alleged link between a course at the Wananga and reports of a group of students attempting to rob a bank.

I have asked the Education Ministry to report to me on the facts of the situation, whether appropriate actions had been taken to ensure the quality of the course offered, whether any approvals had been given to the course content and how the course was funded.

Mr Creech said he would also write to the head of the Wananga to get an explanation of the events as he sees them.
