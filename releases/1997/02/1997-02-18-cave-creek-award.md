The Attorney-General, Paul East, today announced the compensation award by the mediator-arbitrator appointed to settle claims arising from the Cave Creek platform collapse.

Mr East said that the total award made by the mediator-arbitrator, the Right Honourable Sir Duncan McMullin, was $2,675,000. The Government will move promptly to implement the settlement.

"It has been agreed by the parties involved in the mediation-arbitration that the amounts of compensation paid to individual claimants remain confidential.

"The Government is naturally pleased that this matter has been resolved without court action. It means that the parties have been spared the stress, delay, uncertainty and expense which court action would have involved," said Mr East.
