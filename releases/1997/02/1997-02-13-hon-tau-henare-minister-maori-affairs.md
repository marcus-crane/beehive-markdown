The Minister of Maori Affairs, the Hon Tau Henare, today announced the release of the report of the Independent Review committee on Compensation Issues. The committee was established to provide an opinion on the compensation provisions contained in the Maori Reserved Land Amendment Bill 1996.

I have decided to release the report to the public as I believe it will contribute to and foster sensible debate on the compensation provisions in the Maori Reserved Land Amendment Bill, said the Minister.

The report has been referred to the Justice and Law Reform Select committee which will shortly be considering the Maori Reserved Land Amendment Bill.

Mr Henare said he was confident the select committee will give all of the issues associated with the Bill and the reform of the Maori reserved land leases thorough and balanced consideration.

The Minister said the introduction of the Maori Reserved Land Amendment Bill was a landmark step towards resolving a long-standing inequitable relationship between Maori reserved land owners and Maori reserved land lessees.

A considerable amount of work has gone into this process and I am pleased with the progress, said Mr Henare.
