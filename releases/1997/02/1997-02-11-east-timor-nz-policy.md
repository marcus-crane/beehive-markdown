"We had a discussion about New Zealand's approach to East Timor in Cabinet yesterday," Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said today.

"There has been no change in the Government's position on East Timor. We will continue to monitor the situation closely, and to support the United Nations-sponsored talks currently underway. It remains important to keep our lines open to the Indonesian authorities. We are looking at ways to further our development assistance in the province. As a member of the 1994 Parliamentary mission to East Timor, Hon Tau Henare will continue to take a special interest in the situation of the East Timorese people."
