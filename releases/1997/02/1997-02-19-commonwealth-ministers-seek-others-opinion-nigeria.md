The Commonwealth Ministers Action Group on Nigeria will seek information on Nigeria from non-governmental organisations and international and regional groups before a final report is submitted to CHOGM in Edinburgh later this year. At the end of the first day of the two day meeting Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said that canvassing other groups' opinions - either Nigerian exiles or any others with an interest in the country's politics - would give the report balance.

"While progress towards democracy in Nigeria has been slow, it is CMAG and other groups in the international community that ensures progress does occur".

"Pressure must be maintained and Nigerian commitments must be adhered to," he said.

"It is clear Nigeria wants to hold on to its Commonwealth membership. Only continued pressure by CMAG and a positive response by Nigeria will ensure that expulsion from the Commonwealth does not take place," Mr McKinnon warned.

The CMAG meeting concluded yesterday with the eight Foreign Ministers meeting Her Majesty The Queen.
