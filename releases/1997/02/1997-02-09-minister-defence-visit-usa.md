Minister of Defence, Paul East, leaves for Hawaii tomorrow where he will meet with the Commander in Chief of the United States Armed Forces in the Pacific, Admiral Prueher.

"Following recent elections in both countries the visit will serve to continue the high level contacts on defence and security questions which have occurred in recent years between the two countries. The meeting with Admiral Prueher will be a good opportunity to exchange views on events and developments in the Asia Pacific area that are of mutual interest," said Mr East.

Following the meeting with Admiral Prueher the Minister will visit Portland, Oregon, to attend the commissioning of HMNZS RESOLUTION into the Royal New Zealand Navy. The ship, the ex USNS TENACIOUS will take over the charting and oceanographic research work of HMNZ Ships MONOWAI and TUI which will be retired.
