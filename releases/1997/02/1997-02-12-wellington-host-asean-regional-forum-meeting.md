Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said today that an Intersessional Meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) would be held in Wellington on 19-20 February.

The subject of the Wellington meeting will be disaster relief - an issue of importance to the security of many regional states. New Zealand will co-host the meeting with Thailand.

"As we well know from the South Pacific, disasters can have a major impact on the security of states and peoples," Mr McKinnon said. "Looking at this sort of issue is part of the new multilateral approach to security adopted by the ARF."

"Bringing together countries with different security perspectives, and especially military representatives, is a hallmark of the ARF's approach of gradually building confidence and dialogue throughout the region," the Minister added. "By hosting the conference New Zealand will be doing its bit to contribute to the stability and security of the region."

"I am also pleased to have this opportunity to work together with Thailand, an increasingly important partner for New Zealand in the region," he said.

The 21-member ARF is the principal regional security organisation and the most important forum currently discussing security issues. It meets annually at Ministerial level, and also holds a series of working level meetings among officials and defence personnel to discuss aspects of regional security.

The Wellington meeting falls into the latter category.

The ARF was initiated in Bangkok in August 1994. It comprises 21 members: the seven ASEAN nations (Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Viet Nam and Brunei), New Zealand, Australia, China, Japan, South Korea, the US, Russia, Canada, India, the European Union, Papua New Guinea, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.
