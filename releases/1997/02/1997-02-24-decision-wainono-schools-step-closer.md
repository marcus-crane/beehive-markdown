Education Minister, Wyatt Creech has taken the next step towards settling the future of four Wainono schools in South Canterbury.

\`\`It is time a decisions was made,'' said the Minister.

\`\`There has been substantial and lengthy discussion - dating back to pre-1989 - about the future of Hook, Hunter, Makikihi and Otaio primary schools. I have now written to the four school boards advising them of possible closure,'' Mr Creech said.

\`\`Each of the schools has a low roll and there is reasonable access to other schools.

\`\`The schools have until the end of March to present arguments in favour of staying open. I give an assurance that no final decision will be made until any information provided by the Boards has been considered.''

Mr Creech recognised the significant work by the local community and the Education Ministry on the best way to provide education for the students in the region.

\`\`The lengthy discussions over the future of the schools have failed to produce community agreement. I visited the area last year to talk to school representatives about the issue. A decision is overdue - and is now needed to give the community certainty.''
