Foreign Minister Don McKinnon today announced the appointment of Datuk Mohamad Amin Bin Haji Satem as New Zealand's first Honorary Consul in the Malaysian State of Sarawak.

"This new position recognises the particular importance of New Zealand's links with Sarawak," Mr McKinnon said. "I am sure that, with his support, these links will grow."

Last year, the Chief Minister of Sarawak visited New Zealand and this year Mr McKinnon is looking forward to the visit of another distinguished Sarawak leader, the Federal Minister for Agriculture, Datuk Amar Dr Sulaiman Daud, in association with the Asia Festival.

There are also close education connections between Sarawak and New Zealand. Over the years, many Sarawak students from Sarawak have come to New Zealand for their education. New Honorary Consul Datuk Amin Satem was himself educated in New Zealand.

There are also good prospects for the development of business relations between Sarawak and New Zealand.

"Datuk Amin Satem's appointment as honorary consul in Sarawak will give New Zealand business people an important contact point in this fast-growing part of Malaysia," Mr McKinnon said.
