New Zealand's relations with the United States are the best they've been in more than a decade, Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said today.

Mr McKinnon has been in Washington for a round of discussions with senior members of the Clinton Administration, including recently appointed Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.

"Madeleine Albright is an old friend of New Zealand's. She worked closely with New Zealand during her recent term as US Ambassador to the United Nations, especially during our time on the Security Council. I'm pleased that our experience of working with Mrs Albright on issues such as reform of the United Nations and peacekeeping has put us on such a positive footing with her in her new position."

"She has already demonstrated her commitment to our part of the world by making the Asia Pacific region one of her first ports of call as Secretary of State. Mrs Albright had only been back in Washington a few hours after returning from Japan, Korea and China. She clearly understands the increasing importance of this region, in both security and economic terms."

"I have invited Mrs Albright to visit New Zealand and she is keen to take up the offer when time allows."

Meetings were also held with Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, Economics Under Secretary Stuart Eizenstat, US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, James Steinberg of the National Security Council and Defence Under Secretary Jan Lodal.

"These meetings too underscored the importance of New Zealand's ongoing relationship with the US."

On Capitol Hill, Mr McKinnon met Speaker of the House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich, and Chairman of the Senate Foreign relations Committee Jesse Helms. On the Democratic side he met Senator Carl Levin, and Representative Lee Hamilton.

"Mr Gingrich continues to express his admiration of New Zealand's economic reforms. Reform issues which New Zealand addressed a decade ago are still being debated in the US and Mr Gingrich is clearly keen to increase the pace of US reform. He is also interested in coming to New Zealand at some stage to find out first hand about reform and I have assured him he would be most welcome."

"I leave Washington tomorrow confident that New Zealand is progressing all aspects of relations with the US."
