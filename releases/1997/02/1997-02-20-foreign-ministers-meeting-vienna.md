New Zealand and Austria have broken new ground this week with the meeting between their Foreign Ministers in Vienna.

Mr McKinnon said that the meeting was an historic one. It was held in the Metternich Hall of the Chancellor's Office. "It underpinned the importance of New Zealand's establishing a good working relationship with one of the newest members of the EU, a country which will hold the Presidency of the Union in the second half of 1998," he said.

Austrian Foreign Minister, Dr Wolfgang Schüssel and Deputy Foreign Minister, Dr Benita Ferrero-Waldner, underlined the importance of Austrian historical links with New Zealand, from the time of the explorer Franz Josef up to the present. Two-way trade is more than $100 million.

Mr McKinnon thanked the Austrian Ministers for their support of New Zealand's actions during the French testing series at Mururoa and outlined many Asia Pacific developments currently underway, including the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation initiative and the ASEAN Regional Forum.

"Further discussions included proportional representations, expansion of the EU and the benefits of the World Trade Organisation's activities," Mr McKinnon said.

"The Austrian Economics Minister Farnleitner is due to visit New Zealand in August. This will be an excellent opportunity for New Zealand exporters to see benefits and greater trading opportunities with Austria," concluded Don McKinnon.
