Education Minister Wyatt Creech today announced plans to open a new primary school at Hobbs Bay, on the Whangaparaoa Peninsula, in 1998.

\`\`The Whangaparaoa Peninsula is experiencing significant population growth. The rolls of the three primary schools on the peninsula have grown by an average of 8% per year since 1993.

\`\`The school to be built in Alec Craig Way is the second new school on the Peninsula in two years. Hibiscus Coast Intermediate in Stanmore Bay was one of five new state schools to open in Auckland this year.''

Initially the school will be built with five classrooms for approximately 130 pupils.

Mr Creech said another new primary school was needed to relieve roll pressures at existing schools, particularly Whangaparaoa School.

\`\`While the Hibiscus Coast Intermediate School has relieved some of the immediate pressure, the new school at Hobbs Bay will also cater for children from residential developments further out on the peninsula.''

Mr Creech said the Education Ministry will shortly call for community nominations for the establishment board, which will appoint staff and work with the Ministry to ensure the school's successful establishment.
