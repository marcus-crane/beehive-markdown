Inappropriate and completely unjustified is the way I react to the PPTA's proposed actions on bulk funding, Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

It has far more to do with politics than the interests of education.

There has been absolutely no change in policy on bulk funding. The status quo remains. It is completely optional. Schools can choose to be bulk funded if they wish. There is no compulsion to join and the Coalition Agreement makes it clear that bulk funding will remain optional.

It seems ridiculous to want to take this option away from schools that want it and find it delivers a better education to the young people they are responsible for. We leave that judgement for school communities themselves to make; if local flexibility helps them improve education for their school community, then the students are entitled to that benefit.

In spite of the PPTA statements to the contrary, there has been absolutely no change in policy on this matter as a result of the formation of the National-NZ First Coalition Government. It remains as agreed by all education sector groups except the PPTA at the time of the Ministerial Reference Group.

I have become concerned at the incorrect information in newsletters being distributed by the PPTA executive. These incorrect comments are obviously designed to wind their membership up. Secondary teachers would be well advised to find out the correct story before they get caught up in actions that make them look foolish. Unless they do, they will be going off half-cocked.

The Coalition agreement makes it clear we intend to significantly increase funding in education.

Claims that we have 'agendas" to use this policy for all sorts of unacceptable reasons, for example to cut funding, to schools are just arrant nonsense.

I am sure the thinking public will soon tire of this sort of thing.

I want to remind the teachers' union that it is wrong to use the young people of New Zealand as pawns in their political game. Teachers should remember that they will soon earn the ire of parents if they use students as the meat in the sandwich for narrow demands and self interests.

We should also remember that as a matter of principle, it is for Parliament and the Government to make education policy; not the teachers' union. We consult widely, which is appropriate, but in the end we are responsible and accountable to the electorate for the policy adopted.
