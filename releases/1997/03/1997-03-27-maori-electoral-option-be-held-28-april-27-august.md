The Minister of Justice, Hon D.A.M. Graham, says the next Maori electoral option will be conducted from 28 April to 27 August, 1997.

The option gives Maori electors the opportunity to register on either the general or Maori rolls and, for those already registered, the option to change from one roll to the other.

The option has a significant impact on Maori representation because it determines the number of Maori electorate seats in the next Parliament and consequentially the number of general seats.

Mr Graham says the Maori option is the first step in the process which leads to the setting of new electoral district boundaries.

'April to August this year has been chosen because the dates strike a balance between allowing sufficient time to plan the Maori option campaign while not delaying the work of the Representation Commission on setting the new electoral district boundaries.

'A committee of officials has been set up and has already consulted with the NZ Maori Council, the Maori Congress and the Maori Women's Welfare League.

'This consultation will continue at key stages in the planning process. The content and progress of the campaign will also be communicated to other Maori groups.'

Mr Graham says the main objective of the Maori option campaign is to ensure that Maori are able to exercise their option choice effectively by being aware of the timing, process, purpose and implications of the option.

'In order to reach all Maori who are eligible to exercise the option an integrated three-tier publicity strategy is proposed involving a kanohi ki te kanohi (face to face) campaign, an information campaign involving both Maori and general media and a mailout of the Maori option form.

'Experience has shown that the face to face approach is particularly successful in reaching Maori people.

'Both the Waitangi Tribunal and the High Court recommended this approach. However, they also considered that mass media publicity including television was also required.

'Accordingly, both components are included in the proposed campaign.'

Cabinet has approved the spending of $2 million on the Maori option which will be conducted by the Electoral Enrolment Centre of NZ Post.

This sum will enable a comprehensive face to face campaign to be conducted throughout New Zealand, including many rural areas, as well as a mass media campaign.

'The publicity strategy which has been put in place is carefully targeted to achieve the widest coverage practicable,' Mr Graham said.

'I am confident that the strategy announced today and the funding allocated to the campaign will ensure that as many Maori people as possible are aware of their right to enrol or to change from one roll to the other.'
