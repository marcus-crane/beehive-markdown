Health Minister Bill English said today the seriousness of Capital Coast Health's financial situation had been acknowledged late last year when he appointed Jack Jenkins as executive chairman.

"In November I made it clear to Capital Coast that its financial position was unacceptable. I also made it clear that its recovery plan would not be at the cost of reduced standards of safety or quality," he said.

"Capital Coast is now implementing the first phase of its recovery plan.

"A critical part of the direction being taken is to bring clinicians into key positions of responsibility. A surgeon has been recruited as chief executive to further strengthen that clinical expertise at the senior management level. It is up to Capital Coast Health to decide what resources it needs to provide the services required by the Regional Health Authority.

"The Government has had discussions with the CHE's bankers, as would be normal in circumstances such as this. However, the Government has not given the bankers a guarantee, nor linked any future support to the loss of jobs at Capital Coast Health," said Mr English.
