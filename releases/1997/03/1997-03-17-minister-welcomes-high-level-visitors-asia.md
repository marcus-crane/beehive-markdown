"Today I extend the very warmest of Kiwi welcomes to 7 visitors who join us to celebrate the Festival of Asia this week" Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said today. The visitors, all Members of the Honorary Advisory Board of the Asia 2000 Foundation, include some of the most senior personalities in business and politics from Asia. They are:

- Brig-Gen Lee Hsien Loong, Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore
- Dr Sulaiman Daud, Minister of Agriculture of Malaysia
- Dr Supachai Panitchpakdi, an MP and former Deputy PM of Thailand
- Mr Yoshiharu Fukuhara, President of Shiseido Co Ltd (Japan)
- Dr Kim Kak-Choong, Chairman of Kyungbang Ltd, Korea
- Mr Tran Ba Tuoc, of Saigon University, Vietnam
- Mr Firdaus Siddik, Chairman of FASINDO/FINAS Group, Indonesia.

"On Tuesday I welcome the visitors to Parliament, where they will attend a special Asia 2000 Board Meeting. They will also join in the exciting activities this week which will celebrate New Zealand's relationship with Asia", Mr McKinnon said.

"The presence of such a line-up is testimony to the growing strength of New Zealand's links with Asia" Mr McKinnon commented.

"And the Festival of Asia shows how extensive and exciting those links are. It is not a government event but one in which the whole community is engaged. I am delighted for instance that the Festival involves over 300 schools around the country. It is supported by the contributions of over 100 artists and performers, and the generosity of 100 sponsors".

"It shows that our relations with Asia are not just about trade but that we are engaged at all levels with this most diverse and exciting region" the Minister concluded.
