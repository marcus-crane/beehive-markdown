The Prime Minister, Rt Hon Jim Bolger, today announced that three teams have been selected to submit designs for a New Zealand memorial in Australia. The memorial is to be erected on ANZAC Parade, Canberra. The three were selected from a field of 15 who had been invited to forward initial design concepts for the memorial. The finalists are:

Nicholas Stevens  
Neil Dawson and Perry Royal  
Kingsley Baird and Studio of Pacific Architecture.  
The Prime Minister congratulated the successful teams and said the quality of the selected designs was impressive. "The memorial, when completed, will reflect a clear New Zealand identity while acknowledging the special nature of the ANZAC relationship" Mr Bolger said.

The designs were assessed by the following panel:

Convenor  
Sir Somerford Teagle A former Chief of Defence Force, with considerable knowledge of Australia/New Zealand relations.

Members  
Dame Georgina Kirby A former President of the Maori Women's Welfare League, with long-time involvement in Regional Arts Councils and other arts organisations.

Sir Miles Warren One of the most well known of New Zealand architects, highly respected by both the general public and within his profession.

Rewi Thompson An award winning architect who has worked on many prominent projects, including hospitals, civic buildings, marae complexes etc.

Michael Ratcliffe Chief Executive of the Australian National Capital Authority, and an architect.  
The efforts of the assessors were commended by the Prime Minister. "I am aware that the panel had a difficult task in making its selections. We are now well on the way to ensuring that a memorial we, and future generations, can be proud of will be erected."

The next stage of the project requires the three selected design teams to develop their designs further. One proposal will then be chosen, and a contract for the design and construction of the memorial may be awarded.

It is envisaged that the memorial will be completed in 1998, with an official unveiling in Canberra to take place on either ANZAC Day (April 25) or Remembrance Day (November 11).
