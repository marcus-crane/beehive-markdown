The Minister of Conservation Nick Smith announced today at a speech to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature at Lincoln University, that an application will be lodged with the UNESCO for World Heritage status of New Zealands sub-Antarctic islands. The islands lie a third of the way between Invercargill and the Antarctica and consist of the Auckland Islands, Campbell Islands, the Antipodes Islands, the Bounties and the Snares.

"The unique habitat of these wild and unspoilt islands deserves the level of protection that World Heritage status offers. Few people know that there are more sea birds in these remote islands than there are in the whole of Europe. The islands are also the breeding place of the world's rarest seal, the Hooker sea lion. They are also home to a number of endangered flightless birds that have developed free of predation."

A lot of work is required by the Department of Conservation in providing a detailed submission for the New Zealand Governments application to UNESCO and to meet the deadline for this year of 1 July 1997.

"I have instructed officials to proceed with this work and to try and meet the tight timetable."

Australia has applied for World Heritage status for the neighbouring Macquarie Islands and a decision is expected in the next few months. New Zealand has strongly supported their application and is keenly interested in working closely with the Australian Government in protecting these sub-Antarctic Islands.

"The millions of birds who live on these islands can not differentiate between Kiwi and Aussie accents and it makes sense for us to work together in acquiring protection for them."

"The process for obtaining World Heritage status is long and involved. If we are successful in lodging the application to meet this year's deadline it will take around eighteen months before a decision is made. "

World Heritage status would acknowledge the sites as being of international conservation importance. It would also mean we have an obligation to be more rigorous in the maintenance of conservation values in these areas, including careful management of impacts of visitors to the islands.

New Zealand has two world heritage sites, one in South Westland covering a number of our national parks and the other is the Tongariro National Park.
