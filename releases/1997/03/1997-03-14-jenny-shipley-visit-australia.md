The Hon Jenny Shipley is to make a short visit to Australia next week, for discussions with Australian cabinet ministers and to attend the Australian Transport Council meeting.

"I am looking forward to the opportunity to exchange views with my Australian counterparts on issues covering a number of my portfolio responsibilities."

In Canberra, Jenny Shipley will meet with a number of Federal Ministers, including the Hon Peter Reith, Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service. She will be discussing State Sector Reforms with Mr Reith.

Mrs Shipley will also meet the Hon John Sharp, Minister for Transport, for talks about matters of mutual interest, including the issue of aviation beyond rights.

Mrs Shipley, in her capacity as Minister responsible for Radio New Zealand, will also meet with the Australian Minister for Communications, Senator the Hon Richard Alston, to discuss public broadcasting.
