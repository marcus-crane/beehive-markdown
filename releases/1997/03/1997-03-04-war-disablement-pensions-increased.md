Rates of war pensions will be increased by 2.55 percent from 1 April, Minister in Charge of War Pensions, Paul East, announced today.

The increase matches the movement in the Consumers Price Index for the year to the end of December 1996.

For example, the base rate for a 100 percent war disablement pension will increase by $3.59 to $144.41 per week.

Other war pensions and allowances will also increase by 2.55 percent. These include the surviving spouse pension, the war orphans pension, clothing allowances, attendants allowances and funeral grants.
