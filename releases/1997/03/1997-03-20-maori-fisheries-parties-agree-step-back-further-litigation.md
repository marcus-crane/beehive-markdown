Maori fisheries parties agree to step back from further litigation

Maori litigants to the recent Privy Council fisheries case have given a broad indication to the Minister of Maori Affairs, the Hon Tau Henare, that they agree to step back from further court action in order to allow Te Ohu Kaimoana (the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission) to get on with the job of developing a optimum model to allocate the presettlement assets.

At a hui of the parties to the Privy Council case in the old Maori Affairs select committee room in Parliament building today, iwi, urban and other Maori fisheries representatives agreed to give TOKM time to develop an optimum model free of the cloud of litigation.

Although there was a general consensus to step back from the courts, some have reserved their position.

But Mr Henare feels confident the parties have come to a common understanding that their interests will be best served at this stage by staying out of the courts.

This is a momentous step towards getting on with the job to which TOKM has a statutory obligation to fulfil, and I anticipate that will be done before the commissions annual general meeting in July, he said.

This would need to involve urban Maori interests participating in the process with TOKM to develop an allocation model.

Mr Henare said parties not represented at todays hui will be invited to indicate their support for the resolutions to him or TOKM.

The Minister said the Government continued to remain neutral on the issue, and hoped it had assisted the parties to come to agreement by facilitating the two hui which have been held to date.

The resolutions agreed to were:

That all litigating and non-litigating parties desist from further court action in respect to the allocation of the presettlement asset for a period up to 30 July 1997.

That Te Ohu Kaimoana continue to develop a proposal for the optimum method for allocation of the presettlement assets working with Paepae Taumata and including a process of consultation with all interested parties.
