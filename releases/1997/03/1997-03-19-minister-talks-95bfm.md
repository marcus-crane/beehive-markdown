Hon Deborah Morris will be joining the Mikey Havoc Breakfast Show on 95BFM, every Tuesday morning at 8.15am.

95BFM, Auckland's local student and youth radio station, has a high youth focus, and Deborah Morris, as Minister of Youth Affairs, will be using her weekly slot to let young people know about the real happenings in Parliament and politics.

In her Maiden Speech, the Minister of Youth Affairs stated that as a List MP, and under her Ministerial portfolio, she saw her direct constituents being the youth of New Zealand.

"Through Mikey and the Morning Crew of 95BFM, I hope that we can inform young Aucklanders of some of the political issues of the day, and that I will have a better understanding of young peoples issues, in order to represent them to the fullest in Parliament." said Ms Morris.

Ms Morris continues to encourage young people to write to her and detail their thoughts on political issues.

The Tuesday morning slot started on 18th March 1997.
