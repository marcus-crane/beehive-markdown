"The release today of a report into a spate of speedway accidents is very welcome," the Minister of Labour, Hon Max Bradford, said.

The report was requested by Mr Bradford from the Occupational Safety and Health service of the Department of Labour, following three recent speedway accidents.

"In spite of the fact these accidents are strictly outside the coverage of the Health and Safety in Employment Act, I asked for OSH to report to me if any action is needed."

OSH has recommended that Speedway New Zealand should undertake a review of its rules and systems, including comparative overseas practice. The report also recommends that existing rules be amended to allow strengthening of wheels in all classes of speedway vehicle.

"I have asked OSH, and other government agencies to offer their assistance to Speedway New Zealand in reviewing its current regulations. The Land Transport Safety Authority is co-operating with OSH in offering assistance," said Mr Bradford.

"I am pleased that OSH and the LTSA are able to provide their technical expertise to help Speedway New Zealand. This is a matter of public safety. The outcome of the review should mean enjoyment of a day or night at the speedway is not marred by similar tragic incidents again," Mr Bradford concluded.
