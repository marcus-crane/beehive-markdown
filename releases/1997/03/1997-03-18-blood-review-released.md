Health Minister Bill English today (19 February) released a review of the country's blood sector which recommends setting up a national blood service.

Mr English said he supported the concept of a single coordinated service.

"The report notes New Zealand has an internationally respected safety record but it also clearly states there is room for improvement. It found the service was improved by structural reforms that took place in 1993. It also says the main problems stem from a lack of clear management/leadership responsibility for blood.

"I am in no doubt the service can be improved and the key to that seems to be better coordination," Mr English said.

"What we now need is the views of the people who work in the sector. They have been sent a copy of this report and I have asked that a consultation document be prepared for them to comment.

"Once that consultation is complete I expect a proposal will be prepared for the Government to make a decision on the future shape of the service," he said.

"In the meantime, it is important the public understands the report found the sector was generally effective. What we are talking about here is building on improvements to date. I expect in future years that there will be more recommendations, more consultation and more improvements as technological changes and other advances allow better ways to collect, handle and distribute blood and blood products," Mr English said.
