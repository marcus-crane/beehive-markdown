Employment Minister Peter McCardle has today approved Taskforce Green funding for workers to assist in the clean-up and restoration of farms affected by the Opuha Dam collapse last week.

The Taskforce Green assistance will be available for up to six weeks to the thirty farms seriously damaged by the collapse of the dam. Work carried out is expected to include clearing fence-lines of debris and some soil and fence restoration; amongst other urgent tasks.

"The emphasis is on the earliest possible commencement of relief workers and I have instructed the Employment Service to work with Federated Farmers to ensure the immediate completion of employment details and placement of the workers," said Mr McCardle.

It is anticipated that at least twelve workers will be required in the first instance and an ongoing relationship will be maintained with Federated Farmers to ensure a rapid response to any requests for additional workers." the Minister concluded.
