Hon Deborah Morris was today surprised to hear Hon Phil Goff commenting on the appointment of a staff member to the Ministry of Youth Affairs.

As Mr Goff should well know, Ministry appointments are made by the Chief Executive, and under the State Services Act, the Minister is not involved in the process of employing staff.

The Minister was not aware of the staff members background, nor was she consulted on his appointment. Indeed, the staff member in question was appointed prior to the formation of the New Zealand First - National Coalition Government.

"Mr Goff also suggested today that I was too young to carry the responsibility of the Youth Affairs portfolio. Well, if that's what Mr Goff thinks, then he shows a total disregard and lack of respect for the important role that young people should play in decision making".

"Mr Goff looks hell bent on further undermining the value of New Zealand's young people in our society, by questioning my appointment as Minister" said Ms Morris.

"I would suggest that if Mr Goff thinks I have neither the training or experience for this role, then perhaps he should look at what he is saying, and question his knowledge and experience, as he should clearly be aware that the State Service Act, brought in by a Labour Government, clearly prohibits my involvement in the employment of Ministry staff."

Any enquires regarding the appointment should be directed to the Ministry of Youth Affairs.
