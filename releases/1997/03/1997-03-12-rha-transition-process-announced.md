The transition process for moving from four regional health authorities to one health funding body, outlined in the Coalition Agreement, was announced today by Minister of Health Bill English and Associate Minister of Health Neil Kirton.

"What we seek to achieve is a consistent approach to health funding across the country while still retaining a regional presence," the Ministers said.

"In order to move towards this we have set up a Transitional Health Authority which will take over the functions of the four RHA boards. The new funding agency will be set up in mid-1998 as set out in the Coalition Agreement.

"It is important to give certainty to the different health providers who currently contract with the RHAs. They must know where they stand and have clear direction for the future. RHA staff also need some certainty for the future. We must retain skilled staff in the sector, they said.

"In moving towards one funding agency, we want to make sure we build on what works. We have learnt a lot over the last few years and we want to make improvements to the system without losing the gains made.

The Transitional Health Authority will be chaired by Graham Scott, the current chair of the Central Regional Health Authority, with representation from each RHA, the Ministers said.

Last week, the Ministers announced the formation of a Steering Group, which will review the most appropriate structure for the new funding agency. The review will be finished by the end of May.

Both the Transitional Health Authority and the Steering Group will be directly responsible to Health Ministers, they said.

"The Coalition Agreement makes it quite clear where we are heading with the funding of health services and these transition arrangements give certainty to the process of getting there. There are some policy details to be worked through and the Steering Group will do this, the Ministers said.
