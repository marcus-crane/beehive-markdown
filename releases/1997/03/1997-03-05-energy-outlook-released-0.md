Energy supply and demand is projected to change significantly over the next 25 years, according to Energy Minister Max Bradford who today released the latest energy projections by the Ministry of Commerce.

The New Zealand Energy Outlook publication presents supply and demand projections and their implications for New Zealand's energy sector to the year 2020, modelling the complex interactions of the energy market. It adopts a baseline scenario which assumes 3 percent per annum (pa) GDP growth with the continuation of current policy settings.

"Major changes in New Zealand's energy supply and demand balance are projected as demand growth is satisfied, the relative growth rates for fuels change, the Maui gas field depletes and the diversity of new electricity generation projects increases," Mr Bradford said.

Mr Bradford said he was committed to ensuring all consumers enjoyed the benefits of competition in the New Zealand energy market..

"The baseline scenario projects a decline in residential as well as industrial and commercial energy prices over the next 13 years."

Mr Bradford said Energy Outlook was an important contribution to informing the energy market, helping analysts to make projections and companies to plan investments.

"It will assist in providing energy analysts with a better understanding of how New Zealand's energy market operates and how it might change over time.

"The baseline scenario projects consumer energy will grow by 1.8 percent pa to 2000, but by an average of only 1.5 percent pa between 1995 and 2020 as the New Zealand economy becomes less energy intensive.

"This represents a significant decline in the ratio of energy growth to GDP growth, from around 1.2-to-1 in the past 25 years to around 0.5-to-1 in the next 25 years.

"In the baseline scenario, around 2600MW of new electricity generating capacity is projected to become economic by 2020, as demand for electricity exceeds the economic capacity of the current system. Around 400MW each of gas combined cycle, geothermal and coal is projected to become economic, along with 600MW of hydro, 450MW of cogeneration, 200MW of wind and 150MW of distillate plant."

Low and high GDP growth scenarios are also examined as are the effects of varying assumptions about forestry processing, oil prices, gas discoveries and prices.
