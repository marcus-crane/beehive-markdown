The triennial Youth Parliament will be taking place on 26th and 27th May 1997.

Each MP is required to select a young person, aged 16 or over who will vote for the first time at the next election, to represent them in the House of Parliament on these days.

This is a great experience for young people to see how Parliament really works, spend time with an MP and understand how they can contribute to the decision making process in the future. It also gives us a unique opportunity to gauge young peoples opinions on a variety of issues currently under the spotlight., said Ms Morris.

Ms Morris is seeking a young person from the Wellington area to represent her.

An fun selection day, including a youth forum, debate, challenges and competition will be held on Saturday 19th April.

Applications for this are limited, and should be sent to Deborah Morris, PO Box 9349, Wellington, by 4th April at the latest. Applicants should enclose full details and a short summary of why they want to be an MP.
