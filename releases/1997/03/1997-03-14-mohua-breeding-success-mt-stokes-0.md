The future for mohua (yellowhead) is looking a lot brighter following a record breeding season on Mt Stokes, in the Marlborough Sounds, the Minister of Conservation, Hon Dr Nick Smith, said today.

"From a population of about 30 birds, Department of Conservation staff have confirmed that at least 13 chicks fledged this summer," Dr Smith said. "That's an excellent result."

"For years these birds had clung to survival on Mt Stokes, fighting a losing battle against the impacts of introduced predators. In fact, when rediscovered on Mt Stokes in 1985, the population numbered less than 10 birds."

"Since that time, the birds have been clawing their way back from regional extinction, helped by the intensive management of the area by department staff. Increased Green Package funding last year allowed more intensive stoat trapping and possum control work to take place this summer, and with dramatic results."

"A population increase of almost 50% in one season is a fantastic achievement and bodes well for the future of the mohua. It is also a testament to the effectiveness and value of pest control programmes such as these."

Dr Smith said the Mt Stokes chicks remained vulnerable to predation for another couple of months but, given the low stoat and possum numbers left in the area, staff were hopeful the birds would survive into adulthood.

"Mohua have a high reproductive rate, with one of this seasons nests producing four chicks alone, and so the Mt Stokes population has the potential to rapidly increase if we keep predator levels down to current levels."

The mohua was once one of the South Islands most abundant and conspicuous birds, but now the Mt Stokes population is the only known population surviving north of Canterbury. Elsewhere, the birds only survive in parts of Fiordland and Southland.
