The Governor General yesterday signed a water conservation order for the Kawarau river and its tributaries.

The water conservation order recognises and seeks to preserve the values of the water in the Dart, Rees, Greenstone and Caples Rivers, Lochnager and Nevis wetland and to protect some of the water characteristics of the Kawarau, Nevis, Shotover, Lochy, Von Rivers, Lake Wakatipu and Diamond Lake complex.

The Minister of Conservation made the original application in October 1990. The decision to approve the order follows two hearings since 1993. One before a Special Tribunal and the other before the Environment Court (formerly the Planning Tribunal).

The water conservation order will take force next month, with one of the main effects being the protection of the Kawarau and Shotover rivers from damming. The order may be reviewed after two years.

Mr Upton said today, the passing of the order is a important achievement. It concludes many years of consideration and recognises the special values of the rivers and lakes in the Queenstown area.
