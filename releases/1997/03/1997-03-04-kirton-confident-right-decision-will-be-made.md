Associate Health Minister Neil Kirton this afternoon said that he was confident the right decision would be made with regard to the provision of cardio-thoracic services for Canterbury residents.

I am pleased with the outcome of this mornings NZ First Caucus and I believe that further discussions with our coalition partner can resolve any outstanding differences, said Mr Kirton.

Mr Kirton said that he would be awaiting the detailed paperwork relating to the cardio-thoracic contract before progressing the issue further with Health Minister Bill English.
