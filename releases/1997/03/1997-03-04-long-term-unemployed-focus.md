Minister of Employment Peter McCardle said today he is pleasantly surprised at how well employment has held up given slower economic growth in the latter half of last year.

Household Labour Force Survey results released today show seasonally adjusted unemployment at 5.9%, down .4% on the September 1996 quarter.

"New Zealand can take some confidence that its unemployment level is clearly lower than the current average of 7.5% for OECD nations, and that economic growth is forecast to improve during 1997," said Mr McCardle.

"The mix of today's figures and other statistics on long-term unemployment however confirms that duration remains the major challenge for employment policy."

"Despite positive job growth in the last four to five years, the HLFS report reinforces other statistics which overall show that at least 40% of job seekers are long-term unemployed", the Minister said.

"While it is widely accepted that economic growth largely determines the numbers of unemployed, I am of the view that my area of responsibility, employment policy, can affect the duration of unemployment. This will be the prime focus of my portfolio."

"Over the term of this Government, I am confident we can significantly improve the statistics for long-term unemployment that have become entrenched in NZ since the late 1980s." concluded Mr McCardle.
