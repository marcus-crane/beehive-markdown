"Drive to Survive", is the message the Minister of Transport, the Hon Jenny Shipley, is giving to New Zealand motorists.

Speaking at the Automobile Association Conference at the Wairakei Resort Hotel near Taupo, Mrs Shipley described the road toll as an epidemic.

"If I was still Minister of Health, and a disease had killed 132 people in the first three months of this year, the public would be demanding action.

"One hundred and thirty-two New Zealanders have died on the roads, but still many drivers seem to believe it they are immune.

"The regional breakdown shows that all parts of the country are affected. I am particularly concerned by the high number of deaths in the Waikato and Manawatu-Wanganui regions, in comparison to their population.

(Land Transport Safety Authority regional road toll figures are contained in the table below).

"There are four "lifesavers" that can help keep the road toll down. They are sensible speed, safety belts, sober drivers, and alert drivers.

Mrs Shipley outlined the many initiatives the government is taking to improve road safety, including the hidden speed camera trial, and the work that is under way on confiscating vehicles from repeat-offender drunk drivers, and withholding earnings-related ACC compensation from repeat-offender drunk drivers.

Mrs Shipley also foreshadowed the release of a discussion document on driver licensing.

"The Land Transport Safety Authority has put forward a proposal that includes increasing the minimum driving age and making the license test tougher. Details of the proposal are expected to be released next week, and the Coalition Government will be interested in the public reaction to the ideas.

"It's all part of the Coalition Government's commitment to reducing the tragic waste of life that occurs on our roads every day."
