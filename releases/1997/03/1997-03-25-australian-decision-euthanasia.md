Health Minister Bill English said today the Australian Governments decision to overturn the Northern Territory euthanasia law showed euthanasia was not inevitable.

"The Australian Government decision follows the lead of New Zealand in turning down the opportunity to put in place legislation allowing voluntary euthanasia," Mr English said.

"One argument in favour of euthanasia is that it is inevitable so we might as well allow it. The evidence on both sides of the Tasman is that legislators do not see it that way," he said.

"The Australian decision reflects our experience in New Zealand which is that legislators are reluctant to write the rules of life and death. This reluctance remains whatever the perceived public support for voluntary euthanasia," Mr English said.
