"I was very concerned to learn today that treason charges have been laid against Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka and eleven Nigerian pro-democracy figures," Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said today. The twelve are alleged to be responsible for the bombing of buses in Nigeria.

"This will do nothing to reassure the international community about the intentions of General Abacha's regime. Nor does it provide an incentive to lift the suspension of Nigeria from the Commonwealth".

"The charges follow the decision last month to cancel the visit of the UN Human Rights observers, because of restrictions imposed by Nigeria," he said.

Commonwealth Ministers have been prepared to look for results and to observe any progress Nigeria makes towards democracy, Mr McKinnon said. "I can understand concern in Nigeria resulting from recent bombings. But blaming pro-democracy groups - and a novelist who does not even live in Nigeria - for this, and the continued harassment of anybody who challenges the Abacha regime, are cause for real concern about Nigeria's real intentions," the Minister continued.

"The regime is thumbing its nose at international opinion, just as it did when Ken Saro-Wiwa was hanged".

"But the clock is ticking. We want General Abacha to keep his word and proceed on the path towards democracy. Announcement of these charges suggests he is insecure and curtailing the basic human rights of those he fears could beat him in a free and fair election," Mr McKinnon said.

"In light of the UN report last year on the so-called "trial" of Mr Saro-Wiwa, the credibility of the judicial process is crucial. I want to see a speedy, fair and open trial for those charged. International observers - including UN Human Rights observers - should be permitted access immediately to all detailed prisoners," the Minister concluded.

Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth at the Auckland CHOGM in 1995. The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG), will report to the Edinburgh CHOGM later this year on whether Nigeria should be re-admitted to the Commonwealth. Mr McKinnon is the deputy Chair of CMAG.
