Tourism and Sports Minister Murray McCully has welcomed the withdrawal today of the last of three outstanding appeals for the America's Cup Viaduct Basin village in Auckland as "great news".

"The Auckland Regional services Trust deserves the highest praise for choosing to negotiate settlements with each of the three objectors rather than attempting to litigate the issues in the Environment Court," Mr McCully said.

The Trust is optimistic that construction of the $56M village complex can start by 1 April, and that the syndicate bases should all be complete by November 1988.
