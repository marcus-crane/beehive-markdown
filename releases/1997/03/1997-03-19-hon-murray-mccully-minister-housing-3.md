Housing Minister Murray McCully says the Coalition Government will extend the interim rent freeze for current Housing New Zealand tenants to 1 July 1997, on which date Accommodation Supplement increases are expected to be implemented.

"The timing of the lifting of the interim freeze is aimed at ensuring that current Housing New Zealand tenants do not incur a rent increase until the increased housing assistance, referred to in the Coalition Agreement, is available," Mr McCully said.

"I am in the process of consulting with Housing New Zealand, as required by the legislation, prior to directing the company under section 14 of the Housing Restructuring Act," he said.
