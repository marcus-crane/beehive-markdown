"New Zealand's defence capability will be greatly enhanced by the Government's decision to purchase four new helicopters for the Royal New Zealand Navy," Minister of Defence, Paul East, said today.

Mr East announced that the American Kaman SH-2G Seasprite helicopter had been selected to replace the Navy's aging fleet of Wasp helicopters. The Seasprite was chosen ahead of the British built Westland Super Lynx.

The two helicopter types - shortlisted from four original tenders - were evaluated for operational performance, airworthiness, industrial benefits, risk management and cost.

"The results demonstrated that the Seasprite was clearly the best helicopter to meet our needs," said Mr East. "The Ministry of Defence will now begin contract negotiations with Kaman to supply four helicopters, with the first of them expected to enter service in the year 2000. The maximum cost of the project is expected to be about NZ $274 million exclusive of GST.

"These helicopters will contribute to the modernisation of New Zealand's defence forces. Without a steady replacement of obsolete equipment, New Zealand will not be able to meet its obligations to peacekeeping, resource protection and making an effective contribution to the security and stability of the Asia-Pacific region," said Mr East.

Mr East said the price included not only the helicopters but also training, spares, and missiles. "The total cost of the project will be met from within the existing Defence budget and no extra taxpayer funding is involved," said Mr East.

"The new helicopter will have both surveillance and combat roles, with the capability to deploy missiles, torpedoes and depth charges. It will also be able to transport stores and personnel from ship to shore, carry out search and rescue missions, medical evacuations and assist with boarding operations.

"An effective maritime helicopter is an essential addition to the fighting capability of a modern frigate because it enhances its ability to defend itself and other shipping against both surface and undersea adversaries. A naval force without modern helicopters is vulnerable and becomes a liability to our regional allies. A helicopter, such as the Seasprite, increases the surveillance capability of a frigate at least six-fold.

The Kaman Seasprite is currently in service with reserve squadrons of the US Navy and was recently selected for the Australian Navy's ANZAC Class frigates.

"There are obvious advantages in buying a helicopter that can operate with units of the Australian Navy," said Mr East. "As well, we get access to spares and common maintenance facilities".

The contract includes an industry programme worth nearly NZ$100 million for work to be carried out in New Zealand. It will include the manufacture of helicopter components, engine overhaul, specialist maintenance training and through-life commercial support for the aircraft. The final value of the programme, however, will depend on the outcome of both Australian and New Zealand contract negotiations.

"The four helicopters will be deployed on the new ANZAC ships already purchased," said Mr East. "They can also be used on the two older Leander frigates which the RNZN will keep in service until sometime in the next decade."

An earlier version of the Seasprite helicopter, the SH-2F, will be brought into service to bridge the gap between the Wasp's withdrawal from service and the introduction of the new helicopters.
