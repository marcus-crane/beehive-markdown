The number of people registered as unemployed fell by 2,017 to 164,147 in of January, Employment Minister Peter McCardle said today.

"Registered unemployment has regularly fallen in the month of January, and the 1.2% reduction is generally in line with expectations." he said.

Mr McCardle said however that forecasting and register comparisons would be more complex in the next few months as new work assistance measures for some spouses of unemployment beneficiaries, and other beneficiaries, will see some new groups joining the register.
