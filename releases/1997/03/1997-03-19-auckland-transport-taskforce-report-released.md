Auckland is on the move in addressing its immediate and medium term traffic problems, Transport Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

Its pleasing to see Auckland local authorities fronting up and making some very practical recommendations as to what should be done.

Mrs Shipley and other Coalition Government ministers today met with Auckland Mayors to consider the report of the Auckland Transport Taskforce.

The Taskforce, made up of officials from Auckland local authorities, the Auckland Regional Council and central government departments, has been meeting since September last year, looking at options for dealing with traffic congestion in Auckland.

I appreciate the concerted effort that has gone into this project and the demonstrated willingness of all areas of Auckland to work together. Some of the recommendations deal with immediate problems that require solution.

It is good to hear the Auckland Local Authorities acknowledging their responsibility to try to get the existing system working better.

As a result of this work, proposals are being lodged with Transfund for enhancement of the existing rail, bus and ferry systems, as well as for roading improvements. During the last six months, a lot of progress has been made in developing these proposals.

The second important outcome of the Taskforce Report is a clear acknowledgment of the need for local funding for public transport schemes which do not qualify for national funding. In this context, the Auckland local authorities have come up with some useful suggestions for funding local public transport systems.

The Ministers would be pleased to work with them, to explore these options further. Mrs Shipley says its clear that while keeping Auckland moving is primarily a matter for Auckland local authorities, Government also has an important role to play.

The third major point made by the Auckland local authorities is a request for more funding. Government has a major review of the funding system underway, and important decisions will be made towards the end of the year about the whole area of land transport pricing.

The options will be laid out in May when the final discussion paper will be produced. A three month period of intensive consultation with all interested parties will follow, prior to government decision making. This consideration is not focussed simply on solving Aucklands problems, but rather tries to ask the correct questions as to how we can have a properly funded and maintained roading network for all New Zealanders.

In the meantime the government has already released additional funds for roading projects for 1997-98. Auckland is already benefiting from some of this. Our end of year decisions will include whether still further increases are warranted, and what these should cover.

Road funding for the development of new transport options is however only part of the answer. Auckland people have to think carefully about the use of their vehicles, the time of day they travel, their use of motorways as opposed to local roads, and the possibility of alternative transport options.

All these issues must be considered as the Government works with Auckland on a solution to the citys traffic congestion problems, Mrs Shipley concluded.
