The Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, Hon D.A.M. Graham, has formally accepted Deeds of Mandate to represent Nga Ruahine iwi in negotiations for the settlement of historical claims.

Nga Hapu o Nga Ruahine-Rangi, the Waiokura Marae and Reserves Trustees and the Oeo Marae Trustees collectively form Te Muru me te Raupatu mo nga Hapu o Nga Ruahine Iwi, an umbrella organisation representing all hapu of Nga Ruahine iwi.

The three Deeds of Mandate were received by the Crown in August last year. They have since been evaluated by officials and the Crown believes Te Muru me te Raupatu mo nga Hapu o Nga Ruahine Iwi is the appropriate body to collectively represent Nga Ruahine iwi, Mr Graham says.

'This means there are now four iwi in the Taranaki area who are ready to enter into formal settlement negotiations with the Crown,' he says.

In November the Crown accepted Deeds of Mandate from the Ngati Tama Iwi Development Trust, the Ngati Mutunga Iwi Authority and Te Iwi o Ngati Maru Incorporated.

These three Northern Taranaki iwi have agreed that the Claims Progression Team can negotiate their claims with the crown collectively.

'Mandate issues are particularly hard to work through,' Mr Graham says. 'I am therefore delighted that four Taranaki iwi have done so, and will now enter formal settlement negotiations with the Crown.

'Some other tribal claimants have started dialogue with the Crown and I hope that it won't be too long before other Taranaki iwi are ready to file their Deeds of Mandate.'
