The Minister of Youth Affairs, Deborah Morris, today praised the work of Youth Skill New Zealand, and especially the efforts of all the young people entering the New Zealand finals of the Youth Skill Olympics.

The Youth Skill Olympics is a trade/skill competition aimed at young people with specific skills in various trades, including; building, computers, auto engineering, cookery and electronics. The entrants have to battle with others in their field to prove to be the best in their category in New Zealand. The winners, announced tomorrow (Tuesday) evening, will then go on to Switzerland to compete in the World Youth Skill Olympics.

This is a tremendous event for young people, and for showing the world the expertise of New Zealands youth said Ms Morris.

Ms Morris went on to say, Not only does the event encourage the participants to excel in their chosen skill area, but it also inspires the hundreds of students who visit the national finals. This is a very positive event in promoting skills, and encouraging young people to achieve the highest standards in their chosen skill.

I look forward to being able to congratulate the winners, and sending my encouragement and best wishes for the final competition in Switzerland in July.
