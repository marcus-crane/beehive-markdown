Associate Minister of Education, Hon Nick Smith, said today that one of the biggest challenges for the Education Ministry was the provision of staffing and accommodation to meet roll growth and population movement.

One of the greatest problems we face is providing enough, suitable accommodation as and where it is required. Gone are the days of the square, board floored, desk lined classrooms. Tomorrows rooms will reflect the changes in learning, modern technology and will be designed to coordinate with the local environment. Parents and Boards of Trustees are far more involved in school design and layout, and our pupils are getting better facilities as a result.

Over the next three years there will be 18,000 more children attending primary schools. Add to this population movement and children staying at school longer, and we will need another 1200 classrooms as well as nine new or relocated schools.

"Bulging rolls are a particular challenge in Auckland where they are expected to increase by 11400 children over the same period. Wellington, Canterbury, Nelson and the Bay of Plenty are also seeing considerable roll growth."

Enrolments are a reflection of changing birth trends in the last decade. From 1982 to 1992 the number of live births has increased by 21 percent to 60,500. The raising of the secondary school leaving age will also contribute to school rolls peaking in 2007 when they will be higher than ever before.

"One in six state school students will catch a school bus this year. As part of the responsibilities within my education delegation, I want to look at the issue of seat belts in buses."

Nick Smith takes up formal responsibility for school property, school transport and social welfare/education liaison with the confirmation of delegated responsibilities by the Prime Minister in his role as Associate Minister.
