Health Minister Bill English said today he had had confirmation that Stephen Anderson was receiving treatment from mental health services in Wellington.

However, Mr English said it would be inappropriate for him to comment further on the case until all the details were known.

"We don't yet know all the circumstances surrounding Saturdays tragic shooting and whether, or to what extent, Mr Andersons illness contributed to what happened.

"Until we know all the facts it would be wrong to speculate about this case or to link it to the issue of people with mental illness living in our communities.

"I have been advised that Capital Coast Health is reviewing the full circumstances surrounding Mr Anderson's situation, his condition, and the treatment and ongoing support he and his family was receiving. The CHE is co-operating fully with the police and all the details will be clarified during the criminal trial.

"I am satisfied that at this stage all the appropriate avenues are being followed up to establish the events that led to this tragedy. If there are any questions raised about his treatment by the health services as a result of the inquiries I will be the first to be demanding answers," said Mr English.
