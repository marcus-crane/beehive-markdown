The Minister of Conservation Nick Smith today officially opened the new Routeburn Falls Hut on the Routeburn Track. The new 48 bed hut replaces a smaller hut built in 1968.

"This new facility will do much to enhance the reputation of the Routeburn Track as one of the world's great alpine walks. In the past few years the Falls Hut locality has suffered from overcrowding at peak times in the summer and this hut combined with the booking system on the track will help alleviate that problem."

Up to 10,000 trampers use the Routeburn Track every year and this project demonstrates the government's commitment to providing recreational facilitates for visitors to national parks and other public land. "The $400,000 cost of building this hut is a good investment. But the Crowns investment in places like the Routeburn Track has a return which cannot be measured just in terms of money. It is measured in terms of inspiration and enjoyment, and a sense of national identity. While the Routeburn is an important track for the international tourism industry, we must ensure that ordinary New Zealand families are able to have access to the beauty and grandeur of the tract without the impediments of large crowds or costly fees."

Mr Smith tramped into the hut today along with wife Cyndy and local MP Gavan Herlihy, and will be staying overnight at the new hut.
