The Minister of Maori Affairs and Associate Minister of Sport, the Hon Tau Henare, has condemned the attack on the Americas Cup.

Mr Henare said the Cup was a national treasure the entire public of New Zealand took pride in and to damage the Cup for what one can only assume is a publicity stunt is a cheap shot that will only further set back attempts to soothe relationships between the diverse cultures that make up this country.

I understand from somewhat limited information the attack on the cup was motivated for political reasons.

The Coalition Government gave a serious undertaking to Maori and the general public of New Zealand it would address Maori issues in a meaningful way, and thats what people like me and the other Maori members of this Government have given notice to our colleagues that thats what we intend to do.

However, when attacks of this nature, which is akin to destroying a national treasure like the Treaty \[of Waitangi] take place it makes the task we, as a Government have outlined, more difficult and the general public treat Maori aspirations with contempt, said Mr Henare.

Mr Henare said there were no winners in attacks like this.

Understandably Team New Zealand, who slogged hard to win such a prestigious trophy, and all the others involved in the winning of the Cup can feel gutted, and my sympathies go out to them.
