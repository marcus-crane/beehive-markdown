Minister of Social Welfare, Hon. Roger Sowry has a warning for students in light of a recent High Court decision which ruled against counting the living cost part of a student loan as income when a person applies for Disability Allowance.

"The decision does not mean that students will have widespread access to further benefits," says Mr Sowry.

"But it may enable for what we believe to be a small number of students, access to the Disability Allowance and perhaps some other additional assistance measures."

Mr Sowry says the Department is undertaking further study of the judgement before making any decision on whether to appeal the High Court decision.
