Health Minister Bill English and Associate Minister Neil Kirton said today they were pleased with the progress made by the Steering Group established to oversee changes to the public health sector signalled in the Coalition Agreement.

"We are particularly pleased to see the group using its networks in the health and disability sector to gain expert sector input into the development of the advice to the Government," they said.

"The public will have an opportunity to have input into the process as the group's report is translated into draft legislation for the consideration of Parliament through the select committee process.

"We are confident that the two processes - expert sector input and public input into the select committee process - will result in an improved health and disability sector designed to best meet the health and disability needs of all New Zealanders," said the Ministers.

The Steering Group will be presenting its report to the Ministers by the end of May.
