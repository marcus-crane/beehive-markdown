Customs Minister Neil Kirton today congratulated Customs and Police for New Zealands largest seizure of the class B drug MDMA, also known as Ecstasy.

The seizure on Monday of 5000 tablets is the culmination of extensive work by personnel from both Customs and Police Services.

"Because of the considerable potential for harm from the illegal import of these drugs it is crucial that the efforts of all Government agencies working in this field are co-ordinated to prevent drugs coming across our borders."

"I support the close co-operation between the Police and Customs Services and this operation is an excellent example of what can be achieved when both services work closely together."

"It is disturbing to note the quantity of the drug involved in the importation, and the arrest of this offender should serve as a warning to those involved in drug trafficking activities that this was an area of high priority focus for Customs."

"The message it should give to any would-be drug smugglers is - 'Dont do it, because you will be caught'", Mr Kirton said.
