The Minister of Cultural Affairs, Chris Fletcher, today expressed surprise and concern at the amount of money spent developing a new logo for the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (MONZ).

The new logo for MONZ made public yesterday uses words from the title, "Te Papa", with the addition of "Our Place", and features a thumbprint stylised symbol. MONZ said it cost between $200,000 and $300,000 to develop.

"As Minister I am unable to influence decisions of the Board of MONZ. The amount spent on branding represents a great deal of money in view of the fund raising task that MONZ has ahead of it. I am relying on them to use their money wisely and to be accountable for its expenditure.

"As far as I am concerned, I will probably not use the new name. The statute and purpose of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa requires it to be a national museum for all New Zealanders and that is how I will recognise it.

"If the Museum of New Zealand wishes to start moving away from its national focus, I am sure regional museums will be quick to respond to funding needs and take up any opportunity that this gap may create."
