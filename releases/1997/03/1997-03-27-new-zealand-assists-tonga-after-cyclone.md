New Zealand will supply a package of relief assistance to Tonga in the wake of Cyclone Hina, Associate Foreign Affairs Minister, Simon Upton announced today.

The Tongan Governments comprehensive assessment is that damage exceeds $20 million, Mr Upton said. Water and electricity supplies have been extensively disrupted along with damage to houses and public buildings. We will provide practical and financial help to restore essential  
services.

A team of line mechanics from Wellington-based power firm TransAlta New Zealand will fly up to Tonga next week to help Tongan authorities with restoration of the electric power network. New Zealand will also provide tarpaulins and blankets, help with repair of water tanks and  
combine with Australia to assist with school reconstruction.

The cost of the assistance will be met by New Zealands Overseas Aid programme, together with a contribution from TransAlta.
