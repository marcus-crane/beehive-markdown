Deborah Morris was today appointed to serve on the Education and Science Select Committee.

Ms Morris said she is looking forward to this challenge, and will use her recent experience as a student to benefit the committee.

As someone who is still paying off their student loan, says Ms Morris, I believe I can bring a bit of reality into the Select Committee, and help the deliberations with the best intentions of students in mind.

Youth work is an essential aspect of informal education, and I will be trying, through this forum, to increase the recognition and value of working with young people.

To Trevor Mallards comments on Morris Minor, Ms Morris laughed, saying Well, if he wants to call me a Morris Minor, thats fine, its a compliment. After all, arent Morris Minors cars that have lasted time? A reliable, adaptable, safe, strong and long lasting vehicle.

Perhaps Mr Mallard should get off his high horse, and get a Morris Minor instead. They seem to be working better.

As Ive said before, my youthfulness is going to be an asset in my portfolio of Youth Affairs. In Select Committee too, my youth is no doubt going to be a huge advantage in the work of the Committee.
