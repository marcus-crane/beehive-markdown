Christchurch Opposition members today baulked in Parliament when Health Minister Bill English challenged them to repeat their claims that Christchurch Hospital was unsafe.

"The same members who have been so vigorous in their demands for inquiries into patient safety at Christchurch were suddenly silent when it came to their hospitals suitability for a cardiac service," Mr English said.

"When challenged Jim Anderton refused to answer whether Christchurch Hospital was safe or not.

"These same members have criticised what they have seen as delays in conducting an inquiry because they have claimed lives have been at risk," Mr English said.

"When it comes to cardiac services suddenly they are advocates for that very same hospital.

"The members cannot have it both ways," he said.

"What we need to do is put all this political double vision aside and consider the cardiac services proposal for Christchurch Hospital on clinical grounds.

"Any cardiac services at Christchurch Hospital must be clinically safe. There are legal, financial and political considerations as well but the paramount one is clinical safety," Mr English said.
