The Minister of State Services, the Hon Jenny Shipley, is welcoming the move to delegate responsibility for industrial negotiations in the education sector to the Ministry of Education.

The State Services Commissioner, Don Hunn, announced that move today.

Mrs Shipley says it makes sense for the Ministry of Education to take over responsibility for industrial negotiations from the State Services Commission.

This is in line with the rest of the public and private sector employment reform, where industrial relations issues are handled by particular industry sites, and specific departments or ministries.

This means each organisation is able to, where appropriate, negotiate contracts which best suit their own specific requirements and those of their staff.

The State Services Commission has carried out its responsibilities for industrial relations in the Education Sector in a professional and thorough way, but the time is now right for that responsibility to be handed on.

I note that staff working in this area have been offered positions by the Ministry of Education, and that the necessary resources will also be transferred from the State Services Commission to the Ministry of Education to ensure the sector is not disrupted by this decision.
