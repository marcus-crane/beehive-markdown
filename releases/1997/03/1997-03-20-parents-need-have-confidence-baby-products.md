The Minister of Consumer Affairs, Hon Robyn McDonald today said that parents need to have confidence in the baby products they buy for their babies.

"I agree with Mrs Penny that the tragic death of little Felix Penny must have a positive result - that no other baby suffers such a distressing death now or in the future in a pram," Mrs McDonald said.

"As a mother myself, I take the concerns raised by the Coroner very seriously and I have asked the Ministry of Consumer Affairs to investigate and report to me on the evidence provided to the inquest, that other models have similar construction and may be unsafe.

"Whilst Foldaway Industries Ltd are acting responsibly in recalling all upholsteries of the Rhingo Sport models for modification, I want to ensure that parents buying any pram with this type of construction on the New Zealand market can know that such products are safe for their babies," said Mrs McDonald.

"The Consumer Affairs Ministry has already been looking at other pram models with Plunket. I will also be looking at the issue of mandatory and voluntary standards for prams and strollers.

"I urge parents concerned about the safety of their pram to call the free-phone established by Foldaway Industries Ltd - 0508 222 437," the Minister said.
