On January 27, Cabinet approved additional funding to Aotearoa Television Network subject to a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the service by its funding agency, Te Mangai Paho, no later than 1 month from that day.

Cabinet decided today that an additional $4 million funding for Te Mangai Paho to negotiate a further contract with Aotearoa Television Network would not now proceed. Cabinet has noted the advice of the Ministry of Commerce that it had serious reservations about the financial management and controls in place at ATN, and how these concerns might affect ATNs ability to meet the requirements of an extended contract to provide Maori television programmes.

The Ministers noted that the objectives of the original pilot programme had largely been met and efforts would now concentrate on the longer term arrangements that would be needed to promote the Maori language through television.

They confirmed that the Government fully accepts its responsibility to promote the Maori language through broadcasting.

The Ministers also expressed their appreciation of the efforts of the production staff at Aotearoa Television Network who had achieved impressive results in a very short period of time.
