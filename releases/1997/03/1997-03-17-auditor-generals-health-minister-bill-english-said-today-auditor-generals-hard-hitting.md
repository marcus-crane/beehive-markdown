Health Minister Bill English said  
today the Auditor General's hard hitting report on Crown Health Enterprises  
finances highlights the need for substantial improvements.

Controller  
and Auditor-General David Macdonald said in his first report for 1997 that Crown  
Health Enterprises were in a poor financial condition.

Health Minister  
Bill English said the report reinforces the need for better performance from  
CHEs.

"The Auditor General is right. The figures are not good and we  
need to do something about it. Some CHEs are performing well but there's a long  
way to go," Mr English said.

"CHEs have already improved the amount and  
quality of information about their services so we know what we are buying for  
every health dollar spent.

"The Government is addressing the substantive  
issue of how to reduce deficit funding. There is a need for better cost controls  
and sanctions for breach of audit requirements and lending covenants," he said.

"As long as CHEs can forfeit on loan payments and turn to the Government  
for extra funding for debts, the incentives for CHEs to examine the cause of the  
debt are lost.

"One of the reasons for deficits is that CHEs may not be  
paid enough to cover their costs. Where the underlying cause of a CHE debt is  
the price it receives for services, that needs redressing through the funding  
agency. Where the reason lies in the CHE, the CHE must tackle the problem.

"The report refers to the need for a more non-financial measures of  
success. It is clear CHEs do need a more balanced suite of performance measures  
and for these to be early indicators of how they are doing," Mr English said.
