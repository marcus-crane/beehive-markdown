New Zealands new High Commissioner to London is Dr Richard Grant. He will replace Mr John Collinge at the conclusion of his term in April, Foreign Minister Don McKinnon announced today. Dr Grant is a career diplomat in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. His last overseas assignment was as Ambassador in Bonn. He is currently Director of the Ministrys Australia Division and earlier headed the European Division.

Britain is by far our largest trading partner in the European Union and the Union is New Zealands second largest market internationally. Britain and New Zealand also share very similar views on the need for the liberalisation of international trade.

But our relationship with Britain goes far deeper and wider than trade, said Mr McKinnon. We share a common heritage of culture, language and tradition and Britain remains an important source of tourism, investment and migration. We have an easy relationship and a history of talking to each other and cooperating on international matters of mutual concern. These range from Bosnia, where our soldiers are working alongside their British counterparts, to international environmental issues.

Dr Grant will play a key role in our relationship with Britain. His background in European diplomacy and knowledge of the European Union and its institutions equip him well for the London post, Mr McKinnon said.

Dr Grant will also be accredited as Ambassador to Ireland.
