The Minister of Conservation Nick Smith has turned down an application by National Geographic to use stainless steel barbs to attach cameras to whales to observe giant squid. The Minister has, however, approved the permit applying to film the foraging behaviour of sperm whales and the use of suction caps for attaching cameras to whales subject to strict conditions.

"I am deliberately taking a cautious approach with respect to the welfare of the sperm whales. Mankind has grossly abused whales to the point of near extinction. It was only thirty years ago that 120 sperm whales were slaughtered on the Kaikoura coast. We owe it to the whales now to be conservative about their welfare. "

"There was significant scientific uncertainty about the harm caused by the stainless steel barb, known as a floytag. The floytag is implanted up to five centimetres under the skin of the whales and remains in the whale after the camera is released. I think it will be quite foolish to approve the permit unless we are very sure that it would cause no harm or annoyance to the whales."

The Minister today visited Kaikoura and met with representatives of the National Geographic, The Smithsonian Institute and Whale Watch Kaikoura who applied to attach the cameras to the whales. He also met with objectors to the proposal. 52 submissions were made to the application, most of them were against the use of the barb to attach the cameras to the whales.

The approval for the use of suction caps to attach the crittercam to the whale is subject to detailed conditions. These include restrictions on how the whale can be approached, the number of attempts at attachment, and the monitoring of any adverse reaction from the whale. The presence of a DOC observer during usage of the suction cap is a condition of the permit and is at the applicants expense.

"There will be some in the scientific fraternity who will be disappointed in this negative decision regarding the use of floytags, but I think it is important to recognise that the whales themselves were not to benefit from this particular research."

The sperm whales were being used as involuntary cameramen for National Geographic and I would only be prepared to approve this when I am satisfied there would be no harm to the whales.

"Man's inquisitiveness for pretty pictures needs to be checked against the welfare of the whales. They can't speak for themselves and so it is my job to speak for them."

Mr Smith said he admired the National Geographic teams project and wished them well in their endeavours to research the giant squid. He said he was satisfied that neither the suction caps nor the use of cameras would cause any harm to the whales and hoped these methods would prove successful in getting pictures of the elusive giant squid.
