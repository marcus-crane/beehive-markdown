Health Minister Bill English sent a strong message to Crown Health Enterprises today to work more closely with other health providers to do a better job for patients.

In a speech prepared for the Rural Focus Forum, Mr English said CHEs, especially those in the provinces, must become part of a chain of integrated care for patients.

"CHEs and other public organisations need to stop thinking of themselves as primarily hospitals, although that will always be their role, and start thinking about how they can become part of a chain of integrated health care. That doesn't mean rushing out to take over all other health services. It means thinking about how to work with others to do a better job for the patient," Mr English said.

"The Coalition Agreement health policy would speed up the trend that was already developing for this closer relationship between CHEs, other health professionals and the community.

"That trend was started in rural communities where people had taken up the opportunities available with the health reforms and were now deciding what their communities needed and were getting those services for their people.

Rural people, working together, are better able to make these decisions than bureaucrats in a central agency," he said.

"Nowadays, you don't have to be a man in a white coat to get public money. Anyone, any community, in theory, can put together a proposal for health services, and get the money to provide them.

"Community Trusts are the silent, but effective vehicle many rural communities are using to contract for and coordinate rural health services.

"The Hokianga Enterprise Trust is an example of a community trust working. It handles $4.6 million a year from the Northern Regional Health Authority and is responsive to the cultural sensitivity issues, ignored by old-time health providers, and is effectively confronting the unique socio-economic profile of its region.

"In Tuatapere, a trust runs the maternity hospital and employs the district nurses. A second trust has now been set up, to own the local GP practice. Between these trusts, there are now two doctors working in Tuatapere, where there had been considerable risk of there being none at all.

"Equity of access to health care is an issue for rural people. The best way to resolve it, is by communities deciding solutions, then making them work. The worst way is to sit and wait for some bureaucrat to come and answer your problem for you," Mr English said.
