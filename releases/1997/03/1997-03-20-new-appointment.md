Prime Minister Jim Bolger today announced the appointment of Tom Bridgman to the new position of Communications Co-ordinator for the Coalition Government. The new responsibility is designed to assist in the increased communication work within the Government. Tom Bridgman will take up the position within the Prime Minister's Private Office from next Monday.

He moves from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet where he was Director of the Communications Unit. Previously Mr Bridgman was Media Director of the CHOGM Taskforce and prior to that he was News Editor of the New Zealand Press Association.

Tom Bridgman says he is keen to take on the new challenge and the opportunities that will open up as he moves into a new area of responsibility.

The Prime Minister says he's delighted that someone with such wide-ranging experience will be working in his office.
