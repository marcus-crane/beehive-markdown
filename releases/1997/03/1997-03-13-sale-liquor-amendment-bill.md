The Minister of Justice, Hon D.A.M. Graham, today introduced legislation to validate the licences held by hotels and taverns permitting them to trade up to 3am on a Sunday.

'Since the Sale of Liquor Act came into force in 1989, the Liquor Licensing Authority, in the absence of any objections, has been granting on-licences authorising many hotels and taverns to supply liquor until 3am on a Sunday.

'However, S14 (2) of the Act currently does not permit hotels and taverns to sell or supply liquor on a Sunday, other than to people dining in or living on the premises.'

The result is that over 1400 holders of licences may well be operating in accordance with a licence wrongly issued, he said.

'This is through no fault of the licence holder who will no doubt have invested in the business in good faith,' Mr Graham said.

'The Sale of Liquor Amendment Bill validates those licences and to ensure a level playing field it authorises the Liquor Licensing Authority to issue licences up to 3am on Sundays.

'I am seeking the agreement of Opposition parties to ensure the Bill passes through all stages of the House as soon as possible,' he said.

The Bill is not part of the proposed general reform of the liquor laws. The Government is still assessing the report of the Liquor Review Advisory Committee.
