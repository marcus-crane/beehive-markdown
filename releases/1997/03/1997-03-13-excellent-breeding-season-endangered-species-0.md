The Minister of Conservation Nick Smith is impressed with recent progress in the protection of endangered species. In particular the kiwi Management Programme in the Central North Island is showing positive results.

"The hard work and effort by conservation staff to see our endangered national bird survive is starting to pay off. An 18 month old kiwi, Te Aukaha ("the strong one") has been successfully released back into Tongariro Forest, as part of operation nest egg. He is one of four young kiwi reared in captivity to protect him from predation from stoats. Now after seven weeks in the forest he's adapting well to life as a wild kiwi."

For the first time ever Okarito kiwi eggs have been hatched in captivity. The 12 chicks that survived that are still alive and well, and will eventually be released into the wild again.

"Kiwi aren't the only birds doing well. The magenta petrel, or Chatham Island taiko, has four chicks in burrows at the moment. If all these chicks survive, this looks like being the most successful breeding season yet for the taiko since its re-discovery in 1978. This summer has also been a good breeding season for the kokako and mohua (yellowhead)."

"While most of the Department's endangered species programmes have been very successful over this season there were some disappointments. The black robin had only 62 chicks from 69 pairs and only 14 of these have fledged so far. The shore plover programme has seen only 11 chicks fledged so far. This illustrates how difficult bird recovery projects are and the need for ongoing development of breeding techniques."

Mr Smith credits the eradication of predators and careful monitoring of the breeding areas for the success in protecting these rare breeds.

"Just last week we found out that at least one female kakapo is sitting on eggs on Codfish Island. Only 50 kakapo are known to still survive and with less than ten breeding females any new additions to the fledgling flock are a tremendous boost for the success of the programme. We are now just waiting to find out whether the eggs are fertile or not."

"The endangered species programme involves a major investment by the taxpayer in our natural heritage. These success stories show we are getting results."
