Cabinet today approved an amendment to the Petroleum Products Specifications Regulations which permits the use of aviation fuel in all jet boats, the Minister of Energy, Hon Max Bradford said today.

"The amendment is necessary because some jet boats use a high compression engine which requires a higher octane petrol than is normally available," Mr Bradford said.

Previously the regulations permitted the sale of non-specification fuel for a limited range of purposes, including jet boat and power boat racing.

"The amendment will permit non-specification fuel to be used by jet boats in any situation, not just racing. The non-specification fuel is generally called aviation gasoline, as it's prime use is in aviation," Mr Bradford said.

The Petroleum Products Specifications Amendment Regulations 1997 come into effect today. While the use of aviation fuel will not be mandatory, the Maritime Safety Authority will recommend that jet boats with high compression engines use aviation gasoline.
