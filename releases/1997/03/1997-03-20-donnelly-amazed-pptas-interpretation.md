"The PPTA's reaction to comments I made to the NZ Principals' Federation is outrageous," the Associate Education Minister Brian Donnelly said today.

The PPTA's president, Martin Cooney, announced on Monday that his association will withdraw from the Unified Pay System talks, giving remarks made by Mr. Donnelly as a reason.

"The reasons advanced by Mr. Cooney for the PPTA's action are lame," Mr. Donnelly said.

"I told the NZPF that, as the present population bubble moves from the primary to the secondary school sector, the Government needs to ensure that there is a partially mobile teaching force to move with it. This is the only way to prevent massive disruption to schools in a few years."

"I outlined what I perceived to be a psychological barrier amongst primary teachers to teaching in secondary schools; a barrier reinforced by the present two-tiered pay system."

"I then used my experience to demonstrate that the barrier was an artificial one for many teachers. In doing so, I did not suggest that there was no difference between the roles of primary and secondary teachers. This is simply a convenient spin the PPTA is putting on my comments to stir up its members."

"I am a primary-trained teacher who has spent most of my teaching career at the secondary level, teaching a range of subjects. I do not believe that all primary teachers can teach all subjects at secondary level. I strongly believe that content knowledge in the area being taught is one key element of successful teaching. All I was saying was that many primary teachers have knowledge and skills that can be used at the secondary level."

"Is the PPTA denying my experience, and the experience of many other primary-trained teachers who work in secondary schools? Is it also denying the fact that there are many secondary teachers successfully teaching subjects they did not specialise in at university?"

"For the PPTA to use my statements to withdraw from the consultative process raises questions about its real agenda."

"This present action and threats of major disruption to students' programme later this year is nothing more than a continuation of the pre-election chaos of last year. Mr. Cooney has now threatened unprecedented levels of industrial action. The Government will not be intimidated by the PPTA's posturing and the public will not tolerate a repeat of last year's actions, particularly if such action is based on flimsy pretexts."
