The Minister of Justice, Hon D.A.M. Graham, says the referendum on compulsory superannuation will be conducted by postal ballot in September.

The Government will consider itself bound by the result if it is approved by a simple majority of those voting, irrespective of voter turn-out.

If approved, the compulsory superannuation scheme will be implemented on 1 July next year.

The voting period will be a three-week period to be specified by Order in Council.

'On the current timetable, the most likely dates will be the three weeks beginning 5 September and ending at 7pm on 26 September,' Mr Graham said.

'Votes returned by post must be received by the Returning Officer on or before noon on the fourth day after the close of the voting period and postmarked in New Zealand on or before the close of the voting period.

'Overseas votes must be postmarked on or before the day before the close of the voting period.'

The results of the poll will not be calculated until after the close of the poll. The final result will be declared in early October.

Mr Graham says that the Government considers a postal ballot will be more convenient to voters and may encourage a greater voter turnout.

Preliminary rolls will be published before the referendum and voters will be encouraged by advertising to check their electoral details.

All voters on the electoral roll before the beginning of the voting period and those who qualify for enrolment during the voting period and who pre-enrol before the beginning of polling will be issued voting papers.

People on the roll who damage or spoil their papers or do not receive them can apply to have replacement papers posted to them.

The Chief Electoral Officer, Phil Whelan, will be designated as Returning Officer. A District Court Judge or a retired District Court Judge will be appointed to observe the scrutiny and count.

A core group of officials, including a private sector person, has been established to design the scheme, drawing on the superannuation policy announced by New Zealand First and the principles outlined by the Todd Task Force of Private Provision for Retirement. The group will consult with other departments and industry as the detail of the scheme is developed.

Details of the superannuation scheme will be widely publicised before the referendum by an independent Ministerial panel to be appointed shortly. The Coalition Government, as a government, will remain neutral on the proposal and each MP is entitled to argue for or against the scheme.

Mr Graham says the panel will be charged with ensuring voters have sufficient factual, balanced and impartial information to enable them to make an informed choice on compulsory superannuation. This publicity campaign is expected to cost about $4 million.

'The cost of running a nation-wide postal ballot, based on a 85% turn out of 2.5 million eligible electors, is in round figures $5 million plus GST,' Mr Graham says.

'In addition the Electoral Enrolment Centre of NZ Post will incur an additional $900,000 for printing rolls, pre-enrolment advertising and additional temporary staffing.

'These costings totalling about $10 million are however indicative and Cabinet has directed officials to prepare detailed costings.

'They are however about $7 million cheaper than a ballot box vote,' he says.
