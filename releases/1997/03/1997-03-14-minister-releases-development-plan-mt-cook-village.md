Conservation Minister Nick Smith today released a development report for Mt Cook village and community, saying that a major revamp is necessary if Mt Cook is to retain its status as one of New Zealand's premier visitor destinations.

"Mt Cook is one of the great icons of New Zealand tourism. The village is looking tired and tardy and this reflects poorly on the image of our tourism industry. This proposed plan is about re-establishing Mt Cook as one of the premier visitor centres in New Zealand and a trail blazer for attracting promotions and visitors to our country."

The report proposes a major revamp of the village including a redesign of the road network, a new commercial and visitor centre and a new management authority. The proposed upgrade is estimated to cost $16.7m. The village could be redeveloped over a period of twenty years with $7.5m required in the first five years.

"Funding will obviously be critical to the implementation of this proposed development. A partnership of central and local government with investment from major tourism interests will be needed. The report suggests that the new development could be funded by a $5 levy on visitors, collected at the new visitor centre."

"Currently 250,000 people visit Mt Cook each year. The challenge is going to be in providing up-market tourist facilities that will attract international interests without excluding New Zealand families from being able to enjoy Mt Cook as casual visitors."

Consultants Ernst and Young prepared the report in consultation with the Aoraki Conservation Board and a village development steering group of 13 organisations from central and local government, the tourism industry, non-governmental organisations and the local community. The report was funded by the Department of Conservation and the Tourism Industry.

Dr Smith said he would be seeking the co-operation of the local tourism industry to work towards implementing the report. The department will review the 1989 Mount Cook National Park management plan over the next two years, providing an opportunity for the public to comment on the plan.

Dr Smith said it was the first time that such a diverse group had worked together on a project of this type in New Zealand.

"They have jointly produced a document which is likely to result in greatly-improved facilities in Mount Cook village," he said.

Dr Smith also released three other reports on the village. Two geotechnical reports look at ways to ensure that the village is protected from the risk of mud, rock and water flows, which can occur without warning.

The third report recommends improving signs and walking tracks in the village. The department is already working on these.

"Aoraki/Mount Cook is a national icon with a long history of mountain recreation and tourism. It is also of central cultural importance to Ngai Tahu, a national park and a world heritage site. We must conserve the natural and cultural values of the area while trying to promote the village and park as an excellent place to enjoy New Zealand's great outdoors."
