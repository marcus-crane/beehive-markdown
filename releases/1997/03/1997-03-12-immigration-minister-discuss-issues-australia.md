Increasing numbers of asylum seekers entering New Zealand have prompted Immigration Minister Max Bradford to raise the issue with his Australian counterpart.

Mr Bradford is to meet with Commonwealth Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, during the Ministerial Council and Standing Committee of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in Darwin tomorrow and Friday.

Mr Bradford said he intended to raise immigration issues of mutual interest to New Zealand and Australia.

I will be raising one issue of particular concern to both Australia and New Zealand; that is, the alarming rise in asylum seekers in recent years in both our countries.

In 1993 the number of applications for refugee status was 347. By last year the number had risen to 1310.

These asylum seekers are crowding out genuine refugee claimants and imposing substantial costs on our welfare and legal system and budgets. Mr Bradford said.

There are several areas where New Zealand and Australia could work together for the benefit of both countries.
