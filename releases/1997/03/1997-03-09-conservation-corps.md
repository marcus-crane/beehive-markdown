Hon Deborah Morris, Minister of Youth Affairs, will tomorrow (10th March) visit two Conservation Corps programmes operating in the Wellington Region.

The Conservation Corps is a highly successful joint community and government enterprise. The programme caters for young people between the ages of 16 and 25 years, with 50% being Youth Action clients of the New Zealand Employment Service. Up to 90% of previous participants have entered employment, education or training six months after completing their programme.

The projects, focusing on conservation, education and challenging recreation, offer young people the opportunity to develop valuable work skills and increase their qualifications, self esteem, and confidence.

The two projects being visited are operated by the YMCA and the Salvation Army. The participants are involved in pampas removal, planting native trees, wetland planting, flora and fauna survey, and fence, track and wheelchair pathway construction.

Visits will take place in central Wellington and the Otari Reserve, between 9am and 12.30pm.
