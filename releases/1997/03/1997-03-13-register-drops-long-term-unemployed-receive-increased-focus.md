Employment Minister Peter McCardle said today traditional employment patterns had the expected effect on the number of people registered as unemployed in February, resulting in a register drop of 5,930 to 158,217.

Last months fall is encouraging and consistent with other economic indicators; and while the register has increasing complications as one unemployment indicator, the February statistics are positive. he said.

However monthly changes aside, the long-term register still includes 66,122 people unemployed for over six months. said the Minister.

Mr McCardle said this stubborn statistic reinforces that the Governments plans to focus employment policy activities more determinedly on reducing the percentage of people out of work for a long time is the right way to go.

It is critical we concentrate our activities on achieving better outcomes for long-term job seekers, said Mr McCardle.

In the first instance I would like to see significant progress in assisting the six thousand people who have been out of work for more than four years. Behind that unacceptable statistic are real people with real employment needs.

The Minister also said that work to develop the details of the Governments employment strategy is fully under way, with policy development due for completion by the middle of the year.
