Transport Minister Jenny Shipley is calling on the public to get involved in this discussion prior to the Government making decisions.

MMP provides an expectation that people should have their say.

The changes that are being considered will affect all New Zealanders and its important for the Coalition Government to hear as wide a range of views as possible.

The Land Transport Safety Authority (LTSA) began a review of driver licensing two years ago and has compiled the discussion document which is being released today.

The key changes proposed in the discussion document are:

Increasing the minimum driver licensing age to 17 years.  
Requiring a photograph on all drivers licenses.  
Requiring drivers to carry their licences at all times when driving.  
Introducing a zero blood alcohol limit for novice drivers.  
Making the licensing test tougher with extra emphasis on skills.  
Requiring all drivers to renew their licence and have their eyesight tested every 10 years.  
Relaxing the frequency of re-testing of older drivers but making the test tougher.  
Toughening the penalties for driving offences.  
Reducing the number of driver licence classes from 13 to 6.  
Amending the Graduated Drivers Licensing System and applying it to new drivers of any age.  
Mrs Shipley says the review is an important part of the Coalition Governments efforts to improve road safety.

Already this year 135 New Zealanders have died on our roads. That underlines the need for new measures to improve safety.

The Coalition Agreement requires the review of driver licensing to place strong emphasis on driver competence and to recognise that competent driving is dependent upon five facts: the individuals knowledge, skill, experience, fitness and attitude. The Coalition Agreement also includes consideration of introducing photos on drivers licences and investigation of the use of simulator training for new drivers.

This discussion document provides an interesting starting point for debate on driver licensing.

Some of the policies for consideration may prove controversial. I expect considerable comment, in particular, on the idea of increasing the licensing age to 17. Other issues will affect rural and urban people differently. The Government will keep an open mind and consider all the opinions expressed but we need people to get involved.

Submissions can be made to the LTSA by May 16 and those will then be summarised and taken into account when final policy options are developed for the Governments decision making. Copies of the discussion document can be obtained by calling the LTSAs free phone line, 0800 699-000.

Government MPs will be actively seeking the views of their electorates to enable them to be fully informed when they come to debating the options.

I expect decisions on the final shape of a new driver licensing system to be made before the end of the year, allowing for any necessary changes in the law to occur in 1998, Mrs Shipley concluded.
