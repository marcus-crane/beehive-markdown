New Zealand is to give 50 thousand dollars to help victims of the recent devastating earthquake in Iran, Foreign Minister Don McKinnon announced today. The New Zealand grant will come from Official Development Assistance funds and will be channelled through the UN's relief programme.

A series of major earthquakes have struck Aredebil province, northwest of Tehran, in the last week. Nearly a thousand people have been killed and more than 2500 injured. Damage to property and infrastructure is widespread.

"New Zealanders are no strangers to the damage earthquakes bring," Mr McKinnon said. "It is with sadness that I learned of the death and destruction this earthquake has caused."

Thousands of people have been left homeless by the earthquakes. Rescuers are battling heavy snow and freezing temperatures to rescue the victims.
