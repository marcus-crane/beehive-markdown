The Minister of Conservation Nick Smith today welcomed a proposed study to measure the effects cats are having on native birds, but Mr Smith challenged the Auckland SPCA to ensure any study was credible.

"Any survey needs to be scientifically based and not just a questionnaire to cat owners asking whether their tabby has killed any native birds. That is about as effective as asking parents whether their Johnny started the pinching at Kindy."

The Minister of Conservation originally raised the issue of cats in towns close to National Parks in a formal submission to the Tasman District Council Resource Management Plan. In the submission he suggested that the council provide for a ban on cats on any new subdivisions in St Arnaud township adjacent to Nelson Lakes National Park, that it ban any new cats to the area but that any existing cats be allowed to live out their lives. St Arnaud is the site of an innovative native bird recovery project where work is happening to eradicate stoats, weasels, possums and wasps so that rare native bird species from special island reserves can be introduced to this area and still have protection.

"Cat ownership in 99.9 percent of New Zealand is not under question, but for a few settlements close to National Parks where bird populations are at risk the idea needs to be considered. The proposal has few implications for Auckland and I am not suggesting at all that cats in Auckland are a major threat to native birds. Conducting a survey in Auckland is pretty meaningless because I have never suggested that cats in towns and cities pose any threat to our native bird populations."

"While I totally understand the SPCA's passionate advocacy for our feline friends, including my own cat Alfie, they must also recognise that other New Zealanders are just as passionate about protecting our native bird species. I don't think it is too much to ask that cats be banned in a few, very remote corners of New Zealand to help enable us to be able to enjoy our native wildlife."
