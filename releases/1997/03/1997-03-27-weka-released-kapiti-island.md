The Minister of Conservation Nick Smith today released weka on Kapiti Island after a successful programme to eradicate rats. No rats have been sighted on the island for six months. Although it will be two years before the island can be officially declared predator free, this is an excellent start.

"The only thing seen disappearing down a rat hole in the last few months was a lizard tail and this is incredibly encouraging for the future of endangered species on the island. The weka have been kept in large cages since October last year when the Wellington Conservancy of the Department of Conservation released bait to rid Kapiti Island of the Norway and Polynesian rat.

"This attempt to rid an island of introduced rodents is recognised as a world class undertaking. Only one other larger island, off Canada, has attempted a similar programme. The removal of rats will allow populations on birds on the island to develop. These include the saddleback, stitchbird and kaka. Other species like the kakapo, rare lizards and frogs, shoreplover and fernbirds may also benefit from being transferred to a rodent free island.

"Kapiti Island will continue to be monitored to ensure that it is indeed truly rat free. So far, this eradication effort has been the result of four years investigation and consultation with Iwi, landowners and public. Everybody involved in working on this project is to be congratulated. This is a key conservation achievement along the road to providing sanctuaries for our most threatened bird species."
