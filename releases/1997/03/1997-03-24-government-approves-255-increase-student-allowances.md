The Government announced today that student allowances will rise by 2.55% from April 1.

Education Minister Wyatt Creech said more than 49,000 students would benefit from the increase, which was in line with other cost of living adjustments.

Student allowances are available to students who meet specific eligibility criteria.

New maximum weekly allowances after tax are:

Students aged 16-24 living at home: $97.40 (was $94.98)  
Students aged 16-24 living away from home: $121.77 (was $118.74)  
Students 25 and over living at home: $116.90 (was $113.99)  
Students 25 and over living away from home: $146.13 (was $142.50)

This is a regular adjustment made to such payments. It is the maintaining of an existing policy.

The increase also applies to allowances for student couples, students with partners who are earning, students with dependent children, and the independent circumstances allowance for young students who are unable to live at home and who cannot reasonably expect financial support from their parents.
