The Minister of Police, Hon John Luxton today announced the appointment of an Independent Review of Firearms Control in New Zealand.

"This follows the request by the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) for the Minister of Police to call an independent inquiry into "Firearms Control in New Zealand", following the PCA reports on the fatal shootings in Invercargill and Whangarei," said Mr Luxton.

"I am pleased to appoint Hon Thomas Murray Thorp, a recently retired High Court Judge, who has an extensive legal background and is a highly respected member of the Judiciary.

"The Terms of Reference require Justice Thorp to consider the effectiveness of the 1983 Arms Act and its subsequent amendments in 1992, and to report on, in particular:

- whether the 1992 amendment has met with general compliance by the public;
- whether the Police have been able to adequately enforce compliance.

"After considering these issues, to outline the need for any amendment or further recommendations in the Review.

"The Review will encompass an audit of the recommendations contained in the Police Review as well as submissions from interested parties.

"The Review is required to be completed by 28 February 1997 and presented to the Minister of Police for consideration by the Government.

"I have written to interested parties who have raised the issue of Firearms Control with me, advising them that their written comments will be forwarded to Justice Thorp for his consideration during the Review," the Minister stated.

"Since the concerns on gun control were raised, action has been taken in a number of areas. Police undertook an immediate review of gunshop security, made findings in respect of policies and procedures, with some having been actioned already and others still under consideration. Some legislative changes were also recommended.

"At my request, Police also undertook their own review "A Review of Firearms Control in New Zealand" which was also extended to include comment on the Australian Firearms Control recommendations being adopted by the Australian Government," the Minister said.

"This is not the first time the Government has looked at firearms control in New Zealand. The Arms Amendment Act 1992, was the Government's response to our own tragedy at Aramoana in 1990. The Act tightened the firearms control legislation through:

- removing lifetime firearms licences and requiring renewal every 10 years. This ensures that Police can assess each applicant as to whether they are a "fit and proper" person to hold a firearms licence;
- stopping the importation of military style semi-automatic firearms (MSSA's);
- requiring current owners of MSSA's to hold an "E" endorsement on their firearms licence and requiring good security for these firearms;
- providing new safety and security requirements under the Arms Regulations for all firearms;
- enabling Police to seize firearms if a non-molestation or non-violence order is made by a Court in relation to domestic violence;
- making it an offence to sell or supply ammunition to anyone who does not have a licence; and
- making it an offence to sell firearms or ammunition by mail order without a written order signed by the buyer and endorsed by the Police.

"Any legislation needs to be reviewed periodically and I am pleased that we have appointed Justice Thorp to undertake this review.

"The issue of firearms control is an important one and I believe it is essential that the Government seeks this Independent Review before any further action is considered. This is also an opportunity for interested parties to put forward their views for consideration," concluded Mr Luxton.
