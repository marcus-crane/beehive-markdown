The taxpayer has not been ripped off through sales of Crown land to Ngai Tahu, the Minister of Lands, Denis Marshall, said today.

Mr Marshall was responding to claims by Christchurch MP Mike Moore that Ngai Tahu had made large profits by selling surplus Crown land it had bought.

"All the properties Mr Moore lists were either in the landbank for settling Ngai Tahu's Treaty of Waitangi claims, or were destined to go into the landbank."

"They were also all sold at current market value as assessed by a registered valuer."

"Once the transactions are complete then the properties are Ngai Tahu's to do with as they wish."

"It is significant that most of the properties on Mr Moore's list were on-sold to Ngai Tahu-owned companies."

"These sales were undertaken in the spirit of the negotiations. However, last year I reviewed the criteria for these sales and restricted them to land that was already in the landbank."

"These landbanked properties can't be sold to anyone else and are in limbo. Selling them to Ngai Tahu frees them up for development and leaves room for other properties to go into their landbank."
