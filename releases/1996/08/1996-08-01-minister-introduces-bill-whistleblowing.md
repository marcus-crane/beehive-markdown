The Minister of State Services, Paul East, today introduced a Protected Disclosures Bill to give legal protection to "whistleblowers".

The Bill is designed to protect those who disclose dishonesty, maladministration, or threats to public health, public safety or the environment, in or by the organisations in which they work.

A Ministerial review team, reported last December that, although there was no evidence of significant under-reporting of abuses, legislation was desirable for the following reasons:

· To reduce impediments to employees disclosing serious wrongdoing;

· To enhance confidence in public institutions;

· And to reinforce the statutory and ethical obligations of honesty and integrity within the public sector.

Mr East said that public sector organisations would be required to adopt internal procedures to receive and assess disclosures within the organisation. This would encourage consideration of ethical and public interest issues as part of the corporate culture.

"Where internal procedures do not exist, or are inappropriate, the head of the organisation may be approached instead. If no satisfactory result is reached within the organisation, the "whistleblower" may approach a policing authority or some other appropriate authority for assistance, or as a last resort, a Minister of the Crown or the Chief Ombudsman.

"In accordance with the findings of the review team, no separate agency is established to receive disclosures but the Ombudsmen's Office has a duty to provide information about the operation of the legislation to those who request it.

"In terms of protection for those who disclose information, the Bill covers both private and public sector employees and:

· Makes retaliatory action the ground of a personal grievance under the Employment Contracts Act;

· Provides a remedy against victimisation under the Human Rights Act 1993;

· Provides the "whistleblower" with immunity from criminal or civil liability;

· And as far as possible, confers anonymity on the "whistleblower".

"I believe that the Bill meets public concerns in this area in a measured and reasonable way. I propose to have the Bill referred to the Justice and Law Reform Select Committee to hear public submissions," said Mr East.
