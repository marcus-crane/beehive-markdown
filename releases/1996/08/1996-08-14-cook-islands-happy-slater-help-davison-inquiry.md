Foreign Minister Don McKinnon, having read the Slater Report, said he is pleased the Cook Islands have no problem with Mr Slater QC appearing before the Davison Commission.

I have sent a copy of the Report to Sir Ronald Davison, but it will be for the Commission to decide whether the information in it might be used in its own inquiry, Mr McKinnon said.

The two inquiries are quite separate, both in terms of their constitution and their terms of reference.

We have long urged the Cooks to cooperate with Sir Ronalds inquiry and this report shows that the Cook Islands Government has at least acknowledged it needs to address some of the fundamental questions at stake - thats a positive  
development, he said.

Mr McKinnon noted it is not appropriate for him to comment on the substance of the report.
