Minister of Defence, Paul East, said today that he had received a report from the New Zealand Army into the circumstances surrounding the shooting of 13 Kaimanawa wild horses at Waiouru.

"The report states that in the past these horses have posed a threat to both Army personnel and motorists travelling along State Highway 1. Since 1990 there have been three reported instances of wild horses causing accidents on the Desert Road, one of which involved serious injury. In 1994, wild horses broke into the Waiouru Saddle Club and along with the domestic horses stampeded across the children's play area.

"In view of these past incidents, the Army took action to ensure public safety. I agree with the report's conclusion that there should have been more consultation and that the alternatives to shooting should have been investigated and pursued.

"I have directed the Army to use alternative methods of dealing with the horses, such as tranquillisation, if they continue to pose a threat to the camp or motorists. In future no horse will be shot unless there is an immediate and serious threat to public safety and there is no other way of dealing with the danger they pose," said Mr East.
