Foreign Minister Don McKinnon has been aware of an action pending involving Mr Nattrass for about three or four years.

Allegations the New Zealand Government has interfered in the case are wrong.

So far as the New Zealand Government is concerned whether or not there was wrong doing is a matter for the Hong Kong judicial authorities. No doubt if the allegations made demonstrate the need for a judicial inquiry, the Hong Kong authorities will hold one.
