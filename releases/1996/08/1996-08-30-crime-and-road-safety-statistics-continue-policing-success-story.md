The Minister of Police, Hon John Luxton today welcomed the release by Police of the crime and road safety statistics for the June year 1996, saying that they showed very good trends in many key policing areas.

"We have a policing success story to tell and these latest statistics are good news for our communities," said Mr Luxton.

"It certainly disproves recent comments that "crime is out of control". In my view, it is considerably more under control now than under previous governments. The increase in reported crime continues to remain just above 2%.

"This trend has developed over the last few years since the Government initiated both the merger of the Police with the old Traffic Safety Division, the extra 900 Police, and we have seen the implementation of the Police five year strategic plan since 1993.

"I am delighted to see that violent offending and serious assaults have decreased and that burglaries have also continued a downward trend," said the Minister.

"The road safety and enforcement statistics show quite clearly that Police are doing a very good job on our roads, again disputing recent claims that the job was not being done. We continue to see the road toll lower than in previous years and enforcement of driving offences has increased considerably.

"I congratulate Police on their excellent work but reducing crime and improving road safety needs help from our local communities also. It is not a job for Police alone.

"The Government has worked very hard to enhance the partnership role between Government, Police, local communities and other agencies to focus on crime prevention and road safety," Mr Luxton said.

"We are successfully implementing the New Zealand Crime Prevention Strategy announced in 1994 which is the first time such a strategy has been developed for New Zealand. We have also initiated Safer Community Councils with 52 established covering 86% of our population. These Councils are doing a very good job of c0-ordinating local crime prevention initiatives.

"I welcome the support we have been receiving from local communities in promoting crime prevention. We are also receiving excellent support in the road safety area but we still need to keep promoting safe driving practices to all drivers.

"I believe these latest statistics can reassure New Zealanders that we are successfully dealing with crime and road safety issues and are also a good response to the misinformed critics," concluded Mr Luxton
