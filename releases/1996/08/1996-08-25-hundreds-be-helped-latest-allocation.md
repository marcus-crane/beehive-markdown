More than 1,800 people on waiting lists will be offered procedures as a result of the latest allocation from the Government's Waiting Times Fund aimed at reducing New Zealand's public hospital waiting lists," announced the Minister of Health Jenny Shipley today.

The Waiting Times Fund Advisory Group considered seven more applications at their third meeting last week.

"I have approved in principle additional procedures which include coronary angioplasty, orthopaedic specialist assessments and treatment, and ear nose and throat specialist assessments and treatment," said Mrs Shipley.

The following areas benefit from this latest allocation:
