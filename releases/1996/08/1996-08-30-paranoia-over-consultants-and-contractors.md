Annette King's never ending attack on Social Welfare's use of contractors and consultants, displays either a naïve understanding of modern business acumen,or reflects a hidden agenda to reinflate numbers in the public service, the Hon Peter Gresham, Minister of Social Welfare, said today.

Responding to Mrs King's promise that Labour would review the use of consultants by government departments Mr Gresham said that expenditure of $1.5 million for the use of contractors in a department the size of Social Welfare was modest.

"This is an organisation with an operating budget of nearly $500 million and a total expenditure of over $11 billion. The Department must have access to the top business brains in the country to help ensure taxpayers are given the best possible return for their investment, and that customers receive a highly efficient range of services.

"It would be totally inappropriate to hire specialist personnel on a full-time basis to meet every eventuality. Few New Zealanders would want to turn the clock back to the days when the bloated bureaucracy was staffed to deal with every imaginable situation that might arise.

"Mrs King is also clutching at straws when she tries to link senior managers performance pay to the cost of contractors and consultants. The managers have ongoing policy and service delivery responsibilities which keep them fully occupied. Contractors are only brought in to advise on particular projects or to help out in areas of specific expertise".

On the issue of tendering, Mr Gresham said that despite Mrs Kings allegations contractors and consultants were hired in line with departmental policy. In a very few cases tenders were not called because of the highly specialised nature of projects which required detailed knowledge and scarce expertise held by individuals.
