The Credit (Repossession) Bill 1996 was introduced to the House today. The Bill corrects credit law shortcomings in the area of repossessions.

"This is an area where present practices are of considerable concern to consumer and community organisations dealing with consumers who have their goods repossessed" said the Minister of Consumer Affairs, Katherine O'Regan.

The current laws governing credit repossession are spread over several statutes. This inconsistency has resulted in confusion for both businesses and consumers and has lead to poor market practices.

The Bill seeks to achieve a better balance between the rights of debtors, credit providers and guarantors by enhancing safeguards when goods are repossessed. Those safeguards include reasonable time periods for notice of the intention to repossess, that repossessions are carried out in a reasonable manner and at reasonable times by people without serious criminal records. The Bill also seeks to enable debtors to reinstate the agreement after repossession without jeopardising the interests of credit providers.

"This is very good news" said Mrs O'Regan. "Consumer and community organisations have long called for changes to repossession and other areas of credit law to protect consumers' interests. I am confident that this Bill provides an appropriate balance between the rights of debtors and the legitimate interests of credit providers."
