The Army is to be equipped with $18.5 million of new night vision and remote ground sensing equipment, the Minister of Defence, Paul East, announced in Parliament today.

Mr East says the Ministry of Defence will begin negotiations with a range of overseas companies for the supply of night weapon sights, night vision goggles, night aiming devices, thermal imaging, and remote ground sensing equipment.

A further contract for night vision binoculars, worth about $2 million, will be let once trials, currently underway, are completed.

All the equipment is expected to be in service with the Army by the first half of 1997.

"To minimise casualties and protect themselves against surprise attack, our Forces must be able to detect precisely an opponent's movements at night or in conditions where visibility is limited.

"We need the gear to operate effectively with the Forces of our friends and allies and enhance our self-reliance. Not having this equipment will make us a liability to any collective security or peacekeeping operation," said Mr East.

The equipment will also be used in counter-terrorist and search and rescue operations. It will be funded, as all military equipment purchases are, from the existing Defence Vote.

Mr East says the Government is aware of the need for modern naval helicopters, but a decision on the purchase of appropriate aircraft has been deferred.

Two helicopters - the Kaman SH-2G Seasprite and the Westland Super Lynx - have been shortlisted for selection to replace the Navy's obsolete Wasp helicopters.

"The project is a collaborative one with the Australian Department of Defence which is currently evaluating a number of tenders to supply new helicopters for the Royal Australian Navy's ANZAC class frigates and its planned offshore patrol boats.

"In line with the Government's desire to ensure that whatever equipment we buy is compatible with Australia's, we have decided to await further progress with their evaluation," said Mr East.

The Royal New Zealand Navy's new helicopters will operate from both its Leander and its new ANZAC frigates.
