No public money will be used in any proposed legal action relating to appointments at Southern Health, Crown Health Enterprises Minister Bill English said today.

"The MP for Invercargill wrongly claimed that taxpayers' money would be used in legal action against him.

"Any action is entirely a matter for the individuals concerned and will be taken by those individuals.

"Mr Mark Peck and the chairman and chief executive of Southern Health can sort out their personal differences in the courts, but no taxpayers money will be involved," said Mr English.
