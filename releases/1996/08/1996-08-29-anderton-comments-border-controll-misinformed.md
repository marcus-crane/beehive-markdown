Alliance leader Jim Anderton's comments to Kerikeri orchardists yesterday regarding the Government's commitment to strengthening border controls were misinformed, Agriculture Minister Lockwood Smith said today.

"Considerable work has been undertaken by the Ministry of Agriculture on a new border control strategy including the introduction of X-ray machines, extra sniffer dogs and enhanced inflight and arrival hall information," Dr Smith said.

"New Zealand MAF officials have visited the United States to evaluate the use of X-ray machines and the United States Department of Agriculture was kind enough to trial their machines along the lines we are proposing to use them in New Zealand."

Dr Smith said it was important that when the X-ray machines were introduced in New Zealand airports they were as effective as possible without causing unacceptable delays for passengers.

"The business case for the introduction of the machines was completed some time ago and officials are now looking at different options for the implementation of the machines to maximise their effectiveness while minimising delays."

There was no immediate rush to introduce the machines until later in the year because fruitfly cannot survive in New Zealand's winter. That meant the Government had time to ensure the introduction of the machines would lead to the maximum possible improvements to border control.

Nevertheless, Dr Smith said the Government was keen to make a decision in the next few weeks to avoid any delays in the introduction of the machines should the election result be such that a new Government is not formed until late in the year.
