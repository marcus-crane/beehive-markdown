Transport Minister, Maurice Williamson is concerned that the Tasman District and Nelson City Councils may have been misinformed about the Government position regarding an Iwi shareholding in Nelson Airport.

I am concerned that the Governments position on the sale of its share in the airport may have been misrepresented. We have not put any pressure on the Councils to on-sell any of their shareholding. The Governments obligation was to ensure our Treaty partner was informed.

It is entirely up to the two Councils to decide whether or not to sell any of their shares in the Airport to any other party.
