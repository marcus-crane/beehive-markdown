A 60 bed unit is to be added to Mangaroa Prison in the Hawkes Bay, Minister of Corrections, Paul East, announced today.

Tendering for design work and construction will start as soon as possible and the new unit should be ready by the end of April 1997. It will be sited on land currently owned by the prison.

"The extra capacity will help cater for the projected long term growth in prison numbers and will also ensure that Hawkes' Bay offenders don't have to be sent out of the region because of a shortage of prison beds locally.

"The Government has asked the Department of Corrections to develop a facilities plan for the country as a whole so that optimal use is made of each existing prison site.

"Three new 60 bed units - one at Rolleston near Christchurch and two at Waikeria near Te Awamutu, are due to open in the next couple of months. The Government is also committed to building a new contract managed remand centre next to Mt Eden Prison and a new prison in South Auckland," said Mr East.

The new 60 bed unit at Mangaroa Prison will create about 20 extra jobs for prison officers, bringing staff numbers up to approximately 160. The prison currently houses 264 inmates.

"The new unit at Mangaroa will also provide work for inmates at Waikeria Prison who will build the cell huts, while the remainder of the construction will go out to competitive tender," said Mr East.
