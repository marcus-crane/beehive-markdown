Rangitikei MP Denis Marshall said that homes will have to be found for one thousand Kaimanawa wild horses if all of the culled ones are to be saved.

"There are now well in excess of 1,300 horses; probably as many as 1,600. At least 250 of the foals born this spring will survive into the autumn. The management plan allows for 800 horses in two herds. Therefore 1,000 horses have to go."

"This is a big challenge for the horse lobby who don't want the Department of Conservation to kill any of the horses. Those horses that aren't bought after next year's muster will inevitably go to the abattoir.

Mr Marshall said the Government had not backed off the management plan.

"This is only a temporary reprieve; the horses still have to be culled to protect the sensitive ecology of the Kaimanawas.
