The Minister of Police, the Hon John Luxton said today that he was encouraged by the positive action Police have been taking to deal more effectively with youth offenders in our communities.

"Earlier this year, I was very concerned over reports on how the Children and Young Persons and Their Families Act was working from a Police perspective and requested a briefing from Police on the issue," said Mr Luxton.

"There are many Police staff who are using the Act the way it was intended but to further deal with issues arising from youth offending, Police have been undertaking internal publicity and training.

"There have also been bilateral discussions at all levels between Police, the Department of Social Welfare (DSW) and the New Zealand Children and Young Persons Service (NZCYPS) to work through issues.

"I have also had discussions with my colleague, the Minister of Social Welfare, Hon Peter Gresham on youth offending issues. I am very pleased with the progress being made since I received the Police briefing paper in February," Mr Luxton said.

"I also believe it is important that New Zealanders are aware of how Police can use the Act to deal effectively with youth offenders. I have decided to release the briefing paper which was prepared for me and outlines some of the issues and the action taken by Police over the last six months.

"There are several areas of the Act which can assist Police and they include:

- a child or a young person can be arrested. Once this has happened Police do not have to charge them - they can go direct to a family group conference or be given a warning;
- youths who are arrested can be kept in Police custody for 24 hours without a joint certificate;
- a child under 14 can be arrested and kept in custody, but they are dealt with by way of a declaration. This is a court order directing that the youngster is to receive care and protection because of the "number, nature or magnitude" of their offending.

"I believe that the co-operation between Police and the NZCYPS is seeing a positive benefit through the increased effectiveness in dealing with youth offenders

"In particular, a number of joint initiatives have commenced including an inter-agency strategy "Recidivist Offender Project" involving Police, Youth Affairs, NZCYPS and community groups. This aims to ensure the co-ordinated development of services to assist the early identification of recidivist offenders and ensuring that specific programmes and services are targeted appropriately.

"I believe we are making good progress in dealing with youth offenders, but the issue cannot be left to Government alone, local communities need to work in partnership with us in helping to prevent crime," concluded Mr Luxton.
