The Education Minister has asked the Secretary for Education to investigate the circumstances surrounding the failure of tens of thousands of education staff to get paid.

Contractor Datacom has apologised for yesterday's 24 hour delay in the crediting of school staff pay.

"I am deeply concerned at the problems with the payments. A speedy inquiry is needed to find out what went wrong and to establish what needs to be to done ensure the collapse is never repeated," Mr Creech said.

"Since I have been Minister I have been working to improve the working relationship between the education workforce and the Ministry.

"An investigation of the issue should settle the concerns of all involved" Mr Creech said

"The results of the investigation should be available to the sector - including any follow-up action to be taken by the Secretary.

Mr Creech said he has been assured the pay has now been banked in staff accounts.
