Minister of Defence Paul East says he is disappointed that Labour's associate defence spokesperson does not have more faith in the calibre of New Zealand's defence forces.

Mr East was responding to Phil Goff's claims that the defence forces will not be able to cope with working in the prisons affected by industrial action.

"I am sure defence personnel will feel insulted by this lack of support from Mr Goff. This country is fortunate to have extremely well-trained and capable people serving in its armed forces. I have every confidence that they all have the skills and training necessary for their role in supplementing those prison staff who remain on duty.

"I have been assured that defence personnel will receive every possible assistance from the prison staff they'll be working alongside," said Mr East.
