The health sector will be concerned and confused at Helen Clarks appointment as Labour health spokesperson, Crown Health Enterprises Minister Bill English said today.

"Health professionals will remember that it was Ms Clark who said 'over-representation of providers of health care on area health boards would hamper the ability of boards to change the traditional allocation of resources'.

"Labour has harped on about the management emphasis in our Crown health enterprises and has said it will bring back elected area health boards to run our health system.

"But it was Helen Clark who, in 1989, brought management disciplines into our hospitals and threatened to give elected area health boards the chop unless they could make rational decisions, said Mr English.

"Labour is sending a very confused signal to the health sector and I am sure Ms Clark knows the bind she's in. After six years of complaining, Labour needs to come up with something which is different enough to excite the public or get the health sector on side.

"But Labour's policy of reinventing elected area health boards will simply be an expensive and ineffective time waster and Helen Clark knows it. It will be an exercise about people in Wellington drawing lines on maps, but it will cause huge and unnecessary disruption in the hospital sector," said Mr English.
