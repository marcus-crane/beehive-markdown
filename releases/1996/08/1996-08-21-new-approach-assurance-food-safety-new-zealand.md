Food Amendment Bill No 2 has had its 3rd reading in the House today and in speaking to the Bill, Mrs O'Regan, Associate Minister of Health, said that "The Food Amendment Bill No 2 proposes a completely new approach to the assurance of food safety in New Zealand.

Up to this time the food industry has been regulated under the very prescriptive Food Hygiene Regulations 1974. The focus of the current food hygiene regulations is on the detailed requirements for premises and basic food hygiene rather than on the food safety risks associated with the processes of food production, storage, transportation and retail sale."

Mrs O'Regan says under this Bill food manufacturers and retailers will be able to get an exemption from these prescriptive regulations, when and only when, they have an approved food safety programme in place. The Bill clearly sets out what must be included in a food safety programme and concentrates on the key food safety issue of risk identification, management and control.

"The whole process is underpinned by the need to have an effective transparent audit process to show that the food safety programme continues to be effective," she says.

Mrs O'Regan said, The move to food safety programmes based on Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point System (HACCP) is entirely consistent with the progress which is being seen in other countries. New Zealand has long taken the lead in international forum when discussion of food safety has arisen. It is entirely appropriate that New Zealand now takes the initiative to give legal recognition to this important food safety provision.

"There is strong, one could almost say, overwhelming support within the food industry for this initiative. I believe that this again demonstrates the importance of the Bill," said Mrs O'Regan. "When you have the support of the sector which is the subject of the regulation then success is that much easier."

"The Bill clearly sets out the powers and responsibilities of the Director-General of Health, the Territorial Authorities and the independent auditors."

"This whole move in a new direction for food safety can only be effectively achieved when all the parties involved are part of the process. This legislation signals the beginning of the transition," Mrs O'Regan said. "It has been developed through an open and consultative process where the frank exchange of views and ideas has been crucial. By building in the voluntary transitional process the Bill allows for the most effective food safety systems to be developed for New Zealand."

"International experience has clearly shown that it is only when there is commitment and support for all parties that meaningful change in food safety can be achieved," said Mrs O'Regan. "The imposition of unnecessarily restrictive legislative requirements has been clearly shown to be counterproductive."

"This Bill signals the beginning of a major reform for the New Zealand food industry. It is going to take time to fully complete this reform. This Bill begins a new way for the food industry and the regulators to do their business. The Bill facilitates the learning process that will enhance the safety and export potential of New Zealand foods," concluded Mrs O'Regan
