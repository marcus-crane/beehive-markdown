Crown Health Enterprises Minister Bill English said today that the boards running the public hospital system had a wide range of skills.

He was commenting on information provided for parliamentary questions asked by Labour's former health spokeswoman Lianne Dalziel.

"The questions asked how many members of Crown health enterprise boards were accountants, lawyers or had a medical background. From the information held, eight directors described themselves as lawyers, 25 as accountants, and 20 had a clinical background.

"Descriptions given by directors of their occupation ranged from college principal to farmer to engineer.

"Most board members are dedicated individuals with a desire to do public service. There is often little public recognition for their work.

"Now that the public hospital sector is getting better at living with financial disciplines, it is important that boards focus on improving the quality of services provided by our hospitals.

"Getting the mix of skills on each board right is important. To date there has been a focus on the financial side of things, but I have been keen to increase the number of directors with clinical skills," said Mr English.
