Minister of Defence, Paul East, today dismissed the Alliance's defence policy, describing it as introspective and naive."The Alliance's plan to withdraw New Zealand from all current international defence alliances ignores the fact that we live in a global village and there is no place for neutrality in today's modern world.

"If New Zealand wants to maintain its strong economic position and its reputation as a good world citizen, then we must pursue our policies on all levels in a co-ordinated manner.

"The Alliance does not seem to realise that defence policy is but one facet of a nation's strategy to prosper in the world. Defence policies must be co-ordinated with foreign and trade policies. The Alliance's defence policy has been written in isolation and will in fact result in New Zealand becoming isolated.

"In simple terms, you can't influence the outcome of the game if you don't pick up the ball and play.

"The Alliance is naive to think it can put defence personnel into peacekeeping operations, which all have the potential to deteriorate into open warfare, without providing them with the necessary skills and equipment to handle these situations.

"If you want to be totally involved in peacekeeping, as our Forces have been in Somalia, Mozambique and Bosnia, then you need to be completely up to speed with combat capabilities.

"The Alliance seems hellbent on stripping the Forces of the very skills they need to carry out peacekeeping missions. While the mediation skills advocated by the Alliance, and in fact already taught by the Defence Force, are all well and good, you need certain combat skills to fall back on when the bullets start flying.

"The Alliance's ideas on equipment needs are inconsistent. On the one hand it plans to cancel the ANZAC frigate project but at the same time it outlines tasks for the Navy that only a frigate sized ship could carry out.

"Everything about the Alliance defence policy is unworkable and contradictory," said Mr East.
