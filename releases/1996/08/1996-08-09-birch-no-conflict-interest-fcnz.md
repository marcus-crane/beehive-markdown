Ministers are well aware of their responsibilities, Finance Minister Rt Hon Bill Birch said today.

Mr Birch was responding to a statement from Jeanette Fitzsimons of the Alliance  
which said some Ministers should not be involved in the process of considering the sale of Forestry Corporation.

Those Ministers who feel there is a conflict of interest stand aside from the consideration when a decision like this is being made. Furthermore, it is ridiculous for Ms Fitzsimons to claim the Alliance has revealed anything.

It is the government which publishes the Register of Ministers Interests and  
Assets. The register is public knowledge.
