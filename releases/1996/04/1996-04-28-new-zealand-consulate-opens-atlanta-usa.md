To the sounds of conch shells and the singing of the Maori cultural performance group, Kahurangi, the New Zealand Consulate in Atlanta was opened by the Deputy Prime Minister Don McKinnon during a stopover in Georgias capital.

This is a proud day for New Zealand, Mr McKinnon said.

Our flag now flutters from the mast head of one of Atlantas leading hotels where the office is situated.

The new Honorary Consulate, headed by New Zealander Ian Latham, a Senior Partner in Ogilvy and Mather, provides a focal point not only for the many New Zealanders and commercial interests in Georgia, but also for those expected to visit during the Olympic Games getting under way in less than three months time.

Ian Latham is well qualified to represent New Zealand here, Mr McKinnon said.

He has lived and worked in the United States for nearly twenty years and in Atlanta since 1980.

Establishing a presence in Atlanta signalled New Zealands close economic interests with the United States South Mr McKinnon commented.

It compliments consulates already established in places like Houston, Chicago, and San Diego and provides a conduit for closer ties.

The United States is New Zealands principle investment source and is also our third largest trading partner.

During his short visit to Atlanta, following talks in Washington with senior members of the US Administration, Mr McKinnon gave an address to the Southern Center for International Studies on New Zealands economic reforms and toured the New Zealand Host Committee facilities for the Olympic Games.
