Prime Minister, Rt Hon J B Bolger, is shocked and outraged at hearing reports that up to 100 refugees, many of them women and children, were killed and more than 150 injured when Israeli forces shelled a UN base in southern Lebanon.

The horrific events in Lebanon underscore the urgency of the need to find a peaceful and comprehensive solution in the Middle East. I am deeply concerned that the headquarters of the Fijian battalion of UN peacekeeping troops has been fired upon by Israeli forces. I call on all parties to respect the relevant UN resolutions, Mr Bolger said.

Reports indicate that the shelling took place after Hizbollah forces had fired Katyusha rockets and mortar shells from a position about 300 metres from the UN base.

I am also saddened by reports that Fiji peacekeepers are among the dead and injured. I am sure the thoughts and prayers of all New Zealanders are with the people of Fiji at this sad time, as they are, of course, with the families of the refugees killed and injured in Lebanon.

Three Fijian peacekeepers were reported to have died in the attack. The Prime Minister is sending a condolence message to the Acting Prime Minister of Fiji, the Honourable Ratu Timoci Vesikula.
