Oyster lovers will be able to enjoy Bluff oysters from the first commercial season in three years with the announcement today by the Minister of Fisheries Hon Doug Kidd of a commercial oyster fishing season. The only oysters available over the last three years have been the by-product of small scale enhancement trials, which were permitted even though normal harvesting was prohibited.

The season will run from 1 June until 31 August 1996. Mr Kidd will introduce regulations allowing for a Total Allowable Commercial Catch of 14,950,000 oysters, or 650 sacks each for the 23 vessels in the fishery. A more flexible stance on fishing-on-behalf arrangement within the oyster fleet is also to be taken. This will enable a significant reduction in catching costs.

Mr Kidds decision is based on oyster survey results late last year showing the oyster beds in Fouveaux Strait have begun to recover from the disease that decimated the beds between 1987 and 1992. The number of oysters in the Strait have increased in the three years since the fishery was closed, from around 319 million oysters in 1992 to an estimated 679 million. Prior to the outbreak of the Bonamia disease the oyster population in Foveaux Strait was estimated to be more than 1140 million - a level which had proved to be sustainable over many years.

It is important to strike a careful balance between any harvest of oysters and allowing the beds to quickly rebuild to their former size, said Mr Kidd. I have set a conservative catch limit which safeguards the recovery the fishery has shown in the absence of fishing and recognises the unknown impact of reopening the beds to fishing, said Mr Kidd.

The Minister noted the responsible stance taken by the oyster industry in its deliberations over the prospects for a season this year. It is clear from the recommendations put forward by the oyster industry that industry leaders have set for themselves the task of planning for a sustainable and productive fishery, said Mr Kidd.
