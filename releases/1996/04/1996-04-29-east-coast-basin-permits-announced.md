The Minister of Energy, Hon Doug Kidd, today announced that he had approved the grant of six petroleum exploration permits in the East Coast Basin (on and offshore East Coast, North Island).

The new permits cover some 30,000 square kilometres (7.4 million acres). Three of the permits areonshore and three offshore.

All of the permits have been issued for a five year term. The conditions of grant for each of the permits require a minimum of one well to be drilled within the five year term.

The successful bidders are:

PEP 38325 Westech Energy New Zealand Limited and Enerco New Zealand Limited PEP 38326 Westech Energy New Zealand Limited and Enerco New Zealand Limited PEP 38327 Asia Pacific Oil Sdn. Bhd.  
PEP 38328 International Resource Management Group, Moondance Energy Limited, Mosaic Oil NZ and Croft Exploration Limited  
PEP 38329 Westech Energy New Zealand Limited and Enerco New Zealand Limited PEP 38330 Indo-Pacific Energy Limited, Moondance Energy Limited and Mosaic  
Oil NZ 2

The approval for grant of these six Petroleum Exploration Permits follows the October 1995 approval of 17 permits in the Taranaki, Canterbury and Westland Basins. Significant work has already commenced in some of the Taranaki Basin permits, complementing a further significant seismic survey in the offshore Northland Basin.

The Minister emphasised that apart from the current release of two permit blocks in the Taranaki Basin announced in March this year, the whole of the New Zealand not covered by existing permits and licences was now available for permitting via the Acceptable Frontier Offer system. The Acceptable Frontier Offer system is a simplified process which must provide for welldrilling in year two of the permit, or year three if it is in a less explored area.
