Fisheries Minister Hon Doug Kidd today supervised the release of two truckloads of eels, the first dividend of an innovative partnership between South Island Maori and commercial fishers to rebuild the eel fishery. The eels were released to sea from Waihora/Lake Ellesmere.

The ground breaking pilot programme will ensure the Minister of Fisheries is given advice on the most appropriate ways to rebuild the declining South Island eel fishery, addressing outstanding Treaty issues and give security to commercial interests by bringing the South Island eel fishery into the Quota Management System.

Mr Kidd said that such a joint venture would have been inconceivable a few years ago when both parties had little understanding or sympathy for the others point of view. Mr Kidd said he was heartened by the efforts that Maori and industry had put into developing far reaching and innovative proposals to sustain and rebuild the fishery to the long term benefit of all, not least being the eels themselves.

Maori and industry had formed, at the invitation of the Minister, a Joint Working Group known as the Te Waka a Maui me ona Toka Eel Working Group. The group has developed a long term strategy for the management of the fishery to address the concerns of all users of the fishery. A report setting out the strategies has been presented to the Minister for his consideration and approval.

Mr Kidd said the group could be justly proud of their efforts which showed that Maori and other New Zealanders could work closely together to manage a natural resource without compromising either the sustainability of the resource or the principles of the Treaty. The efforts of the Joint Working Group showed that solutions to these problems did not need to be solely the province of Government.

Mr Kidd said that what could be achieved by application of local knowledge of a resource and the sound application of the principles of sustainable management was exemplified by the work of the Ngai Tahu people of Waihora/Lake Ellesmere and the commercial fishers of the Lake Ellesmere Eel Fishermans Association.

Faced with a declining fishery where the majority of the eels taken were of minimal size, few female eels reached a size and age that allowed them to migrate to breed and virtually none reached a size that Maori considered appropriate for cultural purposes, the local people developed their own practical and effective solutions to the problem.

They sought from Government a progressive annual increase in the commercial size of eels in the Lake, which effectively placed the majority of the fishery beyond the reach of commercial fishers. They then reached an agreement amongst themselves which would allow the harvest of small surplus male eels for a short period of the year when many eels die attempting to migrate across the beach at Ellesmere to the sea.

As part of that agreement any large female eels that were caught would be saved and manually transferred to waterways where they would be able to reach the sea and migrate to breed.

Finally after the migration of small eels is completed, commercial fishers agreed to cease fishing the area of the lake where larger eels congregate to migrate thereby reserving those fish for customary harvest and breeding purposes.

Mr Kidd said he had considered that this proposal had such merit that he had approved a special permit to allow it to proceed this year.

The management strategies at Waihora/Lake Ellesmere had not been without short term financial loss to the commercial eel fishers, but the partnership between Maori and industry could confidently expect that these actions would result in future economic and customary gains.

Mr Kidd commended the people of Waihora/Lake Ellesmere for their efforts saying they had laid down a challenge which Maori and industry in other fisheries could usefully consider as an example to follow.
