The Minister of Maori Affairs, Hon John Luxton today called for nominations from interested parties for the 13 Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission (Te Ohu Kaimoana) Commissioner positions.The successful nominees will be asked to tackle an important issue for Maori - the allocation of the fisheries resource, said Mr Luxton.

The 13 member Commission was established as part of the Maori fisheries settlement under the Treaty of Waitangi (Fisheries Claims) Settlement Act 1992.

Members of the Commission were appointed to a three year term in May 1993, with the primary function of identifying the appropriate beneficiaries of the fisheries settlement and allocating to them, the benefits of the fisheries settlement.

This task has proved to be a complicated and time consuming one, said Mr Luxton.

When the Commission was originally appointed, all parties looked forward to it completing allocation expeditiously. However, it has been a contested process which is not surprising perhaps, given what is at stake.

The impasse has not prevented the Commission from carrying out its other responsibilities, including building the skills of Maori fishers and fishing companies, representing Maori interests in the fishing industry and building an asset base, the Minister stated.

The Commission have progressively worked through the issues over the last three years to ensure Maori got into the business of fishing. What was once largely a subsistence and part-time source of employment for Maori, is now seen as a long-term career path and base for Maori economic development. The Commission must continue the good work it has completed, while at the same time, bringing allocation issues to a satisfactory resolution, Mr Luxton said.

I am also interested in receiving views from Maori on the criteria for the selection of Commission members. In the past, the criteria used for the selection of Commissioners included:

- fluency in Te Reo Maori and an understanding of Maori aspirations;
- an understanding of the Treaty of Waitangi and its application in modern society;
- business experience, preferably in the fishing industry;
- financial management skills commensurate with the management of a complex financial enterprise;
- established trade and marketing networks in the fishing industry;
- possession of effective communication skills; and
- presentation of regional fishing interests.

The role of the Commission has developed over the past three years and it may be that greater emphasis should be placed on some of the criteria or other criteria established.

I welcome views on these issues and also anticipate convening a national hui to provide a further forum for opinions and an opportunity for submissions to be presented, concluded Mr Luxton.

Details of the hui will be made available shortly. All nominations for the Commission and submissions on the selection criteria should be sent by 7 June 1996 to:
