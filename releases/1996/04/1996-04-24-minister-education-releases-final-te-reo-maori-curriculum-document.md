Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today he was delighted to release to schools the final version of the first-ever Mäori language curriculum document, Te Reo Mäori.

"This is a landmark in the process of helping to preserve te reo Mäori as a living language for future generations," said Mr Creech.

"The curriculum document provides for learning and teaching through Mäori language and through Mäori knowledge and experience," he said.

"It contains clear achievement objectives at eight levels and will ensure that the learning opportunities are relevant and interesting for the student. It also provides assessment examples and suggestions for monitoring students' learning. The document allows flexibility for each iwi to include dialectual variations in the implementation process."

Mr Creech said he wished to issue his personal thanks to the many Mäori educationalists, the members of iwi and the school communities who had worked together since 1992 to help produce the curriculum statement.

"Immersion-style education has two main goals. These are the recovery of te reo Mäori as a living language, and better achievement and paricipation of students in education by providing a learning environment which is appropriate for their needs," he said.

"Teachers in Kura Kaupapa and other teachers of Mäori language throughout New Zealand now have a curriculum statement on which to base their Mäori language programmes. I am sure that parents and iwi will be delighted that the first recognised Mäori curriculum statement has been provided for their children.

Mr Creech said professional teacher development programmes would continue to assist practising teachers to increase their Mäori language proficiency and help them in the implementation of the Mäori curriculum.

The curriculum statements Pängarau (Mäori mathematics) and Putaiao(Maori science), are in the process of final development, and will be distributed to schools later in the year. The draft of Tikanga a iwi (Mäori social studies) is at present being developed, and preparations are also under way for the development of Hangarau (Mäori technology).

"Parents, teachers and supporters of Mäori medium education can therefore be assured that instruction in te reo Mäori is a viable option for pupils throughout the compulsory education sector," Mr Creech said.
