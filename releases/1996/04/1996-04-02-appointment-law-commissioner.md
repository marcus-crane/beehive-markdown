The Minister of Justice, Hon D.A.M. Graham, today announced the appointment of Judge Margaret Lee as a Commissioner of the Law Commission for a term of three years.

Judge Lee is a District Court Judge based in Wellington. During 1991/92 she was a member of the joint working party which reviewed District Court rules.

Judge Lee chaired the Arohata District Prison Board from 1988 to 1989 and the Real Estate Agents Licensing Board from 1986 to 1987. She convened the Wellington Women Lawyers Association from 1985 to 1986 and she was a member of the NZ Council for Civil Liberties for two years from 1983.

The vacancy on the Law Commission arose from the resignation of the President, Sir Kenneth Keith, to take up an appointment as a Judge of the Appeal Court.

Hon Justice Wallace is Acting President of the Law Commission.
