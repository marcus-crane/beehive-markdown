The Cabinet has now approved the gazettal of the new Kahurangi National Park, the Minister of Conservation, Denis Marshall, said today.

"Gazettal has been delayed until the passage of the Conservation Amendment Act, which ensured protection of the Tasman Wilderness Area by carrying it over into the new park."

"Kahurangi is one of the largest unfragmented, protected areas of virtually unmodified landscape in New Zealand and fully warrants national park status," Mr Marshall said.

"There has been widespread public support for establishing a new national park in northwest Nelson for over ten years now."

"The Kahurangi National Park consists of extensive areas of native forest and limestone and marble landscape of international significance. Its large size and intact nature makes it an important habitat for native plants and animals, including the great spotted kiwi and the southern kaka."

"The new park, New Zealand's thirteenth, will also provide significant outdoor recreation opportunities ranging from tramping to caving and has great cultural and historic significance."

The Kahurangi National Park covers a total area of 452,000 hectares. Most of it is derived from the former North West Nelson Forest Park and extends from the base of Farewell Spit to the Buller River in the south.

Mr Marshall said the new park will include the area south of the Wangapeka River in the Buller region that was subject to litigation by Buller Electricity Ltd. The entire area of 79,981 hectares will be included in the national park.

"I have also decided to exclude the 28,000 hectare Taitapu Block. Although it has natural values that make it worthy of national park status, the area is subject to a claim taken to the Waitangi Tribunal by Ngati Rarua and Ngati Tama."

"However, the Department of Conservation will continue to manage this block for conservation purposes."

Mr Marshall is organising opening ceremonies for the park, which should take place in May, once the gazettal comes into effect. The Prime Minister, who is a keen tramper, has been invited to open the new park.
