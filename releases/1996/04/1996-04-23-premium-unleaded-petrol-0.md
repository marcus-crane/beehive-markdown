The Minister of Energy, Hon Doug Kidd, today welcomed the advice from the oil companies, the motor industry and Government agencies that, based on extensive tests and investigations, the new premium unleaded petrol can be used with the same confidence as other fuels.

"I am pleased to see that the 48 percent limit on total aromatics imposed by the Government and the 40 percent voluntary limit on toluene and/or xylene have been confirmed as appropriate precautionary measures", Mr Kidd said.

New Zealand is now one of only a handful of countries which regulates the total level of aromatics.

The Ministry of Commerce will continue to monitor the level of total and individual aromatics sold at petrol stations and in bulk storage and will release survey results from time to time.

"I think most of us have learned a great deal from the experience with introducing premium unleaded petrol", Mr Kidd said.

"In particular, companies introducing new products into the market have a clear responsibility to make sure the product is fully suitable for the New Zealand market and that the public are kept fully informed.

In essence it is now clear some initial shipments of the new petrol had risky levels of aromatics for the New Zealand car fleet and in particular one imported cargo contained excessive toluene. This should not have happened.

"At the same time, it has come into sharp focus that motorists should ensure their fuel system componentry is checked regularly and that only warranted and approved replacement parts are used. We must not forget that all petrol is hazardous, and should be treated accordingly at all times".
