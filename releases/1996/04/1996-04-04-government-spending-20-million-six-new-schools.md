Education Minister Wyatt Creech announced today that he has formally approved the establishment of three new primary schools from the beginning of next year. Two will be in Auckland ad the third in Tauranga.

This means that a total of six new schools costing just on $20 million will open their doors to more than 1500 primary school pupils at the beginning of 1997, Mr Creech said

This is in addition to the three-year programme now underway to establish fifteen new kura kaupapa Maori, he said.

The three latest new schools to receive official approval are at Spencer Road in Albany, Randwick Park in Manurewa, and Welcome Bay, in Tauranga. Earlier approvals were given for a primary school to be established next year at Point View North in Howick and for intermediates at Somerville Road, Howick, and Stanmore Bay on the Whangaparaoa Peninsula.

The first new schools in the programme opened at the beginning of this year at Papamoa, near Tauranga, and at Kohia Terrace, in Auckland.

The programme to provide new schools is now well established and these new schools are positive proof that we are catering for the areas of rapid population growth in both Auckland and the Bay of Plenty, Mr Creech said.

In each case, a programme of school and community consultation was being followed by the appointment of an establishment board of trustees. Preparation of the sites was already well under way, he said.
