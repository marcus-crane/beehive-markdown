Thank you for the invitation to be here to launch the Interactive Television Project today. This is my first official visit as Minister of Education to the Correspondence School, although deep in my past I was a student of this very school. It is good to be back. Today we launch a pilot project that is part of our general commitment to develop and encourage science and technologies in schools to complement the work of teachers. Over 100 schools will benefit from the lessons and technology and languages which will be delivered by the Interactive Satellite Television that we are launching here today.

It will enhance the teaching of languages particularly in rural schools, and in schools where there is no specialist language teacher. The Government has put $700,000 into this exciting project.

The Correspondence School is ideally suited to initiate this development. It will be able to use its extensive networks in education. It has experience in partnerships with other providers and a proven ability over many decades for delivering high quality education programmes.

Under this programme 18 schools in remote areas have been equipped with a satellite antennae. associated electronics and a receiver. 72 schools will receive programmes via the SKY Television network.

There will be many benefits to all students. But to those in remote areas it offers opportunities previously not contemplated as being available to them. By watching the programmes, these students can communicate with a central studio. They can ask questions and have them answered immediately. Despite the distance, each can be actively involved in the learning process.

Young people will become much more familiar with modern technology in an enjoyable and constructive way.

The classroom teacher and the television presenter will work together to help students to get the best value from the programmes. As well as assisting students with their learning, this new network will provide professional development for teachers and will benefit the wider community who wish to access it through SKY Television.

This new facility can also be used outside school hours by community organisations and other Government agencies. Social Welfare, Ambulance Services or the Police, for example, could use it for their own training needs.

In the past three years, the Ministry of Education has funded pilot projects such as the schools network using the Internet, audiographics and desktop composing. This Interactive Satellite Television Pilot project offers a further exciting teaching aid.

I am very pleased to be here this morning to launch what has to be a fore runner of major new developments in the education process in New Zealand.

Good luck for the future.
