Forestry Corporation's assets include 22 Crown Forestry Licences covering 188,000 hectares of exotic plantation forest land in the Bay of Plenty, together with processing plants at Waipa, Kaingaroa and Mount Maunganui. It also has a nursery at Te Ngae and a seed orchard in North Canterbury.

The corporation does not harvest any native trees.

Forestry Corporation is a major player in the New Zealand forest industry. It controls the country's largest sawmill, a modern log processing plant and is a leader in genetic development.

The corporation is an integrated operation with activities ranging from planting and growing forests through to harvesting, processing and marketing logs and lumber, both locally and internationally. At 31 December 1995, the book value of the Crown's equity in Forestry Corporation was $1.72 billion.

The corporation controls 12 per cent of New Zealand's commercial plantation forestry. It supplies 77 per cent of its annual radiata pine harvest to the domestic market. The land on which Forestry Corporation grows its trees is owned by the Crown and is leased to the corporation under Crown Forestry Licences. The corporation owns, manages and harvests trees on this land.

Currently, it annually harvests 2.6 million cubic metres of radiata pine, 250,000 cubic metres of Douglas fir and 250,000 cubic metres of minor species.

Harvesting is carried out on a sustained yield basis, with the corporation replanting each year the area that it harvests (currently 5,000 hectares annually).

The corporation produces approximately 200,000 cubic metres of lumber annually, representing 6.9 per cent of New Zealand's total production.

Major markets are New Zealand's domestic market, followed by Japan and Korea. The USA is a major market for processed product, with new processed markets being developed in Japan, Korea, Australia and South East Asia.

Forestry Corporation employs 750 people.
