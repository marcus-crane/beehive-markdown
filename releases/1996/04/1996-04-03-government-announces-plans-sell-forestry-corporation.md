The Crown's shares in Forestry Corporation of New Zealand Ltd will be offered for sale through an international tender process, Finance Minister Rt Hon Bill Birch said today. Forestry Corporation's principal assets are cutting rights to 188,000 hectares of exotic plantation forest land in the central North Island, principally Pinus Radiata and Douglas Fir the corporation does not harvest native timber.

Forestry Corporation does not own the land under these trees and the land will not be included in any sale.

"These trees were planted to be harvested. The Government wants to see significant new investment in further processing of wood in New Zealand. Sale will create the opportunity for more jobs for New Zealanders, increased export returns, and will ensure taxpayers get the most value from Forestry Corporation's forestry assets," Mr Birch said.

"After an intensive review and consultation process lasting six months, we have confirmed that a sale of Forestry Corporation, most probably to parties with international-scale forestry expertise, is the best way to achieve these goals."

Following extensive new private planting, Forestry Corporation now accounts for just 12 per cent of New Zealand's total planted forests and one third of the forests in the central North Island. At the current rate of planting around the country, new forests equivalent in size to Kaingaroa are being created every two years.

Mr Birch said that in the important central North Island region, investment in further processing was lagging behind because of uncertainties surrounding ownership of Forestry Corporation.

"Forestry Corporation and its predecessors such as the New Zealand Forest Service have shown themselves to be very good at planting and growing trees.

"However the corporation will benefit from access to the fullest possible range of world-class processing skills and technology, and international marketing and distribution networks, to maximise processing opportunities.

"Forestry Corporation currently exports around 33,000 truckloads of logs each year. Every truckload represents lost opportunities for New Zealand.

"New Zealand is a very good place for investment in further processing -- $265m was invested in 1994, the best year since records began in 1988. New highs are expected in 1996 and 1997.

"A sale will give the new owner, or owners, the certainty of wood supply needed before substantial funds can be committed to new processing, while at the same time ensuring taxpayers immediately receive the top price for the trees."

As part of the tender process, bidders will be asked to outline their processing plans. "We want to see bidders' processing plans, how they plan to use the wood and the implications of these plans for the communities in the central North Island," Mr Birch said. "Bidders will also be asked for their intentions on continuing to supply logs to local sawmillers and other wood processors.

"The successful buyer or buyers of Forestry Corporation will have to demonstrate their ability to manage and develop the corporation's assets.

"They will also be required to replant the trees after harvesting. The corporation's Crown forestry licences will be amended to include replanting requirements along the same lines used in the 1992 sale of New Zealand Timberlands Ltd."

Mr Birch said the Government's commercial advisors, SBC Warburg, had confirmed a strong level of interest in Forestry Corporation among potential bidders.

"The Government intends to get the best price for Forestry Corporation for the benefit of taxpayers. The buyer who pays the best price will also have the greatest incentive to add value to Forestry Corporation's wood crop.

"However, the Government does not have to sell. We will only sell Forestry Corporation if we are able to maximise its value, and we are confident that the sale will lead to investment in further processing and added value to the wood crop.

"Previous sales of Crown cutting rights have gone hand-in-hand with increased investment in further processing. For example, Rayonier NZ and Juken Nissho have between them invested, or plan to invest, around half a billion dollars in value-added processing since buying Crown cutting rights in 1990 and 1992.

"A typical sales process takes between four and five months. The proceeds of the sale will be used to repay foreign debt."

Preliminary information on Forestry Corporation will be provided shortly to prospective bidders. Parties with appropriate financial substance and reputation will then be invited to undertake their own "due diligence" examination of the corporation's assets before submitting their bids.

"The sale process has been structured to encourage the maximum level of buyer interest. As part of that, all parties will be treated equally. No preference will be given to any party," Mr Birch said.

"Local Maori have expressed strong support for a sale of Forestry Corporation. The Government is aware that they are interested in participating in the sale process, possibly by joining forces with other bidders.

"Maori will make the decision whether they want to be involved, and with whom. From the Government's perspective, Maori participation will be viewed on a strictly commercial basis, as part of an open, contestable process. The Government will not reserve a portion of shares for Maori."

Maori claims under the Treaty of Waitangi for any of the land on which Forestry Corporation trees are planted are protected by law and these claims will not be affected by a sale.

"The Government has no intention of changing the Treaty protection mechanism under the Crown Forest Assets Act," Mr Birch said.
