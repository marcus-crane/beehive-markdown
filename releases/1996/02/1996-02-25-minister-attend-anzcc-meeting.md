Minister of Defence, Paul East, leaves for Australia tomorrow (26 February) for the annual New Zealand-Australia Defence Ministers' talks.

The Australia-New Zealand Consultative Committee (ANZCC) meeting will be held in Canberra on the 27th and 28th February. The Ministers of Defence, Secretaries of Defence and Chiefs of Defence Forces will discuss a range of issues relating to closer defence relations (CDR) between the two countries.

While in Canberra Mr East will also address the Australian Institute of International Affairs. The topic of his speech will be "New Zealand and the Trans-Tasman Relationship: Future Policy Directions under the Coalition Government."

Mr East will also visit the Royal New Zealand Air Force No 2 Squadron which is based at the Royal Australian Naval Air Station Nowra, south of Sydney. The RNZAF provide jet aircraft for air defence training with the Royal Australian Navy under an arrangement called the Enhanced NOWRA Agreement.
