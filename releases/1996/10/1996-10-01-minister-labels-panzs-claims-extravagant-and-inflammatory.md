The Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, Hon D.A.M. Graham, said tonight the Crown is committed to preserving public access, conservation and recreation values when settling Treaty of Waitangi claims.

'Any settlement with Ngai Tahu will reflect that commitment,' he said.

Mr Graham said a Press Release issued today by Public Access New Zealand about negotiations between the Crown and Ngai Tahu is 'inaccurate in many respects, unhelpful and mischievous'.

'Mr Bruce Mason, who issued the statement, is trying to be as inflammatory as he can be with wild accusations which have no base in fact,' Mr Graham said.

'Mr Mason is one of several representatives of conservation and recreation groups the Crown brought together to brief on details of the proposed settlement with Ngai Tahu.

'He appeared happy with most of what he heard on Friday.

'Today, however, he has chosen to issue a statement which is extravagant and wrong in many respects.'

The Government is well aware of the concerns of the people Mr Mason claims to represent, Mr Graham said.

'Hundreds turned out for public meetings in Christchurch and Dunedin recently to hear Crown proposals relating to the Ngai Tahu claim.

'Those meetings and the constructive consultation that has taken place between conservation groups and Crown officials have helped the negotiations process and I thought helped put some of the more fanciful ideas emanating from some sectors to rest.

'Unfortunately, Mr Mason seems to seek a perpetual deferment of any decision making.

'This is unfair both to Ngai Tahu and all other South Islanders who wish to see the matter resolved fairly and justly and as soon as possible.'
