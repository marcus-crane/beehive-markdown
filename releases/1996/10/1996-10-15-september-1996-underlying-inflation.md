Finance Minister Rt Hon Bill Birch today welcomed improving underlying inflation figures for the September 1996 quarter.

"Underlying inflation of 0.33 per cent for the quarter and 2.34 per cent for the year was better than market, Government and Reserve Bank expectations.

"The quarterly result is consistent with the Reserve Bank's price stability target of 0 to 2 per cent and will improve public confidence in the ability of the Bank to achieve that target in the next 12 months.

"However, at this stage, underlying inflation still remains above the target band. I don't want to get over-excited about any single result.

What matters is maintaining progress over time.

"Price stability is the goal. By achieving and maintaining it, the Bank makes its best contribution to sustained economic growth."
