The Minister of Justice, Hon D.A.M. Graham, says a report released today by the Ministry of Justice shows that the judiciary is taking advantage of tough new provisions for sentencing and reparation.

The report Conviction and Sentencing of Offenders in New Zealand: 1986 to 1995 is the sixth in an annual series examining the trends in prosecutions and convictions and sentences imposed by the courts.

The report shows that the average length of the custodial sentences imposed for rape increased in both 1994 and 1995 to reach 7 years and 1 month in 1995.

'This is the highest figure in the decade under review,' Mr Graham says. 'In the period 1991 to 1993, rapists had sentences imposed of 5 years 11 months on average.

'The average length of custodial sentences imposed for unlawful sexual connection in 1995 of 4 years and 7 months was the highest since the offence was introduced in 1986.

'The Crimes Amendment Act (No. 3) 1993 increased the maximum penalty for both rape and unlawful sexual connection from 14 years to 20 years.

'I therefore expect the next report may show further increases in the length of custodial sentences.'

The total number of convictions for violent offences was higher in 1995 than in any other year in the past decade, although the increase in the number of violent offence convictions between 1994 and 1995 was the smallest increase in the 1990s.

Convictions for violent sex offences more than tripled over the decade, although the vast majority of this increase occurred between 1986 and 1993. Since 1993 there has been only a relatively small increase in convictions for violent sex offences.

Just over three-quarters of the convictions for a violent sex offence in 1995 involved a victim aged 16 years or less.

'This high proportion of charges in 1995, which involved young victims, was contributed to by the prosecution of a significant number of offences which occurred some time ago,' Mr Graham says.

'There were 232 convictions in 1995 which related to violent sex offences against young victims which occurred prior to 1980.'

There was a very large increase in convictions in the 'male assaults female' category between 1990 and 1994.

'This is partly a reflection of a change in police practice towards arrest and prosecution of the offender when attending domestic incidents,' he says.

The Criminal Justice Amendment Act 1993 gave the court greater powers to impose reparation during sentencing.

'While the proportion of all convicted property offences which resulted in a sentence of reparation changed very little between 1991 and 1993, there were increases in 1994 and 1995 following the changes to the law in late 1993,' Mr Graham says.

'The proportion increased from just under 20% in 1993 to a little over 22% in 1994 and then to just under 24% in 1995.

'For theft and fraud, there were small increases in the use of reparation in both 1994 and 1995.'
