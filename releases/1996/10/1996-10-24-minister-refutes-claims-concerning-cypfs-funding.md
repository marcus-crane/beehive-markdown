Social Welfare Minister Hon Peter Gresham has refuted claims by Labour's spokesperson Annette King that he has been unsuccessful in seeking funding for The Children, Young Persons and Their Families Service.

Mr Gresham says Annette King's been told but seems unable to grasp the fact that since 1993 to the current financial year he has been successful with obtaining Treasury approval to all of the funding increases requested for CYPFS by the Department for those years.

\`This was at a time when the fiscal environment was extremely competitive in the social needs area' said Mr Gresham.

\`Mrs King is simply using the record of difficulties that have been encountered during the course of the lengthy process of management reorganisation' said Mr Gresham.

\`It should also be noted that this year is the first time the Department of Social Welfare accounts have not been tagged in respect of The Children Young Persons and Their Families Service' said Mr Gresham.

\`The difficulties summarised in the Ombudsman's Report have been dealt with in a variety of ways and this is clarified in the contextual information details which was provided to Mrs King, but completely left out of her media statement' said Mr Gresham.
