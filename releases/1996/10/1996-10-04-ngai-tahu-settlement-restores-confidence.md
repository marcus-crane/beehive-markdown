The Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, Hon D.A.M. Graham, today announced that agreement had been reached on the Ngai Tahu Treaty of Waitangi claim.

It is intended that the Heads of Agreement to be signed in Wellington tomorrow morning will lead to a full and final settlement of the claim, he said.

This will, at last, bring certainty to the South Island.

For 150 years, many in the South Island have known of Ngai Tahus grievances and the claims for redress against the Crown.

This has caused a great deal of anxiety to many private land owners and to recreational users of the South Islands vast conservation lands.

Mr Graham said he was particularly pleased that the settlement will preserve and enhance public access rights and that anxieties private land owners have had will be removed by the settlement.

The settlement will also enable Ngai Tahu to play a full role in the South Island and to provide for the health, education and welfare of their own people in their own way.

Mr Graham said he believed the settlement was further evidence of the ability of the Government to settle Treaty claims fairly and within the parameters set by the Government.

It has been suggested that negotiations have been rushed, he said.

In fact, the grievances have existed for 150 years and negotiations have been going on for over five years.

The Government has been pleased to be able to respond to Ngai Tahus desire to reach a settlement if possible before the election to avoid all the uncertainties which may flow after the election.

Mr Graham said he wished to thank the Ngai Tahu negotiators for their patience and for the manner in which they carried out the negotiations.

The task has been extraordinarily difficult because of the detail and complexity of the issues involved, he said.

However we have been helped by the fact that the majority of New Zealanders support what we are trying to do and believe that the time has come to right the wrongs of the past.

Today is the beginning of a new era of co-operation between Ngai Tahu and the Crown which will be of benefit to every New Zealander, he said.
