The Crown will sell Christchurch's Wigram airbase to Ngai Tahu, which will keep most of it as an aviation estate, the Minister of Lands Denis Marshall announced today.

Ngai Tahu intends to lease two thirds of the land at Wigram to the Christchurch City Council, as a site for aviation related activities, including education and recreation. The council's commitment is subject to resource consent and commercial viability. Ngai Tahu will develop the rest of the land. However, the Crown will keep the museum site and the Wigram bequest land.

Mr Marshall and Ngai Tahu's Holding Corporation Chairman Sir Tipene O'Regan signed an Option to Purchase Agreement for Wigram today.

"At this stage the agreement is only an option to buy," Mr Marshall said. "Ngai Tahu has until the end of January 1997 to take the option up, and the deal is conditional on a lease being signed between Ngai Tahu and the city council."

"The current proposal is for the council to lease 180 hectares at Wigram for an aviation park for 10 years initially, with four rights of renewal of 10 years each."

"There has been a great deal of concern in Canterbury that Wigram would be lost to aviation. This deal will ensure that an airfield will remain on the site for at least 10 years and, provided it is commercially viable, for as long as 50 years."

Ngai Tahu will pay $18.56 million (GST inclusive) for Wigram. This value was set using a valuation methodology that calculates a 'highest and best' value for the land.

"An independent registered valuer checked the methodology and agreed it would ensure that the Crown would maximise its return on the property," Mr Marshall said.

Ngai Tahu's Holding Corporation Chairman Sir Tipene O'Regan said, "From the Ngai Tahu point of view Wigram is a 20 year development project. It secures a firm Ngai Tahu foothold in an important part of the South Island's regional economic infrastructure."

"The agreement seals a long-term relationship with the Christchurch City Council, which is one of our nation's most dynamic arms of local government. They are great people to do business with and we look forward to that relationship with a lot of optimism," Sir Tipene said.

Christchurch City Councillor Ron Wright, Chair of the council's Projects and Property Committee, said the council welcomed the sale of Wigram to Ngai Tahu as a way of ensuring the facilities stay available for an Aviation Estate for the people of Canterbury.

"Sixty four percent of the people surveyed in the 1996 Christchurch residents' survey indicated that they would like to see Wigram continue as an aviation site," Cr. Wright said.

And Councillor David Close, Chair of the council's Strategy and Resources Committee, said, "From the time Government announced the RNZAF was leaving Wigram, council has been concerned to retain and create jobs in the aviation industry. The proposal for Ngai Tahu to purchase Wigram and lease the airfield back to the Council offers the best opportunity yet to get real jobs at Wigram for Christchurch."
