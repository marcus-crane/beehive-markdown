The Brazilian Governments announcement that it is to open its first Embassy in New Zealand has been warmly welcomed by Foreign Minister Don McKinnon.

Im delighted to welcome the Brazilians here, he said.

Brazil is a huge and vital nation Brazil. And the decision to open an Embassy here underscores the growing strength of our relationship.

Brazils decision is also a tremendous boost to the Governments Focus Latin America programme which seeks to focus New Zealanders attention on our nearest neighbours to the east, he concluded.

Brazil is the worlds fifth largest country and the largest in Latin America. With two way trade topping $169 in the year to June it is emerging as one of New Zealands most important trade partners.

New Zealand recently signed an air services agreement with Brazil, the third country in Latin America to do so. Mr McKinnon said he hoped flights between the two countries would start soon offering improved transport links for business people and tourism.
