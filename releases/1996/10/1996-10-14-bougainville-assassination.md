The assassination of Premier Theodore Miriung has been described by Foreign Minister Don McKinnon as a major blow to hopes for peace on Bougainville.

Commenting on the killing on Saturday of the Bougainville Transitional Government Premier, Mr McKinnon said Mr Miriung was one person who could talk to all the parties involved.

He was a key player in the peace initiatives and his killing is an outrage.

I strongly urge all those involved to redouble their efforts to renew discussion and reach a peaceful settlement. As ever we are ready to help, he concluded.
