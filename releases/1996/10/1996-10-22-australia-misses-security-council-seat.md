Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said he very much regretted Australia failed to win a Security Council seat during the elections in New York this morning.

Not only do I feel for all those who worked so hard on the campaign but it also highlights the inappropriateness of the current regional groupings and the pressing need for reform of the Security Council.

In recent years the Asia Pacific has become an influential and legitimate regional grouping of countries.

With Australias missing out on a two-year term, a very strong voice for the region will not be heard, he said.

Mr McKinnon said he was pleased Japan won a seat and offered his congratulations.
