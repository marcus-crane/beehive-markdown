Children will be among the main beneficiaries of a $150,000 assistance package for typhoon victims in Viet Nam and Laos announced today by Foreign Minister Don McKinnon.

Northern Viet Nam and Laos have been hit by a succession of typhoons in recent months and heavy rainfall has led to extensive flooding.

Our Ambassador in Hanoi has reported widespread devastation. At least 45,000 houses have been destroyed and 400 people killed, Mr McKinnon said.

These two countries are among the poorest in Asia yet the estimated cost of damage amounts to over $420 million.

New Zealand will contribute $100,000 towards a UNICEF programme in Viet Nam which targets and health and education sectors. Special health kits will be supplied to address diarrheoeal diseases and malaria outbreaks. Damage to schools will be repaired and school equipment replaced. UNICEF will also assist children who have been orphaned.

In addition, $50,000 will be channelled through the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs to assist villages in Laos who have been left without shelter, food or warm clothing. This contribution will also be used to provide emergency health care and to restore damaged canals and dykes.
