New Zealanders visiting the Czech Republic will no longer need a visa following the Czech Governments announcement of a visa waiver arrangement today.

Foreign Minister Don McKinnon has warmly welcomed the initiative.

It means that from today New Zealanders can visit the Czech Republic for up to 90 days without worrying about a visa, he said.

New Zealand implemented a similar arrangement for Czech citizens earlier this month.
