A programme to increase the number of trained early childhood staff was announced today by the Associate Minister of Education, Bill English.

"More early childhood services are wanting to employ qualified staff to meet the Governments new quality standards. While these new standards are improving the quality of education and care, they have contributed to a shortage of trained early childhood workers," he said.

The 'pathways' programme provides the opportunity for people with partial qualifications to attain a Diploma of Teaching (Early Childhood Education). A number of the training programmes provided by private and voluntary providers will have given people the necessary 80 licensing points to be eligible to enter the programme.

"Getting more trained staff into the sector has been one of my priorities as Minister. I was able to give some urgency to an initiative started by my predecessor, John Luxton, and I am delighted that we are now seeing the results.

"High quality, accessible early childhood education and care is a goal of this Government and getting enough qualified staff is an important part of reaching that goal.

"Since the quality funding rate was introduced in March this year nearly 800 centres have employed staff with higher benchmark qualifications and met the quality standards set. Clearly more qualified staff need to be available so more centres can take advantage of the quality rate," said Mr English.

The programme starts on 1 January 1997. It is the equivalent of a full-time, one year course, but can be done part-time. Details of the new programme are being sent to all early childhood services, national organisations, and training providers.
