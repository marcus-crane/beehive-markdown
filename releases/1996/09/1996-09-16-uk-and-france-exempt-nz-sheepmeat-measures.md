New Zealand has gained exemptions for its sheepmeat and goat products from new United Kingdom and French measures against BSE (Mad Cow Disease) and scrapie.

Acting Minister for Trade Negotiations, Don McKinnon, and Minister of Agriculture, Dr Lockwood Smith say theyre delighted at the news.

The decision to exempt New Zealand sheepmeat is very welcome news for the New Zealand industry, Mr McKinnon said.

The exemptions came after intensive representations by Foreign Ministry and Agriculture Ministry officials to convince the UK and French authorities they should recognise New Zealands internationally-acknowledged status as free of BSE and scrapie.

The exemptions for New Zealand products should help safeguard our sheepmeat exports to those two countries, worth in total $487.4 million in the year to June 1996.

We are pleased and appreciate the fact both the UK and France have acted on sound scientific grounds to recognise New Zealands BSE- and scrapie-free status, and therefore to exempt products from New Zealand, Mr McKinnon said.

In the long term, the only satisfactory way countries can set policy on these potentially emotive human and animal health issues is on the basis of sound science.

Britain and France are taking separate and different measures against the diseases.

They are being taken in response to studies that show, under experimental conditions, parts of sheep may be able to be infected with BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy), and to speculation that BSE and scrapie in sheepmeat could affect humans.

The UK measures require that sheep and goat heads and any food derived from them not enter the animal or human food chain, and the French measures that spinal cord, eyes and brains be removed from sheep over 12 months old.

The European Union is still not considering EU-wide measures against BSE and scrapie in sheepmeats, and has not yet decided how to treat imports from third countries like New Zealand.

The New Zealand Ministry of Health is monitoring the European situation closely and will assess carefully the significance of the British and French decisions. Given that New Zealand is BSE- and scrapie-free, there is absolutely no reason for concern regarding New Zealand product.
