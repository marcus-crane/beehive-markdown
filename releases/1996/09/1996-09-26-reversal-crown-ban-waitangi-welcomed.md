The reversal of a recent decision to ban the Crown from Waitangi Day commemorations in the Far North has been welcomed by Deputy Prime Minister Don McKinnon.

Mr McKinnon, former co-chair of the Waitangi Day Organising Committee, said it was clear at the August hui that while the Crown was not wanted, and very strongly so, this was not everyone's view.

I am certainly very pleased to hear of this latest development, Mr McKinnon said.

He noted, however, that given the proximity of the general election, it would be inappropriate to respond in any detail.

The broad support of all political parties for the day is important and could not easily be obtained in the next two weeks. This will also give people time to reflect on any new proposals.

We naturally look forward to resolving the extent of the Crowns involvement in Waitangi Day commemorations after the election.

I believe the strong partnership between the Crown and Maori reflected in the Waitangi Day Organising Committee, incorporating the hard work of the local people, worked very well and was saddened when it was pushed aside.

Mr McKinnon said he would maintain a close interest in any further hui held to discuss next years events at Waitangi.
