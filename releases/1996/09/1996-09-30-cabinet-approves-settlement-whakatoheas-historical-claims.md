The Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, Hon D.A.M. Graham, said today Cabinet had approved a settlement of Whakatohea's historical claims for breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi particularly the confiscation of approximately 170,000 acres of land in the Bay of Plenty.

The Deed of Settlement will be signed in the Beehive's Banquet Hall at 9.00am tomorrow.

The grievances date back to actions begun by the Crown in Opotiki in 1865.

Whakatohea filed a claim to the Waitangi Tribunal in 1989. The Whakatohea Raupatu Negotiating Committee was mandated to negotiate a settlement on behalf of the tribe in 1994.

'Today's Cabinet approval is the culmination of a lot of hard work by the negotiating committee and Crown officials,' Mr Graham said.

'Whakatohea people are travelling to Wellington today for tomorrow's signing ceremony.

'Full details of the settlement will be released tomorrow to enable the tribe's negotiators to brief their people first,' he said.
