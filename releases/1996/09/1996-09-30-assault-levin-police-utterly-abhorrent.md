Acting Police Minister Don McKinnon said the vicious assault on two Levin police officers is utterly abhorrent.

That this should happen in small town New Zealand is totally unacceptable. It defies credibility that such brutality could be inflicted on two people who were simply doing their job.

My most heart felt sympathy goes out to them and their families.

I also extend my sympathy to the Levin community who will be feeling appalled and threatened by this crime. I want to reassure them the Police are doing all in their power to ensure this sort of horrifying incident doesn't happen again.

Mr McKinnon met the Commissioner of Police this morning to get an update on the officers conditions and ensure that everything possible was being done to apprehend the offenders.

Mr McKinnon is appealing to the public to come forward if they have any information, no matter how small.
