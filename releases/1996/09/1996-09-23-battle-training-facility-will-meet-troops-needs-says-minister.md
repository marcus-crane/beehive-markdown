"A new Special Air Service battle training facility planned for Hobsonville will be as good as, if not better than, the one currently located in Papakura," Minister of Defence Paul East said today.

Mr East was responding to the United Party's concerns that the planned new facility at Hobsonville would be inferior and should instead be built at Ardmore.

"I can assure United that the Hobsonville facility will be perfectly capable of meeting the current and future training needs of the SAS. In fact, based on the experience gained from using the facility at Papakura, the new building will include some modifications so that it is even more geared to the SAS's needs.

"The difficulty with Ardmore is that it is a considerable distance from the SAS compound in Hobsonville. It is far more practical and economical for the new facility to be based close to its main user," said Mr East.
