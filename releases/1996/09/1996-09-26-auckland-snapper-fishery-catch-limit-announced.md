The total catch level for the Auckland area snapper fishery for the 1996-97 year will be reset at 5,600 tonnes, with an allowance of 2600 tonnes for non commercial fishers and the Total Allowable Commercial Catch set at 3000 tonnes, Minister of Fisheries Hon Doug Kidd announced today.

While this is the same total allowable commercial catch announced by Mr Kidd last year, legal action taken by industry resulted in the level of commercial harvesting remaining at its 1994/5 level (4938 tonnes). Closure of the inner Hauraki Gulf to commercial fishing from 1 October to 31 March was also not able to be enforced due to legal action.

Mr Kidd said the legal action in relation to the quota reduction applied only to the 1995-96 season, and will not prevent this years TACC from being implemented.

The management decisions I made last year were based on an assessment that showed that the catch level in SNA 1 would not allow the fishery to rebuild and needed to be substantially reduced. I have considered submissions from industry outlining the significant implications and economic hardship to fishers that may result from a commercial catch of 3000 tonnes. However, I am of the firm view that a reduction in the commercial take is necessary to provide for the rebuilding of the snapper stocks, said Mr Kidd. I ask commercial fishers to take a long term view of their fishery, rather than concentrating on short term gain.

In addition to considering submissions from industry groups, Mr Kidd also considered submissions from recreational, environmental and Maori fisheries interests.

Additional funding of $584,000 has already been announced to provide additional enforcement resources to target illegal fishing activity. This money is funding a new compliance team in Auckland which is targetting high-grading and dumping in the fishery and aims to stamp out the black market in snapper.

The daily bag limit for recreational fishers will remain at nine. Recreational fishing compliance will be improved by increased funding to the Honorary Fishery Officer (HFO) network.

Mr Kidd said the results from research programmes commissioned in 1995 and 1996 will assist with providing information on the recreational catch of snapper. The research includes a recreational telephone/diary survey that will provide an estimate of the 1996 calendar year amateur catch of snapper.

Mr Kidd said that with the measures announced today the snapper biomass is predicted to have substantially rebuilt by 2005.
