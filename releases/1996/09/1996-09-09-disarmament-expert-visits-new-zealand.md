The Minister of Disarmament and Arms Control, Hon D.A.M. Graham, said today he hoped this week's visit by Professor Paul Rogers, Head of the Department of Peace Studies at the University of Bradford, would stimulate further discussion on peace and disarmament issues.

Professor Rogers' visit is sponsored by the Public Advisory Committee on Disarmament and Arms Control, which Mr Graham chairs, and funded by the Peace and Disarmament Education Trust.

'The New Zealand public has shown a great deal of interest in the issues that Professor Rogers specialises in,' he said.

'We are fortunate to have someone so well respected for his work on disarmament and global security visit this country.'

Professor Rogers will give seminars and attend meetings in Wellington, Christchurch and Auckland. He will speak on future prospects in the field of nuclear disarmament and the future for global security after the end of the Cold War.
