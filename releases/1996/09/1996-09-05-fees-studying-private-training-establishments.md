The Government has taken steps to give students more choice with their tertiary study by ensuring they have access to additional money for fees if studying at Private Training Establishments.

Education Minister Wyatt Creech announced today that the maximum a student could borrow for compulsory fees (such as tuition fees) at Private Training Establishments would move from $4,500 to $6,500 from next year.

"Many of the courses at the training establishments fill a gap left by other tertiary institutions. By lifting the amount which can be borrowed we hope to give more students more choice about where and what they study," Mr Creech said.

About 450 approved programmes are currently run by the Training Establishments - they cover the full spectrum of training from business, beauty therapy and computer courses through to pilot, bible colleges and massage therapy.

"Making another $2,000 available under the Student Loans Scheme will help students get into the courses, while still limiting the potential fiscal risk to the taxpayer against the high fees charged for some of the courses offered by the Private Training Establishments."

Mr Creech said the student loan policy is designed to lift the financial barriers to tertiary study.

"Making the loans available ensures those students considering tertiary study but who don't have the cash at the time aren't locked out of furthering their education."
