The Minister of Cultural Affairs, Hon D.A.M. Graham, today announced the appointment of Sir Robert Mahuta and David Gascoigne to the Board of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa for three-year terms.

Sue Wood has been re-appointed to the Board for three years.

Sir Robert is the Director of the Centre for Maori Studies and Research at the University of Waikato, a Commissioner of the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission and Chair of the Maori Development Corporation.

'Sir Robert is eminently qualified to assist the Board in fulfilling its statutory obligation to express and recognise the mana and significance of Maori, European and other major traditions and cultural heritages,' Mr Graham said.

Mr Gascoigne is a Trustee and Executive Chair of the NZ International Festival of the Arts Trust Board. He is a former Deputy Chair of the Queen Elizabeth 11 Arts Council, Chair of the NZ Film Commission, Member of the National Art Gallery Council and Member of the Board of Trustees of the National Art Gallery, Museum and War Memorial.

'Mr Gascoigne's broad experience of cultural-sector governance and his knowledge of cultural issues will be highly valuable assets to the Museum at the present crucial period in its development,' Mr Graham said.

Mrs Wood's professional background in public relations and management had enabled her to provide valuable advice to the Board in these areas, he said.

Sir Robert and Mr Gascoigne replace Professor Athol Mann and Georgina Te Heuheu whose terms of appointment expire on 1 October.

Mr Graham thanked Professor Mann and Mrs Te Heuheu for their commitment and contribution to the Museum during their terms as Board Members.

'The Museum has benefited greatly from your experience and judgement,' he told them.
