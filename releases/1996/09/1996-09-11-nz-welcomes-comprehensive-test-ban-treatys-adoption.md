The Minister for Disarmament and Arms Control, Hon D.A.M. Graham, today welcomed the news that the United Nations had adopted the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

'The adoption and opening for signature of the CTBT demonstrates the international community's desire to definitively end the nuclear arms race,' Mr Graham said.

'It also contributes in a decisive manner to the battle against the proliferation of nuclear arms.'

Mr Graham said today's vote in New York was the result of intensive efforts over the past few weeks.

'We were disappointed when the treaty failed to be adopted by the Conference on Disarmament, as a result of blocking by India.

'But we were determined that this would not mean losing this historic opportunity to bring an end to nuclear testing for all time.

'Australia took the lead, with strong support from New Zealand, to have the text submitted directly to the UN General Assembly. Today's decision vindicates that approach.

'The task now will be to secure signature and ratification of the treaty by as many countries as possible, specially the 44 states including India whose ratification is needed for entry into force.

'Even though the vote in New York was an overwhelming 158 in favour, three countries voted against it and there were five abstentions.

'One of the three, India, has since said it will never sign the treaty so clearly entry into force will be a difficult process.

'However, we do have a commitment from the five nuclear weapon states to cease testing which in itself is a cause to celebrate.'
