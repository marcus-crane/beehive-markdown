Discussions will continue with kindergarten associations to find a way of resolving the current dispute over pay for kindergarten teachers, Associate Minister of Education Bill English said today.

"The Government has listened to the kindergarten associations and understands their need to give kindergarten teachers a pay increase. The package we have put forward includes a significant amount of money for the associations. The differences of opinion are over the conditions under which they will accept the money.

"The reason the funding increase is tied to the number of sessions is that this is the fairest way of injecting more money into kindergartens without disadvantaging the 70 percent of children who attend other kinds of early childhood services.

"We have to maintain a degree of equity and consistency of funding across the early childhood education sector."

Mr English said the majority of kindergarten associations had indicated they wanted the option of running more sessions, but would also like an increase in the per child per hour funding rate.

"We are going to continue discussions with them. The Government wants to find a way through this which will allow kindergarten associations to meet their financial concerns as well as deal with the pay round," said Mr English.
