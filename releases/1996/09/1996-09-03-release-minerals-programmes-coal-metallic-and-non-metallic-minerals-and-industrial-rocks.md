The Minister of Energy, Hon Doug Kidd, today gave public notification of the revised Draft Minerals Programme for Coal and the revised Draft Minerals Programme for Minerals (other than coal and petroleum).

These programmes outline the policies, procedures and provisions to be applied in respect of the management of Crown owned coal, metallic and non-metallic minerals and industrial rocks and building stones.

Mr Kidd said that late last year submissions on the initial Draft Minerals Programmes for Coal, Metallic and Non-Metallic Minerals and Industrial Rocks and Building Stones were invited as part of an extensive public consultation process.

I have considered matters raised in the submissions and, as a result, changes have been incorporated in the revised drafts, said Mr Kidd.

In response to submissions from industry that the Draft Minerals Programmes for Metallic and Non-Metallic Minerals and Industrial Rocks and Building Stones should be combined, a revised Draft Minerals Programme for Minerals (other than coal and petroleum) has been prepared.

The revised Draft Minerals Programmes for Coal and the revised Draft Minerals Programme for Minerals (other than coal and petroleum). Crown specify the permit allocation and royalty regime to apply in respect of Crown-owned coal, metallic and non-metallic minerals and industrial rocks and building stones.

They incorporate a decision made by the Government to agree to requests from iwi to exclude Mokoia Island; the Lake Rotoiti and Lake Okataina Scenic Reserves; Mt Taranaki and the Puakai, Pukeiti and Kaitake Ranges; part of Ngati Tamatea Tutahi lands near Rotorua; and all Crown land in the Muriwai-Moehau-Waiaro Blocks from the operation of the Minerals Programmes for Coal and minerals (other than coal and petroleum).

The revised Draft Minerals Programme for Minerals (other than coal and petroleum) also includes a decision by the Government to preclude the primary prospecting, exploration and mining of uranium and thorium, consistent with the Governments non-nuclear policy.

The revised Draft Minerals Programme for Coal and the revised Draft Minerals Programme for Minerals (other than coal and petroleum) will be issued as the Minerals Programme for Coal and the Minerals Programme for Minerals (other than coal and petroleum) respectively. Public notification will be given of the issuing of the Minerals Programmes and where copies may be inspected or purchased.
