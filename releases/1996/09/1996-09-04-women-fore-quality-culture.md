The most significant and pleasing feature of this years Business Development Quality Awards is the number of women who are either recipients of awards or are driving the quality culture within their organisation, Business Development Minister Roger Maxwell said at the national awards ceremony in the Beehive tonight.

The second feature of this years awards is the standard of applications is the highest ever. Although the threshold for assessment of the national awards is the highest it has been in their four year existence, it is pleasing to note the range of organisations, by both type and size, which were able to successfully nominate and meet these demanding standards.

Indeed the gap between the six finalists was so narrow that this year two organisations are the recipients of the 1996 national Business Development Quality Awards - Mountain Air and Netway Communications, Mr Maxwell said.

The Air New Zealand, ASB Bank and Toyota New Zealand sponsored BDQA programme achieves two objectives - the education of organisations in best business practice and assessment against internationally recognised criteria.

The rigorous assessment and feedback process allows every applicant to learn how they are performing and what they need to do to improve. The value of this process to the applicants is reflected in the fact that many of this years 117 entries were applying for the second, third or even fourth time, Mr Maxwell said.

The two national award winners both use the seven principles of total quality management as the basis of operating and improving their businesses.

It is also rewarding to note, that international visitors of standing in the field of quality never fail to be impressed with the high standards New Zealand achieves in so many spheres of endeavour. There is no doubt that this awards programme is materially contributing to New Zealands international competitiveness.

My vision as Minister of Business Development is for New Zealand to be recognised as the quality centre of the world. The Business Development Quality Awards are playing their part in making this vision a reality, Mr Maxwell said.
