New Zealand Firsts policy of having no limit on the amount of compensation for Treaty of Waitangi claims is not only stupid but is a cruel hoax, Finance Minister Rt Hon Bill Birch said today.

Mr Peters is lifting Maori expectations of compensation that are simply not affordable - would he borrow the money to settle claims or take it from other New Zealanders by cutting health or education or superannuation funding?

This promise of no cap on settlements on top of Tau Henares demand that all land now in the hands of the Crown should be returned to Maori should set warning bells ringing for all New Zealanders.

These policies are not credible. They would destroy our economic prospects, cost jobs and undermine all the current social policy programmes.

New Zealand First is also talking about spending more money on funding the Waitangi Tribunal and on setting up more bureaucracies for Maori.

These policies would undermine the wide support for the settlement process and the present negotiations.

Once again Mr Peters has picked a particular audience and made up a policy to try and woo that group.

When he was in Invercargill talking to a Greypower audience last week, he told them that their power company should not go to Ngai Tahu to try and settle its claims.

Those very people from Greypower who support Mr Peters should start to worry about how much will be left for their super with NZ First policies, Mr Birch said.
