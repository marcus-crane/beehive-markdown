Agriculture Minister Lockwood Smith and Environment Minister Simon Upton have agreed that RCD should be released in Australia but stress their decision has no bearing on whether or not it will be introduced here.

Dr Smith and Mr Upton had intended to abstain from the vote on the grounds that the decision should be made solely by Australian ministers as it concerns an entirely Australian domestic matter. New Zealand has its own, completely separate, process for deciding whether to introduce RCD on this side of the Tasman.

However, Australian officials have advised of a legal anomaly which requires a unanimous decision of all Agricultural and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand (ARMCANZ) ministers to allow the introduction of RCD in Australia, even though the decision has no impact on New Zealand. This anomaly arises from the fact that legislation predated New Zealands admission as a full member of ARMCANZ. The Australian officials further advised that an abstention by New Zealand, even if all Australian ministers agree, would not constitute a unanimous decision.

Therefore, Dr Smith and Mr Upton have decided to agree to the introduction of RCD in Australia so as not to be in the position of having a power of veto over an Australian matter.

Dr Smith's and Mr Upton's decision has no impact on whether or not RCD will be introduced in New Zealand. They have made it clear to the Australians that their decision was made solely to avoid having a power of veto over an Australian domestic matter and was not based on any consideration of the scientific evidence presented by the Australians.

In their letter to Australian Primary Industries and Energy Minister John Anderson, Dr Smith and Mr Upton asked that Australia give consideration to ensuring that, in future, New Zealand ministers are not put in the position of having a veto over Australian domestic policy matters.
