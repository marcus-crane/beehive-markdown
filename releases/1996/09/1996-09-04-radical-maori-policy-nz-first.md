The Minister of Maori Affairs, Hon John Luxton today expressed concern over NZ First's Maori policy which is advocating a return to the failed policies of racial separatism.

"Separatism has failed in the past and NZ First's policy of establishing separate Maori agencies to deal exclusively with Maori education, Maori health, Maori development and Maori employment and training, is an unacceptable approach which will only divide society," said Mr Luxton.

"NZ First's policy is a recipe for failure as shown by previous government approaches to Maori policy under the old Department of Maori Affairs. It only served to sideline Maori aspirations.

"The Government's mainstream policies have given Maori a major input into our policies and we have been achieving very successful results since 1990, in all of the areas NZ First wants to promote separatism. This interestingly is a reversal of the policies implemented by Winston Peters as Minister of Maori Affairs six years ago," said the Minister

"Mainstream departments are able to deliver services in ways which are specific to the needs of Maori communities.

"The NZ First policy is also to have no limit to taxpayer funding of Treaty of Waitangi Settlements which is a clear support of Deputy NZ First Leader Tau Henare's demands that "All land now in the hands of the Crown should be returned to Maori".

"These radical policies should be of concern to all New Zealanders and although they may see NZ First gain some votes in the five Maori electorates, they will certainly be at the expense of a loss of NZ First Grey Power supporters," concluded Mr Luxton.
