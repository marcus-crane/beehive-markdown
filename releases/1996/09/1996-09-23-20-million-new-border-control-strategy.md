The Government will spend $19.9 million over the next three years on a new border control strategy to protect New Zealand's environment and primary industries from hazards such as fruitfly, Agriculture Minister Lockwood Smith announced today

"New Zealand received a clear warning with this year's fruitfly scare, which had the potential to put at risk our $1.4 billion horticulture industry and which will have cost taxpayers $6,627,000 by the middle of next year," Dr Smith said.

"I'm pleased to be able to announce this new strategy today which will substantially reduce the risk of future importations of fruitfly and other hazards. It will protect our horticulture industry from pests like fruitfly, our livestock industries from diseases such as foot and mouth, our forestry estate from a vast array of exotic pests, and New Zealand's unique biological environment as a whole.

"The funds for the new strategy are only available because of National's sensible economic management over the last six years which has led to sustained economic growth, the elimination of our net public foreign debt and budget surpluses."

Dr Smith said the strategy would ensure that as the tourism industry expanded it would not jeopardise other vitally important industries.

He said that 2.6 million passengers entered New Zealand last year and significant further growth was anticipated. Passengers from Asian countries were expected to increase 15% per annum and by 7% per annum from the rest of the world.

"This presents a massive challenge to our border control services. In the last financial year alone, almost 11.5 tonnes of fruit and vegetable material was seized at the border of which 4.8 tonnes was undeclared."

The new Border Control Strategy has three components:

1\. approximately $16.5 million over three years for the imminent installation and ongoing staffing of 7 high-tech X-ray machines at Auckland International Airport (4 machines), the International Mail centre in Auckland (1 machine), Wellington International Airport (1 machine) and Christchurch International Airport (1 machine)

2\. a $2 million boost over three years to the quarantine detector dog programme allowing for 5 teams to be based in Auckland, 3 at the International Mail Centre, 2 at Wellington International Airport and 4 at Christchurch International Airport. These teams will also be used at regional international airports such as Hamilton, Palmerston North, Dunedin and Queenstown

3\. approximately $500,000 for an upgraded multi-lingual, multi-media awareness programme. The programme will include:

· a new inflight video, able to be played in a variety of languages, informing passengers of New Zealand's agriculture security laws, the consequences of breaking them and the screening procedures they will encounter at airports

· new passenger declaration forms in a wider variety of languages

· improved signs and amnesty bins, and the broadcasting of videos, in international airport arrival halls

· immediate and long-term public awareness campaigns, and the provision of improved information to staff in New Zealand's international posts

"With the introduction of this integrated strategy, we can be confident that the chances of having another fruitfly or similar scare are massively reduced," Dr Smith said. However, he stressed that the highest level of success depended on MAF's quarantine service, the tourism industry, airlines and airport companies working as a team. Each would have to play a part in educating passengers.

The aim of the strategy was to enable people from all countries to be informed about the risks to New Zealand, the risks of being caught with illegal material and the size of the penalties.

"Our message to travellers is clear: welcome to New Zealand, but if you are bringing illegal material into New Zealand you will be caught by our state of the art technology and you will face fines of up to $100,000 and fives years in jail."

Dr Smith said New Zealand welcomed tourism and was keen to see it expand. Every effort would be put into ensuring smooth passenger facilitation without risking biosecurity. He said he was confident passengers would not be unduly delayed.

"We will never be able to guarantee a 100% detection rate, and no country can without banning trade and tourism, but this new strategy will give us an 80% plus detection rate which will put New Zealand up with the best in the world," Dr Smith concluded.
