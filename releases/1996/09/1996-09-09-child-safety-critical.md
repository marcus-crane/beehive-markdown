"Prevention of injury to children is the responsibility of all New Zealanders" said Katherine O'Regan, Minister of Consumer Affairs, today.

Supporting Kidsafe Week, is a national programme to raise child safety awareness. Mrs O'Regan said that each year over 100 children die from unintentional injury and over 15 thousand are hospitalised.

"Any death is one too many, and any injury is unacceptable" she said.

Mrs O'Regan said "The Ministry of Consumer Affairs continually investigates complaints or reports about unsafe products. About one third of the complaints each year are about products which affect children."

The Ministry works with suppliers to improve the safety of the product. This approach is usually enough to rectify the situation.

"As a measure of last resort, I have the power to order the recall or banning of a product which is unsafe" said Mrs O'Regan.
