Associate Minister of Education Bill English said today he was surprised that Auckland kindergarten teachers had turned down the pay offer from their association.

"The offer made to Auckland kindergarten teachers was very generous. It is difficult to see how this issue can be resolved if the teachers turn down an offer of this size.

"Head Teachers would receive an increase of at least 14.8% or $4,788. The starting salary for qualified teachers would increase by 8.6% and for teachers with a degree by 10.3%. The rates offered are comparable to, and in some cases better than, similar levels in the primary sector. In addition, all teachers were offered an extra weeks' annual leave and health insurance," said Mr English.

"Kindergartens are only one of a number of providers in the early childhood sector and there is demand for qualified staff across the sector. The Auckland Kindergarten Association offer goes a long way towards preventing qualified staff moving to jobs in other parts of the sector.

"I do not accept that an increase in teacher contact time with the children will reduce the quality of education and care provided. Other services meet the same quality standards as kindergartens with little or no non-contact time each day.

"The NZEI is keen to achieve parity with primary teachers, who teach 394 half days per year compared to 320 currently in kindergartens.

"The Governments offer to kindergarten associations is linked to an increase in the number of sessions because this is the fairest way to inject more money into kindergartens without disadvantaging the children who attend other early childhood services.

"Kindergartens are already funded on a higher rate than other types of early childhood services," said Mr English.
