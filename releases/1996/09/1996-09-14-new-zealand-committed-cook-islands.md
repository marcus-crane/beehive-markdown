New Zealand and the Cook Island people have a unique and special relationship which both are deeply committed to.

Pacific Island Affairs Minister Don McKinnon expressed this sentiment at a large gathering of the Cook Island community in Mangere to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the Birds of Paradise Dance Troupe.

The Birds of Paradise team are a wonderful example of the sort of success, in business and entertainment, Cook Islands people are achieving, Mr McKinnon said.

Cook Islands Consul General, Bill Teariki, top National Party list member Arthur Anae, Opposition spokesperson for Pacific Island Affairs, Taito Phillip Field and High Commissioner designate to the Cook Islands, James Kember also attended the celebration.

Mr McKinnon said he rated New Zealands relationship with the Cook Islands and its people as one of the most important in the Pacific.

He acknowledged that the Cook Islands have recently taken some tough decisions and commended steps they have made towards putting the Cook Islands back on a firm economic footing.

Radical reform is now well under way and it will require guts, determination and clear thinking to see it through. The commitment the Cook Islands people have shown to its success is admirable, he said.

The reform programme is also supported by the Asian Development Bank in cooperation with New Zealand overseas aid assistance.

Our Cook Islands aid programme has a very practical focus and we are keen to be involved and assist with the development of private sector initiatives, especially those in tourism and horticulture.

Mr McKinnon also focused on New Zealand based Cook Islanders.

Cook Island New Zealanders have a real role to play in our community, he said.

He encouraged those at the gathering to seriously consider playing a pro-active part in education, employment and health initiatives, either in their immediate neighbourhood or at a national level.

Mr McKinnon noted particularly how tremendously important it is for Cook Island young people to strive for high educational achievement.

Stay at school and aim for the top, he said.

This doesnt necessarily mean heading to university. There are all sorts of opportunities available now where formal recognition is given for skills attained in areas like social welfare, and the trades, in tourism and in recreational and sporting pursuits.

Mr McKinnon also took the opportunity to introduce High Commissioner designate, Dr James Kember to the New Zealand Cook Island community. Dr Kember gave an address in the Cook Islands language.

High on the National Party list, successful Pacific Island travel agent Arthur Anae was also introduced to the gathering by Mr McKinnon.
