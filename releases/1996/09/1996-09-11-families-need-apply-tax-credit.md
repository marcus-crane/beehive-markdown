Employers have a role to play in ensuring that people in work are getting what they are entitled to from the tax cuts and social assistance programme, Finance Minister Rt Hon Bill Birch said today.

"While the tax cuts have flowed through automatically to pay-packets, it has come to my attention while visiting workplaces that many people with children are not aware they can now receive the Independent Family Tax Credit.

"I have written to the Employers Federation asking if it can draw this matter to its members' attention. I will also be talking to Top Tier sector leaders about this today."  
The Independent Family Tax Credit is a significant part of the tax reductions for low- and  
middle-income working people with families. It provides a tax reduction equivalent to $15 per child for dependent children of working families.

The credit, like the overall tax reductions, has been introduced in two stages, half on 1 July 1996 and the remaining half on 1 July 1997.

The full amount of the IFTC is available to working families with incomes up to $20,000 per year and is then gradually reduced for those on higher incomes.

For a working family with three dependent children on $35,000 the total take-home gain from the tax reductions, Independent Family Tax Credit and Family Support is $52 per week now ($2704 a year), increasing to $98 per week from next July ($5096 a year).

"Treasury advise me that 19% of people (28,400) have so far applied for the tax credit. It was estimated that 150,000 families would be eligible for it.  
"The tax cuts were designed to give the greatest benefit to low- and middle-income working families.

"It would be very unfortunate if these families were not accessing the cash benefits immediately because they were unaware of them.

"While Inland Revenue sent a booklet to all households informing people of the changes under the tax cuts, some people are still unaware of their entitlement. That is why it has been important to talk to employers.

"Inland Revenue is also planning to put out more publicity material on the IFTC.  
"The IFTC is available immediately and is accessed by applying to the local Inland Revenue Department. It is paid directly into the primary carers' bank account by the IRD.  
"For those who have not already applied, the credit can also be paid via tax refunds at the end of the income year."
