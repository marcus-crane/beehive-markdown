The Minister of Justice, Hon D.A.M. Graham, said today that the two Whangarei Judges under investigation for irregularities involving travel claims have agreed to stand aside from sitting while the investigation continues.

They are Judge Martin Beattie and Judge Robert Hesketh.

Mr Graham said he is seeking further information on the allegations after receiving a report he called for from Mr John Upton QC.

There would be no further comment on the matter until late next week when the next stage of the investigation is expected to be completed.
