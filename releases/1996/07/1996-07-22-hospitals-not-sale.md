New Zealands hospitals are not for sale, Crown Health Enterprises Minister Bill English said today.

Mr English said the claim by the Association of Salaried Medical Specialists that the Government planned to privatise provincial hospitals after the election was just electioneering.

"Everyone would be better informed if the Association was honest about which party it supports, so we can see its statements for the rubbish they are.

"The Government has no intention of selling hospitals that we need for our public health system".

"The Association has been making these same claims about privatisation for about five years. I am surprised they are still getting a hearing on this one."

Mr English said a report of the Social Services Committee, which was tabled in Parliament last week, accurately reflected his view that it was possible that some Crown health enterprises may amalgamate in the future.

"I have said before that I doubt whether there will be 23 CHEs in five years time".

"Privatisation has not got anything to do with it. The issue here is about services and how they are best provided," he said.
