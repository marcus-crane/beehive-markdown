New Zealand First's export policy would do nothing for farmers other than make them pay higher interest rates, Agriculture Minister Lockwood Smith said today.

"Peters says he would control inflation by keeping it below the level of our trading partners while spending up large on the demands of Wellington lobby groups.

"That would mean a return to the massive interest rates we saw in the mid-1980s when Labour tried to do the same thing. 90 Day Bank Bills went well above 25% and overnight interest rates went over 100%.

"Peters' policies would mean many farmers would be driven off their land."

Dr Smith said that the rest of the policy was based on the assumption that the answer to difficulties in exporting lay in Wellington, through expanding bureaucracies, and setting up new ones.

"The last thing we need is to employ more highly-paid, so-called experts in Wellington to tell farmers and exporters what to do. We already know what needs to be done to improve our marketing effort, and I am providing the leadership to see that the establishment responds," Dr Smith concluded.
