In releasing a press statement on the workload of the Employment Tribunal, Opposition labour relations spokesman Steve Maharey has demonstrated his lack of understanding of the current industrial relations environment, Minister of Labour Hon Doug Kidd said today.

Mr Maharey's statement that the increase in the number of applications to the Employment Tribunal since 1992 represents a growing phenomenon of worker abuse is a distortion of the real situation.

The Employment Contracts Act represented a landmark in industrial relations legislation, as it deliberately opened up access to effective grievance procedures to all employees, rather than restricting this right to union members.

The increase in applications to the Tribunal actually reflects the growing awareness of employment rights by the workers of New Zealand, and their ability to exercise them under the Employment Contracts Act, said Mr Kidd.

While 4,800 applications were made to the Employment Tribunal in 1995, this represents only a very small fraction - 0.2% - of the total employed workforce. Moreover, this figure does not take into account the fact that a large number of cases are withdrawn before a hearing, most often because the employer and employee are able to come to an agreement themselves. The majority of applications are settled in mediation, an informal and effective method of resolution which allows employees and employers to resolve their own disputes and own the solution.

This reflects the intent of the Employment Contracts Act - the ability for employees and employers to negotiate their own contracts, and to settle any differences between themselves. The Employment Tribunals mediation role facilitates this ability, while difficult cases can be settled in adjudication.

The Employment Contracts Act has enhanced workers rights through better access to personal grievance resolution procedures. It co-exists with a strong minimum code of employment rights which ensures workers are protected from exploitation. Since the enactment of the Employment Contracts Act, employment has increased, unemployment has fallen, wages and salaries have increased, and the economy has grown.

The workload of the Employment Tribunal is constantly monitored to ensure it is able to maintain an effective and efficient level of service.

Prior to the Employment Contracts Act half the workforce was denied access to grievance procedures by law because they weren't union members. Now that all workers have access to grievance procedures it should surprise no-one that the numbers have increased.

The Department of Labour is playing a key role through its freephone and other services in promoting an awareness of employees rights which will increase the number able to utilise Employment Tribunal.
