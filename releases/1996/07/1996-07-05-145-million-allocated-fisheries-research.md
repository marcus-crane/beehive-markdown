The Minister of Fisheries, Hon Doug Kidd, announced today a total funding of $14.5 million for fisheries research projects for the 1996/97 fishing year.  
In addition to the $14.5 million ($15.8 million last year), two additional funding streams are available for fisheries research in 1996/97. These are $998,000 (up from $827,000 the previous year) through the Conservation Services Levy for research on the impacts of fishing on protected species of seabirds and marine mammals and $1.1 million through FoRST for research on the impact of fishing and diseases on the sustainability of the marine environment.

This years research includes development work on deep water acoustic stock assessment equipment that will lead to much higher quality data on important deepwater species than has been possible using past techniques. This equipment will be used next year to carry out a complete survey of the Chatham Rise orange roughy and  
oreo dory fisheries, said Mr Kidd.

Both the development of the new time series survey to estimate the abundance of juvenile kawhai and the continuation of research on all northern snapper are important to environmental, recreational and industry interests.

The key concern is that robust research data is gathered on the population status of New Zealands fish stocks so that sound management decisions can be made on sustainable catch levels, said Mr Kidd. I am aware that more information is required for approximately half of New Zealands largest fisheries, however, I am also aware that research already underway or in the pipeline will address some of these  
concerns, he said.

Mr Kidd said the aim would be to establish multi-year programmes for fisheries research to support strategic research priorities. These priorities would be developed through consultation with stakeholder groups before final decisions on specific research projects and funding were made. Meetings towards that end are already underway.

Without pre-determining the results of consultation for 1997/98, present indications are that fisheries research funding could be as high as $18 million that year, he said.  
I am committed to ensuring fisheries research capacity is maintained by developing realistic research strategies which ultimately allow us to make appropriate decisions on the ongoing sustainability of New Zealands fish stocks, concluded the Minister.
