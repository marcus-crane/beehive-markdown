The Government has decided to develop energy efficiency legislation providing for the introduction of minimum energy performance standards for some categories of appliances and equipment.

When announcing the decision today the Minister of Energy, the Hon Doug Kidd, said it was an important part of the Governments overall strategy for improving energy use in New Zealand, and would bring benefits to onsumers, the economy and the environment.

Consumers will benefit through the lower energy costs of more efficient appliances and equipment. The economy will benefit through lower energy costs to businesses and reduced pressure for construction of new energy generation projects. And the environment will benefit through lower CO2 emissions, which will also help New Zealand in terms of our international commitments on climate change.

The Minister said that officials had calculated the net national economic benefits of the standards which would reach $70 million over 15 years, and that the reduction in CO2 emissions would be more than 1 million tonnes over the same period.

Initially energy performance standards are likely to be introduced for domestic electric storage hot water cylinders, fluorescent lamps and fluorescent ballasts for office lighting. More anlaysis into the possible introduction of standards for electric motors and domestic refrigerators and freezers will also be undertaken.

Once the standards are in force, these products will be required to meet or exceed minimum levels of energy efficiency before they can be sold in New Zealand. The standards will not apply to existing installations of ppliances and equipment.

We expect that consumers will still enjoy a wide choice of models for each product type, but that the least energy efficient and most obsolete technologies will be knocked out of the market, said Mr Kidd.

This is not a decision which the Government has taken lightly. It is only being taken after exhaustive analysis, consultation and review by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) to ensure it is the most appropriate course of action, said Mr Kidd.

The Minister also indicated that the standards would be developed in full consultation with the relevant industries, and that appropriate lead times would be provided before implementation to allow suppliers to quit existing stocks of non-complying product.

Such standards are also becoming increasingly established internationally, he said. Australia, for example, has decided to implement minimum energy performance standards for domestic refrigerators and electric storage water heaters and is investigating their development for electric motors, fluorescent ballasts and unit air conditioners, Mr Kidd said. New Zealand officials will work closely with their Australian counterparts to achieve harmonisation of standards between our two countries where possible.
