More than 8,000 hectares of high country Otago land with nationally significant conservation values is to be returned to Crown control, the Minister of Lands, Denis Marshall, said today.

Centred on the Old Man Range near Alexandra, the land is part of Earnscleugh Station, one of Otago's largest pastoral lease properties.

In a tenure review deal signed recently, around two thirds of the Earnscleugh Station (16,600 ha) will be freeholded, while the balance (8,060 ha), mostly the higher altitude land, will be managed by the Department of Conservation for its natural, recreation and historic values.

"It's the largest deal completed so far under the tenure review process in Otago, and it provides benefits for both the lessees and for conservation," Mr Marshall said.

The review involved extensive consultation with public interest groups and the lessee.

"There are several exciting outcomes for the Earnscleugh deal. For a start, some of the country's most significant high-altitude tussock grasslands, herbfields and wetlands will be returned to public management and protection. At the same time access for the public will be secured, and the lessees will be able to get on with the business of sustainably managing the lower-altitude country."

"Earnscleugh is renowned as a producer of premier fine wool, but it has had a hard time keeping rabbits under control in recent years and needs to diversify," Mr Marshall said.

"Of key conservation importance are the Old Man Range tops, Frazer Basin and Omeo Creek headwaters, where habitats are diverse and several uncommon plant communities are found. On lower country, two species of endangered flightless chafer beetle and a number of threatened plants will enjoy protection. Important historic goldmining sites will also be protected."

"As a result of this deal, there will be a corridor of conservation land stretching along the summit crest of the Old Man Range and adjoining Old Woman Range. The deal provides for covenants over certain areas of the freehold. One covenant protects landscape features over part of the station's Obelisk block, while another ensures public access for winter recreation, notably cross-country skiing, over part of the Ewe and Frenchman blocks."

Public access across the remaining freehold areas will be catered for by easements allowing foot and mountain bike access.

"On the flip side of the coin, special leases will be issued over two of the areas to be transferred to the Department of Conservation," Mr Marshall said. "These leases will allow for ongoing use of the land for grazing provided that monitoring of the vegetation indicates that there are no adverse effects."

"The tenure review is the result of extensive consultation by the Land Resources Division of Knight Frank (NZ) Limited and the Department of Conservation with interested parties, and lengthy negotiations with the principal partner in Earnscleugh Station, Mr Alistair Campbell. The resulting deal will provide a clear focus for meeting conservation and production objectives," Mr Marshall said.
