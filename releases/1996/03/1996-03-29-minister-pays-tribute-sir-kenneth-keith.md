The Minister of Justice, Hon D.A.M. Graham, today paid tribute to Sir Kenneth Keith for his outstanding services as President of the Law Commission.

Sir Kenneth has resigned from the Commission to take up his appointment as a Judge of the Court of Appeal from Monday.

He is a former Professor of Law at Victoria University and has had a distinguished academic career.

Sir Kenneth has been a Member of the Law Commission since 1986 and President from 1991.

Mr Graham said Sir Kenneths distinguished and unique career involving national and international issues will serve him well in his new position.

He was a member of the New Zealand legal team in the nuclear testing cases against France before the International Court of Justice in 1973/74 and 1995.

He was also a member of the three-person Presidential Commission of Inquiry set up by the President of Sri Lanka to inquire into and report on the explosion at Araly Point in 1992/93.

He has been a Judge of the Western Samoan and Cook Islands Courts of Appeal since 1982 and a Judge of the Niue Court of Appeal since 1985.

In addition to an impressive list of formal appointments, Sir Kenneth has been involved in wide range of constitutional issues and a number of assignments on the range and scope of New Zealand legislation and statutes, Mr Graham said.

His contribution to the constitutional policy making process has been profound and of considerable assistance to Governments over the years.

Sir Kenneth has been an outstanding Member and President of the Law Commission and his appointment to the Court of Appeal is deserved and timely.
