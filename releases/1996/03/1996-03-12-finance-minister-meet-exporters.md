Finance Minister Bill Birch today invited representatives of leading exporter organisations to meet him on Thursday this week to discuss means of achieving growth without compromising the 0-2% inflation target.

Mr Birch said his invitation followed a joint press release last night from Federated Farmers, the Forest Owners Association, the Manufacturers Federation and the Tourist Industry Association.

Exporters are in the front line of the nations growth effort. They are necessarily more exposed than the non-tradeable sector to international economic fluctuations.

Exchange rates recently have hurt their profitability. I can readily appreciate their concern that monetary policy should be adequately supported by a full range of other policies which help to achieve economic growth without compromising the 0-2% inflation target.

I thought last nights statement was impressive. It showed comprehensive grasp of the strategic issues involved in growth, and sought to make genuinely constructive suggestions to assist non-inflationary growth.

I have therefore taken the initiative this morning to invite them to meet me for an hour on Thursday this week, so that we can exchange ideas and develop an improved consensus on policy, Mr Birch said.
