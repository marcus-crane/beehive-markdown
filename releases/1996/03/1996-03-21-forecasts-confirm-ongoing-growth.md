Reserve Bank forecasts released today confirm that New Zealanders can continue to expect strong economic growth, high levels of business investment, rising employment and low inflation, Finance Minister Rt Hon Bill Birch said today.

"The forecasts also confirm that the Government's tax reduction and social policy programme is sustainable, even though the Reserve Bank is picking somewhat weaker economic growth than the Treasury's December forecasts."
