"Consideration is being given to the establishment of a new youth justice centre for Auckland," Social Welfare Minister, Hon Peter Gresham, said today.

The Minister made his announcement following a meeting with the combined Mayors of Auckland to discuss the issue of youth justice and care and protection facilities for the greater Auckland area.

The new centre would house a Youth Court, residential remand and secure facilities, youth aid, community constable, and youth justice coordinators all on the one site.

"There is still work to be done on the proposal, which involves the departments of Social Welfare, Police and Courts, but it is already clear that there could be significant advantages in terms of more effective coordination and the efficient provision of youth justice services if some of the services of Police, Courts and the Children and Young Persons Service can be co-located," said Mr Gresham.

"The new centre would result in the removal of youth justice services from the current Northern Residential Centre at Weymouth. The Northern Residential Centre could then be redeveloped as an upgraded Care and Protection Unit capable of providing a range of special therapeutic programmes.

"Work is now underway under the Resource Management Act to identify suitable sites for the new youth justice centre.

"We have the opportunity to solve problems relating to restricted use of the Northern Residential Centre by separating out the youth justice services and upgrading the existing facility to become a front runner in the delivery of care and protection programmes.

"Resource considerations, site selection, community consultation and planning approvals are likely to take twelve months before the project can proceed further," said Mr Gresham.
