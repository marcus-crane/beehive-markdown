"Surfing the Internet for career information may eventually become a reality in New Zealand if a Government-initiated project is successful," said Minister of Education and Employment Wyatt Creech today in announcing the start of a feasibility project which aims to put career information on the Internet. ."The Internet project aims to make career information more widely available, more easily accessible by putting updated information about careers onto the Internet. The information will be more accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date. The project will be aimed at unemployed people, school students and people on the Training Opportunities Programme," Mr Creech said.

The pilot project is due to begin immediately by investigating people's career information needs, and deciding how feasible and useful it will be to have this information on the Internet. Organisations which have relevant career information will be encouraged to make this available through the Internet.

Access to the Internet is becoming more widely available through schools and public libraries. If the project takes off, the information could also be accessible at local offices of the NZ Employment Service.

Representatives from Government education and employment agencies are involved in the pilot project, being conducted by the Careers Service and a subsidiary of Victoria university called Victoria Link, and will be completed in December 1996.

"Depending on the results of this first stage, the Internet project will be fully developed in 1997," Mr Creech said. The system will be developed progressively over three years.

The project is at the pilot stage for a year, where testing and market information will be gathered about how appropriate, feasible and useful it will be to have this information on the Internet for the people who need it.
