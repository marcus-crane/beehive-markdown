Environmental Externalities, the third in the series of Land Transport Pricing Study discussion papers, was released today by the Minister of Transport, Maurice Williamson.

For the first time we have a preliminary indication of the real magnitude of the costs imposed on the environment each year by road users, Mr Williamson said.

The paper examines four major areas of environmental impacts - noise pollution, air quality, water quality and greenhouse gases.

Mr Williamson said that the findings presented in the paper suggested that further research and monitoring was needed to understand fully the nature and costs of the environmental impacts of road transport.

Air pollution appears to be the area where there is the greatest need to improve on current knowledge.

Initial estimates of the environmental impact costs of road use are:

- Noise - annual costs estimated to range from $230 million to $2,650 million with a best estimate of $290 million.
- Air Pollution - annual costs estimated to be $700 million, most of which relates to exhaust particles;
- Water - annual costs estimated to range from $35 million to $170 million with a best estimate of $100 million.
- Greenhouse Gases - annual costs estimated to range from $25 million to $580 million with a best estimate of $290 million.

I stress that the results presented in this paper are preliminary. Environmental Externaities is not intended to provide policy options, but to continue consultation with the transport industry over our future land transport system, Mr Williamson said.

Todays release follows the publication of two earlier discussion papers, The Cost of Roading Infrastructure in July 1995, and Roading as an Economic Good in December.

The Land Transport Pricing Study breaks new ground internationally by pioneering an understanding of the issues which need to be considered in developing future transport networks. It comprises a wide ranging review of land transport services designed to support New Zealands goal of a safe sustainable transport system at reasonable cost.

Key issues and policy options arising from the Land Transport Pricing Study will be addressed through the release of a further discussion paper once all submissions have been considered, Mr Williamson said.

This will provide further opportunity for input before any decisions are made.

The closing date for submissions on the Environmental Externalities discussion paper is 30 June 1996.
