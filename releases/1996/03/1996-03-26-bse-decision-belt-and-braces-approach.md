The Government is taking a "belt and braces" approach to BSE by temporarily suspending imports of bovine semen and embryos from Britain as well as banning imports of beef products, according to Rangitikei MP, Denis Marshall.

Mr Marshall, who is also Associate Minister of Agriculture, said that the risk of introducing bovine spongiform encephalopathy (or mad cow disease) has not increased since the announcement from Britain that several people who died of the rare brain disease, Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, may have caught it from eating beef.

"The research points very strongly to the fact cattle can only catch BSE from contaminated feed. There has never been a case of BSE being transmitted from a cow to her calf in utero."

"BSE has only ever been found in the brains and the top of the spinal cord in cattle. With most cattle viscera having to be dumped, rather than going into the food chain, the chances of anyone catching BSE from British beef - even if it is possible - are negligible."

"Given the current concern, however, it is prudent to temporarily suspend imports of bovine genetic material while new evidence is assessed."

The Government has set up an independent scientific panel to review the latest information as it becomes available. It will operate in consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture and advise the Government on all scientific issues concerning BSE.

The members of the panel are:

- Professor Colin Wilks (Professor of Veterinary Pathology, Massey University)
- Professor John Markbrook (Professor of Molecular Medicine, Auckland University)
- Professor David Skegg (Professor of Preventative and Social Medicine, Otago University)
- Professor Barry Scott (Professor of Molecular Genetics, Massey University)
- Dr Paul Atkinson (General Manager,Animal Health Division, AgResearch)
- Dr Peter Fennessy (General Manager, Sheep, Deer and Equine Division, AgResearch)

"It is important that New Zealand makes a considered assessment of the risks of BSE, and bases it response on science, not emotion."

"The British Government has not handled this issue well. It has had two Ministers singing different songs. This has led to confusion and fear among the public."

"New Zealanders need to be assured that the Government is taking all the appropriate measures to ensure their safety."
