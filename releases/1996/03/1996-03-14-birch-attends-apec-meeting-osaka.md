Finance Minister Rt Hon Bill Birch will attend the APEC Finance Ministers meeting in Osaka, Japan, on 16th and 17th of March.

Mr Birch will reiterate New Zealands support for implementation of the Bogor declaration.

APEC is now the fastest growing region in the world, Mr Birch said. Its important that the liberalisation of trade and investment in the region is matched by stable economic policies.

The APEC Finance Ministers Meeting was established by the APEC Economic Leaders in Seattle, November 1993, to consult on broad economic issues.

At the conclusion of the APEC meeting, Mr Birch will meet with business groups in Kyoto on Monday, and Tokyo on Tuesday.

The meetings include a speech to the Kankeiren (Federation of Kansai Economic Regions) on New Zealands economic reforms, and an engagement with the Japan/New Zealand Diet Members League.

Mr Birch will return to New Zealand on Wednesday morning.
