"Consumers will soon have better access to Disputes Tribunals" says the Minister of Consumer Affairs, Katherine O'Regan. "Government has made improvements to the Disputes Tribunals which will benefit all those with small level disputes"

The improvements stem impart from a Review of the Operation of Disputes Tribunal from a Consumer Perspective, carried out by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs in 1994. Following that review, the then Department of Justice began examining the way in which they could improve the efficiency and accessibility of the Tribunals.

The two main changes relate to the type of complaints the Tribunal can hear. The amount of the dispute will be increased from $3000 to $5000 (and from $5000 to $10 000 if both parties agree to the higher amount). "It is commonly thought that to take action in the District Court a dispute must be at least $12 000 for it to be financially viable, this change will lessen the gap between Disputes Tribunals action and District Court action. It also brings the monetary limit more in line with similar tribunals internationally."

The Tribunal will also be able to hear disputes about hire purchase agreements and credit contracts that were previously excluded from the Tribunal's jurisdiction. "This is a significant change as consumers with some credit disputes currently have very limited means of redress open to them through the Courts."

"Access to redress is one of the internationally recognised World Consumer Rights. Disputes Tribunals are the most important forum for ensuring access to effective redress for consumers. They are a cheap, informal and relatively quick method of dispute resolution." said Katherine O'Regan. "These changes will ensure that consumers have improved access to this forum for redress."
