Job seekers who have been out of work for longer than four years can now benefit from a new programme being phased in by the New Zealand Employment Service.

Employment Minister, Wyatt Creech said today that the programme, called Job Connection, has been introduced in five locations around the country, and will be fully operational by July.

"Job Connection was one of the initiatives the Government announced in October last year as part of its response to the Employment Task Force recommendations. It aims to give those job seekers who have been out of work for a very long time a helping hand into sustainable, paid work," said Mr Creech.

"There are some very altruistic employers out in the labour market, who recognise that, given a supportive environment where people can take time to re-establish their work habits and upgrade their skills, the long-term unemployed can become valuable contributors to the workplace. Job Connection makes this possible, with financial assistance to those employers."

The first Job Connection participants started work at the end of February and to date, nineteen people have commenced work.

"The first job seekers to benefit from the new programme have been out of work for between four and ten years. This is a significant opportunity for these people to break the cycle of unemployment, in a fully supportive manner," Mr Creech said.

"Employers involved at this stage include several from the private sector, two community trusts and a school, offering a variety of employment opportunities, for example manufacturing, clerical work, computer programming, landscaping, tree planting and road maintenance."

Job Connection is currently being trialed by employment centres in Whangarei, Gisborne, New Plymouth, Lower Hutt and Invercargill. The aim of the trial is to establish operational procedure and to ensure that the right support mechanisms are in place for job seekers and employers before the programme expands nationwide in the new financial year.
