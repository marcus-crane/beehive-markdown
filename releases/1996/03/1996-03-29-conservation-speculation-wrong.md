Reports that Treasury and senior Ministers are blocking funding for the Department of Conservation are incorrect, Finance Minister Rt Hon Bill Birch said today.

"The Government allocates taxpayers resources by evaluating expenditure proposals against competing claims from priority areas including health, education, conservation, environment, and targeting the needs of families. "These priorities have been well foreshadowed in the Governments publications New Opportunities and the Budget Policy Statement released last month. "This process is now well advanced and details will be released as usual in the Budget in May.

"The evaluation will reflect the high value given to conservation matters. "The desperate comments by opposition parties and others over the funding needs of the environment and conservation issues simply demonstrates the ad hoc, capricious way in which they approach government spending.

"This Government has high regard for conservation and environmental values and this will be reflected in the allocation of resources in this years Budget."
