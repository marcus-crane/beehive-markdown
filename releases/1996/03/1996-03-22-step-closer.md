The establishment of joint Australia/New Zealand food standards came a step closer yesterday.

The Hon Katherine O'Regan, Associate Minister of Health and Winsome McCaughey, the Chairperson of the Australian National Food Authority, signed an agreement to set up a joint Australia New Zealand Food Authority Office in Wellington.

"This office, which I hope to be in operation in July, will provide an on-the-spot service to New Zealand food manufacturers and producers who wish to export new products to Australia. It will greatly help our trade in food products at a time when trading between our two countries is around $1 billion per annum," said Mrs O'Regan.

The new arrangements will continue to ensure that public health and safety in food matters are not compromised.

"With the establishment of a New Zealand office and amendments to the Food Act, which I expect to be in place at the same time, this country will have removed much of the frustration and legal barriers that have hindered trade in food products for many years."

"I look forward to an increasingly productive working relationship between our two countries which will benefit both."
