The Government has clarified the list of UK derived beef products which are temporarily suspended for importation, Health Minister Jenny Shipley and Agriculture Minister Lockwood Smith announced today.

In order to avoid confusion amongst consumers about the products which have been suspended, the Director-General of the Ministry of Health will be recommending to retailers what products should be removed from shelves. These products are scheduled in the Director-General of Healths's statement, which has been released to the public.

The New Zealand move follows a similar move by the Australian Government and is in response to a decision of the European Commission's Standing Veterinary Committee to ban the export of UK beef and all food products derived from UK beef.

"While the risk from these products is low, the government believes that until further clarification is obtained from the European Commissions Standing Veterinary Committee and the World Health Organisation, this step will ensure New Zealand consumers are fully protected from any risk."

"Officials and ministers will continue to monitor information emerging from overseas and will keep the public well-informed of any developments," the ministers said.

New Zealand does not import any fresh or frozen UK beef.
