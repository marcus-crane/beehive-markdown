The Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, Hon D.A.M. Graham, today announced an extension to the deadline for submissions on the Crowns policy proposals on Treaty claims relating to public works acquisitions.

The Office of Treaty Settlements will now accept submissions up till April 7, 1996. The previous deadline was February 28.

Mr Graham said the proposals had attracted a great deal of interest and the extension was in response to a number of requests for more time to respond.

'Given the complexity and importance of the issues involved in public works acquisitions, I would not wish anyone miss out on the opportunity to express their views because of time pressures.

'I have therefore agreed to a six-week extension,' he said.
