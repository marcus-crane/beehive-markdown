New Zealanders need to be very careful when conducting business using the new electronic technology, said Katherine O'Regan, Minister of Consumer Affairs, today.

Its appropriate on World Consumer Rights Day to consider the changes in the market place that are occurring, said Mrs O'Regan. And its appropriate that consumers look closely at both how they can benefit from this and at the same time make sure they are not disadvantaged. Unfortunately the explosion of new technology has seen increasing opportunities for rip-offs and scams.

Mrs ORegan said the Ministry has already looked closely at EFT POS and made representations to the banking industry.

And the Ministry is currently reviewing the Door to Door Sales Act to see if it still provides appropriate consumer protection now that so much selling is done through tele-marketing.

Security of personal information, particularly of financial details is vital, said Mrs ORegan. She stresses that consumers should never give anyone their Personal Identification Numbers (PIN) and should take every precaution to avoid anyone seeing them key the number in.

Consumers also need to take every care when providing details of their credit card or bank account numbers, particularly if they are being supplied to an overseas trader.

Mrs ORegan also warns consumers that when they purchase from overseas, they are not protected by New Zealand consumer law. They should always check where the trader is before buying.

The electronic age may well make life easier, but it also provides the opportunities for unscrupulous merchants to take advantage of the unwary consumer, said Mrs ORegan.

The challenge of the future will be to ensure consumer protection keeps abreast of the latest technological advances.
