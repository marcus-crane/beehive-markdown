Kokako in the "mainland island" reserve of Mapara in Waikato have doubled in numbers in the past four years, the Minister of Conservation, Denis Marshall, said today.

At least 86 adults have been counted in an official census and many others have been sighted by the Conservation Department staff. Seventeen chicks are also known to have fledged in the reserve this year.

"Fifty five chicks successfully fledged in last years baby boom and there are now bands of 'teenagers' roaming the forest," Mr Marshall said.

The department has been actively managing the reserve with pest control operations and a habitat restoration programme.

In Northland all known kokako nests were protected by conservation staff with each producing one or more chicks, while at Mangatutu another new "mainland island" site in Waikato, of six pairs, three definitely fledged chicks and two more pairs are suspected of producing chicks.

"The Northland chick population was particularly pleasing as the species was considered to be close to regional extinction only two years ago," Mr Marshall said.

"The intensive protection by the department is proving to be a winner for the recovery of the bird throughout the country."

"The success in the past couple of seasons show that with effort and resources a good return on investment is made."

The kokako work being undertaken by the department is also supported by State Insurance, which sponsors the kokako recovery plan.

Fewer than 2,000 of the blue wattled songbird survive in New Zealand, in a few locations in the North Island and on predator-free off-shore island.

Predation of adults and chicks by rats, possums and cats is now the main threat to their survival.
