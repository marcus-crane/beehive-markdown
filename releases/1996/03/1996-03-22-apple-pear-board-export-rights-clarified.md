The Associate Minister of Agriculture, Denis Marshall, has clarified the Apple and Pear Board's rights to export produce other than apples and pears.

"In recent months there has been some concern, and complaints, from other exporters that the Board has been exporting other products without proper authority," Mr Marshall said.

"The new approvals clearly restrict the involvement of the Board and its subsidiaries in marketing other fruits or vegetables."

Following an application from the Board for export consents in August last year, the Government and the Board have been reviewing the Board's powers under the New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Act 1971.

"The Board accepted the Government's interpretation and amended its application for export consents for a range of products to various markets. I have issued these as new consents, subject to strict conditions," Mr Marshall said.

Under these conditions the Board: - must supply a formal resolution that it can handle, transport, store, treat, export, market and dispose of other fresh fruit and vegetables conveniently in conjunction with the acquisition, export and marketing of apples and pears; - can only export as an agent; - must have in place systems to account to growers for each product, and; - must report to the Minister of Agriculture each year on proposed export volumes for the next year and what it exported in the previous year.

Some of the new consents are for products for which the Board did not hold consents. These will come into effect immediately.

The Minister has also issued new approvals for products for which the Board did hold consents. The old consents will be revoked from 30 June 1996, and the new ones will come into effect the following day.

Mr Marshall has also immediately revoked approvals for a range of products the Board no longer wanted to export.

All approvals will last for five years.
