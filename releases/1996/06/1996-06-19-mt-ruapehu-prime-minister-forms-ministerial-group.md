The Prime Minister, Rt Hon Jim Bolger, today formed a Ministerial Group to monitor developments at Mt Ruapehu.

Mr Bolger said the formation of the group resulted not so much from a concern about the current level of activity as a wish to ensure that the Government is ready to react should activity worsen.

The ad hoc group will be headed by Hon John Banks (Minister of Civil Defence and Tourism) and will include Hon Dr Lockwood Smith (Minister of Agriculture), Hon Simon Upton (Minister of Science and Conservation) and Hon Bill English (Minister of CHEs).

Mr Bolger said the group would be supported by a small team of senior officials who will consider day-to-day activities such as risk analysis, public safety, health, co-ordination and civil defence.
