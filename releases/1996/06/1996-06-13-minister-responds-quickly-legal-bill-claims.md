Social Welfare Minister Peter Gresham has responded quickly to claims by Labour 's Annette King to her suggestion that the Children and Young Persons' Service is facing a huge legal bill of more than 10 million dollars.

Mr Gresham says these are legal claims that have been lodged in the last four or five years but many are historical in nature, and some involve events as long as 30 years ago. Some cases involve allegations of abuse while they were in care.

The Minister says its today's more open environment about abuse issues which have brought forward such historical claims, and Mr Gresham also comments that many are unproven and many more are settled for a lot less than earlier claimed.

It's a ten million dollar contingency liability, involving sixty six cases, and includes some staff personal grievance matters.

The Minister commented that provision has been made in the Social Welfare accounts for what is considered an appropriate figure in respect to these claims.

Mr Gresham says it needs to be seen in the long context of time and the relevancy of the sheer magnitude, volume, and complexity of work that goes back as far as the original Child Welfare Department, to the Social Welfare Department and the current Children and Young Persons' Service.

Mr Gresham says the Opposition's spokesperson Annette King should have taken some early advice from the Minister before acting foolishly on this issue
