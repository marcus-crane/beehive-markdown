"I have met with the Chair and Chief Executive of Housing New Zealand today to discuss allegations that the company has increased rentals for existing tenants as they have been brought into the Home Leasing programme."

"The Chair and Chief Executive have now investigated the matter and ascertained that the facts of the two cases referred to by Mr Goff are substantially as he has outlined them. It is apparent that a number of other tenants, possibly 30 or 40, are similarly affected."

"Housing New Zealand will be contacting these tenants directly."

"Procedural changes have been made which I am satisfied will ensure that there is no repetition of this problem. With regard to those tenants who are affected, the company is urgently exploring its options. Housing New Zealand has undertaken to complete this process before the proposed rent increases take effect."
