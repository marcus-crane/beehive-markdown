The Government today announced the sale of its 49.9 per cent shareholding in the Maori Development Corporation Limited (MDC). After consultation with other shareholders and the company, the Crown sold its 13 million shares back to the company. The sale price was $20.93 million.

Minister of Finance Rt Hon Bill Birch said the Crown, other shareholders and MDC had been involved in lengthy discussions on the future of its shares in the company."We are pleased that this long standing matter has been resolved and that all shareholders are happy with the deal," said Mr Birch.

The Crown has also decided to make available a grant of $7.6 million to the Poutama Trust, subject to it providing an acceptable business plan and consulting with the major pan-Maori organisaions. Mr Birch said the grant reflected the Government's continuing commitment to Maori economic development.

The Poutama Trust was established in July 1988, under the Charitable Trusts Act, to support Maori business development. The trust administers study grants and management support grants. The trustees appointed by the Crown comprise Colin Knox (chair), Jim Brown, Wira Gardiner, Stan Keepa and Rangimarie Parata.The MDC was established on 1 July 1987 following review of the status of economic development within Maoridom by the Maori Economic Development Commission.

The Crown's original role as shareholder was to help establish the MDC and encourage the participation of corporate shareholders. In this respect, the Crown shareholding was seen as an initial seeding, with the Crown withdrawing at some unspecified point in the future. Prior to the sale, shareholders in MDC were the Crown (49.9 per cent), Taharoa C Block (34.7 percent), the Tainui Maori Trust Board (7.7 per cent) and the Poutama Trust Board (7.7 per cent).The sale of the Crown's shareholding in MDC was finalised on June 17. Since then, the Government has  
agreed to make available the grant to the Poutama Trust.
