The Minister of Maori Affairs, the Hon John Luxton met with Taranaki Maori at Parliament today to discuss the Waitangi Tribunal report on Taranaki claims released this morning.

"I welcome this interim report on Taranaki claims and I hope that others will take the opportunity to read the report's overview which outlines the history of the main aspects of the Taranaki claims. The report describes the real and present day effect of our shared history, demonstrating why Treaty claims need to be addressed," said Mr Luxton.

"The Tribunal's report is part of the process for seeking resolution to the grievances of Taranaki Maori. Much of the way in which Taranaki was settled is already part of New Zealand's historical record, however the report has identified in specific terms, the impact the settlement process had on Taranaki tribes.

"The Tribunal's report provides the basis for Government and Taranaki Maori to recognise and to resolve as best we can, the differences, grievances and wrongs of the past so that we might focus on developing the future together," said Mr Luxton.

"The Government has been working steadily towards finding ways to negotiate with Maori over Treaty of Waitangi grievances. There is no doubt, as outlined in this report, that actions in the past, have disadvantaged Maori. We want to reach satisfactory settlements to ensure that Maori have the opportunity to develop economically and socially.

"The process to be followed now, is for Government to consider the report and to assess how to facilitate dialogue with the Taranaki claimants. The report has established a foundation for such dialogue and for negotiations to move forward between Taranaki claimants and the Crown," the Minister stated. "The next steps for the Treaty settlement process are the responsibility of my colleague, the Hon Douglas  
Graham, Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations.

"I would like to extend my thanks to the Waitangi Tribunal for its hard work in the preparation of this important report. I know that the Tribunal has conducted hearings over along period of time and have undertaken a considerable amount of research to complete the report and make its recommendations," concluded Mr Luxton.
