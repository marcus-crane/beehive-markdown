The Government has approved a new residential services strategy to cater for children and young people who for a variety of reasons need to be in 24 hour care for a period of time.

"The new strategy has four main points," Hon Peter Gresham, Minister of Social Welfare, said. "It proposes that therapeutic units will be established for young people with sexual behaviour problems and for children and young people with special needs. Secondly, there should be a total separation of Youth Justice and Care and Protection residential facilities and campuses. Thirdly, Youth Justice residences should be shifted, wherever possible, to locations that have a non-residential zoning and finally, a range of alternative management systems for residences will be developed. These may include, for example, a mix of departmental residential facilities and those managed on behalf of the Director-General of Social Welfare by other groups.

"The new strategy takes into account the varying needs of children and young people to be placed in appropriate care. The number, nature and purpose of residential facilities has changed over time and is now complemented by a considerable quantity of accommodation provided by community groups under contract to the New Zealand Community Funding Agency. "This strategy should be seen as a part of the total care continuum which has been putin place over recent months. This includes the recently let contracts for specialist programmes for young people with the most serious sexual behaviour and children with specialist needs, many new initiatives and additional funding.

All of these developments will mean that social workers will have a much more comprehensive range of interventions available to them.

"The five departmental residences run by the Children, Young Persons and Their Families Service are no longer appropriately configured to cope with current demands and needs. It simply is no longer tenable to run large multi-purpose residences and so we are adopting a very positive approach to overcome the current difficulties and to deliver the necessary services in an improved manner.

"The strategy envisages some increase in overall bed numbers, primarily through an increase in small specialist units providing highly tailored programmes which have been shown overseas to pay off in terms of reducing offending and other problems experienced by clients in adult life. While details of the number of beds at individual locations are not yet certain, it is expected that overall numbers will increase by around 50%.

"The new strategy cannot be put in place overnight, however. It will take several years to come to full fruition. Residents and neighbours of the current residences should, nevertheless, be pleased with the components of the strategy and the intention to move youth justice services out of residential zones.

"Implementation of the strategy will commence with the proposal to establish a new Youth Justice Centre for Auckland, the building of a unit for young people with sexual behaviour problems in Christchurch and a ten bed unit for children and young people with a need for specialist therapeutic programmes in Auckland.

"Work is underway in Auckland to identify alternative sites for the proposed new Youth Justice Centre. Officials are also commencing negotiations with the Northern Residential Centre Residents Group and community leaders about the redevelopment of the Centre as a Care and Protection facility which would include the provision of therapeutic programmes for children and young people with special needs. Successful negotiations would allow decisions to be made on disposing of land at the centre which would be surplus to requirements.

"Further implementation of the overall strategy will take place progressively over the next two to three years, bearing in mind the requirements of the Resource Management Act and the need for consultation and thorough scrutiny of potential sites," Mr Gresham said.
