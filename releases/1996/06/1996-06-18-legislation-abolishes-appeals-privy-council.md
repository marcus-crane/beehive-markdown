The Minister of Justice, Hon D.A.M. Graham, today introduced the New Zealand Courts Structure Bill which provides that the Court of Appeal is the final appellate court in New Zealand. The Bill abolishes the right of appeal to the Privy Council from any judgment of any court in New Zealand.

Mr Graham said the legislation increases the number of Appeal Court judges from six to seven and creates two divisions - a civil division and a criminal division.

'Cases of significant importance, however, can be heard from the full Court of Appeal which will consist of at least five permanent judges.'

Mr Graham said the Bill will be sent to the Justice and Law Reform Select Committee to enable those who wished to make submissions to do so. It is not intended that the Bill will be passed prior to the General Election.

'The Government believes our final court of appeal should be in New Zealand and it should be composed of judges who are familiar with our society, our history and our values.

'I have complete confidence in the abilities of the New Zealand judiciary to undertake this role,' Mr Graham said.

'This Bill will enhance New Zealand's national identity as a unique and independent nation without compromising the quality of justice.
