Some responsibilty towards repayment of our public debt should be accepted by each of our generations, young and old according to the Minister for Senior Citizens Hon. Peter Gresham.

Addressing the New Zealand Returned Services' Association Conference in Wellington Mr Gresham says reducing debt today enables us to plan with more certainty tomorrow.

Mr Gresham says the question we need to address is the balance of responsibilities for debt repayment between the various generations.

He says there needs to be a recognition of the appropriate amount of debt that younger generations should accept as an off set against such assets as our roads,power stations,  
schools and hospitals.

Mr Gresham asked delegates to consider what constitutes a fair and just society.

A fair and just society says the Minister is one where those in genuine need are assisted to live a decent life, and those in a position to help themselves are encouraged to do so.

In such a society we must always have an eye on the future. We cannot conduct business today oblivious to the effect it will have tomorrow.

With a growing older population it is essential that debt collection is targeted as a priority area of expenditure, and unless we do this now New Zealand will not be in a position to provide current levels of services or support to future generations of older people.

As a representative of my constituents, a parent and a grandparent, I have an interest in seeing that the benefits of the current economic gains are fairly distributed across every age group says Mr Gresham.

He issued a challenge to delegates to use their skills in leadership, and help build a better society not just for now but for the future.

He invited them to contribute to the debate on the question of intergenerational equity, debt repayment, and the best ways to make full use of our resources for present and future needs.
