The Minister of Police, Hon John Luxton tonight said it was unfortunate that Terence Thompson had not surrendered to Police when challenged.

"Events like this are always tragic as was the untimely death of Constable Glenn McKibbin two months ago. A death no matter what the circumstances is always Difficult to accept and one feels sympathy for Mr Thompson's family.

"However, I know that the local community will be feeling relief that his whereabouts is no longer creating fear and uncertainty," said Mr Luxton.

"I would also like to commend the local Police who have maintained a very professional approach in continuing to police the community, despite considerable pressure created by that uncertainty," stated Mr Luxton.

There will be no further comment as the situation is now subject to the Police Complaints Authority inquiry.
