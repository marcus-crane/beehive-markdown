Hon D.A.M. Graham, for the Crown, and Sir Tipene ORegan, for Ngai Tahu, said today the parties had agreed to an 'on account' settlement as part of the negotiations on the tribes historical Treaty claim. It will be offset against the final settlement.

The 'on account' deed provides for the Crown to introduce legislation to vest pounamu (greenstone) and the Tutaepatu Lagoon in Ngai Tahu and also provides for an 'on account' payment of $10 million.

Mr Graham said the Crown was happy to provide certain redress to Ngai Tahu on an 'on account' basis in recognition of the long process of negotiations which had already taken place and as a demonstration of the Crown's goodwill.

'Pounamu (bowenite, nephrite and serpentine) has long been treasured by Maori. The Waitangi Tribunal recognised that Ngai Tahu are the guardians of this taonga,' he said.

The current licences will continue until they expire. The Crown will continue to manage them, but any royalties collected will be paid to Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu.

This means existing rights will continue until they expire, but applications currently lodged for permits or licences will not be granted.

Tutaepatu Lagoon, at Woodend Beach in North Canterbury, will be vested in Ngai Tahu as freehold land, subject to a public walkway over the site of the Pegasus Bay Walkway.

The Waikuku Beach Recreation Reserve plus three other recreation reserves administered by the Council and a small DOC area will form a new recreation reserve which will be managed by a Trust to be established by Ngai Tahu and the Council. A small part of the Waikuku Reserve will remain under the control and management of the Waimakiriri District Council.

The Government will contribute up to $50,000 towards the cost of preparing a management plan for the new reserve and a feasibility study of the restoration of the lagoon. The Government will also contribute $250,000 towards the cost of implementing this plan with the goal of restoring the ecology of the wetlands area.

Mr Graham and Sir Tipene said that the substantive negotiations were still only in an early stage.
