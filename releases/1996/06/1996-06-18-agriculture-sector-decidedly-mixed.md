"Decidedly mixed" was how Agriculture Minister Lockwood Smith described the sector at the release of Situation and Outlook for New Zealand Agriculture 1996 today.

"At one end of the scale, we have our dairy farmers receiving a 23% boost in revenues and earning a record payout. At the other, we have beef and sheep farmers suffering an average 6% drop in revenue."  
Dr Smith said the contrast in the performance of different agricultural industries could be put down largely to marketing.

"The dairy industry follows the fundamentals of marketing I've been promoting around the country: investment in the marketplace, control of distribution lines and long-term relationships between farmers and processors. The red meat industry, with the exception of deer, does not."

The strong performance of the dairy and deer industries showed it was not credible for "light-weight, left-wing" politicians to continue blaming the value of the kiwi dollar for the poor performance of other sectors, Dr Smith said. The policies promoted by the Labour/Alliance/NZ First "three-headed monster" to deflate the dollar would mean higher interest rates for farmers.

"The real problem, that I'm addressing, is a failure to adjust marketing strategies to take account of international consumer trends.

"We've failed to get out of selling commodities and into marketing branded consumer products. My efforts in the year ahead will be to change the attitude of the Meat Board and the meat companies," Dr Smith concluded.
