The Prime Minister today announced that he had accepted the resignation from Cabinet of the Hon John Banks, Minister of Tourism; Sport, Fitness and Leisure; Local Government; and Civil Defence.

Mr Bolger said Mr Banks advised him this morning that he wished to resign from Cabinet.

He said Mr Banks had been a colourful, at times controversial, but always conscientious member of Cabinet.

"His commitment to the tourism industry and his work for the advancement of sport stand out as highlights in his career."

The Prime Minister said in the meantime the Hon Murray McCully will take over Mr Banks' Ministerial responsibilities.
