The Acting Minister of Agriculture Denis Marshall said today that Mike Moore has jumped the gun by asking the Minister of Agriculture to arbitrate in the consideration of Apple-Fields' application to export its entire apple crop this season.

"The Apple and Pear Marketing Board advises me that it only received Apple-Fields' application in the past two weeks. Next week will be first opportunity for the Export Consents Committee to discuss the application."

"Discussions have not broken down because they haven't even started."

"In 1993 Parliament made the process that the Board uses to consider independent export consent applications more transparent. The Apple and Pear Marketing Act does not give the government any power to get involved, and it certainly was never envisaged that the government would take the process over."
