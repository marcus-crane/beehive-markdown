Schools will from today receive details of the funding they will get from the $10 million property Financial Assistance Scheme, Education Minister Wyatt Creech announced today.

The Financial Assistance Scheme enables schools to carry out their own property related projects with financial assistance from the Ministry of Education. The financial assistance adds to funds already raised by the schools.

The Ministry of Education will be telling schools the results of this year's round of applications for funding from the scheme, Mr Creech said.

"$10 million has been budgeted for the property Finance Assistance this financial year. Since its inception in 1991 the scheme has allocated $47 million to schools."

The eleven District Property Consultative Committees decide which programmes should get funding from the pool. They have recommended funding for 405 projects in 391 schools.

This year with the caretaker status of the Government, the appropriate process is for the Ministry of Education to make the announcement of the details of this years successful applications," said the Minister. The Ministry yesterday posted letters to each school that has applied for assistance telling them of the outcome of their bid.
