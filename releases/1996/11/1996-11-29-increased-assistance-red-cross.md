Foreign Minister Don McKinnon today announced a grant of $350,000 to the New Zealand Red Cross to support the cost of sending New Zealanders to work in relief operations overseas.

"These people are highly dedicated New Zealanders prepared to work in often dangerous and difficult conditions, saving and improving the lives of some of the world's most vulnerable people", Mr McKinnon said.

"The increased government support reflects the value we place on the Red Cross role in emergencies", Mr McKinnon said.

The grant, from New Zealand's Overseas Aid programme, represents an increase of $100,000 on that made in 1995. It will assist the Red Cross to send over 30 delegates with professional medical and logistical skills to work in relief operations in places like Afghanistan and Bosnia. A number of the delegates will be going to Rwanda and Zaire.
