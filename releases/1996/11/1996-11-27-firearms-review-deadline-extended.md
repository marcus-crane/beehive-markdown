The Minister of Police, Hon John Luxton today announced that the deadline for the report of the Independent Review of Firearms Control has been extended by another four months to 30 June 1997.

"This extension has been agreed to in response to a request by Justice Thorp, currently undertaking the Review," said Mr Luxton.

"The original deadline was 28 February 1997, but Justice Thorp has advised me that he has received over 2,700 submissions and that the extension is needed to enable him to undertake the considerable investigation he considers is required for the Review.

"The Review was announced in August in response to concerns on New Zealand Firearms Control. Submissions were called for by 31 October 1996.

"I am pleased that the Review has generated a considerable response from New Zealanders which reflects the importance of thoroughly examining firearms control within our country," concluded Mr Luxton.
