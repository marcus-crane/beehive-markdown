Finance Minister Rt Hon Bill Birch said today that Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash's speech clearly focused on the pressures on monetary policy and the exchange rate if spending is increased substantially by this or any other government.

"The danger of such pressure is that according to Dr Brash it will require "very firm monetary conditions" to hold inflation.

"If that happens then the very positive economic growth currently forecast for the next three years may not be achieved, thus damaging the present income and job prospects of New Zealanders .

"I have noted that Labour's finance spokesperson Michael Cullen has made a public statement supporting Dr Brash.

"It is the additional spending advocated by Dr Cullen and Labour that is creating the pressures referred to by Dr Brash."
