The Government is to make an immediate grant of $200 000 in emergency funds for use in Eastern Zaire.

What we are seeing is another desperate tragedy in a region which has had more than its share of humanitarian disasters, Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said in announcing the aid.

The money will go to the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and will help re-establish relief operations as soon as the military situation makes this possible.

The numbers of displaced people alone are appalling but what we tend to forget is that each one of these people is suffering their own individual hell in this situation, Mr McKinnon continued.

On top of the dislocation and hardship of refugee camps situated along the border with Rwanda and Burundi, a civil war is now destroying the very relief infrastructure which has allowed them to continue a precarious existence in the camps.

Mr McKinnon described the situation as outrageous and called on all the governments in the region, especially Zaire, Rwanda and Burundi, to take immediate steps to end the fighting, bring their soldiers into line and start political discussions to find a sustainable and lasting solution to the regions problems.

Continuing to rely on international aid and financial relief will not achieve this, he said.

Mr McKinnon added that it was grotesque that relief infrastructure, including hospitals and schools, provided by the international community, were now being looted and destroyed. This made this emergency quite different from other natural disasters in that this one is purely man made he said.

In concluding Mr McKinnon acknowledged the efforts being made by non-government organisations and charities in the private sector.
