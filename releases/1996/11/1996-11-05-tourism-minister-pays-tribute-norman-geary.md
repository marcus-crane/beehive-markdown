Tourism Minister Murray McCully has paid tribute to Norman Geary who indicated his retirement today as inaugural Chairman of the NZ Tourism Board, saying "he has been an outstanding leader during the most important five years of the tourism industry."

"He has presided over a period of significant change since 1991 when the NZ Tourism Board was formed, and has overseen restructuring which has resulted in a more commercially focussed and competitive organisation," Mr McCully said.

"During his time chairing the Board, the tourism industry has gone from a modest revenue earner to New Zealands largest foreign exchange earner at $5B in 1996, with 1.5M international visitors."
