Crown Health Enterprises Minister Bill English announced today that Jack Jenkins, the chairman of Health Waikato, had been appointed acting executive chairman of Capital Coast Health.

This follows the resignation today of the current chairman, Rob Thompson. Mr Thompson will remain as a member of the board.

"The Government has agreed to a proposal from the board of Capital Coast Health to appoint an executive chairman who can devote the time needed to oversee a recovery plan for the CHE.

"Mr Thompson has advised me that he believes a fresh perspective on the organisation and its plans will assist the CHE to quickly turn around its forecast deficit. He felt that the situation needed a full-time commitment," said Mr English.

"I am in no doubt that the CHE will need to make some fundamental changes in order to turn around its forecast financial position. Mr Jenkins has the experience necessary to assist the board to achieve this. His appointment is in an acting capacity at this stage to allow the incoming government the opportunity to confirm this arrangement," he said.

Mr Jenkins has been chairman of Health Waikato since its inception in July 1993 and was executive chairman for several months in 1995.
