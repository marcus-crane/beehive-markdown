Police Minister, Hon John Luxton today expressed support for Police in working on new strategies to enhance the safety of Police officers.

"In recent months there have been some very nasty and unacceptable attacks on police officers as they go about their duties protecting New Zealanders," said Mr Luxton.

"I fully support the Commissioner of Police, Peter Doone's moves to undertake an urgent evaluation of the potential police use of capsicum sprays and to look at the patrol and deployment policies to ensure officers safety continues to be the priority.

"However, it is not just the responsibility of Police management, but also of all law abiding New Zealanders to help Police make our communities safer. Crime Prevention strategies are playing a major role in this approach but everyone needs to take responsibility in helping Police.

"This means for example, being alert to any suspicious behaviour and reporting it immediately to Police. The excellent responses also from members of the public in providing information to Police during recent criminal investigations, illustrates the importance of the partnership between Police and local communities," concluded Mr Luxton.
