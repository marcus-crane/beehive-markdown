Crown health enterprise boards are responsible for setting and evaluating performance criteria for the payment of chief executive bonuses, Crown Health Enterprises Minister Bill English said today.

"Regarding the specific situation at Capital Coast Health, until a month ago the CHE appeared to have been making good progress. Its financial situation at the end of the 95/96 year was generally satisfactory.

"That is not now the case with the forecast deficit for the 96/97 year. We have taken a number of steps to remedy that, including the appointment of an executive chairman. While financial performance is not the only measure of achievement, clearly under the current circumstances the performances of the board and the chief executive are under scrutiny," said Mr English.
