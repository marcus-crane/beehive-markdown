The Minister for Disarmament and Arms Control, Hon D.A.M. Graham, has welcomed the overwhelming support for a United Nation's resolution on a nuclear-weapon-free Southern Hemisphere.

The resolution, co-sponsored by New Zealand, was adopted by a large majority in the First Committee of the UN General Assembly in New York this morning. There were 111 votes for the resolution, 4 against and 36 abstentions.

The resolution calls on all the parties to the four existing nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties to 'explore and implement further ways and means of co-operation, including the consolidation of the status of nuclear-weapon-free Southern Hemisphere and adjacent areas'.

It also calls on other countries to consider establishing further nuclear-weapon-free zones. It takes into account the international legal obligations relating to rights of passage under the law of the sea.

'NZ co-sponsored this resolution as part of our ongoing commitment to work for a nuclear-weapon-free world,' Mr Graham said.
