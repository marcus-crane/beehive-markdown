Education Minister Wyatt Creech announced today a new initiative designed to attract experienced teachers back into classrooms.

Boards of trustees at schools designated as priority staffing will now be able to access a $2,500 Recruitment Allowance to attract New Zealand teachers who have been out of teaching for three or more years, he said.

Some schools have expressed concern that they need more tools to get experienced teachers back into the teaching workforce after they have moved out - for instance teachers who have left to raise families. They will now be able to use the Recruitment Allowance to encourage those who have been away from teaching to return.

The allowance will help boards of trustees provide whatever assistance they think is needed to best meet the individual needs of the returning teacher. This system is being used to give maximum flexibility to Boards in meeting their staffing needs.

The $2,500 Recruitment Allowance is already available to primary and secondary schools where a teacher is eligible for the Limited Relocation Grant.

Mr Creech said extending the allowance had come about because of the close monitoring of the Teacher Supply situation and the Education Ministrys commitment to adapt initiatives to deal with areas of need.

To be eligible for the Recruitment Allowance a school has to employ the teacher for 20 weeks or more, and it must not already have Staffing Incentive Allowance status.
