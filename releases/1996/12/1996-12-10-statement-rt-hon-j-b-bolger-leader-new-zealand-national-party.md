The National Party Leader Rt Hon J B Bolger says the coalition agreement between the National Party and New Zealand First Party secures long-term stable government for New Zealand.

Todays coalition agreement blends the economic progress of the past six years with the social policy priorities New Zealanders indicated at the general election.

I am confident that New Zealands economy will continue to develop and grow. We are maintaining the fundamental building blocks of our nations recent economic success.

At the same time the coalition will deliver on the social policy concerns expressed by voters. These will include some new programmes put forward by National and significant new initiatives from New Zealand First.

The coalition agreement stresses continued responsible fiscal policy, the running of significant surpluses, repayment of debt and a focus on the productive sector. The impact of agreed increases in social spending will be offset by postponing the next round of tax cuts for one year.

The legislative framework for economic policy, the Reserve Bank Act, the Employment Contracts Act and the Fiscal Responsibility Act, will be maintained and the inflation target will be increased from 0-2% to 0-3%.

I want to acknowledge the willingness shown by both parties to put aside past history in the best interests of our nation said Mr Bolger.
