Foreign Minister Don McKinnon has welcomed the appointment of Mr C H Tung to the post of Chief Executive of Hong Kong's Government after its return to China in July 1997.

"This is a significant step. It marks the beginning of the final phase of the transition process that began with the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984", Mr McKinnon said.

"With this appointment, we can now expect to see the form of the new Hong Kong Government taking shape as the final transition details are worked through."

"As Chief Executive, Mr Tung will face the particular challenge of maintaining the high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong promised in the Joint Declaration. It will not be an easy task to meet the expectations of Hong Kong people, the Chinese government and the international community."

"Hong Kong is an important regional partner for New Zealand. We have large and longstanding interests through trade, investment, migration, tourism and other exchanges. Mr Tung will bring to the office a very wide experience in business and government, as well as an impressive range of international and Chinese contacts. We look forward to working with him for the success of Hong Kong and New Zealand's future relations with it", Mr McKinnon concluded.
