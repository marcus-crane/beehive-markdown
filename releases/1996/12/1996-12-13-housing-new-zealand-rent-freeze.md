Housing Minister Murray McCully has confirmed that he has directed Housing New Zealand to impose an interim freeze on rents for current tenants pending a review of affordability issues.

"I have given formal notice to Housing New Zealand today that the company should implement the freeze from the date of the National-NZ First Coalition agreement (11 December) ," Mr McCully said, "as required under section 14(b) of the Housing Restructuring Act."

"The freeze was provided for in the Coalition agreement announced earlier this week," he said.
