"This Ministry is a bold reflection of the diversity in New Zealand today. It will provide a strong Government for the new MMP era," said the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon J B Bolger, today.

"The range of experience, age and ideas make this the most representative Executive in New Zealand's history. It will serve us well as we move towards the millennium.

"This representative Ministry is also a positive response to the proportional representation demands of a changed parliament, and I believe it has all the elements needed for good government.

"I do regret that because of the requirements of coalition I was unable to find a place for all my previous Ministers.

"I want to thank them on behalf of New Zealanders for their dedicated efforts over the last transitionary term. I would anticipate a number of these senior parliamentarians will be considered as chairperson of various select committees.

I would like to note that I am heartened by the overwhelmingly positive response of New Zealanders to the formation of the National-New Zealand First Coalition Government."

The Prime Minister announced that the swearing-in of the new Ministry would be held at Government House tomorrow at 10.30am.

The first National-New Zealand First Coalition Cabinet meeting will be tomorrow at 1.30pm.
