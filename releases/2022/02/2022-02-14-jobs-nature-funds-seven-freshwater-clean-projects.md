- Jobs for Nature funding for seven projects around the country
- Investment will clean up and protect waterways and create local jobs
- Up to 243 jobs (FTEs) expected from these projects over the next five years.

The clean-up of a degraded lake in Marlborough and restoration of an estuary system in Gisborne are among a suite of projects that will receive $12 million of Jobs for Nature funding, Environment Minister David Parker announced today.

Across the seven projects, up to 243 jobs (FTEs) are expected to be created over the next five years.

Together with council and other contributions, these projects will see more than $26 million invested in improving New Zealand’s freshwater.

“Each project is taking us closer to meeting the objectives of the Essential Freshwater package, while creating training and employment opportunities,” David Parker said.

“It’s about improving water quality now, so that the next generation can enjoy healthy freshwater for years to come.

“We are supporting projects that are taking a catchment wide approach to remediation, like the Hokianga Harbour Care project. We are helping fence off waterways to exclude stock, plant up riparian margins and restore wetlands.

“We are upskilling people. Ngāti Koata Trust’s project to restore Lake Moawhitu is offering employment and ecological training for local rangatahi and others in the community,” David Parker said.

The funding for these projects comes from the Freshwater Improvement Fund. It aims to create significant environmental benefits and boost training and employment in our regions to help accelerate the recovery from the impact of COVID-19.

At the latest full update on 30 September 2021, the Jobs for Nature programme had created employment for 5,698 people. This included short term, part time and contract work. At that date there were more than 2,400 currently employed. The programme remains on track to meet its core objectives.
