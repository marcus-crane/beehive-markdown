- New Maori Housing dashboard for better data sharing and better outcomes
- New development training programme to grow sector capability

Associate Minister of Housing (Maori Housing) Peeni Henare today attended the annual MAIHI Whare Wananga hosted by Toitu Tairawhiti Housing Limited in Kaiti.

“Our MAIHI Whare Wananga is an opportunity for Government, Iwi and Maori to come together and discuss how we can support better Maori Housing outcomes,” Peeni Henare said..

“Our vision is for all whanau to have safe, healthy, affordable homes with secure tenure regardless of where they live in New Zealand. The plan is to build 1000 new homes, undertake repairs and maintenance to 700 homes, and provide infrastructure support for another 2,700 homes.

Since our last Whare Wananga,

- Of the 1000 homes to be delivered, we have approved up to 959
- Of the 700 homes for repairs and maintenance, we have approved up to 331
- Of the 2,700 sites requiring infrastructure support, we have enabled up to 1356

“Tracking our progress and sharing data is an important part of the collective work of the MAIHI Whare Wananga, which is why we are launching the new Maori Housing dashboard, MAIHI Ka Ora – Ka Marama.

“This new dashboard will give people access to data on a cross-section of work we are undertaking—programmes like Whai Kainga Whai Oranga and the Homelessness Action Plan.

“Being open and transparent about the progress we are making in Maori Housing helps ensure we are held accountable, but also allows us to work together better.

“It also means we can celebrate the successes our partnerships have delivered and the targets we have reached.”

The theme of this year’s wananga is Maui Nukurau Tangata.

“The theme calls for all of us to be more like Maui in our approach to the future of Maori Housing. To be fearless innovators and relentless drivers of our own destiny,” Peeni Henare said.

“But before we drive forward and meet future challenges, we need to ready ourselves to lead.

“Te Matapihi, through extensive consultation, have designed the National Maori Housing leadership programme – Mana Kainga.

“This will be the first kaupapa Maori curriculum developed through wānanga and co-production design to build the capability of Housing Navigators to support whānau Māori through the housing system and achieve their housing aspirations.

“Mana Kainga is committed to advancing capacity and capability through a new Maori housing curriculum. Strong emphasis will be placed on the synergies between research and practice, science and matauranga that is co-produced with key stakeholders, iwi, hapu, whanau and Maori organisations.

“I am happy to announce that the Government is providing $750,000 towards advancing the Mana Kainga leadership programme.

“With the help of programmes like Mana Kainga and with the ongoing work of our MAIHI Whare Wananga, Maori will be ready to meet all our future challenges head-on.

“I am excited about what else we can achieve together, what other innovative solutions we can implement and how we can continue to be relentless drivers of a better Maori housing future,” Peeni Henare said.
