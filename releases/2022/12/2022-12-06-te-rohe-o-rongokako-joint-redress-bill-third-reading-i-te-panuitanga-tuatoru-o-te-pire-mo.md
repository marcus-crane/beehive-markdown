**Te Pānuitanga Tuatoru o te Pire mō te Puretumu Ngātahi mō Te Rohe o Rongokako**

I te rā nei, i Pāremata, ka oti te tuatoru me te whakamutunga o ngā pānuitanga o te Pire mō te Puretumu Ngātahi mō te Rohe o Rongokako. Ko tā te pire, he whakatinana i te puretumu ngātahi i waenga i a Ngāti Kahungunu ki Wairarapa Tāmaki Nui-a-Rua, me Rangitāne o Wairarapa, me Rangitāne o Tamaki nui-ā-Rua, i ō rātou nā rohe o Tāmaki Nui-ā-Rua me Wairarapa, mai i Te Mātakitaki-a-Kupe ki Te Aho a Māui.

"He pae whakahirahira tēnei nā te mea e whakaūngia ana te hononga auroa o Ngāti Kahungunu me Rangitāne ki ngā whenua me ngā wai i ō rātou rohe, ka mutu, e tūmanako ana au, ka noho tēnei pae hei painga mō ngā uri whakaheke ā haere ake nei," te kī a te Minita mō ngā Take Tiriti o Waitangi, a Andrew Little.

Ka whai wāhi ki te pire ko te whakahokinga o ngā whenua i Mākirikiri, i Mataikona, i Rangiwhakaoma, i te moana o Wairarapa me te riu hopuwai o te awa o Ruamāhanga. Hei āpitihanga ki tērā, ka whakaūngia e te pire nei te tūranga matua o ngā iwi e rua hei kaitiaki mō ō rātou arawai e whakahirahira ana, ā, ka whakatūria hoki te Poari ā-Ture o Wairarapa Moana, ko ōna mema he mea kopou e Rangitāne, e Ngāti Kahungunu, e te Minita o Te Papa Atawhai, e te Kaunihera ā-Rohe o Te Whanganui-a-Tara, e Te Kaunihera ā-Takiwā o Wairarapa ki te Tonga hoki. Ka mahi te Poari kia tiakina te moana o Wairarapa me te riu hopuwai o te awa o Ruamāhanga hei painga mō ngā uri o nāianei, o muri ake nei hoki.

"E pā ana te kaupapa nei ki te whakaūnga o te hononga mauki, o te mana rangatira hoki o Ngāti Kahungunu me Rangitāne ki ō rātou whenua, ki ō rātou awa, ki tō rātou moana hoki," te kī a Andrew Little

**Te Rohe o Rongokako Joint Redress Bill Third Reading**

Te Rohe o Rongokako Joint Redress Bill was read for a third and final time at Parliament today. The bill gives effect to cultural redress shared between Ngāti Kahungunu ki Wairarapa Tāmaki nui-a-Rua, Rangitāne o Wairarapa, and Rangitāne o Tamaki nui-ā-Rua in their rohe of Tāmaki nui-ā-Rua and Wairarapa, from Cape Palliser to Cape Turnagain.

 “This is an important milestone as it recognises the long-standing association of both Ngāti Kahungunu and Rangitāne with lands and waters in their rohe, and it is a milestone that sincerely I hope will benefit generations to come,” Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Andrew Little said.

The bill provides for the return of land at Mākirikiri, Mataikona, Castlepoint, Wairarapa Moana (Lake Wairarapa) and the Ruamahanga River catchment. Additionally, it recognises the central role the two iwi have as kaitiaki of their important waterways and establishes the Wairarapa Moana Statutory Board, composed of members appointed by Rangitāne, Ngāti Kahungunu, the Minister of Conservation, the Wellington Regional Council, and the South Wairarapa District Council. The Board will work to preserve Wairarapa Moana and the Ruamahanga River catchment for the benefit of current and future generations.

“This is about the acknowledgement of the longstanding connection and mana rangatiratanga of both Ngāti Kahungunu and Rangitāne over their whenua, awa, and moana,” Andrew Little said.
