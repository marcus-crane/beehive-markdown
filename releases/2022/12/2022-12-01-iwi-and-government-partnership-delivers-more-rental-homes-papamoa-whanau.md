Associate Minister of Housing (Māori Housing) Peeni Henare attended the official opening of 10 new rental homes built for working whānau of Ngā Pōtiki ā Tamapahore in Pāpāmoa today.

“The Bay of Plenty region is one of many regions facing significant housing challenges and this Government is taking action by working in partnership with Iwi to deliver warm dry homes for whānau,” Peeni Henare said.

Following a $15 million funding boost from the Government in 2022, Manawa Community Housing Trust has built 10 new four-bedroom affordable rental homes, with a further 20 homes to be delivered by the end of 2024.

The houses will be offered to low income earners who have struggled to get into local market rental homes at a much more affordable cost.

Manawa Community Housing Trust is the housing delivery entity of Ngā Pōtiki ā Tamapahore Trust. It is a registered community housing provider tasked specifically with providing housing solutions for Ngā Pōtiki whānau.

“These whare will give Ngā Pōtiki whānau the ability to continue living in their rohe, to be close to their whānau and marae, to stay connected to their whenua, which is what is at the core of the Government’s Māori Housing Strategy,” Peeni Henare said..

The next stage of the project is the construction of four townhouse blocks of two-bedroom and three-bedroom homes. These 20 homes will also be affordable rentals for Ngā Pōtiki whānau.

General manager of Manawa Community Housing Trust, Victoria Carroll, says the new homes will be rented by low-income working Ngā Pōtiki whānau at 40-50 per cent less than the local market rental rates.

“We have also made these rental homes available for young adult members to band together as flatmates. For many of our whānau, this is their only opportunity to leave the nest and start their journey to independence.

“All the rental tenants will be supported by the Ngā Pōtiki Housing team and its partners, providing wrap-around services including budget advice, access to free health care services, housing and home ownership pathways, and more,” Victoria Carroll said.

**Notes to Editors**

In 2021 the Government invested $730 million into Māori housing. Whai Kāinga Whai Oranga was established to work with iwi and hapū to build new homes for whānau.

We remain committed to delivering a better housing future for Māori, and through our Māori housing programmes like Whai Kāinga Whai Oranga plan to build 1000 new homes, undertake repairs and maintenance to 700 homes, and provide infrastructure support for 2,700 homes.

- Of the 1000 homes to be delivered, we have approved up to 959
- Of the 700 homes for repairs and maintenance, we have approved up to 331
- Of the 2700 sites requiring infrastructure support, we have enabled up to 1356
