Tauranga will be the first region to use a new Government tool to raise funding for much-needed infrastructure.

A Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) will be used to raise finance from private markets, which is then repaid via the levy on those who benefit from the infrastructure. The finance raised by the SPV will sit outside of Tauranga City Council’s balance sheet constraints.

The first levy to be applied under the innovative Infrastructure Funding and Financing (IFF) Act, will enable Tauranga City Council to raise approximately $175 million towards the construction costs of thirteen transport projects across the region.

“The Western Bay of Plenty is one of the fastest growing regions in New Zealand with growth projections showing, on average, hundreds of people are moving there each month,” Megan Woods said.

“This high-speed growth is putting pressure on our infrastructure and services. The 13 projects that will be part funded through the new model are focused on finding solutions for the challenges related to housing, transport and urban development.”

The IFF Act offers councils an alternative model to provide infrastructure needed for housing and urban development through a levy. The IFF levy will partly replace a targeted rate Tauranga City Council is charging to fund its Transport System Plan (TSP) projects, increasing balance sheet headroom for the Council. 

“Crown Infrastructure Partners, which will wholly own the SPV, has secured debt finance from Westpac and Bank of New Zealand to enable the SPV to contribute approximately $175 million towards the construction costs of the 13 TSP projects,” Grant Robertson said.

“This will be repaid over time by the annual IFF levy which commences in July 2024.

Tauranga City Council Commissioners are delighted that the proposal is proceeding, and Tauranga is the first council to utilise the IFF Act.

Commission Chair Anne Tolley says the Transport System Plan benefits Tauranga City and the wider Western Bay of Plenty in a number of ways, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions through more public transport, cycling and walking options, and better urban development.

“This innovative financing approach means we have more balance sheet headroom available to progress other vital infrastructure and community facility investments and that’s hugely important for a fast-growing city like Tauranga,” Anne Tolley said.
