Associate Minister of Housing (Māori Housing) Peeni Henare joined Ngāi Tāmanuhiri and the wider Toitū Tairāwhiti collective, at the opening of 10 new homes built for kaumātua and whānau in Muriwai today.

“Every whare that is built and whānau that is transferred from inadequate housing to a warm dry home helps to address the housing challenges in Te Tairāwhiti. Im pleased the Government is working with iwi to deliver housing opportunities for whānau here in Te Muriwai,” Peeni Henare said.

In May, the Government invested $55 million from the Whai Kāinga Whai Oranga fund to enable Toitū Tairāwhiti (a collective that consists of Ngāi Tāmanuhiri, Rongowhakaata, Te Aitanga-a-Māhaki and Ngāti Porou, plus iwi partners Te Whānau-ā-Apanui and Te Whakatōhea) to deliver up to 150 new homes on whenua Māori. 

“Ngāi Tāmanuhiri made a commitment to build 10 homes to support iwi members who were caught up in the housing crisis and living in unreasonable conditions,” Peeni Henare said.

“These 10 homes include four one-bedroom unit kaumātua duplex, four-three-bedroom and two-four-bedroom homes for iwi whānau members.

“The four kaumātua moving into the duplex are either currently in social housing, need care or support from whānau in Te Muriwai, or are paying unaffordable market rents in Gisborne town. The duplex will be managed by a community housing provider and offered to kaumātua at a subsidised rent.

“Six whānau will be moving into the homes on a rent-to-buy agreement over 10 years. The whānau are currently living in overcrowded situations, in un-inhabitable dwellings such as garages or unsafe, unhealthy rental properties.

“These whare will give Ngāi Tāmanuhiri pakeke and whānau the ability to continue living in their rohe, to be close to their whānau and marae, to stay connected to their whenua, which is at the core of the Government’s Māori Housing strategy,” Peeni Henare said.

**Quote from Provider:**

Tāmanuhiri Tūtū Poroporo Trust Chairperson, Pauline Hill said, “For the whānau who move into the new homes, one of the contributing factors for success is that whānau become/ remain active members of our local community. In return the community of Te Muriwai look forward to welcoming these whānau home and embracing them in this journey of reconnection and home ownership”.
