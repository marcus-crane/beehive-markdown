- The first marine project under the Low Emission Transport Fund is among 11 projects getting $2.14 million

Eleven new transport projects including clever solutions for electric vehicle charging, ways to cut fuel costs in heavy freight, and the first marine project will get co-funding from the Government, Energy and Resources Minister Dr Megan Woods has announced today.

“In total, the projects will receive $2.14 million from the Government’s third round of The Low Emission Transport Fund so they can trial new ways of slashing emissions in the transport sector, in areas that were previously seen as hard to decarbonise,” says Megan Woods.

“For example, Core Technology, was chosen to pilot electric outboard motors including ‘handbag’, ‘briefcase’, and ‘carry-on’ sized batteries for use on small watercraft so boat owners can test out what works best for them. The pilot will be based at marinas within the Northland and North Auckland areas.

“It’s also great to see projects looking at saving money and waste at the same time by targeting inefficiencies in freight. Freight and transport management companies Findatruckload and iCOS LIVE, will partner to identify “empty legs” - when trucks return empty. This will allow them to increase revenue, and significantly reduce wasted fuel. It’s a win win.

“The projects come in all shapes and sizes. At a more local level, Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei, ahi kā from Tāmaki Makaurau will run a car share service using a community app with chargers, three EV cars, and an EV van so whānau in the local community have accessible and affordable transport without needing to run an expensive private car.

“We are also happy to support work on one of the big reasons that stop prospective buyers from purchasing EVs - slow charging. For example Red Phase Technologies will work with Z Energy and Powerco to integrate a super high-speed charger at a Waiouru site, using technology that will reduce the impact on the grid.

“Jump Charging will build a portable skid-mounted 75kW DC rapid charging station that can be installed in locations that require temporary increases in EV charging demand such as special events or emergency situations.

“Congratulations to all successful applicants, I look forward to following your progress. You are part of the national effort to reduce our transport emissions by 41 percent by 2035,” Megan Woods said.

**About the LETF**

The Low Emission Transport Fund, administered by EECA, supports the demonstration and adoption of low emission transport technology, innovation and infrastructure to accelerate the decarbonisation of the New Zealand transport sector.

Organisations were able to apply for up to 50% of the cost of projects that met specific objectives, for instance, projects that would demonstrate replicability, overcome significant barriers within sectors, or encourage innovative approaches to smart charging and/or vehicle use.

The fund focuses on activities in the transport sector that move people and/or goods on roads, off-road, and in the marine and aviation sectors to:

- Demonstrate innovative solutions that will enable future adoption and deployment
- Reduce energy-related emissions in the transport sector
- Address market and organisational barriers through co-investment and diffusion of new knowledge and lessons, and
- Share knowledge and lessons to stimulate wider replication of successful projects and solutions in the transport sector.

Wider transport systems and activities (such as building roads, urban design, and mode shift policy) are excluded.

Each round of the LETF will provide co-funding to a particular area of interest (unlike the previous LEVCF, in which each round welcomed the full range of applications). An announcement will be made in advance of each funding round advising which areas of interest will be included.

Low Emission Transport Fund - Round 3 Vehicles & Technology

Approved Projects

**Technology and software**

1. Red Phase Technologies Limited **$397,000**

Electric vehicle charging demonstration project – mitigation of grid constraints

Red Phase will work with Z Energy and Powerco to integrate a super high-speed charger at a grid-constrained site in Waiouru using technology that will modify charger draw and reduce impact on the power network, minimising impact on the electricity grid and avoiding expensive grid upgrades. The system delivers 4 chargers that can provide over 180kW each.

1. Critchlow Geospatial Limited **$112,750**

Calibrating SwitchMyFleet for BEV cars undertaking New Zealand journeys

Critchlow Geospatial will extend the functionality of their SwitchMyFleet product to include battery electric cars. The project will provide an electric car to generate data to accurately build and calibrate the model and to provide comparisons between combustion engine and light electric vehicles. The tool will allow purchasers to choose the most appropriate vehicle and battery size for their needs and confirm they can complete their journeys.

1. Truckload Limited **$91,000**

Decarbonising the Freight Industry by matching freight with existing capacity

Findatruckload, a freight management company, and iCOS LIVE, a Transport Management Company, will partner to integrate their products to create "the Future Initiative." The service will automate freight alerts to trucks about to run empty to allow them to fill their empty leg, generate more revenue, eliminate the need to put another truck on the road to move the same freight, and thereby save emissions.

1. Jump Charging **$101,094**

Portable Skid Mounted 75kW DC Rapid Charging Station

Jump Charging will build a portable skid mounted 75kW DC rapid charging station with dual 11kV or 400V input that can be installed to service locations which experience temporary or periodic increases in EV charging demand including seasonal areas, specialist events or emergency situations.

**Marine electric outboard motors**

1. Core Technology Limited **$112,000**

Marina based pilot with supplied electric outboard motors including ‘handbag’, ‘briefcase’ and ‘carry-on’ sized battery options to enable real-life marina experiences and adoption

Core Technology Ltd has designed and built 3, 6 and 10hp electric outboard motors [for use on small watercraft and tenders](). The motors will be offered as part of a pilot with three different sizes of battery for marina owners and boat owners to trial for optimal configuration of motor, battery size and use case. The pilot will be based at marinas within the Northland and Auckland North areas.

**Mobility-as-a-Service**

1. Accel Technologies Limited **$32,000**

Demonstrating Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) to support mode shift to micro-mobility (MM)
