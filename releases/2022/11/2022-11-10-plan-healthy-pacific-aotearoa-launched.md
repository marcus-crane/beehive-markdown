Associate Minister of Health Hon. Aupito William Sio has today launched Ola Manuia the Interim Pacific Health Plan.

Ola Manuia sets out the first two years of action that will guide the national Pacific health work programme at Te Whatu Ora – Health New Zealand.

“We have known for a long time that many areas of our health system don't work well for Pacific people,” said Aupito William Sio.

“That is why the Government has made a specific commitment to addressing health inequities for Pacific communities.

“Ola Manuia is just the beginning as we work to tackle inequities head on and lift Pacific wellbeing.

“In 2023 a Pacific Health Strategy will be developed under the Pae Ora (Healthy Futures) Act 2022. For the first time a Pacific Health Strategy is legislated to ensure on-going accountability. My vision is that a comprehensive health plan for our people will be created.

“We have started to make gains for Pacific people through the efforts of community leadership and our Pacific health workforce across the country. There are many excellent models of care already in place.

“Ola Manuia details how we will build on those successes and continue working towards a thriving, resilient and prosperous Pacific Aotearoa.”

The development of the interim Pacific plan included consultation with people working in Pacific health and Pacific communities, in May and June 2022.

It also addresses the health needs of priority Pacific populations and urgently addresses care gaps that have appeared during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Ola Manuia is the companion document to Te Pae Tata - the Interim New Zealand Health Plan, released last month, and highlights key priority groups:

- pregnant women
- children and youth
- adults and elders
- people with long-term conditions (such as diabetes)
- people with mental health needs
- tagata sa’ilimalo (people with disabilities)

“The actions outlined for the next two years will enable Pacific people to access care when and where they need it,” said Aupito William Sio.
