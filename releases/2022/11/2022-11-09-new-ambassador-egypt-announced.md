Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta today announced the appointment of Amy Laurenson as New Zealand’s next ambassador to Cairo, Egypt.

“Aotearoa New Zealand has a constructive and long-standing relationship with Egypt. They are a prominent regional leader and we appreciate their perspectives on issues in the Middle East and across Africa,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“We regularly exchange views on a wide range of issues, such as peace and security, human rights, and this year Egypt is hosting the Climate Change Conference COP27, which New Zealand is attending.

“Since 1982, Defence Force personnel from New Zealand have served with the Multinational Force and Observers on the Sinai Peninsula, contributing to regional peace and security. 

“We also share a strong trade relationship with Egypt, which is one of our largest trading partners in Africa. Through Ms Laurenson’s appointment, we hope to expand this relationship even further,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

Amy Laurenson has most recently the Chief of Staff for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. She has also served as the manager of the ministry’s Antarctic and Southern Ocean Unit and as the New Zealand Commissioner of the International Whaling Commission.

Her overseas postings include a term as Deputy Head of Mission at the New Zealand Embassy in Mexico and Second Secretary at the New Zealand Permanent Mission to the UN in Geneva.

She has twice served as a Private Secretary in the Office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, including as UN Security Council Coordinator during New Zealand’s 2015-16 term.

Ms Laurenson takes up her position in the New Year.
