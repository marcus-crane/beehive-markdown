- 17 community energy-saving education projects share $1.7 million
- Builds on success of previous Government projects that have supported more than 13,000 households and 440 energy education events with more than 80,000 LEDs distributed

Helping households to reduce their energy bills and make their homes warmer and more energy-efficient, is the key focus of a further 17 community projects receiving $1.7 million funding, says Energy and Resources Minister Megan Woods.

“These 17 projects, from the Government’s Support for Energy Education in Communities (SEEC) Programme, will help even more households, across even more communities, maximise their homes’ energy efficiency and save on their power bills,” Megan Woods said.

“The SEEC Programme funds community organisations to deliver personalised energy education through in-home visits and via video calls, and to larger groups through hui and workshops.

“For example Sustain & Enable’s project will support people with disabilities and seniors who live rurally and in small towns. Households will receive energy assessments and advice online and follow-up calls to measure progress. A range of energy-saving devices will also be supplied to maximise energy efficiency gains and further lower power bills.

“These projects teach people about power use, talk through power bills and plans, and provide information on how they can heat their homes more efficiently. Some projects provide minor house repairs and help households access other services like curtain banks. For example, the WISE Charitable Trust, which runs a successful programme helping households in Taranaki, is supported by its home repair team who undertake minor repairs and remediation work on poor quality houses. The Trust also conducts interactive educational presentations through community workshops.

“The majority of the organisations receiving this new funding are building on earlier success by expanding their projects into new areas, targeting new communities or providing follow-up support. For example the project run by the Society of St Vincent de Paul in Hamilton focuses on Māori, Pasifika, migrant households and low-income whānau in the city and North Waikato. It’s partnering with other local organisations and iwi to provide its energy education programme, which includes training up home energy assessors who can work with households, providing information and practical advice, supply free LED lightbulbs and connect them with other local support services,” Megan Woods said.

The Government’s SEEC Programme has already helped more than 13,000 households save on power bills by teaching them how to be smart power users and providing cost-saving equipment like LED lightbulbs.

Changes to household energy use through LEDs, turning off second fridges or other actions can each save households about $200 a year.

There is a further $2.95 million available in 2023/24. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment will evaluate all funded programmes next year and use findings to shape the delivery of future SEEC Programme funding.

The SEEC Programme is one of a number of initiatives that contribute to the Government’s broader and longer-term strategy to alleviate energy hardship in Aotearoa New Zealand.
