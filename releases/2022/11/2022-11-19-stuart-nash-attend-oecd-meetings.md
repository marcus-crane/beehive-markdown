Small Business Minister Stuart Nash will travel to Paris today to attend small business meetings with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

Stuart Nash will chair the OECD’s Digital for SMEs (D4SME) Steering Group meeting and the 4th Roundtable of the OECD D4SME Global Initiative*.*

“The OECD’s Digital for SMEs Global Initiative is a great opportunity to engage with my OECD counterparts and private sector partners on how we transition to a post-COVID future, and advance the importance of mental health, wellbeing and inclusivity to SME digitalisation,” said Stuart Nash.

OECD engagements will also advance Government priorities in areas of Small Business, Economic Development, Tourism and Forestry.

“As chair, at the D4SME meetings I will moderate discussion of digital transformation by SMEs. This meeting comes at a critical time. SMEs around the world are facing a range of economic challenges from supply chain disruptions to price increases, all while recovering from the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy.

“This meeting presents a valuable opportunity for us to learn from one another as we tackle common challenges. Digital tools can help SMEs to weather disruptions while also strengthening longer-term resilience,” said Stuart Nash.

The meeting will be a vital forum to discuss how these digital tools are applied, what the longer-term impact of this adoption is, and how the different sectors can work together to help SMEs access them and accelerate transition to become more digitally enabled.

“I will also deliver a keynote address at the Green Growth and Sustainable Development (GGSD) Forum, focusing on the role of SMEs in green innovation. This forum will allow for discussion of approaches to green innovation, and the role that low-carbon hydrogen and the bio-economy sectors could play in a sustainable recovery.

“It will also discuss the specific challenges and opportunities faced by SMEs and the lessons learnt from the international scientific co-operation in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Stuart Nash.

Stuart Nash will be travelling from 20-26 November 2022.
