Much needed public housing is on the way for the Kāpiti Coast thanks to the Government’s purchase of a large vacant plot of land at 59-69 Raumati Road in Raumati Beach.

“This purchase will ultimately mean more families have a place to call home and demonstrates our commitment to resolving the housing challenges facing the Kāpiti Coast District,” says Minister of Housing Megan Woods.

“This announcement comes on the back of the Government’s recent delivery of two new Kāinga Ora homes for nearby Paraparaumu in October.

“It is in the very early stages, but plans for the number and type of homes on the site are still being developed, with initial estimates indicating around 100 warm, dry homes could be delivered on the 4.6360 hectare site.

 “Historically there have been low levels of public housing in Kāpiti and a recent assessment conducted by the local council highlighted a significant shortfall of all types of housing across the district.

 “It is clear that we need to take further steps to address housing in the region, and by tackling it now, we can prevent problems that will potentially compound and worsen in the coming years.”

Kāinga Ora will continue to work closely with Kāpiti District Council, local iwi and local residents on how best to make sure these homes support the local community and new residents,” said Megan Woods.
