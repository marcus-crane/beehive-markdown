Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Priyanca Radhakrishnan, has announced the reappointment of Gwendoline Keel as chair of the Charities Registration Board Te Rātā Atawhai.

“Gwendoline’s legal knowledge, experience in kaupapa Māori organisations and involvement as a board member, provide her with a solid foundation to continue as board chair,” Priyanca Radhakrishnan said.

“The extensive knowledge about charities law and reporting requirements that Gwendoline brings will ensure continuity of board operations and the Charities Act reform process,” Priyanca Radhakrishnan said.

The Charities Registration Board Te Rātā Atawhai makes decisions on the registration and deregistration of charities.

Gwendoline was first appointed to the board in December 2019 and promoted to chair in September 2021. Her knowledge of te ao Māori, kaupapa Māori charities and the Māori charitable sector has been valuable for the Board.

The new term of office for Gwendoline is from 7 November 2022 to 6 November 2025.
