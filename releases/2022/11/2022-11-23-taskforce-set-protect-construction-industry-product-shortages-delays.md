- New ‘Critical Materials Taskforce’ will trouble shoot building materials shortages
- Focus on maximising productivity & cushioning businesses from supply chain risks
- Successful ‘Plasterboard Taskforce’ reshaped to include broader sector knowledge and expertise
- Will provide guidance, data and information to support builders, designers and business owners

A new Critical Materials Taskforce will bring together industry experts to watch for emerging supply chain risks in the building and construction industry, the Minister for Building and Construction Megan Woods says.

The new entity includes sector leaders from the Government’s Plasterboard Taskforce which was set up in June 2022, and has been reshaped to incorporate experts covering smaller operations, design, consenting, products and procurement.

“The Critical Materials Taskforce will build on the successes of the Plasterboard Taskforce and use the valuable lessons learnt to be proactive and forward-looking, so we can identify emerging risks and respond as quickly as possible,” Megan Woods said.

Since the beginning of January to October 2022, there has been a 444 per cent increase in the amount of plasterboard imported into New Zealand. A total of 4.6 million square metres of plasterboard and plaster-related products have been imported into New Zealand between January and October; enough to build over 9,000 homes.

“Bringing together construction, building consent, and supply chain experts into a taskforce earlier this year showed how government and the sector successfully worked together to trouble shoot plasterboard shortages quickly and pragmatically. We didn’t over complicate. Industry talked. We listened. It worked.

“While we can be optimistic about the opportunities for our economy, we also need to remain cautious. We know we are facing a period of global turmoil. There will be more headwinds, which potentially means more materials shortages. We are ready,” Megan Woods said.

The Ministry of Building, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) will lead the Critical Materials and Products Work Programme (CMAP Programme) in partnership with the Critical Materials Taskforce.

The Taskforce will proactively explore what’s happening in the building materials sector to provide guidance, advice, data and information and inform the CMAP Programme so they can mitigate emerging supply risks.

The Minister for Building and Construction Megan Woods will be kept informed of the work programme and the taskforce’s meetings and actions through weekly reports from MBIE.

Since the beginning of January to October 2022, there has been a 444 per cent increase in the amount of plasterboard imported. This increasing trend in plasterboard imports is expected to continue through the end of the calendar year.

From the beginning of January to October 2022, a total of 4.6 million square metres of plasterboard and plaster-related products were imported into New Zealand – this is enough to build over 9,000 homes (based on the assumption that an average of 500 sqm of plasterboard is used per home).
