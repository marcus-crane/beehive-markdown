The first of many builds for Ngāti Whakaue Lands Trust was delivered today with Associate Minister of Housing (Māori Housing) Peeni Henare attending the opening of  eight affordable whānau homes.

“House by house, whānau by whānau, we are working together to address housing needs. Ngati Whākaue are walking the talk when tackling homeownership rates, with a  percentage of homes they build to be sold to Ngāti Whakaue descendants. This could include close to 150 homes,” Peeni Henare said.

“This is an example of what partnership looks like with the Government investing $55 million to fund the infrastructure towards the builds. This investment includes $35 million for improvements to SH30 – expected to be completed by mid-2023. The improvements, through to Wharenui Road, will address key transport constraints to future stages of Ngāti Whakaue Tribal Lands Wharenui Rise development. 

 “A further $20 million was committed to Rotorua Lakes Council for other enabling infrastructure for Wharenui Rise. This included $5 million for local roading improvements and $15 million for sewerage and stormwater infrastructure,” Peeni Henare Said.

Peeni Henare also announced a new intergenerational housing project targeted at public

and affordable housing, which will be built over three stages to be completed in the next six

years. The Manawa Gardens Development located on 16 Hectares of Māori titled land

owned by Ngāti Whakaue Tribal Lands on Wharenui Road, close to the Wharenui Rise

Development. 

“This exciting, new development will provide a community focused, environmentally friendly

living space with affordable homes and kaumatua housing. Land development is underway

with construction due to commence mid next year,” Peeni Henare said.

Minister for Housing, Dr Megan Woods, said “this investment will result in the building of around 1,100 new homes at Wharenui Rise, bringing much-needed housing to the whānau and communities of Ngāti Whakaue.

“We know that we cannot tackle this housing crisis alone. The key to success lies in partnership, and the partnership the Government and Ngāti Whakaue have established is continuing to deliver real housing opportunities to those that need it the most,” Megan Woods said.

“This Government is committed to tackling the housing crisis, to investing in key infrastructure to enable housing developments and to working in partnership with Māori to build houses and grow communities. The opening of eight new whānau whare today is an example of what is possible when we work together,” Peeni Henare said.
