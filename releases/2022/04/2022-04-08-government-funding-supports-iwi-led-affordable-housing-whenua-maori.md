Associate Minister of Housing (Māori Housing) Peeni Henare this morning joined partners Toitū Tairāwhiti to open a newly built home for a whānau of 10 at Te Karaka, the fourth of twenty five homes to be delivered in the Tairāwhiti region as part of the Government’s MAIHI Partnerships Programme.

“It’s fantastic to be here in Te Karaka alongside Toitū Tairāwhiti to see another iwi-led new build home opened to a deserving whānau. Seeing another whānau move into a warm dry home is another step forward for the Government’s Māori Housing strategy” Peeni Henare said.

Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga – Ministry of Housing and Urban Development is collaborating with iwi to deliver more homes to local whānau. This is the fourth of twenty five homes that will be delivered in the Tairāwhiti area, helping whānau into quality, affordable housing.

“Over the past year, Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga have worked with hapū and iwi to support their housing aspirations and seize opportunities to ensure whānau in need can have an affordable home,” said Peeni Henare.

“Today we take time to celebrate this milestone and get more whānau into affordable housing.

“This Government has made a commitment to do things differently in terms of Māori Housing. I am committed to ensuring that we continue to partner with hapū and iwi to deliver more affordable housing for Māori. That’s why last year we launched our National Māori Housing strategy – MAIHI Ka Ora. It promised partnership, investment and progress.

“The opening of this home sees us delivering on the promises we made in MAIHI Ka Ora, the promise we made to work in partnership with Māori, and the commitment to delivering a better Māori Housing future for our whānau,” Peeni Henare said.
