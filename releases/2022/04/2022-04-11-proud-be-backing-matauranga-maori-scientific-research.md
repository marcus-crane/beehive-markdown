- Indigenous innovation – contributing to economic growth through distinctive science and innovation
- Taiao – achieving environmental sustainability through iwi and hapū relationships with land and sea
- Hauora/Oranga – improving health and social wellbeing
- Mātauranga – exploring indigenous knowledge and science and innovation.

Sixteen projects including a horticultural and food enterprise, a study into intergenerational iwi knowledge, and ways of bringing traditional and modern engineering streams together will receive funding through the latest round of the Te Pūnaha Hihiko: Vision Mātauranga Capability Fund, RSI Minister Megan Woods and Māori Development Minister Willie Jackson announced today.

“This Fund is all about supporting the many opportunities that come from strengthening mātauranga Māori and the science and innovation system in a way that embraces both bodies of knowledge as complementary,” says Megan Woods.

“In this tenth round of investment I’m excited to see how these 16 projects will inspire new understanding for both iwi and research organisations, so we can find new solutions for the benefit of all of Aotearoa New Zealand, whilst potentially also coming up with new pathways for commercial opportunities.

“For example Rangitāne o Manawatū will work with Massey University and Plant and Food to look at what needs to happen to develop the karaka nut as a potential commercial enterprise. We know the kernel is a gluten-free source of carbohydrate and protein and has the potential to be a useful food source, however, its toxins need to be eliminated, and that’s where mātauranga Māori comes in,” Megan Woods said.

“Our ability to create a better future is strengthened through every one of these projects and I want to personally congratulate them for their hard mahi” says Willie Jackson.

“Mātauranga spans Māori knowledge, culture, values and worldview. Protecting and developing mātauranga Māori is a key factor in preserving our country’s uniqueness. I am proud to see Māori knowledge and research continue to grow,” Willie Jackson said.

“This investment demonstrates the Government’s continued support for science and innovation as we continue our economic rebuild from Covid-19,” Megan Woods said.

**Editor’s notes**

Established in 2010, the Vision Mātauranga Capability Fund invests around $4 million each investment round into projects across two schemes: the Connect Scheme, which builds new connections between Māori organisations and the science and innovation system; and the Placement Scheme, which enhances the development of an individual(s) through placement in a Partner organisation.

MBIE makes final funding decisions based on recommendations of an independent Assessment Panel.

The 2022 round is the tenth investment round of the fund.
