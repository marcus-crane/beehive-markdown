Minister of Foreign Affairs Nanaia Mahuta today congratulated Hon Hu'akavameiliku Siaosi Sovaleni on being appointed Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Tonga.

“Aotearoa New Zealand and Tonga have an enduring bond and the Kingdom is one of our closest neighbours in the Pacific. We look forward to working with Prime Minister Hon Hu'akavameiliku Siaosi Sovaleni and the new Cabinet in the spirit of partnership,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“We will continue to work side-by-side with Tonga to implement the Statement of Partnership signed in 2019, which sets out joint priorities for cooperation, particularly climate change, stability and security and people and prosperity,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

The friendship between Aotearoa New Zealand and Tonga derives from our shared Polynesian roots and is reinforced by the rich connections between our peoples, including the more than 80,000 Tongans calling Aotearoa New Zealand home.

“The Tongan diaspora are an integral part of Aotearoa New Zealand and active contributors to our strong relationship.” Nanaia Mahuta said.

The Minister of Foreign Affairs also acknowledged outgoing Prime Minister Hon Pohiva Tu’i’onetoa and his contribution to Tonga.
