The Prime Minister has officially opened the Hawke’s Bay Regional Aquatic Centre today saying it is a huge asset to the region and to the country.

“This is a world class facility which will be able to host national and international events including the world championships. With a 10-lane Olympic pool, training pool, hydrotherapy centre and seating capacity of up to 1,662 people, this is a facility that Hawke’s Bay and New Zealand can be proud of.

“I am so delighted to see this project come to fruition and want to acknowledge Sir Graeme Avery whose passion and vision has been a huge part in its successful development,” Jacinda Ardern said.

The Government invested $32 million into the project through the Infrastructure Reference Group as part of the COVID-19 recovery.

“This facility is an excellent example of good quality infrastructure investment creating 88 jobs during construction and further employment opportunities now that it is open.” Stuart Nash said

“The improved recreational water facilities will also mean children will be able to take part in learn-to-swim and water safety classes. The health and wellbeing of people wider region, from Wairoa to Waipukurau, will benefit from this asset.

“The potential economic spinoffs for the region are enormous with major events, including world championships, able to be held here.”
