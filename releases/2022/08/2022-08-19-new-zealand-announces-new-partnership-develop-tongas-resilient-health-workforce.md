Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta has concluded her visit to Tonga, meeting the Minister of Health Dr Saia Piukala and frontline healthcare workers in Nuku’alofa.

“As a country in and of the Pacific, New Zealand has done all we can to assist our Pacific whānau prepare and navigate through various COVID-19 outbreaks,” Nanaia Mahuta.

“While this has been challenging at times, particularly through our ongoing domestic response, we remain committed to our Pacific partners.

“To further strengthen resilience and develop Tonga’s health workforce, Aotearoa New Zealand is funding a $4.8 million partnership programme over the next four years.

“Under the new partnership, Massey University will help Tonga plan for service needs, train staff, and allocate healthcare workers to where they are most needed.

“In Tonga, New Zealand are proud to be key partners in the health sector. We stand firmly alongside the Tongan health workforce as it manages COVID-19 and recovers from January’s Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha’apai volcanic eruption and tsunami,” Nanaia Mahuta said.
