I am honoured to support the 2022 Women in Governance Awards, celebrating governance leaders, directors, change-makers, and rising stars in the community, said Minister for Pacific Peoples Aupito William Sio.

For the second consecutive year, MPP is proudly sponsoring the Pacific Governance Leader category, recognising Pacific women in governance and presented to a woman who is acknowledged as an experienced and reputable governance leader at a regional or national level, championing gender diversity and equity.

“This is a fiercely fought over category, with a high calibre of Pacific women in the running to receive the prestigious award,” Aupito William Sio said.

“In 2021, Caren Rangi ONZM – Chair of the Arts Council of New Zealand Toi Aotearoa - Creative New Zealand's governing body - received the Pacific Governance Leader award, which has set the bar very high.

“However, we are seeing more and more talent stepping up to the mark, and I know we are in good hands, with these brilliant women.”

This year’s Pacific Governance Leader nominees include, Erolia Eteuati Rooney, Jemaima Tiatia, Meleane Burgess and Pauline-Jean Luyten.

Pacific women featured in other categories include Mele Wendt MNZM, in the Not-For-Profit Governance Leader category, sponsored by Ministry for Women.

Hosted by Women on Boards New Zealand in conjunction with Governance New Zealand, the awards will be announced tonight, at a gala dinner held at Parliament’s Banquet Hall.

Aupito William Sio said MPP works hard to encourage more Pacific women into governance, by regularly running courses and training.

“Pacific women are natural-born leaders, and it is an exciting time when we start to see more Pacific women at the table. I would like to congratulate all of the nominees for their contributions to good governance and wish them all the best with their ongoing work – ia manuia” Aupito William Sio said.
