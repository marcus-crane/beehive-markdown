The communities of Māngere and Onehunga share a greater connection today with the opening of the Old Māngere Bridge Replacement, delivering environmental, social and economic benefits, announced Transport Minister Michael Wood. 

“The Government is upgrading New Zealand’s transport system to make it safer, greener, and more efficient for now and future generations to come,” Michael Wood said.

“Our Government’s commitment to infrastructure investment will continue to play a critical part in securing New Zealand’s economy and supporting communities to thrive.

“Providing not only an important strategic connection as part of the wider walking and cycling network in Auckland, the new bridge will also be a place for whānau and friends to gather, sit and enjoy their surroundings. Creating spaces and places which recognise and acknowledge how locals enjoy their neighbourhood is important to ensure that we’re creating liveable places for future generations.

“The Old Māngere Bridge closed in late 2018 due to safety concerns and had stood in the Manukau Harbour for over 100 years since its opening in 1915. It was well loved by the community for many generations, and the designs of the new bridge reflects the cultural and heritage values of the surrounding area.

“Iwi artworks, two dedicated fishing bays as well as bench seating and a heritage garden all feature as part of the new bridge for the local community and visitors to enjoy. In addition, lighting on the arch and piers to create an architectural feature within the Manukau Harbour and on the balustrade to extend the hours of safe use after sunset.

“The path along the bridge is also designed to be accessible for a wide range of users.

“Delivering on projects such as this helps address our current infrastructure deficit while also meeting future needs caused by population growth and climate change. It is the latest in a large number of completed projects providing more transport choices to people in Auckland and around New Zealand,” Michael Wood said.

Minister Wood was joined by mana whenua, Auckland mayor Phil Goff, iwi and stakeholders to cut the ribbon on the new bridge which is already being enjoyed by the community.
