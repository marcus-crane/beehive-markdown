The Associate Minister of Education, Aupito William Sio, has today announced the recipients of the Tulī Takes Flight scholarships which were a key part of last year’s Dawn Raids apology.

The scholarships are a part of the goodwill gesture of reconciliation to mark the apology by the New Zealand Government for the Dawn Raids in the 1970s.

As part of the gesture of reconciliation package, the Ministry of Education established the Tulī Takes Flight scholarships for Aotearoa Pacific peoples.

“The Tulī scholarships can support Pacific people to reach their potential by reducing some of the financial barriers to study or training. One year on, I am delighted to announce the first Tulī Takes Flight scholars.

“The Tulī bird which migrates across the Pacific is a powerful symbol of our Aotearoa Pacific peoples and their determination to succeed,” said Aupito William Sio.

Students can receive between $10,000 dollars and $30,000  dollars depending on the  scholarship.  Budget 2022 allocated $815,000 over 4 years for  additional career changer Tulī scholarships.

This is the first year of the Tulī scholarships and  35 scholarships have been awarded this year.

“I am really pleased that such a wide variety of study is represented. Everything from nursing to construction management to teaching . These scholarships are a feast that will be instrumental in boosting the employment horizons of our Pasifika people, “ said Aupito William Sio.
