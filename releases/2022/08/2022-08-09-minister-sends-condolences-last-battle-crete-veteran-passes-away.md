Minister for Veterans, Hon Meka Whaitiri sends her condolences to the last Battle for Crete veteran.

“I am saddened today to learn of the passing of Cyril Henry Robinson known as Brant Robinson, who is believed to be the last surviving New Zealand veteran of the Battle for Crete, Meka Whaitiri said

It was one of the most brutal campaigns New Zealand forces have ever undertaken.

“Our veterans display extraordinary aspects of service and with the passing of Brant Robinson it’s our duty to ensure that service is remembered, Meka Whaitiri said

Just before dawn on 20 May, 1941, New Zealand soldiers and the Cretan people banded together and fiercely fought enemy paratroopers.

Brant Robinson was one of many Kiwi soldiers who put up a spirited and courageous resistance and proved once again what a formidable force New Zealanders are of those who seek to crush freedom.

Mr Robinson counted himself lucky to have survived the Battle for Crete, having experienced the loss of close friends and comrades. 

"Today I express my deepest condolences to his family, and acknowledge the service and personal sacrifice he made in serving our country.” Meka Whaitiri said
