The Government’s Temporary Accommodation Service (TAS) has been activated to support people who’ve been displaced by the severe flooding and landslips in Nelson Tasman and Marlborough regions, Housing Minister Megan Woods has announced.

“TAS is now accepting registrations from those who cannot return to their homes and need assistance finding temporary accommodation, and who have not already been contacted by TAS’s Matching and Placement Team with help to find suitable accommodation.

“TAS is working closely with local authorities in the Nelson, Tasman and Marlborough regions to assess the damage, establish how many homes have been affected, and to scope the longer term need. We expect to have a fuller picture in the coming weeks as more people register with our services.

“The TAS team will work with everyone who’s been affected to find available accommodation and I urge anyone who needs their help to register their details. So far 21 households have registered.

“In the past the service proved very successful in the Christchurch and Kaikōura earthquakes and in the Napier and Westport floods. The level of damage and displacement indicates that TAS support is needed in the Nelson Tasman and Marlborough regions,” Megan Woods said.

**Notes to Editors**

**Flood assistance the Government has provided so far:**

- The Government has made initial contributions of $400,000 to the Mayoral Relief Funds in Nelson/Tasman and Marlborough.
- Financial assistance from The Ministry of Social Development via Civil Defence Payments is available to support people impacted by the Nelson/Marlborough weather event. People don’t have to be on a benefit to qualify for a Civil Defence payment, and it is not income or asset tested.
- Enhanced Taskforce Green has been activated to provide workers to help farmers and growers complete clean-up work on their properties. This may include clearing debris, clearing fence lines and repairing buildings and waterways. It also provides support to enable public assets such as community halls and gardens, playgrounds and public spaces to be returned to the same condition they were prior to the event
- Ministry of Primary industries announced a medium scale classification for the event and made $120,000 available for local Rural Support Trusts and Mayoral Relief Funds in the Top of the South to help farmers and growers recover.
- In addition to these initial financial contributions there has been staff deployed from multiple government agencies to support the local response and recovery.

**About TAS:**

Temporary accommodation is different to ‘shelter’ and ‘emergency accommodation’, which is provided for a short period of time by civil defence and emergency management agencies. Temporary accommodation is used for a short to medium term, providing accommodation while repairs are undertaken following a natural disaster.

Wherever possible TAS uses existing, undamaged residential housing as temporary accommodation. Where there is a shortage of rental accommodation in the affected area, TAS procures and deploys additional housing supply for temporary accommodation to support residential housing recovery.

The Temporary Accommodation Service remains active in response to the July 2021 flooding in Westport, March 2022 flooding events in Tokomaru Bay and the Levin Tornado in May 2022.
