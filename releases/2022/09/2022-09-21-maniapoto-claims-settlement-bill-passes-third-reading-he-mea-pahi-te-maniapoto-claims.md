Nā te Minita mō ngā Take Tiriti o Waitangi, nā Andrew Little,  te iwi o Maniapoto i rāhiri i tēnei rā ki te mātakitaki i te pānuitanga tuatoru o te Maniapoto Claims Settlement Bill - te pikinga whakamutunga o tā rātou whakataunga Tiriti o Waitangi o mua.

"Me mihi ka tika ki te tokomaha o Maniapoto i haere tawhiti mai - mā runga pahi, tereina, waka rererangi, aha rānei - ki te kite i te rā nui whakaharahara nei  me te whakaaro ki ērā atu o rātou tē taea te haere ā-tinana mai i te rangi nei," te kī a Andrew Little.

"He wā tino whakahirahira tēnei, ā, he wā i oti mai ai ngā mahi whakapau kaha i a rātou ngā rōpū whiriwhiri o Maniapoto, me te Karauna. He tohu hoki i te kaha, te manawanui me te aumangea o te iwi o Maniapoto."

Kei Te Rohe Pōtae  te iwi o Maniapoto, kei ngā takiwā o Te Kūiti, Mōkau, Ōtorohanga, Te Awamutu, me Kāwhia. E toro atu ana tō rātou wāhi whai pānga ki te  rohe moana, ki tētahi wāhanga o te rohe ohaoha urukati. Ko te whakatau tata ko tōna 45,930 te rahi o Maniapoto (e ai ki te tatauranga 2018).

Kei roto i te Whakataunga he whakamihinga me tētahi whakapāha nā te Karauna ki āna takahitanga o nehe i te Tiriti o Waitangi ki te iwi o Maniapoto.

"Ko ngā nawe mai anō a Ngāti Maniapoto, e pā ana ki ngā matenga i hua mai i ngā whawhai ki te Karauna me ngā utu i pēhitia e ngā Pakanga o Aotearoa," hei tā Andrew Little.

“I takahi rawatia e te Karauna te mana motuhake o Maniapoto, kīhai i manaaki ngā whakaaetanga o roto i Te Ōhākī Tapu i takoto atu ai i ngā tau 1880, mō te whakahaere hoki i te whenua me te mana motuhake o Maniapoto, ka mutu ka riro whakatuma atu te whenua o Maniapoto i te Karauna."

Nā ngā whakaaetanga i te tau 1885, i hīkina e Maniapoto te Aukati i runga i ō rātou whenua, ka mutu ka hoatu te taiaha, Maungārongo, ki te Pāremata hei tohu  o te rangimārie, hei tohu hoki i te wā.  Nā te aukati i ārai tā te kāwanatanga whakamahi i tōna mana mai anō i ngā Pakanga o Waikato, heoi anō i te hikinga ake, i tere te rokohanga o ngā whenua o Maniapoto  i te hokohoko a te Karauna. Mai i taua wā kua puritia te taiaha e te Whare Taonga o Ōtākou.

Ko ngā kawenga i tēnei rā ko te whakahokinga atu o te taiaha, o Maungārongo ki te Pāremata – he mea hoatu taurewa e Maniapoto mō te rima tau hei tohu o te ū ki tētahi hononga hou.

"E tohu ana tēnei rā i tētahi tīmatanga hou ki te whakatinana i ngā kī taurangi ki a Maniapoto, ā, ko taku tūmanako nui, mā tēnei whakataunga me tēnei rangapūtanga hou ka noho i runga i te aroha a tētahi ki tētahi, me te mahi tahi hei oranga, hei tōnuitanga hoki mō Ngāti Maniapoto ki tua," ko tā Andrew Little.

Ko te whakaaetanga whakataunga e whakarato i a Maniapoto ki te puretumu ahumoni, ki te arumoni hoki $165 miriona. Ka whakahoki anō hoki te whakataunga i ngā wāhi ahurea hira e toru tekau mā ono me te whakarato ara mō te hono atu ki ngā tari Karauna matua.

"I waitohua te Whakaaetanga Whakataunga i Noema 2021 i te wā o ngā whakatiki KOWHEORI-19, i te wā tē taea te tūtaki kanohi ki te kanohi. E tāria ana e au te haere atu ki roto o Maniapoto ki tō ratou anō rohe mō te tukunga o te whakapāha a te Karauna hei te mutunga o tēnei tau," i kī a Andrew Little.

**KA MUTU**

**Maniapoto Claims Settlement Bill passes third reading**

Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Andrew Little today welcomed Maniapoto to Parliament to witness the third reading of the Maniapoto Claims Settlement Bill - the final milestone in their historical Treaty of Waitangi settlement process.

“I want to acknowledge the many Maniapoto who have travelled long distances - by bus, train, plane and other means - to witness this historic moment and also those who could not be at parliament today in person,” Andrew Little said.

“This is a momentous occasion and one that is possible due to the tireless work of the negotiation teams for both Maniapoto and the Crown. It is also testament to the strength, patience, and determination of Maniapoto.”

Maniapoto is based in Te Rohe Pōtae (the King Country), in and around Te Kūiti, Mōkau, Ōtorohanga, Te Awamutu, and Kāwhia. Their area of interest extends out to the marine environment and part of the exclusive economic zone. Maniapoto has an estimated population of 45,930 members (2018 census).

The settlement package includes an acknowledgement and apology by the Crown for its historical breaches of the Treaty towards Maniapoto.

“Maniapoto’s historical grievances relate to loss of life in conflicts with the Crown and bearing the costs of the New Zealand Wars,” Andrew Little said.

“The Crown deliberately undermined Maniapoto independence, failed to uphold Ōhākī Tapu agreements made in the 1880s relating to Maniapoto land administration and self-determination, and acquired Maniapoto land in an aggressive manner.”

On the basis of the agreements in 1885, Maniapoto lifted the aukati (prohibition) over their land and gifted the taiaha, Maungārongo, to Parliament as a symbol of peace to mark the occasion. The aukati had prevented the practical exercise of state authority since the Waikato Wars but when it was lifted, Crown purchasing rapidly led to Maniapoto losing vast amounts of land. The taiaha has since been held by the Otago Museum.

Today’s ceremony included the return of the taiaha, Maungārongo, to Parliament – provided on loan by Maniapoto for five years as a gesture of commitment to a renewed relationship.

“Today marks a new beginning in realising the promises made to Maniapoto, and it is my sincere hope that this settlement and new partnership based on mutual trust, respect and co-operation will provide for the future wellbeing and prosperity of Maniapoto,” Andrew Little said.

The settlement package provides Maniapoto with financial and commercial redress of $165 million. The settlement also returns thirty-six sites of cultural significance and provides for relationship instruments with key Crown agencies.

“The Deed of Settlement was signed in November 2021 during COVID-19 restrictions, when we were not able to meet kanohi ki te kanohi. I look forward to visiting Maniapoto in their rohe for the delivery of the Crown apology later this year,” Andrew Little said.
