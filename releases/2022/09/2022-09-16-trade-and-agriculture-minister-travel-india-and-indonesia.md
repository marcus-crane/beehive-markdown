Minister of Trade and Export Growth and Minister of Agriculture Damien O’Connor will travel tomorrow to India and Indonesia for trade and agricultural meetings to further accelerate the Government’s growing trade agenda.

“Exploring ways we can connect globally and build on our trading relationships is a priority for the Government, and is part of our plan to provide greater economic security for New Zealanders,” Damien O’Connor said.

“India is a priority relationship for New Zealand, it was our 15th largest trading partner in the year to December 2021, and we are committed to broadening and deepening our partnership,” Damien O’Connor said.

“New Zealand and India already have strong people, trade, economic, and agricultural ties, and with both of our countries’ economies continuing to expand, there is opportunity to further our connections.

“I’ll have a number of bilateral meetings with counterparts to specifically progress opportunities for agricultural cooperation and broadening our trade relationship.

“While in New Delhi, I’ll meet with a delegation led by the India New Zealand Business Council (INZBC), which includes a number of key New Zealand business and exporters operating in India, to discuss ways the we can support our businesses with export growth,” Damien O’Connor said.

As Agriculture Minister he will also speak at the ‘Farm to Fork’ panel, showcasing New Zealand’s investments in agri-tech, on-farm training and skills development, and climate-responsive farming as part of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) LEADS Conference.

“I look forward to speaking at the LEADS conference, and engaging with the INZBC delegation, which represents the depth and breadth of New Zealand’s trade and investment interests in India,” Damien O’Connor said. 

While in India, Damien O’Connor will meet with ministerial counterparts. 

**Indonesia leg**

Damien O’Connor will then travel to Bali, Indonesia, to attend the G20 Trade, Investment, and Industry Ministerial Meeting.

This will be the second time he has been invited and attended the G20 Trade Ministerial Meeting, after attending the 2021 G20 meeting in Italy following New Zealand’s chairing of APEC 2021. It is rare for a member outside the G20 to be invited for a second year in a row.

“I am looking forward to representing New Zealand again at the G20 as the invitee of this year’s President, Indonesia,” Damien O’Connor said.

“Attendance at the G20, at this crucial juncture for the global economy, is a valuable opportunity to participate in discussions with the world’s largest and most influential economies.

“The meeting will focus on ensuring international trade and investment delivers an inclusive and sustainable global economic recovery - all areas New Zealand has proudly championed.”

While in Bali, Damien O’Connor will also meet with ministerial counterparts and local business stakeholders to discuss bilateral as well as regional trade and economic issues.

Damien O’Connor will be in India on 19-20 September, and will then travel to Indonesia on 21-23 September. He will return to New Zealand on 24 September.
