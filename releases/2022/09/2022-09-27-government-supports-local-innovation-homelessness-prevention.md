- Ten successful applicants in round two of the Local Innovation and Partnership Fund (LIPF)
- Close to $6 million allocated as part of the Homelessness Action Plan (HAP)
- Māori, Pasefika and rangatahi a strong focus
- Round three opening later this year with up to $6.8 million available.

Government is stepping up its support of community leadership in homelessness prevention with 10 new recipients of the Local Innovation and Partnership Fund (LIPF) confirmed today by Associate Minister of Housing (Homelessness), Marama Davidson.

“I am thrilled to confirm close to $6 million has been allocated to 10 initiatives as part of the Aotearoa New Zealand Homelessness Action Plan. *(Successful initiatives are outlined below).*

“Supporting local leadership is essential for helping prevent and respond to homelessness in the community. Our local leaders have the knowledge and connections to bring about effective change that best meets the needs of their people and regions.

“These 10 initiatives will have a strong focus on Māori, Pasefika and rangatahi as part of this Government’s commitment to supporting communities that are more likely to experience discrimination and isolation,” says Marama Davidson.

“The standard of all applicants was extremely high, and I would like to mihi to all 38 applicants who submitted proposals for this important work.

“I am also pleased to announce that round three of the Fund will open in the coming months and I encourage potential applicants to start considering projects for submission.”

The $16.6 million [Local Innovation and Partnership Fund](https://www.hud.govt.nz/our-work/the-local-innovation-and-partnership-fund/) was set up in 2020 and is one of 18 actions set out in the Aotearoa/ New Zealand Homelessness Action Plan to support local initiatives that respond and prevent homelessness.

**Note to editors**

- The Local Innovation and Partnership Fund (LIPF) is one of the key actions of the Aotearoa New Zealand Homelessness Action Plan (HAP) that supports the Government’s vision that homelessness is prevented where possible, or is rare, brief and non-recurring.
- As part of the HAP, $16.6 million was committed over three years (2020 to 2023) to support local initiatives in responding to and preventing homelessness.
- Different regions experience different drivers and causes of homelessness that are not always addressed by existing national policy programmes or operations. LIPF enables locally designed innovative initiatives to be funded, planned and implemented in a local area.
- LIPF is enabling Māori providers, hapū, iwi, community groups, non-government organisations and local councils to work together on initiatives to address system gaps and improve support or prevention tailored to needs in that area.
- LIPF is supporting a range of initiatives that align to projects to address or prevent homelessness. It does not fund housing supply such as purchase or lease of land, buildings, new builds or property to provide accommodation for people experiencing homelessness.
- Close to $10 million was allocated in the first two rounds of the fund with a total of 17 initiatives across New Zealand.
