Minister of Immigration Michael Wood will travel to Washington D.C this week to represent New Zealand at the annual Five Country Ministerial.

The Five Country Ministerial (commonly known as the FCM) is an annual meeting of home affairs, public safety, interior, security, border and immigration Ministers from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Ministers meet to discuss national security challenges of mutual interest and concern and to discuss opportunities for collaboration. 

“Ministers will be discussing a range of issues, including responses to emerging crises, violent extremism, migration pathways, online threats, countering foreign interference and supporting international norms and the rules-based order,” Michael Wood said.

“New Zealand has a close, enduring working relationship with these partners and I look forward to sharing the insights from our region on these important issues.”

In addition to meetings with Ministerial counterparts, Minister Wood will also meet with Immigration New Zealand staff and visit the U.S Customs and Border Protection agency while in Washington D.C.
