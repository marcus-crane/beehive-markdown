Food Safety Minister Meka Whaitiri will be addressing the World Dairy Summit in New Delhi in September, the flagship event of the International Dairy Federation.

“The World Dairy Summit brings together leaders from across the global dairy sector to share knowledge about how the sector can help nourish the world with safe and sustainable dairy products,” Meka Whaitiri said.

“It will provide a valuable opportunity to promote internationally Aotearoa’s world-class food safety system and both Government and sector efforts to lower environmental impacts from production and the opportunities they will bring.

“Aotearoa New Zealand has an indigenous food story, unique to our farmers, our producers, our whenua and our people.”

Minister Whaitiri said the visit also provides the opportunity to strengthen agricultural cooperation between India and New Zealand and explore opportunities for further cultural and agricultural exchanges.

“India is an important partner to Aotearoa New Zealand, and we enjoy a long-standing friendship. Our two countries share close people to people ties, and I’m looking forward to building on these strong and lasting relationships.”

Minister Whaitiri said India is a key market for New Zealand’s food and fibre products, with exports topping $310 million in the year to 30 June 2022.

“Throughout my visit, I also want to promote our high quality, high value food and beverage, and showcase New Zealand’s food safety and innovation expertise.”

During the Summit, Minister Whaitiri will meet with Ministers and senior officials, and will also make a one day visit to Singapore to meet the Minister for Sustainability and Environment, senior officials and industry representatives, to discuss food safety, technology and innovation.

Minister Whaitiri will be travelling between 10 and 17 September 2022.
