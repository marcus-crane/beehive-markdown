Communities across the country will benefit from newly upgraded sporting facilities as a result of New Zealand co-hosting the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023.

The Government is investing around $19 million to support upgrades at 30 of the 32 potential sporting facilities earmarked for the tournament, including pitch, lighting and facility enhancements, and gender-neutral changing spaces.

The venues and local councils are also contributing to the costs of these upgrades.

“The FIFA Women’s World Cup is the largest women’s sporting event on the planet. Hosting an event of this magnitude will generate significant social and economic benefits for Aotearoa New Zealand and leave a lasting legacy for football and women’s sport in this country,” Grant Robertson said.

“These upgrades are critical to ensure the success of the tournament, but will also benefit local communities, football clubs and many different sporting codes that use these facilities, which is another great reason to invest in them.

“They will also put us in a stronger position when bidding to host major international events in the future.

Four stadia will host matches during the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023: Eden Park, Waikato Stadium, Wellington Regional Stadium and Dunedin Stadium.

For the first time in the tournament’s history, FIFA has also introduced Team Base Camps – headquarters for each team that include accommodation and training facilities.

There are 21 venues in Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington, Dunedin, Rotorua, Napier, Palmerston North, Tauranga and Christchurch earmarked for Team Base Camps. Of these, 16 will end up being selected and used by teams throughout the tournament.

The Government’s investment includes $5 million through Sport New Zealand for gender neutral changing room upgrades at some of these venues.

“This is an excellent example of how Government investment in major events can drive positive, long-term change in our communities,” Grant Robertson said.

The FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023 is taking place from 20 July to 20 August 2023.

Hamilton and Auckland will also host the first ever FIFA Women's World Cup Play-Off Tournament from 17 to 23 February 2023 to determine the final three qualifiers for next year’s world cup.
