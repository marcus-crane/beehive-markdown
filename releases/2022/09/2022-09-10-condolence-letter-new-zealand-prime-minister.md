Your Majesty

On behalf of the Government of New Zealand I wish to express my sincere condolences on the death of Her Majesty The Queen, your mother.

As Queen of New Zealand, Her Majesty was loved for her grace, calmness, dedication, and public service. Her affection for New Zealand and its people was clear, and it was an affection that was shared.

Her Majesty was an important part of all our lives throughout her reign – but she was first and foremost a daughter, a sister, a mother, and a grandmother.

You have our deepest sympathies for her loss but also our gratitude for her extraordinary life of service.

I remain, Your Majesty,

Yours sincerely

Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern

**PRIME MINISTER**
