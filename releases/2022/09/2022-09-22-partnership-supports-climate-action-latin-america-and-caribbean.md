Aotearoa New Zealand is extending the reach of its support for climate action to a new agriculture initiative with partners in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Foreign Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta and Agriculture Minister Damien O’Connor announced a NZ$10 million contribution to build resilience, enhance food security and address the challenges of climate change for small-scale primary producers in the region.

“Aotearoa New Zealand’s [scaled-up climate finance commitment](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/new-zealand-increases-climate-aid-contribution) is directed at countries that are most vulnerable to the climate emergency through loss of ecosystems or biodiversity, food and water insecurity, and economic impacts on livelihoods,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“The impacts of climate change are global and often hit developing communities the hardest. Effective action requires strong partnerships to build capability and knowledge so that communities can develop local solutions.

“The new climate finance contribution will support locally-led initiatives to enable local populations to draw from traditional knowledge and build low-emissions methods of farming that are suited to their own communities.

“The programme reflects the principles established in [Tuia te Waka a Kiwa,](//www.beehive.govt.nz/release/supporting-climate-action-pacific) the government’s recently launched international climate finance strategy,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

Damien O’Connor announced the funding in a virtual speech to the [Americas Agricultural Ministers meeting](https://www.iica.int/en/press/news/ministers-agriculture-30-countries-americas-will-meet-costa-rica-prior-cop27-define) in Costa Rica today.

“The funding will contribute to a four-year Climate Smart Agriculture programme driven in partnership by the Ministry for Primary Industries and other agencies in [the Global Research Alliance](https://globalresearchalliance.org/) on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases,” Damien O’Connor said

“The Global Research Alliance (GRA) is the umbrella network for programmes to accelerate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, build climate resilience, lift productivity and improve the information available for decision-making.

“The programme supports policy makers, researchers, farmers and indigenous producers in their understanding and use of low-emission and productivity-enhancing agricultural systems, technologies and practices.

 “We are working alongside the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean because we know our collective interests depend on adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change on our environment. Our agricultural sectors have an important role to play.

“We share membership of the GRA with most countries in this region.  We value the opportunity to enhance our longstanding partnership and collaborate with this new support. All 33 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are signatories to the Paris Agreement.

“The Climate Smart Agriculture partnership with the GRA reflects our intent to connect with like-minded partners to make a difference globally with a long-term perspective. In order to respond to the global challenge of a climate emergency, we require local solutions in local contexts.

“Incorporating traditional knowledge and learning systems will better prepare a wider range of people for a sustainable future.  

“Our well-proven partnership is built on many years of working together and guided by our shared values and goals and recognises that no single country has all the answers,” Damien O’Connor said.
