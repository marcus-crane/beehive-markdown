The Pacific Aotearoa Community Outreach Fund has helped the  Pacific peoples in Aotearoa  respond proactively to the rapidly changing crisis Omicron has brought, the Minister for Pacific Peoples Aupito William Sio said.

“The fund was introduced in November last year to support the work of the Ministry for Pacific Peoples (MPP), to assist with the safe transition of Pacific communities to the COVID-19 Protection Framework.

“We closed the fund in late January, and 67 Pacific groups were selected to be fully or partially funded, to a total of approximately $1.2m.

“This is an exceptional group of organisations, who care deeply for their community, and use targeted, and tailored approaches and initiatives, along with wellbeing support services,. They are also using social connectedness to ensure the shift to the Fund  is understood by our people.

“When the fund was first released, Omicron had yet to hit New Zealand’s shores, and Delta was the main variant causing concerns in Aotearoa. 

“These funded groups have had to prove their approach can also navigate the way Omicron works, for example and  move online if there is a sudden outbreak. This is not an easy task to organise at times, yet these groups are truly adaptable.

“The Ministry of Health recently released data showing that despite Pacific People making up just eight per cent of the population, 42 per cent of Omicron COVID-19 hospitalisations are Pacific.

“Due to the impact Omicron is having on Pacific peoples, a further $18m package has been made available via MPP to support vulnerable Pacific communities to respond to these challenges.

“To all our fund recipients across New Zealand which are listed on the site below , fa’afetai lava for all the work you do and the care you have for your community,” Minister Sio said.
