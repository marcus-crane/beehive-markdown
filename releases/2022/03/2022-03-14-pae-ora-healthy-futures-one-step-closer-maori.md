Minister of Health Andrew Little and Associate Minister of Health (Māori Health) Peeni Henare have today marked a further step in Aotearoa New Zealand’s health reforms with the interim Māori Health Authority (iMHA) now able to fund providers to deliver services that will make a huge difference for whānau.

“This Government is committed to building a new national health system so all New Zealanders can get the health care they need no matter who they are or where they live,” Andrew Little said. 

“The iMHA has received its initial funding package and with a Board and Chief Executive in place, it is ready to put this putea to work.

“The iMHA will now work with Iwi-Māori Partnership Boards to create services that could include health education, pūrākau, resource development, and models centred on addressing the wider social and environmental determinants of health in their communities,” Andrew Little said.

Specific areas that have been identified by the iMHA to be funded include:

- $3 million for mātauranga Māori (traditional Māori knowledge) initiatives and services
- $6 million to support Māori providers with innovation and sustainability
- $5 million to support kaupapa Māori approaches to population health
- $2 million to expand existing rongoā services
- $2 million to support further development of the Māori workforce
- $1.1 million to support strengthening national collaboration and sharing exemplar projects
- $3.2 million has been allocated by the Māori Health Authority and the Māori Health Directorate of the Ministry of Health to supporting the establishment of Iwi-Māori Partnership Boards this year.

The $22 million comes from Budget 2021’s Māori Health Authority Commissioning funding.

“We are fixing a health system that for too long has failed to address the disproportionate health outcomes that Māori face. On average, Māori die seven years younger than other population groups. This situation cannot be allowed to continue.” Peeni Henare said.

“This initial investment will start to lay the foundation for the Authority’s ongoing role supporting kaupapa Maori health services. The iMHA has outlined its first commitments to embed and expand Te Ao Māori solutions across our health system.

“This is about putting whānau first and supporting new and different approaches that work for Māori communities. I am pleased the iMHA is getting to work quickly to commission providers to deliver services that will make a huge difference for whānau,” Peeni Henare said.

**Notes for Editors:**

The Pae Ora Healthy Futures Bill replaces the 20 District Health Boards with Health New Zealand - a new Crown organisation - to provide a national health service with a strong focus on primary health care. It also establishes an independent Māori Health Authority to work in partnership with Health New Zealand.

The Pae Ora (Healthy Futures) Bill will come into effect July 1, 2022.
