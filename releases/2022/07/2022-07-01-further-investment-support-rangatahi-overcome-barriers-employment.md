Nine new He Poutama Rangatahi programmes have been approved funding.  These programmes will provide work-readiness, training and employment initiatives for over 880 rangatahi NEETS (not in education, employment or training), across Aotearoa New Zealand. 

"He Poutama Rangatahi has proven to be a very successful initiative which supports rangatahi to overcome barriers and access to education, training and employment opportunities," Minister for Social Development and Employment Carmel Sepuloni said. 

"The Government is focused on helping rangatahi get the skills, and supports, they need to choose a career and life pathway that gives them and their whānau a better future. 

"A basic principle of He Poutama Rangatahi is the understanding that local communities are best placed to reach local ranagtahi and will already know many of the barriers they face.  

"We know it's a programme that works and, so far, it's helped 3676 rangatahi who have engaged with the programme move into education, employment or training, since it was launched in 2018.  

"The additional providers we're announcing today will ensure that more of our rangatahi have access to this incredibly positive programme.
