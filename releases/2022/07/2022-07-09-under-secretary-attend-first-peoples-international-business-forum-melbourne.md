Parliamentary Under-Secretary Rino Tirikatene will depart to Australia today to attend the First Peoples International Business Forum: Aotearoa New Zealand and Victoria, which runs from 11 to 12 July in Melbourne.

The two-day event is being hosted by the Aboriginal Economic Development group (AED), Global Victoria, Dept Jobs, Precinct and Regions (DJPR) and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE).

“This is an opportunity to for Māori businesses to participate in networking discussions with local Aboriginal Economic Development businesses and agencies, to explore and build shared understandings, trust and connections, and ultimately build a foundation for business opportunities” Rino Tirikatene said.

The Under-Secretary will be accompanying Māori businesses at the forum. He will give welcoming and closing remarks at the event, along with delivering a speech on how looking back on Te Tiriti o Waitangi influences New Zealand’s trade.

“Establishing these links and creating relationships between New Zealand Māori businesses with the First Peoples of Victoria is important in showing our government’s commitment to the “Trade for All” agenda, which ensures that everyone benefits from international trade.”

“The forum is a direct result of interactions from Te Aratini Global Indigenous Symposium at Expo 2020 Dubai, which has provided a platform for international indigenous collaboration.”

“This event comes at a relevant time following the recent Australia New Zealand Leadership Forum (ANZLF), where there was productive engagement between indigenous businesses and leaders in Sydney” Under-Secretary Tirikatene says.
