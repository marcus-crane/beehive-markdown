Accurate, robust, and relevant Iwi-Māori data is critical to achieving economic, environmental, social and cultural outcomes for Māori, Associate Minister of Statistics, Meka Whaitiri said today.

Budget 2022 is investing $5.3 million to fund Stats NZ initiatives which will support building a data ecosystem that enables Iwi-Māori to make decisions for themselves and unlock the potential for positive self-determined outcomes to achieve wellbeing.

The Government recognises these initiatives will utilise partnerships between Stats NZ, the Data Iwi Leaders Group and the Crown to pursue opportunities that will enhance Aotearoa New Zealand’s data system, addressing inequities and challenges across the data system through system-wide transformation, increased Māori data capability and capacity, and Māori data governance.

“Currently, data collected and used by the Crown does not accurately capture the full impact of how Māori contribute to the economic well-being of Aotearoa New Zealand.

“In a world of evidence-based policies and data-driven decision-making, data is an essential tool—it is an enabler.

“It empowers communities, particularly iwi, to communicate their story and secure opportunities for development, the transformation of the data system for Māori will benefit all New Zealanders,” Meka Whaitiri said.

Budget 2022 will fund a Māori Data Stocktake, an opportunity to go deeper in understanding what iwi and Māori data is held by the Crown across the Government data system, and support the Mana Ōrite Work Programme that is developing necessary data infrastructure to engage with the Crown.

Engagement with iwi, Māori and government agencies will ensure delivery of outcomes is responsive to our Tiriti partner.
