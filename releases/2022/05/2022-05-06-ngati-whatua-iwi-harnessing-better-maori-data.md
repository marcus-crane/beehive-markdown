Associate Minister of Statistics Meka Whaitiri, today announced the pilot initiative establishing a community data hub with Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Whātua.

This pilot will connect users of data with producers of data, in this case Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Whātua and Stats NZ. 

Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Whātua accepted Stats NZ’s invitation in late 2021 to develop, test, and host the data hub pilot.

An immediate focus and expressed need from Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Whātua is to ensure their housing strategy is well-supported with iwi-specific, relevant data and statistics.

Funding for the pilot was secured in 2020 by Stats NZ and the Data Iwi Leaders Group under the Digital Government Partnership Innovation Fund to improve access to data for Māori and increase data capability within iwi.

“Today’s announcement is a celebration of a new journey to empower and work alongside Māori, iwi and hapū to achieve their data aspirations and needs,” Hon Meka Whaitiri said.

Through the development of the pilot community data hub, the need for technical, data expertise has emerged, moving Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Whātua to explore the establishment of a data scholarship.

This scholarship would offer the opportunity for keen individuals to uplift their data capability through hands-on, practical experience with Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Whātua and Stats NZ.
