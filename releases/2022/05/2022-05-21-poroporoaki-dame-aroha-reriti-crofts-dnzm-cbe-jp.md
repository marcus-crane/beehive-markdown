Associate Minister for Māori Development Nanaia Mahuta wishes to acknowledge the passing of former Māori Women’s Welfare League President, Dame Aroha Reriti-Crofts (Ngāi Tūāhuriri, Ngāi Tahu).

“I am deeply saddened to hear that Dame Aroha passed away last night amongst her whānau,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“Dame Aroha was a champion for Māori women and a prominent figure for many key kaupapa in her region. She was fiercely passionate about her people, the advancement of Māori and her faith.

“I was fortunate to see her at the most recent annual conference for the Maori Women’s Welfare League where she was bright, cheerful and even sang her favourite waiata.

“Her passing will leave a significant gap in the hearts of her whānau, but I know she would be comforted in the knowledge that her legacy lives on through her children and mokopuna.

“I want to pay tribute to Dame Aroha and convey my deepest sympathy to her whānau for their sad loss - kia au to moe e te Kahurangi. Her longstanding contribution will be remembered,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

Dame Aroha Reriti-Crofts served as Kaiawhina of the Ratana and was president of the Māori Women’s Welfare League from 1990 to 1993. During her career, she was a chairperson of the Māori Women’s Development Inc and rūnanga representative of Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu representing Ngāi Tūāhuriri.
