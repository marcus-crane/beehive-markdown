Minister of State for Trade and Export Growth, Hon Phil Twyford, has tested positive for COVID-19. He tested positive from a RAT this morning after beginning to feel symptomatic on Friday evening, and is displaying moderate symptoms.

As a result he is no longer able to travel to Timor-Leste on Monday 16 May, where he was to represent the Government at the 20th Anniversary of Timor-Leste’s independence, and the inauguration of Dr Jose Ramos-Horta as Timor-Leste’s next President.

New Zealand’s ambassador to Timor-Leste, Philip Hewitt, will instead represent the New Zealand Government at these events.

“I’m disappointed I am no longer able to travel to Timor-Leste this week. It is a country I have a special connection with, and I was looking forward to representing the New Zealand Government at this important milestone, and reaffirming the strong friendship between our two countries.

“While I won’t be able to attend in person, I would like to send my best wishes to the people of Timor-Leste on the anniversary of independence, and for the inauguration of the President-elect Jose Ramos Horta. I’d also like to thank Ambassador Hewitt for agreeing to step in for me at such short notice,” Phil Twyford said.
