The Government is backing new integrated advisory services for farmers, foresters, growers and whenua Maori owners.

The Government has committed almost $34.5 million over four years to expand on-the-ground support to help Māori agribusinesses lift the productivity of their whenua, Associate Agriculture Minister Meka Whaitiri said. 

“This Budget 2022 initiative will help grow our Māori agribusiness programmes which have been specifically designed for whenua Māori entities,” Meka Whaitiri said. 

The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) launched the Māori Agribusiness Extension programme in 2019.  

“It has partnered with Māori agribusiness clusters, providing tools, support and information to explore ways to lift the productivity of their whenua. This has resulted in approved whenua development proposals,” Meka Whaitiri said. 

“Our investment in Budget 2022 includes funding to boost support for Māori agribusinesses to explore new products and markets, and provide workforce skills and training initiatives that will create new jobs and increase productivity of their primary sector assets.

The Government has committed an extra $1 billion over four years in Budget 2022 to supporting Aotearoa New Zealand’s food and fibre sector. 

“Our food and fibre sector is the driving force behind Aotearoa’s economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, Meka Whaitiri said. 

“Its continued success hinges on our ability to produce world-leading food and fibre products that keep pace with consumer preferences.”
