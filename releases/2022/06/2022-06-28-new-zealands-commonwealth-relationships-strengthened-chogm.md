Foreign Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta has concluded a visit to Rwanda reaffirming Aotearoa New Zealand’s engagement in the Commonwealth and meeting with key counterparts.

“I would like to thank President Kagame and the people of Rwanda for their manaakitanga and expert hosting of this important meeting,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“CHOGM was a valuable opportunity to reconnect New Zealand to the world through building and deepening relationships with counterparts and leaders from across the Commonwealth, including from Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean.

“The meeting reinforced the true value of the Commonwealth, as a diverse network of nations sharing democratic values and with a commitment to peace and universal human rights.

“Meeting with Pacific counterparts was also a highlight of the week and allowed me to reaffirm our connections in person. During a working lunch with Pacific counterparts, we discussed regional and global challenges, including climate change and oceans issues, and how the Commonwealth can best contribute to addressing these,” Nanaia Mahuta said.
