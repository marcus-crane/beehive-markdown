Members with a range of governance, financial and technical skills have been appointed to the Reserve Bank Board as part of the shift to strengthen the Bank’s decision-making and accountability arrangements.

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 2021 comes into force on 1 July 2022, with the establishment of a new statutory governance board, which includes members appointed by Governor General on the recommendation of the government, and also includes the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Adrian Orr.

“This is a significant change that will strengthen the institutional arrangements of the Reserve Bank,” Grant Robertson said.

“The shift to a more conventional board model brings the Reserve Bank in line with other central banks, Crown Entities and public companies in New Zealand. 

The structure protects the Bank’s independence while ensuring it operates in an accountable and transparent manner. The Board’s remit does not cover monetary policy, which remains solely the role of the Monetary Policy Committee.

“I have worked through with the transitional Board to understand the range of skills needed to fulfil the mandate of the new Board. People with both the intellectual capacity to engage with the very challenging issues, and the background of experience and perspective to be able to bring common sense, political awareness and a strong understanding of New Zealand’s economy and society to the table.

“We have also sought to get a mix of backgrounds and experience to give a wide range of perspectives.  Members not only have knowledge of the New Zealand and global economy, but also experience of managing people and culture, and digital change.

“Two highly-experienced members of the previous Board have been retained, current Chair, Professor Neil Quigley and Susan Paterson. Rodger Finlay who has been providing assistance with the transition to the new structure over recent months has also been appointed to the new Board.

“Other appointees are Byron Pepper, Professor Rawinia Higgins, Jeremy Banks and Hinerangi Raumati-Tu’ua. (Brief biographies of all members are below).

“I am delighted with the mix of people who we have been able to appoint. I am confident that they will support the Reserve Bank exceptionally well to achieve the goals set for it in the new legislation that comes into force tomorrow,” Grant Robertson said.
