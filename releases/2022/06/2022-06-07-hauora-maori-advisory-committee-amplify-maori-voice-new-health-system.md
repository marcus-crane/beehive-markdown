Pae ora (Healthy Futures) are one step closer with the appointment of members to the Interim Hauora Māori Advisory Committee.

The Committee will advise the Minister of Health on matters relating to the Māori Health Authority Board and to the Public Health Advisory Committee.

“The Committee is an important part of the new health system because it will ensure the voices of Māori will be heard at all levels of decision-making,” Health Minister Andrew Little said.

“Hauora Māori leaders will have a real say in determining equitable health outcomes for Māori through the Māori Health Authority and from direct advice to the Minister of Health, which demonstrates our commitment to fulfilling our obligations under Te Tiriti o Waitangi at all levels in the new health system.”

Eight members have been appointed to the interim Committee. Six of these members were appointed to the 2021 [Steering Group](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/steering-group-assembled-select-m%C4%81ori-health-authority-interim-board) established under the leadership of Tā Mason Durie to provide advice on governance arrangements and initial appointments to the interim Māori Health Authority.

Within the next two years, the Committee will be nominated directly by Māori through Iwi Māori Partnership Boards and Hauora Māori organisations.

Those appointed to the Committee are:

- Parekawhia McLean (Chair)
- Dr Matire Harwood
- Tā Mark Solomon
- Rahui Papa
- Amohaere Houkamau
- Lisa Tumahai
- Margareth Broodkoorn
- Dr Jim Mather

“This marks another step forward in resetting our health system so the health needs of Māori are met consistently, ensuring we all live longer and healthier lives,” Associate Minister of Health (Māori Health) Peeni Henare said.

“These members bring a wealth of knowledge, leadership experience and established relationships within Te Ao Māori, as well as in the health sector.

“Submissions on the Pae Ora Bill strongly called for increased accountability of the Māori Health Authority to Māori. In response, we agreed that the Hauora Māori Advisory Committee would be directly nominated by Māori.

“Having members of this important Committee appointed directly by Māori strikes the right balance of accountability to Māori, and to Parliament. This means an entity appointed by Māori for Māori is involved in key accountability functions, including appointments to the Board of the Māori Health Authority, leaving no doubt as to the Government’s intention to give effect to Te Tiriti partnership at the highest level of our system.

“The Committee is one more way in which the Government’s reformed health system will better utilise the talent and expertise of Māori health professionals from across Aotearoa at all levels, helping ensure health outcomes improve for Māori and non-Māori alike,” Peeni Henare said.
