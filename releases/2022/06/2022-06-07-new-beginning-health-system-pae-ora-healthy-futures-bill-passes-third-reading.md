The Government today marks a significant milestone in its commitment to deliver better health and wellbeing for all New Zealanders with The Pae Ora (Healthy Futures) Bill passing its third reading at Parliament.

“This is a landmark reform for health in Aotearoa New Zealand, and is key to righting the wrongs of inequity and unacceptable health outcomes that have for too long been suffered by too many,” Health Minister Andrew Little said.

“Removing the postcode lottery to put patients and communities at the heart of our health system is what the reforms are about. We need a system that works for all New Zealanders, and that is what we are building.”

The Bill is part of a health system reset. On July 1 it will establish Health New Zealand and the Māori Health Authority as permanent entities to replace the fragmented DHB system, establish the public health agency within the Ministry of Health, and strengthen the stewardship role of the Ministry of Health.

“All Māori want is an equitable health system that takes care of them. For far too long the status quo has failed to deliver this. That is why this Government is reforming our healthcare system,” Associate Health Minister (Māori) Peeni Henare said.

“The Pae Ora (Healthy Futures) Bill enshrines the Māori Health Authority as an equal partner at the heart of the new health system, empowering it to co-commission and plan services across the system in conjunction with HNZ, commission its own kaupapa Māori services, and monitor the performance of the health system for Māori.

“In addition to the MHA, Iwi Māori Partnership Boards will ensure that the voice of whānau is heard and [helps shape health services delivered locally](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/health-reform-govt-ensures-local-say-health-services), so that they better reflect those who need and use them.

“I am proud that Māori voices and hauora expertise will be reflected at every level of our new health system, improving outcomes for Māori and non-Māori across Aotearoa,” Peeni Henare said.

“The Labour Government promised in our 2020 manifesto to undertake a long-term programme of reform to build a stronger public health system for all New Zealanders, and the passing of this bill shows we are doing that,” Andrew Little said.  

“We have already backed the system with [multi-year budgets](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/secure-future-new-zealanders%E2%80%99-health) and the funding needed to get on with the job. Now we’re removing the structural challenges so resources can be used more effectively, IT systems can be better connected to streamline care, and patients can get treatment sooner to prevent small issues becoming bigger problems.

“New Zealanders value the amazing work of our health system, but we know we can make it better for patients and healthcare workers - that’s why we’re changing it.”

The [Pae Ora (Healthy Futures) Bill](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2021/0085/latest/LMS575405.html?search=ts_act%40bill%40regulation%40deemedreg_pae%20ora_resel_25_a&p=1) was introduced to the House October 2021.

A specially convened Select Committee considered the Bill and received 4,663 submissions.

The health system principles set out in the Pae Ora (Healthy Futures) Bill are:

1. Equitable access to health services and outcomes
2. Engagement with communities so services reflect their needs
3. Māori decision-making authority on matters of importance to them
4. Choice of quality services: quality meaning services designed for different needs
5. The importance of wellbeing, and the wider determinants of health that contribute to that

**He tīmatanga hou mō te Pūnaha Hauora: kua whakamanatia te Pire Pae Ora i tōna pānuitanga tuatoru**

Nō tēnei rā tohu mai ai te tūāoma whakahirahira a te kāwanatanga ki te whakaū i te whai oranga mō Aotearoa whānui i te whakamanatanga o te pānuitanga tuatoru o Te Pire Pae Ora ki te Whare Pāremata.

“He whakahoutanga taioreore tēnei mō te hauora o Aotearoa, ā, he kaupapa matua hei whakatika i ngā hē toharite me ngā putanga hauora kino kua roa nei e tāmi ana i te nuinga o te iwi,” te kōrero a te Minita mō ngā Take Hauora, a Andrew Little.

“Mā te tango i ngā uauatanga tuku āwhina kia noho mai ai te hunga tūroro me ngā hapori ki te iho o te pūnaha hauora, koinei te tino kaupapa o ngā whakahoutanga. E whāia ana tētahi pūnaha e whai hua ana ki a Aotearoa whānui, inā rā, koinei ngā mahi e kōkiritia ana.”

He wāhanga te pire nei i ngā whakatikatika o te pūnaha hauora. Hei te 1 o Hūrae ka whakapūmautia te noho a Hauora Aotearoa me Te Mana Hauora Māori hei hinonga tūturu hei whakakapi ake i ngā rangiruatanga o te pūnaha Poari Hauora ā-Rohe (DHB); ka whakapūmau i te tari hauora tūmatanui o roto mai i Te Manatū Hauora, me te whakakaha hoki i ngā mahi kaitiaki a Te Manatū Hauora.

“Ko te hiahia a ngāi Māori kia noho toharite ai te pūnaha hauora e manaaki nei i a rātou. Kua roa nei e noho ngere ana tēnei āhuatanga. Koinei te take e whakahoutia ana te pūnaha tautiaki e te kāwanatanga,” te kōrero a te Minita Tuarua mō ngā Take Hauora (Māori), a Peeni Henare.

“Ko tā Te Pire Pae Ora he whakaōkawa i Te Mana Hauora Māori hei kōtuinga noho toharite ki te iho o te pūnaha hauora hou, e whai mana ai tana taunaki me te whakamahere i ētahi ratonga puta noa i te pūnaha me Hauora Aoteroa (HNZ); he taunaki i ōna ake ratonga Māori, he aromātai hoki i ngā whakatutukitanga a te pūnaha hauora mō ngāi Māori.”

“Āpiti atu ki tā Te Mana Hauora Māori (MHA), ka rangona ngā reo o ngā whānau i ngā mahi a ngā Poari Kōtuinga ā-Iwi, ka āta whakaritea ngā ratonga hauora ka whāia e ngā rohe kia taka iho ai ēnei tautoko ki te hunga e tika ana.”

“E whakahī ana au ka rangona ngā reo, ka kitea hoki ngā pūkenga hauora Māori ki ia taumata o tō tātou [pūnaha hauora hou](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/health-reform-govt-ensures-local-say-health-services), ā, hei reira rā anō ka pai ake ai ngā putanga hua ki a ngāi Māori, ki a tauiwi hoki puta noa i Aotearoa,” te kōrero a Peeni Henare.”

“Nā te kāwanatanga o Te Rōpū Reipā i oati i tā mātou kupu taurangi tōrangapū o te tau 2020 kia kōkiritia he hōtaka ahunga roa hei whakahou, hei whakakaha i te pūnaha hauora tūmatanui mō Aotearoa whānui, ā, mā te whakamanatanga o tēnei pire ka kitea ai ā mātou mahi ki te whakatutuki i ēnei mahi,” te kōrero a Andrew Little.”  

“Kua pūmautia noatia ā mātou mahi ki te tautoko i te pūnaha mā roto i ngā [tahua huhua ā-tau](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/health-reform-govt-ensures-local-say-health-services) me ngā pūtea tautoko kia tutuki ai ngā mahi. Ināianei, kei te tangohia ngā uauatanga kia pai ake ai te whakamahinga o ngā rawa; he whakapai ake i te tūhononga o ngā pūnaha hangarau kia puta wawe ai ngā kaupapa tautiaki, ā, ka wawe hoki te tiaki i ngā tūroro kia kore ai ngā raru iti nei e whānui ake.”

“E whakamīharo ana a Aotearoa i ngā mahi e kōkiritia ana i tā tātou pūnaha hauora, heoi, e mōhio ana mātou he nui ngā wāhanga ki ngā tūroro me ngā kaimahi hauora ka taea te whakapai ake – koinei mātou e whai nei ki te whakarerekē i te pūnaha.”

**KUA MUTU**

**Pitopito kōrero mō te Etita:**

I whakatakotoria [Te Pire Pae Ora](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2021/0085/latest/LMS575405.html?search=ts_act%40bill%40regulation%40deemedreg_pae%20ora_resel_25_a&p=1) ki mua i te aroaro o te Pāremata i te marama o Oketopa,  2021.

4. Te mana kōwhiri i ngā ratonga: kia kōunga ngā ratonga e whakaritea ana mō ngā hiahia rerekē.
5. Te mana o te whai oranga, me ngā āhuatanga whānui e pā ana ki te hauora e whai māramatanga ai.
