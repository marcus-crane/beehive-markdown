In a first in advancing the interests of women in trade, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and New Zealand have published a review on trade and gender in New Zealand, Trade and Export Growth Minister Damien O’Connor announced.

The ‘Trade and Gender Review of New Zealand’ sheds light on the outcomes of trade for New Zealand women in three economic roles—as workers, business leaders, and consumers—and examines trade policy settings that affect them.

“The main findings of the review show that over the past two decades the number of women in export employment in New Zealand has increased, and these women tend to be higher earners than women in non-exporting employment,” Damien O’Connor said.

“The review demonstrates the progress that has been made through the Government’s *Trade for All* agenda to support all New Zealanders to participate and benefit from trade.

“Reviews like this are necessary as they build our evidence base to better understand women’s experiences in export-oriented industries and firms, so we can support women to better reap the benefits of trade.

“The findings show us we have work to do to continue our progress, gender disparities in the export sector persist and tend to be larger than in the non-exporting economy.

“The drivers of these disparities are multiple and complex, as are their impacts. But through this review we are better equipped to address both the drivers and impacts.

“We requested the review to continue improving outcomes for women through trade, and in doing so show a path forward for other countries to have an inclusive approach to trade policy,” Damien O’Connor said.

The review was released alongside the annual OECD Ministerial Council Meeting in Paris, centred on the theme of ‘The Future We Want: Better Policies for the Next Generation and a Sustainable Transition’.

“I’d like to thank the OECD for their significant work in undertaking this review and acknowledge the participants, including New Zealand women exporters, for sharing their experiences and insights.”
