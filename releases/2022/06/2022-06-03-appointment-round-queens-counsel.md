Attorney-General David Parker announced today that an appointment round for Queen's Counsel will take place in 2022.

Appointments of Queen's Counsel are made by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Attorney-General and with the concurrence of the Chief Justice. The Governor-General retains the discretion to appoint Queen's Counsel in recognition of their extraordinary contributions to the law in fields other than advocacy.

The Chief Justice and the Attorney-General have issued Guidelines for Candidates. The Guidelines were updated in 2019 following a consultation process and now include a new criterion of a commitment to improving access to justice.

"In recommending barristers to take silk I want to have a good understanding of each applicant's personal contribution to advancing better access to justice for those who need it. It will be an important factor in my decisions,” Attorney-General David Parker said.

The Guidelines (and an application form) are available at [www.crownlaw.govt.nz](http://www.crownlaw.govt.nz/) and set out the criteria for appointment and other information about the appointment process.

Applications for appointment as Queen's Counsel open on 20 June 2022.

The Solicitor-General will consult with the New Zealand Law Society and the New Zealand Bar Association regarding the candidates.

It is expected appointments will be made in October 2022.
