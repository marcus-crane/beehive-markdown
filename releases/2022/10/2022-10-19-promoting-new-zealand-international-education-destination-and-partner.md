Education Minister Chris Hipkins will lead a delegation to Asia to encourage people to study in New Zealand and promote the fact our country is open for business. 

“The Government remains strongly committed to international education, which is an important part of the New Zealand economy,” Chris Hipkins said.

“I am looking forward to reconnecting with students, alumni, and partner institutions in South Korea, Indonesia and Singapore, to reinforce that New Zealand is fully open to international students and welcoming them back.

“We’ve already seen good uptake in student enrolments for next year, but there is more we can do and I look forward to helping forge further connections between New Zealand and those involved with international education in these countries.”

Chris Hipkins will speak at the Republic of Korea’s largest student expo, the International Education and Career Fair, and mark the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations.

He will promote New Zealand’s commitment to education cooperation with Indonesia, which is a strategic and growing market.

And he will sign a refreshed Education Cooperation Arrangement with Singapore, and discuss innovative practices and the potential for greater exchange in education and public service training with his ministerial counterpart.

Chris Hipkins leaves on Friday morning and returns to New Zealand on Friday 28 October.
