Foreign Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta today announced the appointment of Jacqueline Frizelle as New Zealand’s next ambassador to Italy.

“Aotearoa New Zealand values its close relationship with Italy. We have strong links between our countries through trade, reciprocal working holiday schemes and culture, including through the Venice Biennale,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“Our connection with the Italian people is also underpinned by our wartime history and we recognise Italy’s key role in the European Union and Europe more broadly.”

Jacqueline Frizelle is a career diplomat with a background in international development. She has previously worked in Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Bhutan on aid and development programmes.

She has also held a number of roles at the Ministry of Foreign of Affairs and Trade, most recently as principal adviser for the Pacific and Development Group, which included being Head of Policy for the international development programme. From 2013 to 2017, Ms Frizelle was New Zealand’s High Commissioner to Samoa.

“Located at our Post in Rome, Ms Frizelle will be key to furthering our relationships in Italy and other parts of Europe. I look forward to seeing how we can enhance our work across a range of global issues through her appointment,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

In addition to Italy, Ms Frizelle will be accredited to a number of other European countries, including Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Montenegro, North Macedonia, San Marino, and Serbia.

She will take up her appointment in the new year.
