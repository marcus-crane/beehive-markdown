Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Andrew Little travels to Australia tomorrow to discuss Aotearoa New Zealand’s treaty negotiations experience with the Australian State and Federal Governments.

Minister Little will meet with state ministerial counterparts and local indigenous councils of Queensland and Victoria, which have roles overseeing the way these states are starting to address historical grievances and a lack of representation in decision-making by their indigenous peoples.

“This trip comes at an important time for Queensland and Victoria as they work to address the injustices of the past, and I’ve been invited to share insights about our approach,” Andrew little said.

“Both states have committed to looking at how a treaty-based process  can improve and reframe the relationship between the state governments and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

“I will discuss how New Zealand’s treaty settlement process works, how we have carried it out, and what policies and approaches have been beneficial to the Māori Crown relationship as it has evolved over the past thirty plus years,” Andrew Little said.

“These discussions are an important opportunity for Australia and New Zealand to learn from and support each other around relationships between indigenous peoples and Government.”

Minister Little will depart Wednesday 12 October and return Saturday 15 October 2022.
