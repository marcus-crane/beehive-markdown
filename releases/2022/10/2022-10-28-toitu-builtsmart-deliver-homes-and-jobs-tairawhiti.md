- Toitū Tairāwhiti Builtsmart facility to create 18 full-time jobs
- The new facility will have the capacity to build up to 24 homes simultaneously
- The facility to become a training site for Toitū Tairāwhiti Māori trades training

Delivering over 50 homes, creating 18 full-time jobs, while providing a site for Toitū Tairāwhiti Māori cadetships is proof that iwi and Crown partnerships work.

“Today’s site opening shows how by working together we can overcome challenges to deliver for whānau in our communities,” Associate Minister for Housing, Peeni Henare said today.

This afternoon, Minister Peeni Henare attended the opening of the Toitū Builtsmart Facility in Te Tairāwhiti Gisborne.

The facility has six smart shelters, which will have the capacity to build up to 24 affordable homes all at once.

Minister for Economic and Regional Development Stuart Nash said, “Not only will this facility build much-needed homes for Tairāwhiti, but it is creating jobs and training opportunities for future generations. It is a real investment in the economic future and wellbeing of the region.”

Toitū Tairāwhiti secured up to $4 million in funding from Kānoa Regional Economic Development & Investment Unit (RDU)’s Regional Strategic Partnership Fund to assist with the construction of the site. Toitū Tairāwhiti also co-funded the remaining $4 million to bring the project to life.

“During the Covid-19 pandemic, Toitū Tairāwhiti recognised ongoing supply chain issues could hinder their housing delivery targets. Toitū Tairāwhiti decided to enter a joint venture with Builtsmart to establish Toitū Tairāwhiti Builtsmart facility in Tūranga,” Peeni Henare said.

In Te Tairāwhiti region, 24 houses have already been completed, and opening this new facility will enable those numbers to grow.

“The Government is committed to the vision that all whānau have safe, healthy, affordable homes with secure tenure across the whole housing continuum,” Peeni Henare said.

“Building healthy and affordable homes while making our regions stronger and more resilient is a priority for our government. Today’s opening of Toitū Builtsmart proves that when we work in partnership, we can bring about real benefits to the regions and communities,” Stuart Nash said.
