The restored battle site at Ōhaeawai, a historically important site in the context of the 1845-46 Northern Land Wars, was today officially opened after undergoing $1.79 million in government backed restorations.

Te Pakanga o Ōhaeawai, located near Kaikohe in Te Tai Tokerau Northland, is the second project completed from a $20 million Historic Sites of National Importance allocation from the Provincial Growth Fund, which is administered by Kānoa – Regional Economic Development & Investment Unit. Ōhaeawai Community Cultural Centre received the funding to restore the site of the Battle of Ōhaeawai which includes St Michael’s Church, the Te Haara farm and the old Ōhaeawai Native School.

“Through investment in sites of national importance, including those where historic battles took place between Māori and Crown forces, we help promote and preserve New Zealand’s history and cultural identity for all New Zealanders, both now and in the future.

“The restoration of the Battle Site allows the descendants of those involved in the war and the wider public to learn about this significant battle as well as the wider community to benefit from the restored infrastructure.

“The Sites of Historical Significance allocation has provided targeted investment to support projects which offer a unique tourism activity, support Māori development and storytelling, and promote a shared understanding of history. I am proud of this important mahi that we have achieved together,” said Stuart Nash.

Other historically significant sites that have received funding include Ruapekapeka Pā also in Te Tai Tokerau, Rangiriri Pā in northern Waikato, and Parihaka in Taranaki.
