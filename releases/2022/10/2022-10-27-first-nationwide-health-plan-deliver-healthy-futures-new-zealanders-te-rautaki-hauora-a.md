Health Minister Andrew Little welcomes Te Pae Tata | the Interim New Zealand Health Plan jointly developed by Te Whatu Ora – Health New Zealand and Te Aka Whai Ora – Māori Health Authority.

“We have consolidated the public health system and now we have a plan to achieve national service coverage and nationally consistent operating policies,” Health Minister Andrew Little said.

“This plan puts into action the Government’s record investment in health from [Budget 2022](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/secure-future-new-zealanders%E2%80%99-health). This Government has increased health spending by more than 40 percent, to $24 billion, since coming to office 2017.

“The plan has been put together by clinicians and health experts and sets out the range of tasks that will be taken over two years to strengthen hospitals, primary care, and tackle the longstanding challenges including workforce shortages,” Andrew Little said.

“Te Pae Tata will lay the foundation for a properly co-ordinated system to better support patients, whether they are at the GP, in hospital, or in some other form of care.”

As well as prioritising workforce and workplace issues, Te Whatu Ora and Te Aka Whai Ora have made specific commitments to improve outcomes in:

- Maternity and early years
- People with cancer
- People living with chronic health conditions
- People living with mental distress

“The plan will be financially sustainable and any efficiencies will be ploughed back into more services for patients,” Andrew Little said.

“Having a joint plan for Te Whatu Ora and Te Aka Whai Ora, working as equal partners, is a game-changer for Māori and whānau,” Associate Health Minister Peeni Henare said.

“It will grow kaupapa Māori services and give Māori a strong voice in a new system focused on improving the disproportionate health outcomes that have long affected our whānau.

“I am proud that Māori voices and hauora expertise will be reflected at every level of our new health system, improving outcomes for Māori and non-Māori across Aotearoa.”

**Notes to editors:**

- Te Pae Tata sets out deliverables under four focus areas:
  
  - People and whānau at the heart of healthcare;
  - Priorities for improving health outcomes and equities;
  - Unified health system;
  - Priority populations.
- Te Pae Tata is “interim” because it is aligned to the landmark two-year budget reform. From 2024 the health budget will move to a three-year cycle and a full plan will commence.

**Te Rautaki Hauora ā-motu tuatahi hei whakaū i te ora mo te katoa o Aotearoa**

E whakanui ana a Andrew Little te Minita mo ngā take Hauora i Te Pae Tata, te rautaki hauora taupua i waihanga ngātahitia e Te Whatu Ora me Te Aka Whai Ora.

“Kua whakakotahi e mātou te pūnaha hauora, ā, kua whai rautaki ano hoki mātou kia horapa whānui ki te motu ngā ratonga kia ōrite ano hoki ngā whakahaere kaupapa here”, hei tā te Minita take Hauora tā Andrew Little.

“Ko tā tēnei rautaki he whakatinana i te nui o tā te Kāwanatanga whakangao pūtea ki roto i ngā kaupapa hauora i waitohua ai i te [Tāhua Pūtea 2022](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/secure-future-new-zealanders%E2%80%99-health). Mai i te tau 2017 kua rahi kē atu te whakangao pūtea ā tēnei Kāwanatanga ki ngā kaupapa hauora, kua piki ake mā te 40-paehenti tūhene atu ki te $24-piriona.”

“Nā ngā tohunga hauora me ngā mātanga hauora tēnei rautaki i waihanga, ko tā tēnei rautaki he whakariterite i ngā mahi i roto i ngā tau e rua e tū māi nei hei whakapakari ake i ngā ratonga hohipera, ngā ratonga mātanga mē ngā raruraru kaimahi kua roa e noho nei i roto i tēnei rāngai,” hei tā Andrew Little.

“Mā Te Pae Tata e whakatakoto i te tūāpapa e tika ai te mahi tahi a te pūnaha ki te tautoko i ngā tūroro, he ahakoa rā haere ai ki te Tākuta, ki te hohipera, ki tētahi atu ratonga hauora rānei.”

Apā noa atu ki te whakaarotau i ngā raruraru kaimahi, wāhi mahi hoki, e ōati ana a Te Whatu Ora me Te Aka Whai Ora ki te hiki i te taumata o te hauora i roto i:

- te hunga kei te kōpū, kei te hapū rānei tae noātu ki taitamarikitanga.
- te hunga e pāngia ana e te mate pukupuku
- te hunga e pāngia ana e ngā mate kukumeroa
- te hunga e pāngia ana e ngā taumahatanga o te hinengaro.

“Toitū nei ngā whakahaere pūtea o tēnei rautaki, āpiti atu ki tēnei, ko ngā painga katoa ka kōwhitia mai ki roto ki ngā ratonga tautoko i ngā tūroro,” hei tā Andrew Little.

Hei tā te Minita Takirua mo ngā kaupapa Hauora tā Peeni Henare “mā te whai a Te Whatu Ora mē Te Aka Whaiora i te rautaki kotahi, i runga i te mana ōrite, ka tino kitea ngā hua ka puta ki te Māori, ki ngā whanau ano hoki.

“Ka tipu ngā ratonga kaupapa Māori, ka pakari kē atu te reo a te Māori i roto i tēnei pūnaha hou, ko te aronga nui o tēnei pūnaha hou he whakatika i ngā hē o te pūnaha hauora kua roa e pēhi nei i ngā whanau.

“Ka nui taku koa, ka rāngona ngā reo a te Māori, ka kitea ano hoki ngā pukenga hauora a te Māori ki ia taumata o tā tātou pūnaha hauora hou, e hiki nei i te toi-oranga mo te katoa o Aotearoa, ahakoa Māori mai, aha ake rānei.”
