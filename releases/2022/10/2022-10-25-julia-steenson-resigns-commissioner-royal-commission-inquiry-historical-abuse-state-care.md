Julia Steenson, Commissioner of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Historical Abuse in State Care, resigned from her role on 17 October 2022.

Ms Steenson was appointed to the Royal Commission on 17 June 2020 by the then Governor-General Dame Patsy Reddy.

The Royal Commission of Historical Abuse in State Care was established on February 1, 2018. Its role is to investigate what happened to children, young people and vulnerable adults in State and faith-based care in Aotearoa New Zealand between the years 1950-99.

The Royal Commission recently held its final public hearing to examine the responses of faith-based institutions to abuse and neglect in their care.

Ms Steenson has advised that her final day at the Royal Commission will be Thursday 27th October 2022 and intend to move into new leadership roles.

The Minister of Internal Affairs Hon Jan Tinetti would like to thank Julia Steenson for her commitment and the contribution she has made to the Royal Commission since her appointment.
