Associate Education (Māori Education) Minister Kelvin Davis has welcomed the expansion of Pūhoro Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and Mātauranga (STEMM) Academy in Te Tai Tokerau.

Pūhoro was established in response to low engagement of Māori in STEMM related career pathways. It supports rangatahi Māori with a pathway into high-value careers, with the transition from secondary school to tertiary programmes including connections to internships, industry opportunities and employment.

“Supporting more rangatahi Māori to succeed in science, technology and innovation is not only important to this Government – it is important to us as a people, and to Aotearoa,” Kelvin Davis said.

“For too long the system has not served Māori well. The current under-representation of our people in the sciences, despite the skills of our tupuna in these areas, attests to this. That needs to change.

“The Pūhoro way is a by Māori for Māori way. Its expansion into Tai Tokerau is a significant milestone for a kaupapa Māori approach that seeks to improve equitable access for rangatahi Māori into science and technology related pathways. This also fits with this Government’s approach to Māori education, as set out in Ka Hikitia – Ka Hāpaitia, the Māori Education Strategy.” Kelvin Davis said.

The last two years have seen significant growth for the Pūhoro STEMM Academy, having engaged 1503 rangatahi in 54 participating schools and kura across nine regions to date. The expansion into Te Tai Tokerau becomes the 10th region Pūhoro serves, made possible through funding from its critical partners including the Ministry of Education, the Tindall Foundation and Foundation North, who are invested in seeing positive engagement and outcomes for Māori in STEMM.

“Pūhoro is an example of the Pathways Programme in action. I am proud of the success it has achieved for our rangatahi Māori and congratulate it on its growth into Tai Tokerau. I look forward to its continued success in expanding its important kaupapa throughout Aotearoa.” Kelvin Davis said.

The Academy has been nationally and internationally recognised for its work, winning two awards at the Diversity Awards 2022, and being nominated as a finalist at the Global Engineering and Technology Innovation awards 2022, to be held in London in November.
