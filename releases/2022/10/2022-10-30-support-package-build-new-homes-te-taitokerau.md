Associate Minister of Housing (Māori Housing) Peeni Henare has today announced a new investment partnership with Te Pouahi o Te Taitokerau to build up to 100 houses in the North.

“The housing challenges we face in Te Taitokerau are significant. But this Government is taking action,” Peeni Henare said.

“We are working together with Te Pouahi o Te Taitokerau (a collective of Northland based Māori housing service providers and supported by Northland iwi, hapū and Ahu Whenua Trusts) to fund a prototype delivery model that will see 80-100 affordable rental homes and up to 110 infrastructure sites by 30 June 2025.

“We know that we cannot tackle this housing crisis alone. The key to success lies in partnership.

“Today we are announcing a $55m package to support Te Pouahi o Te Taitokerau as part of the government’s commitment to the vision that all whānau have safe, healthy, affordable homes with secure tenure across the whole housing continuum,” Peeni Henare said.

Minister for Māori Development Willie Jackson said, that was why the Government created a new pathway for Māori Housing.

“A pathway that relies on a genuine partnership between the Government and Māori to invest in housing opportunities that more widely contribute to the overall oranga (wellbeing) of whānau, hapū and iwi.

“And today we have come together to sign a Heads of Agreement with Te Pouahi o Te Taitokerau to solidify our partnership and to formalise how we will work with each other to deliver better housing opportunities for whānau in the North,” Willie Jackson said.

“In last year’s Budget,  we committed $730 million for Māori housing to deliver 1000 new homes, repairs and maintenance to 700 homes, and infrastructure support for 2,700 homes. This investment includes $30 million towards building future capability for iwi and Māori groups to accelerate housing projects and support services,” Peeni Henare said.

“Our strong economic management means we are well placed to build on our investments to criticle services for whānau like warm dry homes.

The $55m funding provides:

1. $30 million for the supply of 80-100 homes;
2. $20 million to enable the infrastructure requirements for 110 sites;
3. $2.31 million to cover operational costs ($0.77m annually for three years); and
4. $2.69 million for project development, including capability building and technical support.

“Together, Te Pouahi o Te Taitokerau and this Government will deliver a better housing future for Māori in the North, and I look forward to the benefits our partnership will deliver to our whānau across the rohe,” Peeni Henare said.
