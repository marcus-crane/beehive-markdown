Foreign Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta today announced the appointment of Dawn Bennet as New Zealand’s next ambassador to Seoul, South Korea.

“Aotearoa New Zealand and the Republic of Korea share a close, wide-ranging relationship that dates back to our shared sacrifice during the Korean War,” Nanaia Mahuta said. 

“As we celebrate 60 years of diplomatic relations between our countries, our connection is strengthened through our significant trade interests, people-to-people links, and collaboration in the science and technology sector.

“There is significant potential for us to cooperate on climate and clean energy, as we share the objective of net zero carbon economies by 2050.

“As our next Ambassador, Ms Bennet will be vital to increasing our cooperation and collaboration in the Republic of Korea, especially in support of peace, security and prosperity for the Indo-Pacific region,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

Dawn Bennet has most recently served as the divisional manager of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s Australia division.

She has also been a senior trade adviser for the Minister of Trade, an economic counsellor at the New Zealand Embassy in Beijing and previously served as a diplomat and International Relations Consultant in Paris.

Dawn Bennet takes up her position in February.
