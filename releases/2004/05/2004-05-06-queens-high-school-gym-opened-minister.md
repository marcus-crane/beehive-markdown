Education Minister Trevor Mallard played volleyball with Queens High School students today to mark the official opening of the school's new gymnasium at Queens High School.

"This impressive $1.7 million building is now equipped with all the modern facilities necessary for teaching students about the benefits of a healthy lifestyle through fitness and fun," Trevor Mallard said.

"Facilities in the upgraded gymnasium include space for spectators, a sprung floor, new changing room facilities, a drying room for wetsuits and other outdoor education gear, and ancillary areas specifically designed for the teaching of the health and physical education curriculum.

"The upgraded facilities and modern interior should certainly make physical education a more appealing option for students.

"It's usually at school that kids get their first taste of sport and learn the importance of physical activity. Everyone should aim for life long fitness, and schools play an important role in encouraging students to commit to a healthy lifestyle," Trevor Mallard said.

"On average in the past girls' school gymnasiums were not as good as those in  
co-ed schools and markedly worse than in boys' schools. A 2001 survey also showed that 64 per cent of girls were active, compared to 73 per cent of boys.

"This government has made policy changes and accordingly targeted spending to encourage girls to get into physical fitness through funding gym improvements such as those we see today at Queens."

Trevor Mallard said the gymnasium is part of an impressive development programme underway at Queens High.

"A new graphics room is under construction and the computer and data system have recently been integrated. These are great examples of how school curriculum delivery can be enhanced through the provision of modern property."

Funding of $389,000 was provided for the graphics room and data system through the government’s school property funding programme.
