The government has confirmed allocation of funding towards a programme to improve Lake Taupo’s threatened water quality, Environment Minister Marian Hobbs said today.

In the first four years of the 15-year programme, the government will contribute $7.5 million. The total cost of the programme is estimated to be $81.5 million – the government will contribute $36.7 million with Environment Waikato and Taupo District Council funding the remainder.

"Rural and urban development around the lake is slowly but surely degrading its water quality and clarity," Marian Hobbs said. "This programme is designed to preserve our economic and social opportunities in Taupo, while ensuring the environment continues to support and meet our needs."

Marian Hobbs said specifically the package will:

·Encourage land owners to diversify to ‘low nitrogen’ land uses through a combination of financial incentives and regulations

·Provide for research and advisory services on land uses that produce low levels of nitrogen and help maintain a viable rural economy, for example investigating horticulture and forestry which produce little nitrogen, but ensuring that the alternatives identified are profitable

“This is the first time that such an ambitious environmental package requiring land use change has been undertaken on this scale,” Marian Hobbs said. "But given that nitrogen inputs need to be cut by 20 percent to maintain current water quality in the long term, the project is most definitely needed."

Details on the programme's introduction are being developed and will be made public later this year.
