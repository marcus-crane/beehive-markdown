*Joint statement with Greater Wellington*

The Government and Greater Wellington Regional Council have agreed to begin detailed work on a Transport Package for the region.

The announcement was made at the conclusion of a meeting held between the of Transport Minister Pete Hodgson, and Margaret Shields, the Chairperson of the Greater Wellington Regional Council.

Because the region is well advanced in its transport planning, development of the package will begin as soon as possible, and officials from government and Greater Wellington will begin work immediately.

"The Government and Greater Wellington will also work with Mayors and other key stakeholders on the package. It is essential that the region is unified on the content of this package," said Mr Hodgson and Ms Shields.

"We did not discuss funding at this stage, but the respective contributions that government and local authorities will make will definitely be a matter for future discussions."

The shape the package will take is not yet clear, but will involve enhancements to public transport as well as measures to reduce road congestion. Specific issues for discussion include:

- integrated transport policy for the Wellington region (linkages between the New Zealand Transport Strategy and the Wellington Regional Land Transport Strategy);
- road congestion in the region;
- Transmission Gully and other alternatives;
- provision of adequate Rail rolling stock;
- rail track speeds;
- Western Line upgrades;
- future development of passenger transport services;
- park and ride Facilities;
- integration of freight and metro services; and
- demand management initiatives.
