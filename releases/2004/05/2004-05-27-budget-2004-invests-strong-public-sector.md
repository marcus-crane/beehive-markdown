"Budget 2004 delivers a further instalment in the government's long-term programme to rebuild and strengthen the core state sector," State Services Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

"The government wants to ensure departmental baselines are realistic and equal to the task while also maintaining pressure on departments to use resources effectively and efficiently," Trevor Mallard said.

The budget commits around $1 billion to increase the sector's ability to cope with demand and deliver services.

Principal beneficiaries are the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Child Youth and Family, the Department of Corrections and Defence.

- MFAT receives an additional $19 million in 2004-05 rising to $28 million in subsequent years.
- CYF gets an increase of around $61 million this year and $66 million a year thereafter. This is the latest of a series of increases over the last four years and means that the service's operating budget has more than doubled under this government.
- Corrections' operating funding will increase $30 million in 2004-05 and $40 million a year subsequently.
- Defence gets $20 million a year to increase regular force pay and $16 million a year to develop and maintain effective manning levels in the Air Force.

Inland Revenue gets $55 million over four years to expand its audit functions, improve the administration of child support and address staff issues and the Ministry of Transport $11 million to improve its policy advice capability and to administer the government's Land Transport Strategy.

In addition, $1.9 million has been allocated to implement a human resources framework so departments can share common policy where practical, in areas such as career development, remuneration systems and leave entitlements.
