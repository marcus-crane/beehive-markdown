Prime Minister Helen Clark has welcomed the announcement at the Cannes Film Festival that two new films are to go into production in New Zealand.

"The New Zealand Film Production Fund and the New Zealand Film Commission have used the Cannes Festival to announce two new exciting New Zealand/UK co-productions," Helen Clark said.

"River Queen and Perfect Creature are soon to go into production with funding from the Film Production Fund, the Film Commission, and international partners.

"On the 25th anniversary of the New Zealand Film Commission's attendance at the Cannes Film Festival it is wonderful to see the increasing maturity and depth of the New Zealand film culture.

"The two films are very different, reflecting the creativity and diversity of this strong cultural force in New Zealand in the 21st century," Helen Clark said.

River Queen is based on an original story by Vincent Ward (Vigil, The Navigator, Map of the Human Heart) who co-wrote the screenplay with Toa Fraser.

It is an intimate story set in 19th century New Zealand following the journey of a young woman's conflict when caught between two cultures.

Academy-award nominee Samantha Morton, Cliff Curtis and Temuera Morrison will head the cast of Ward's epic feature.

In Perfect Creature, New Zealand writer/director Glenn Standring (The Irrefutable Truth about Demons) explores his vision of a futuristic world where vampires and humans have learnt to co-exist.

Standring has also signed up a strong international cast with Dougray Scott (Mission Impossible 2), Saffron Burrows (Troy), Stuart Wilson (The Mask of Zorro) and Scott Wills (Stickmen).

Helen Clark said that the first two films financed by the Film Production Fund established in 2000, Whalerider and Perfect Strangers, were both successful, and that bodes well for River Queen and Perfect Creature.
