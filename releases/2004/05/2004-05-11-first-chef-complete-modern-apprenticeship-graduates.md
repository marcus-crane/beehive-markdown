The first chef to complete a [Modern Apprenticeship](http://www.modern-apprenticeships.govt.nz/Rendered/Home%20.html) met up with the Minister who introduced the programme in Auckland this morning at the start of a week of activity by government MPs focusing on youth training.

Joseph Tahaafe recently completed his three-year Modern Apprenticeship and is now working as a full-time Demi Chef at Sky City’s top restaurant, Orbit, in Sky Tower. Sky City was one of the first companies in the hospitality industry to sign up with the programme which was introduced by the incoming Labour-led government in 2000.

Steve Maharey said Joseph joins 312 young people nationwide who have now completed their Modern Apprenticeship. The number of [trainees currently undertaking a Modern Apprenticeship](http://www.modern-apprenticeships.govt.nz/rendered/newsstorystats.html) has now risen to a new high of 6,580 (up from 5,102 Modern Apprentices a year ago).

“Modern Apprenticeships are providing a significant new learning pathway into the world of work for young people like Joseph. I first met Joseph and his parents at Sky City back in 2000 and I’m very pleased to be able to congratulate him now that he become a fully qualified chef and been promoted to the position of Demi Chef.

“The success of the Modern Apprenticeships programme is demonstrated by the fact that it has already exceeded the June 2004 target of 6,500 young people in the programme. The government has set a target of 7,500 Modern Apprentices during 2006.

“Working in partnership with the Mayors’ Taskforce for Jobs, the government has committed to getting all young people (aged 15-19 years) into work, training, education or other worthwhile activities by 2007. Modern Apprenticeships is already making a major contribution to this goal.

“Later this week (Thursday) I will be announcing how we intend to step up the campaign to get all young people building a future for themselves, including funding for additional Modern Apprentices,” Steve Maharey said.
