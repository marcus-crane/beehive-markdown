Education Minister Trevor Mallard today launched an on-line astronomy programme, *Carter Star Learning*, developed by Wellington's Carter Observatory.

"Astronomy inspires wonder, and its study develops an understanding of scientific ways of working and thinking. Accessing this information online will be a huge benefit to New Zealand students," Trevor Mallard said.

"The educators here are at the Carter Observatory are experts in their field and passionate about astronomy. The on-line programme enables them to share their enthusiasm and knowledge with learners throughout the country and around the world.

"The digital environment allows a specialist subject area, that is often difficult to explore using more traditional teaching methods, to be accessed by schools and students nationwide. This innovative programme can connect learners and educators across time and space with a subject that has even broader boundaries.

"The Carter Observatory is now an accredited provider with the New Zealand Qualifications Authority and students can gain unit standards through the on-line learning programme to add to their National Certificate of Educational Achievement qualifications.

"The Carter Observatory has run education programmes for years and is an important specialist provider of astronomy education. Many adults and children have gazed at the night sky through the telescopes and used the planetarium to learn more about astronomy."

The programme involves seven modules introduced throughout the year: an overview of the solar system; the milky way and other galaxies; studies of space flight; cosmology; Maori astronomy; traditional Pasifika navigation; and college mathematics.
