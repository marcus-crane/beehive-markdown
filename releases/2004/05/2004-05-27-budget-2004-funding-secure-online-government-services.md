The government is investing an extra $14.8 million over the next four years to further develop a secure system for people wanting to use government services over the Internet, State Services Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

The allocation includes capital funding of $240,000.

"The system, known as online authentication, allows people and agencies to have confidence in each other's identity when conducting transactions online. It is one of the key elements of e-government and will become increasingly important as agencies extend the range of their online services," Trevor Mallard said.

"New Zealanders have enthusiastically embraced internet banking, and tell us they want the same kind of convenience and security for the increasing range of government services that are available online.

"This government is committed to delivering a public service that effectively meets the needs of New Zealanders in the 21st century. Ensuring security and privacy in the provision of good quality and efficient online government services is part of our goal.

"Public consultation on online authentication options was held in 2003, and it was very clear that people preferred a straightforward central solution with limited information exchange, that put security and the privacy of New Zealanders' as the top priority. We agreed with this way forward.

"The State Services Commission's E-government Unit, in conjunction with the Department of Internal Affairs, will now develop and implement government-wide standards for authentication. The Privacy Commissioner will also be consulted on any privacy concerns. A national ID card has been ruled out.

"A number of agencies already conduct online authentication for specific online services. A common approach that can be applied across the whole of government will provide consistency for people using government services online," Trevor Mallard said.
