Police Minister George Hawkins today turned the first sod at a ceremony at the site of a new police station on the corner of Line Rd and Taniwha St in Glen Innes.

When completed, the station will be the 15th new station to be opened since the Labour-led government took office in December 1999.

Mr Hawkins said Glen Innes was one of four new stations currently under construction around New Zealand, with three others planned to commence building this year alone. As well, almost 50 police stations had been upgraded or extensively refurbished since late 1999.

"While only $720,000 was spent on police capital works in each of the last three years by the previous National Government, the Labour-led Government is committed to spending approximately $73m on police capital works over a five year period," Mr Hawkins said.

A committed police capital works programme ensured staff enjoyed comfortable, satisfying conditions in which to do their important work, Mr Hawkins said.

Glen Innes Station will house up to 60 Police staff by early next year. Beca Carter Hollings and Ferner are the building's project managers and architects, with Lawton Construction the main contractor.

Also announced this week as part of Budget 2004 was $14.8 million over the next four years to allow 35 additional Police (28 sworn and 7 non-sworn staff) to be deployed for specific national security duties during the current financial year.

The majority (24 sworn and 5 non-sworn staff) will go to units that will conduct investigative and intelligence-related work. An identity fraud team and a South and West Pacific Police liaison post in Suva will also be established. As well, an additional $39 million has been allocated in the Budget to tackle the methamphetamine trade and organised crime over the next four years.
