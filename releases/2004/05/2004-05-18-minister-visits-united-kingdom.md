Commerce Minister Margaret Wilson is in the United Kingdom for a fortnight for a variety of meetings as a representative of the New Zealand Government.

As Commerce Minister, Margaret Wilson will meet with John Stoker, Chief Charity Commissioner of the Charity Commission for England and Wales.

They will discuss the UK's recently completed review of charities and other not-for-profit organisations given that New Zealand will soon have a Commission of its own following the passage of the Charities Bill.

She will also meet with David Arculus, Chair of the UK Better Regulation Task Force. This is an independent body that advises government on action to ensure that regulation and its enforcement is necessary and of a high standard.

A meeting with Lord Sainsbury of Turville, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Science and Innovation has also been scheduled to discuss the UK's approach to standards development and promotion.  
As Attorney General and Associate Justice Minister, she will visit Scotland to examine the judicial appointments system there.

She will attend a reception in London to thank the Lord Chancellor and Privy Councillors for the role the Privy Council has played as a partial final court for New Zealand.

To mark the first time New Zealand has exhibited at the Chelsea Flower Show, Margaret Wilson will represent the New Zealand Government at a function, and also at the garden's opening.

She will also attend a reception for the Black Caps to wish them all the best in their first test against England. She hopes to attend part of the match at Lord's.
