Conservation Minister Chris Carter has announced a $7m project to create two of the largest island sanctuaries for threatened native wildlife around mainland New Zealand.

"The Labour-Progressive government is delighted to green light an eight year restoration project to transform Secretary Island in Doubtful Sound and Resolution Island in Dusky Sound into unique safe havens for some of our most valuable species," Mr Carter said.

"At 20,860 ha, Resolution Island is up to 10 times larger than any other island sanctuary around our immediate coastline. Secretary Island is about four times larger, at 8140 ha, and one of only two protected off-shore islands of such a scale that have never had rodents on them. The other is Adams Island, which is located way out in the Southern Ocean," Mr Carter said.

"By restoring Secretary and Resolution, we are writing New Zealand an insurance policy against the extinction of signature species. Their size, and the terrain of Secretary, which rises to 1196m, offers a critically important opportunity to nurture larger and more diverse populations of native wildlife than can possibly be accomodated on island sanctuaries at present," Mr Carter said.

"Resolution Island is so big that it may enable us to locate the endangered whio (blue duck) on an island sanctuary for the first time. Until now all of our existing island sanctuaries have lacked the large river systems necessary to support a whio population.

"The islands are already populated by species like the Fiordland-crested penguin, New Zealand falcon, western weka, kaka and kea, but they have the potential to become homes for the threatened kakapo, mohua (yellowhead), rock wren and robin as well."

Mr Carter said the restoration of Secretary and Resolution would cost $7m, with annual maintenance costs of up to $1m a year. It would involve two enormous pest control programmes that would be amongst the biggest the Department of Conservation had ever attempted.

"Resolution Island is populated by mice, deer and stoats, and there is a historical record of rats. Secretary Island is also populated by stoats and deer. Pest control on both islands will either seek to eradicate these pest species completely or control them to very low numbers where they do not impact on native species," Mr Carter said.

"Because of the scale of this project, we are going to start with Secretary first, as the smaller of the two islands. Lessons learned on Secretary will then be applied to Resolution Island."

Mr Carter said the biggest challenge in the project was not how to eradicate the pests but how to keep them from reinvading from the mainland.

"The pest control we will be seeking to apply at the borders of these islands will be at the cutting edge conservation. If it is successful it will be a significant milestone in the government's goal of creating a cleaner, greener New Zealand."
