New research into recreational fishing will improve decision-making affecting the estimated one-in-five New Zealanders who go fishing each year, says Fisheries Minister David Benson-Pope.

Responding to the concerns of recreational fishers that their interests are being squeezed out of the equation by the commercial fishing industry, Mr Benson-Pope announced a four-year, four-million-dollar, research plan.

The primary focus for the extra research will be to collect information on total harvest in the non-commercial sector.

"This funding was agreed to because the Government recognises that to properly provide for recreational fishing interests it is necessary to have good information about them," says Mr Benson-Pope.

"The management of our fisheries resource recognises that commercial, non commercial and customary fishers all have a stake. We are trying to get good outcomes for all of them while ensuring the resource remains available for generations to come."

Research on recreational fishing has focused mainly on obtaining estimates of recreational catch through national telephone surveys and fishing diary surveys. These two national surveys have produced, in some cases, vastly different estimates of the recreational catch of some species in different areas.

The proposed new research, while continuing to improve estimates of total harvest, will also look at the quality of fishing. It will attempt to paint a picture of changes in fishing success over time.

Funding for the new research scheme will be made available in the forthcoming budget.
