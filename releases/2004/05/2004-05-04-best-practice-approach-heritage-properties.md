Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark today announced the introduction of a “best practice” approach to the management of heritage properties owned by government departments.

“It is important that the government is seen to lead by example in the way it cares for its heritage,” Helen Clark said.

“Government departments have in their care a large number of heritage places and properties ranging from courthouses and police stations to archaeological sites which are recognised as having heritage significance to communities around New Zealand.”

“It is important for us and for future generations that government departments maintain these properties to a suitable standard and ensure that their decisions about disposal or future use of the properties take into account their heritage values.”

The Ministry for Culture and Heritage will be overseeing the development of a policy for the implementation of best practice. It expects to report back by the end of July 2004. The Ministry will then work alongside each department which holds heritage properties to develop guidelines and standards for their management, tailored to the department’s functional needs.

“There are many highly successful examples of heritage conservation projects that have been undertaken by both private and public property owners. The publicly-owned Old Government Buildings, now used by the Law School of Victoria University of Wellington, stand as evidence of the interest and pride we take in our nation’s past.”

“There are exciting opportunities to enhance the way that we care for our heritage places. I hope that this demonstration of government’s commitment to its heritage properties will encourage other owners to adopt similar approaches,” Helen Clark said.
