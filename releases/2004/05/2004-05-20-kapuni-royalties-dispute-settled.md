Associate Minister of Energy Harry Duynhoven announced today that a long-standing dispute between the Kapuni joint venture parties and the Government over royalty payments on production from the Kapuni gas and condensate field has been settled.

“I am very pleased that this long-standing dispute has been settled,” Harry Duynhoven said.

The dispute arose because the 1970 Kapuni mining licence set a royalty rate of 5 percent of the value of gas and condensate at the wellhead but did not specify how that value was to be calculated.

“The agreement defines the methodology for the calculation of royalty which should prevent disputes arising in the future. It will result in additional royalty payments by the Kapuni joint venturers estimated by the Government at approximately $3.8 million over the life of the field, depending on reservoir performance and operating costs. The additional payment includes arrears of $1.5 million” Mr Duynhoven said.

In addition to royalties the Crown received around $10-12 million a year from an energy resources levy on gas produced from the Kapuni field.
