Budget 2004 builds on the strong measures taken in the War on Drugs by the Labour Progressive government last year, Progressive leader Jim Anderton says.

Mr Anderton, who chairs the ministerial committee overseeing the National Drug Policy, said the challenge of reducing the problems caused to society from drug use and alcohol abuse is one of the most serious facing the country.

"Budget 2004 allocates an additional $39 million to tackle the illegal methamphetamine trade and organised crime over the next four years. But it isn't only the supply of drugs we have addressed.

"This budget also delivers policies aimed at reducing the demand for drugs and makes provision to care for the victims of the drug peddlers with nearly $15 million over four years on drug related health initiatives and $5.5 million over four years dedicated to support suicide prevention measures," Mr Anderton said.

"The Progressive Party is proud to be part of a forward-looking government with strong policies for the benefit all New Zealanders. No other minor party in Parliament has achieved half as much as we have for New Zealand," Mr Anderton said.

Background 1

Central Region Alcohol and other Drug Residential Treatment

The National Drug Policy identifies young people as an at-risk population requiring special focus. This Budget 2004 initiative acknowledges this and proposes to fill a gap that has been identified by agencies working with young people in the central region of the North Island.

Youth in treatment for alcohol and other drug-related problems are not just younger versions of adults in treatment. Their issues and needs (including safety) differ qualitatively and quantitatively. Therefore, there is a need to have available to young people a treatment service that meets their needs and the needs of their families.

Residential treatment provides an option for young people assessed as needing a degree of stability and intensive support. It provides respite care and the provision of skills and knowledge that can contribute to reducing ongoing alcohol and other drug-related problems.

The new treatment service acknowledges the need for treatment options for young people in the central region. This additional funding will permit the region to fund up to 14 beds suitable for placement of males and females with a range of alcohol and or other drug problems aged between fourteen and eighteen years  
(14 –18 years).

The initial phase of development will involve consultation with other agencies, service providers and services working with young people, the Central Region Mental Health and Addictions Network and specialist youth services.

Development training for secondary prevention

Secondary prevention training is relevant for those working in the criminal justice system, budgetary advice, social services as well as those in Primary Health Organisations.

Secondary prevention techniques permit those working with patients to better identify signs of potential problems and risky behaviour in their patients.

Alcohol & Other Drug clinicians at court

Addictions practitioners at court offer recommendations to judges on whether referral to a specialist addictions assessor is necessary or desirable.

Sometimes these practitioners are able to undertake brief clinical assessments and to refer people to treatment services before sentencing.

It is envisaged that these positions will be one way of diverting unnecessary work away from the treatment system while also increasing the appropriateness of referrals. In jurisdictions where drug courts operate, the presence of an addictions practitioner can speed up access to assessment and possibly referral to treatment services.

Currently addictions treatment services are not specifically funded for this work and the evaluation component of this initiative will enable more in-depth evaluation and analysis of this type of position to be explored. This initiative acknowledges the prevalence of alcohol and other drug related problems and more recently problem gambling related problems amongst the offending population.

This Budget 2004 initiative involves three phases:

· Development that will involve consultation with the Ministry of Justice;  
· Development of a relevant service specification which establishes the parameters of the service being delivered;  
· Implementation and evaluation;

This is a pilot programme for three years.

Evaluation for Community Action on Youth & Drug sites

Funding has been secured to provide evaluations for the 15 Community Action on Youth and Drugs or CAYAD sites established recently.

Evaluation is an integral and essential component of successful community action initiatives.

Evaluation assists with needs assessments, developing evidence-based plans, ongoing review of strategies and activities as well as pre-testing programmes and resources. It will also inform decision-making about future investment in the project.

The evaluation will take place in two parts: formative and impact.

Formative evaluation produces information that is useful for planning, refining and improving the programme as it is designed and implemented. An important part of formative evaluation is developing clear programme goals, objectives and strategies.

Although each evaluation process is important, formative evaluation is seen as a priority for the CAYAD evaluation. Formative evaluation will provide ‘best practice’ principles for the communities involved and provide much needed support for the first 6 to 12 months. This will be extremely important for all the new CAYADs as they begin work on their initiatives.

Impact evaluations measure the effects of a programme and can help guide decision-making on the future direction of the programme.

Impact evaluation is needed to measure the project’s progress towards health gain over time. The impact evaluation will form a strong basis and rationale to expand the project further.

Background 5  
Discretionary fund for National Drug Policy

Jim Anderton requested a discretionary fund to allow for projects that are cross-government drug policy projects to be funded even if they are outside of each individual department’s key spending priority areas.

Jim Anderton has responsibility for the National Drug Policy. Currently all drug policy programmes under the NDP are funded from departmental baselines but the Progressive leader requested this fund to allow for greater flexibility in the delivery of services to support both the victims of drugs and to underpin the government's war against drugs.

This funding pool will be jointly administered by the Ministerial Committee on Drug Policy (MCDP) that the Progressive leader chairs, and by government departments involved in drug and alcohol policy matters.

This fund will allow the MCDP to fund projects/organisations that fill a gap that would otherwise remain unfilled.

This fund will deal with a number of situations which arise during the course of any year which are not specifically funded by an individual budget allocation.

As each department involved in the NDP has many other areas of responsibility funding for any NDP programme must compete with many other departmental priorities.

NDP programmes are restricted by departmental priorities and this fund would allow a number of projects to be funded according to NDP priorities as advised by the Inter Agency Committee on Drugs and decided on by the MCDP.

The fund will also allow for forward planning and fast response to changes in drug trends. Having access to a funding pool for drug policy matters will allow rapid responses to emerging drug issues.

The need for funding of the NDP has been noted in the past by many key stakeholders. A number of stakeholders have identified that the fiscally neutral status of the NDP has restricted effective drug policy development and achievement of harm reduction goals. A number of stakeholders have commented that funding for the NDP will demonstrate a high level of governmental commitment to dealing with drug issues in New Zealand.

Another benefit will be the increasing emphasis on inter-agency co-operation and cross-government approaches to drug policy issues. An NDP fund will provide the IACD and MCDP real ‘joint-ownership’ of a number of projects.

Servicing Ministerial Committee on Drug Policy & NDP

Jim Anderton successfully bid for funding in Budget 2004 to increase the capacity available for servicing the MCDP and the NDP. During the current Parliament, the Ministerial Committee on Drug Policy and Jim Anderton have increased the Labour Progressive government’s focus and action in relation to drug policy matters. Because of the increased activities, capacity needed to meet the requirements of Jim Anderton and the MCDP has increased. This capacity will, in part, be used to complete the following projects:

· Continuing improvement of the classification system. The Controlled Drug Classification System under the Expert Advisory Committee on Drugs (EACD) has become quicker over the last three classifications. However, increased capacity will allow the process to be improved further in both speed and quality;

· Improving and developing the Schedules of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 (the Act). Earlier this year, Jim Anderton announced his agreement to an EACD recommendation for the Ministry of Health to examine options for creating in the Schedules to the Act a classification of controlled drug that would allow for some level of availability while maintaining appropriate regulation (e.g. BZP). This would allow appropriate regulation for some substances that currently do not fit under the current Schedules of the Act. Increased capacity will allow this project to be effectively and efficiently completed;

· Improving the operation of the Inter-Agency Committee on Drugs (IACD) and the MCDP. The frequency of MCDP meetings in particular has increased with six meetings being held in 2003, compared to only one meeting in both 2002 and 2001. Increased capacity will allow these meetings to be held at this increased frequency with consistent and improved levels of organisation and quality.

Increased capacity will allow the Labour Progressive government to increase its focus on and action in matters of drug policy and better meet the challenge of emerging drug problems in New Zealand.

One for one exchange for needles & syringe programmes

Associate Minister of Health, Jim Anderton, has successfully sought funding to institute one-for-one exchange in the Needle and Syringe Exchange Programme (NSEP).

Sharing of injecting equipment by injecting drug users (IDUs) is a disastrously efficient way of transmitting blood borne viruses such as HIV and Hepatitis C.

The NSEP was established in 1987 with the purpose of enabling IDUs to use a new needle and syringe every time they inject and therefore reduce transmission of blood borne viruses within the New Zealand community.

Both internationally and within New Zealand NSEPs have been found to be a highly effective public health intervention.

While the majority of needle syringe exchange programmes in Western countries provide needles and syringes free of charge, the New Zealand NSEP has operated on a user-pays basis since its inception.

The additional funding will allow NSEP outlets to provide needles and syringes free of cost on a one-for-one exchange basis. One-for-one exchange is when IDUs are given a new needle and syringe for free in return for every used one they bring into the NSEP outlet.

According to Ministry of Health estimates, NSEP outlets in New Zealand are providing needles to cover only 10-11 percent of injecting incidents per year. In contrast Australian needle exchange programmes, which do not charge for equipment, provide approximately 27 percent of the required needles and syringes. One-for-one exchange should go some way to breaking down barriers for IDUs wishing to access NSEP services.

The New Zealand NSEP has a low rate of needle and syringe return (52%) compared to NSEP’s in other countries. Based on earlier pilot programmes, it is expected one-for-one exchange will provide a strong incentive for IDUs to return their used syringes to NSEP outlets. Return of needles and syringes means these items will be removed from circulation, reducing the likelihood of risky practices such as sharing and reusing equipment.

Encouraging IDUs to return used syringes to NSEP outlets will also reduce the number of needles and syringes being diposed of unsafely and thereby minimise the possibility of needle stick injuries to the public.

Background:

The Needle and Syringe Exchange Programme (NSEP) has been operating since the introduction of the Health (Needles and Syringes) Regulations 1987. As of 1 January 2002 there were 177 pharmacies, 13 dedicated needle exchanges and 10 alternative outlets operating in New Zealand. A small number of doctors and outreach workers also distribute injecting equipment through the NSEP. The NSEP currently has a turnover of approximately 1 million needles and syringes a year.

The review conducted in 2001 by the Centre for Harm Reduction in Australia, concluded that New Zealand’s NSEP has been effective in preventing HIV and HCV infections among IDUs.

It also found that a gradual but sustained decline in needle sharing had occurred since the late 1980s, which was likely to be at least partially as a result of NSEP activities. Furthermore, the review estimated that for every dollar spent on the NSEP, $3.35 was saved in health care costs that would otherwise have accrued over the period of the investment.

Strenghtening the NZ Drug Foundation's work

Budget 2004 includes additional funding for the New Zealand Drug Foundation to build up its staffing and research capabilities.

For example, the increased funding will permit the Foundation to undertake new research into treatment services for those facing problems with methamphetamine.

These people are a relatively difficult group of clients to retain in treatment. Their behavioural issues (irritability, paranoia and depression) puts stress on services, including detoxification services. The level of stigma associated with methamphetamine addiction means some individual and families find it hard to ask for help.

The research will assist the Foundation to assess the capacity of current treatment services to respond to emerging needs, including a review of the nature and extent of protocol development between mental health and treatment services. Identify a range of models for detoxification and identify gaps in service provision.

The New Zealand Drug Foundation was established in 1990. It is an independent non-government organisation.

The Foundation’s objective is to minimise drug related harm. This includes harm caused by legal drugs, such as tobacco and alcohol, as well as illegal drugs, such as cannabis.

The Foundation’s role is to promote co-ordination, consultation and co-operation among non-governmental organisations, to provide a contact point for the government and non-governmental organisations working in the area, and to provide a centre for valid and reliable information for organisations and individuals.

With over one hundred member organisations, the Foundation is ideally placed to carry out this role. Most of its members are organisations working in the health or education sectors.

The social and economic costs of drug and substance misuse are immense. Drug related harm from tobacco and alcohol alone is estimated to cost New Zealand more than $4 billion every year. This includes tangible costs, such as the cost of treatment and lost production. Some estimates, which include intangible costs, like reduced quality of life, are considerably higher.
