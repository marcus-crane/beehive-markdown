Callers to [Quitline]()"&gt;World Smokefree Day, Mr O'Connor will man the phones at Quitline, a free quit smoking telephone service.

One of the most used smoking support services in the world; Quitline receives about 90,000 calls a year. Callers can simply request quit smoking information, or register with Quitline to receive ongoing support and advice.

"This year has been one of Quitline's busiest," Mr O'Connor said, "partly because of the upcoming ban on smoking in restaurants and bars.

"People know that soon, they won't be able to smoke in bars and restaurants, and it's prompting them to give up."

Quitline's communications manager Liz Price agreed. She said the number of adult smokers in New York City plummeted by over 100,000 in the wake of the city's smokefree legislation.

"I suspect a number of New Zealand smokers will respond in a similar way, by stubbing out their cigarettes for good," she said.

The theme of this year's World Smokefree Day is Haria te auahi ki waho / Take the Smoke Outside. It focuses on the benefits of smokefree homes and cars, especially for children, who're particularly vulnerable to second-hand smoke.

"Second hand smoke kills about 350 people a year in this country and hospitalises more than 500 under two-year-olds annually from chest infections," Mr O'Connor said. "World Smokefree Day is a good opportunity to think about how we can reduce this kind of harm."

Mr O'Connor will be at Quitline, Level 12 Willbank House, 57 Willis Street, from 3-3:30pm today.
