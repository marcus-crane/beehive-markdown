Parents raising preschoolers will get more support from a new initiative launched by Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey today.

The $10.8 million SKIP: Strategies with Kids – Information for Parents campaign will work with community groups to provide resources and training for parents and caregivers of children up to five years old. The campaign comprises:  
·a $3.7 million SKIP Local Initiatives Fund for community groups wanting funding for local positive parenting projects will be available over the next two years;  
·$4.4 million to strengthen and expand existing parenting programmes;  
·$1.8 million is being spent on the production of national resources to support the campaign, and  
·$900,000 for monitoring, research and evaluation.

Steve Maharey said research shows that the most effective parenting uses love and nurturing and strong boundaries.

“Raising a child can be very challenging and parents tell us they are interested in learning new skills and strategies. As well as boosting training, SKIP will be producing lots of practical tips for parents trying to cope with the everyday challenges of bringing up small children.

“SKIP has been developed following extensive consultation with community groups. A strong theme that emerged from this was the need to tap into the organisations that have the history, the infrastructure and the networks to work with parents and children.

“With that in mind, one of SKIP’s three strands is developing national resources for training providers and parents wanting information and advice. The second strand will work with community organisations such as Plunket and Barnardos, to help them strengthen their existing programmes and services.

“The government believes strongly that making an investment in the health and capability of our children today is vital for the well-being of New Zealanders tomorrow. SKIP will give parents practical advice and support on society’s most important job – raising the next generation of dependable adults,” Steve Maharey said.
