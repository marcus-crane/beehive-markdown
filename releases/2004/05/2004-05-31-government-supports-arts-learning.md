A range of up-to-the-minute Arts resources designed for New Zealand schools was launched today by Education Minister Trevor Mallard.

"These six on-line, hard copy and real time curriculum resources will contribute to the cultural life of schools and their communities and help teachers develop their teaching skills," Trevor Mallard said.

"We know that quality teaching is the key to better student outcomes so the more we invest in teacher professional development, the better the results for students.

"The government committed $10 million to implementing the new Arts curriculum in 2001-2 and has committed $3.5 million to a long-term strategy to increase teacher confidence and competence in delivering the Arts."

The resources will enable students to develop their personal and cultural identity and to learn about the arts heritage of New Zealand's diverse cultures. They will encourage students to become knowledgeable critics and discerning audiences and to explore a wide range of future opportunities in arts-related employment.

The resource materials in Dance, Drama, Music and the Visual Arts were produced by the Ministry of Education, Learning Media Ltd and a range of arts organisations.

The resources are:  
**Sweet! II: another taste of New Zealand Music** – CD-ROM, CD, book and poster. This resource was developed and published by the New Zealand Music Industry Commission (NZMIC).  
**Give It a Whirl (Documentary Series, NZ Rock Music)** – Video and DVD with teachers’ notes. This is an educational version of the TV documentary series with teacher notes developed and published by Learning Media Ltd.
