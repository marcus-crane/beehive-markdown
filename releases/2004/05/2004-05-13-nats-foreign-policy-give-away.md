The National Party would rather contract out foreign policy decisions to overseas interests than stand on their own convictions, Foreign Minister Phil Goff said today.

"Within the space of a fortnight, National has confirmed on three occasions that major foreign policy decisions under a National government would not be made in New Zealand, but overseas," Mr Goff said.

"National have already made it clear that they would have made the decision to go to war in Iraq and would invite nuclear ships into our harbours.

"Now, with Nick Smith saying National would follow whatever the United States and Australia decide to do on the Kyoto Protocol, they would have us go against the Pacific in failing to stand by agreements New Zealand has made under successive governments to act against global warming

"Simon Power may well have been reprimanded for having said our armed forces should support our allies 'when and wheresoever our commitment is called upon'.  
However the truth is that National are prepared to surrender New Zealand's sovereignty.

"It is important that New Zealand makes its foreign policy decisions for itself in line with its own values and interests. This has won international respect for New Zealand and enhanced its influence in decision-making.

"In reversing their policy positions on all three issues, National have taken a sharp swing to the right, and in doing so, put themselves at odds with the viewpoint of the very clear majority of ordinary New Zealanders.

"This government and New Zealand are proud of having policies based on conviction. National both lacks conviction in these areas and the backbone to stand up for what is right as against what others might want us to do," Mr Goff said.
