Budget 2004

Increased pressure on the court system will be eased by a $73 million injection from Budget 2004 Courts Minister Rick Barker announced today.

"The government is putting $30 million over four years into running digital audio technology (DAT) to improve evidence recording and transcription in the High and District Courts.

"This evidence recording equipment means that courts are able to proceed at a ‘normal speaking speed’ and that the typed transcript of proceedings is available within 30 minutes of evidence having been given. The technology will enable judges to hear more cases faster and cut down waiting times”, says Rick Barker.

The funding will enable the implementation of new evidence recording equipment in 37 additional courtrooms in High and District Courts. The use of digital audio technology should result in a 12 per cent reduction in the time hearings take to complete.

The budget also invests $1.56 million in a two year pilot using mediators rather than judges in four Family Courts to work with families involved in custody, access or guardianship proceedings.

Rick Barker says non-judge led mediation is a means of speeding up the courts system and relieving the workload on judges.

"It's a win-win situation because the judges can get on with hearings and families can get through their cases in a way that may meet families’ needs better, especially children.

"New government legislation allowing an increase in the number of High Court judges to 55 up from 42, and the number of District Court judges to increase from 123 to 140 will also greatly help ease the pressure on our Courts.

"Courts are getting busier because tougher legislation like the new DNA laws, high crime resolution rates and more police, means more criminals are being caught and brought into the court system to face the music, despite the crime rate coming down 13.8 per cent since 1996.

"Courts must be highly efficient, the Government is putting both people and technology at the top of the list this budget. The replacement of computers to support new IT systems receives a $10 million capital injection over two years and $7.9 million operating funding over four years.

"Budget 2004 earmarks another $23.9 million over four years to relieving specific fiscal pressures affecting delivery of court services.

"This $73 million budget package of investment in our Court system puts people first and demonstrates my commitment to fairness and security in the New Zealand justice system.

"Building strong public services are the benchmark of this budget," says Rick Barker.
