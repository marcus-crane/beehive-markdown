Getting Auckland moving again is going to take more than waffle and fairy dust, says Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard.

Ms Tizard was responding to a speech delivered this morning by National leader Don Brash in which he finally accepted that Auckland does matter to the rest of New Zealand.

"This is a surprise, given that Dr Brash's caucus colleagues skulked from office in 1999 leaving no plans on the books for the future of Auckland infrastructure," says Ms Tizard.

"And to have faith in Dr Brash's promise to complete Auckland's roading network within 10 years you'd also have to believe in fairies at the bottom of the garden.

"It might sound cute to right-wing dreamers, but here's the reality: Dr Brash wants to spend billions of dollars from I know not where, cause thoughtless environmental damage, bulldoze whole communities into oblivion and replace hundreds of family homes with tarmac.

The Labour-led government is proposing balanced development, with increased expenditure giving Auckland the transport solutions it needs, and the rest of the country benefiting from the flow-on effects.

"This government has committed an extra $1.6 billion to improving Auckland's land transport system over the next decade. The funding and governance is now in place, and it'll deliver a more integrated and functional transport system for the city.

Ms Tizard said that the government took Auckland's role in New Zealand's economy and society seriously, and was working with local authorities, businesses, and communities to make Auckland a great place to live, learn, work, and do business.

"For the first time, Auckland’s share of Transfund funding in both public transport and in roading matches its share of New Zealand’s population. Eighteen Auckland projects were among the 54 top-ranked major state highway passenger transport initiatives in Transit New Zealand’s revised 10-year plan.
