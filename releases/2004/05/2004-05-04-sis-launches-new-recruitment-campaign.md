The SIS is using its website for the first time to advertise for recruits, Prime Minister and Minister in Charge of the Security Intelligence Service Helen Clark said today.

Announcing a new recruitment campaign, Helen Clark said that while the SIS had advertised for career intelligence staff for the past three years, this is the first time that the Service had used its website to do so.

“The website allows the Service to offer prospective candidates more detailed information about what the job entails and what the Service is looking for.

“The work of the Service in helping to protect New Zealand is important – and Service jobs are challenging and worthwhile. The Service hopes to attract good quality candidates.”

Helen Clark said recruitment advertisements will be published in major newspapers on Wednesday and Saturday this week.
