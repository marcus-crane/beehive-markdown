Tourism remains one of New Zealand’s most exciting and potentially valuable sectors, and a true economic powerhouse, according to Tourism Minister Mark Burton

Officially opening TRENZ 2004 (Tourism Rendezvous New Zealand), New Zealand’s largest trade show, Mark Burton outlined in detail tourism’s strong economic benefits.

“Last year alone, international visitors injected $6.4 billion into the New Zealand economy—an impressive 3.9 per cent increase on 2002’s record figures.

“Let me put these figures into perspective. Without international visitors, New Zealand would, to compensate, have add an additional 4.5 million cows to our dairy herd, put an extra 5.3 million hectares into forest production, or increase the size of our wine industry 23 times over. And all industry forecasts point to continued strong growth in visitor numbers and, more importantly, an even stronger growth in expenditure.

“I have real confidence that the sector will continue to be an economic powerhouse. Equally, I believe that this premiere industry can also be a model of sustainability, balancing strong growth with the care, protection, and, wherever possible, the enhancement of our natural and made environments.

“New Zealand truly is an ideal environment in which sustainable tourism can thrive. We have strong partnerships between government and the industry and a Tourism Strategy to guide the sector’s future direction. We have positive visitor and expenditure forecasts. And the 100% Pure New Zealand campaign, winner of numerous international marketing awards, clearly demonstrates our ability to promote New Zealand and leverage opportunities.

“We truly are achieving world-class standards in the intensely competitive environment of international tourism. The 409 overseas buyers, 447 New Zealand exhibitors, and 63 media from here and around the world are testament to that.

“I am confident that the sector’s blend of talent, innovation, skill, and quality will enable us to increase our reputation for excellence even further.”

TRENZ runs from Monday 24 May to Thursday 27 May, during which time buyers and exhibitors will hold more than 28,000 pre-scheduled appointments.
