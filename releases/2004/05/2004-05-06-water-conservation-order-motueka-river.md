Preserving the natural state of special parts of the Motueka River will be assured with the decision to place a Water Conservation Order on the river, Environment Minister Marian Hobbs said today.

"The Motueka River has many outstanding characteristics including the scientifically important Karst geological formations, blue duck habitats and brown trout fisheries.

"It is important that these characteristics and the river's other natural features are protected by the conservation order. This will ensure that everyone, both now and in the future, can enjoy the beauty and value of the river."

The Minister said the original application for an order was made in 1990 by the then Nelson Acclimatisation Society (now the Nelson Marlborough Fish and Game Council) and the Council of South Island Acclimatisation Society (now the New Zealand Fish and Game Council).

Marian Hobbs congratulated all parties to the public process for their work in reaching agreement on the content of the order. After carefully considering the relevant matters, she had concluded that an order was needed.

"The order provides certainty to the community in managing this special resource," Marian Hobbs said. "It restricts certain activities that would have a detrimental effect on the Motueka River, including damming and altering river flows.

"The conservation order will ensure the wild, scenic, fishing, and recreational characteristics of the Motueka River are preserved and protected."
