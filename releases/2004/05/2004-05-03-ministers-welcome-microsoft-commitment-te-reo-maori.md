John Tamihere, Associate Mäori Affairs Minister and David Cunliffe, Associate Information Technology Minister today congratulated Microsoft for its commitment to develop te reo Mäori versions of Windows XP and Office 2003.

Microsoft will be working with Mäori through the Mäori Language Commission to develop a community glossary of terms. The glossary will hold all of the technical terms to describe the different features of the programs.

Mr Tamihere, who is also Minister for Small Business says, “Mäori business plays an important role in New Zealand’s economic development. It’s great to see business tools being developed that allow them to leverage off their strengths to compete in an increasingly globalised economy.”

"The initiative is in line with some of the themes we hope to pick up on in the Government's soon to be released Digital Strategy. We want more Kiwis to feel confident using information and communication technologies in their daily lives. This helps." said Mr Cunliffe.

The project will be launched today at 1 pm in the Matangireia, the Mâori Affairs room at Parliament.
