Government has taken another significant step in ensuring a high quality tourism sector for New Zealand.

Tourism Minister Mark Burton today announced $500,000 in further development funding for Qualmark, New Zealand’s branded quality assurance system, as well as the launch of a new ‘Exclusive’ category, focused on high-end accommodation.

Speaking at the Tourism Rendezvous New Zealand trade show, Mark Burton acknowledged the ongoing value of Qualmark to New Zealand’s reputation overseas.

“Tourism is an economic powerhouse that has experienced unprecedented growth over the past few years. It is, by any measure, one of New Zealand’s premiere industries, accounting for nine per cent of GDP, and one in 11 jobs. With just over two million international arrivals in 2003, and this figure set to hit 3 million by 2009, it is without a doubt one of New Zealand’s most exciting and valuable industries.

“But we cannot afford to rest on our laurels or become complacent. We must continue to make sure that our guests’ experiences live up to our image overseas. Qualmark, our world leading quality assurance system, is an ideal way to ensure excellence across the sector.

“Today, as a further demonstration of the Labour-led government’s commitment to quality tourism, I am announcing an additional $500,000 of development funding for Qualmark over the next two years. Qualmark has expanded well beyond its original brief of accommodation assessment, and now includes adventure activities, cultural and nature experiences, rental car companies, bus and coach operators, museums, tours, retail, cafes, and more.

“Qualmark’s new ‘Exclusive’ accommodation category is designed for upmarket, intimate, highly individual establishments that offer the finest of locations, facilities, activities and services. Introduction of this category is a clear illustration of New Zealand’s increasing focus on attracting high-yield, sophisticated guests.

“1200 tourism businesses are either Qualmark licensed or in the process of being licensed. This is an outstanding achievement, demonstrating the high level of commitment by New Zealand’s tourism sector to deliver world-class visitor experiences.

“It’s a matter of real satisfaction for me that this government continues to work in partnership with the industry to support the development of quality tourism across New Zealand,” said Mark Burton.
