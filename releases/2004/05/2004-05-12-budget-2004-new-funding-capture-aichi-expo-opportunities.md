The Government is to spend $3.5 million to help New Zealand take full advantage of opportunities presented by participating in next year's Aichi Expo, Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced in Japan today

"The funds will support a broad four-year programme of events and activities so New Zealand gains longer-term benefits from the higher profile we will have in Japan through our involvement in Aichi,” Mr Goff said.

“Japan is emerging from its recent economic difficulties, and it remains a tremendously wealthy and sophisticated consumer society offering huge opportunities to New Zealand.

“To lead our effort to raise New Zealand's profile in Japan, Ambassador Phillip Gibson was recently appointed as Commissioner-General for Aichi.

“New Zealand is investing $8.5 million in its Expo Pavilion, which will create a unique window on New Zealand for millions of visitors over six months in 2005.

“Our presence at Aichi is aimed at broadening the Japanese perception of New Zealand; to show there’s more to us than just being ‘clean and green’. It will also show that we’re creative, innovative and stylish in many areas of interest to discerning Japanese consumers.

“However the Expo pavilion is only part of the picture. The associated activities, or 'leveraging programme' will help us strengthen New Zealand’s key relationships with Japan.

“Work is under way to identify projects for inclusion in the leveraging programme, led by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise with Mr Gibson's help.

“The projects will encompass the broad relationship with Japan in areas such as business, trade and technology, science, education, tourism and cultural exchanges,” Mr Goff said.

New Zealand’s Expo participation is being managed by NZTE, and it will coordinate the follow-up activities. The annual leveraging budget will be $500,000 in 2004-05, rising to $1 million for three years from 2005-06.
