The Budget increase in school operational funding means schools in Mangere, Manurewa, and Manukau East electorates are around 10 per cent better off now, in real terms, than they were in 1999.

"In 2005, Mangere, Manurewa, and Manukau East schools are expected to receive $1.68m more than last year, and $22.9 million more than in 1999," says Mangere MP Taito Phillip Field.

“That's about $80 more in real terms for each pupil in South Auckland," says Mr Field.

Projected 2005 operational funding for schools in Mangere, Manurewa, and Manukau East is about $66.2 million, on top of other funding.

Nationwide, the compulsory education sector will receive an extra $203 million over four years, including $92 million extra for schools' operational funding.

Taito Phillip Field says the latest increases are part of the government’s commitment to lift education standards, ensuring that every New Zealander can reach their full potential through a top quality education system.

Budget Education 2004 initiatives also include:  
·Getting more youngsters into free, high quality, early childhood education – a crucial early start on the education ladder: an extra $365 million.  
·Ensuring quality learning environments in school and early childhood education property: new funding of $347 million.  
·Lifting student achievement through the National Qualifications Framework and the National Certificate in Educational Achievement: an extra $17.8 million over four years.  
·Training and helping school boards: new money of $1.3 million.  
·Providing extra teachers, over and above catering for extra students, to give teachers more non-contact time and ease workloads: details will be announced later in the year.
