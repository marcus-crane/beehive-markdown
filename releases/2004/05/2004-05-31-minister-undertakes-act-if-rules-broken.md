Fisheries Minister David Benson-Pope has promised action will follow if evidence is found an East Coast marae is in breach of fisheries regulations.

Mr Benson-Pope has asked officials to see if anything has changed since previous claims of breaches of fisheries regulations proved unfounded.

"There is only one law and it applies to everyone," the minister said. "If there is any activity in breach of fisheries rules, then action will be taken."

"The information that we have to hand does not support the claim that the activity is unlawful."

The minister noted that claims of illegal fisheries activity in respect of Potaka Marae had been made previously and these were without substance.

Ministry of Fisheries staff recently visited the marae to discuss land-based aquaculture, and the requirements under fisheries law.

Mr Benson-Pope says he hopes the marae will take up these offers of help because a properly established aquaculture facility would clearly be an asset to the community and provide employment.
