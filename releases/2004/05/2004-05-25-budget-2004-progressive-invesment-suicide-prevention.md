Jim Anderton announced today that his Progressive Party had secured significant new investment to address suicide prevention in the Budget because suicide remains a significant challenge to society.

"I believe our current programmes to reduce suicide and suicide attempts are having a positive effect and officials believe the general trend in our suicide rates is starting to decline.

"However, there's still more work to do in order to save lives and Budget 2004 allocates $5.52 million over the next four financial years for this work to proceed," the Progressive leader said.

The new measures are aimed at all age groups and build on the New Zealand Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy.

They include:

- Improving assessment and management of people at risk of suicide.
- Investment: $700,000 a year for the next three years, $250,000 thereafter;
- Planning and designing a national initiative to combat depression.. I
- Investment: $300,000 in 2004/2005;
- Expanding the Suicide Prevention Information New Zealand (SPINZ) project; Investment: $2.8m over four years;
- Reprinting suicide prevention guidelines for schools; Investment: $60,000 over the next two years;
