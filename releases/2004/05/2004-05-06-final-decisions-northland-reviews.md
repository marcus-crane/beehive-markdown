Final decisions for Northland reviews

Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today most of his final decisions on the review of schools in the Northland area, a move that will unlock $3.6 million in extra resources for the education of local students.

"I have been impressed with the level and depth of the advice we have received and would like to thank all those involved in this project.

"I look forward to Northland students having access to quality education now and in the future and enjoying the benefits of the operational resources released to individual schools.

"Using current estimates, approximately $600,000 will go to Russell Peninsula schools. Of that $440,000 will be available to Russell Peninsula schools over and above their normal entitlements for education development resources. There will be a fund of $125,000 for schools to use jointly, and $40,000 of extra property funding will be available.

"Over $3 million will go to Central Northland schools. Of that $1.3 million will be available to Central Northland schools over and above their normal entitlements for education development resources. There will be a fund of $365,000 for schools to use jointly, and $1.3 million of extra property funding will be available," Trevor Mallard said.

The review decisions are:  
*Russell Peninsula*

- retain Karetu School;
- retain Russell School;
- close Ngaiotonga Valley School, Helena Bay School and Punaruku School and establish a new school (Whangaruru School) on the Punaruku School site with the Ngaiotonga Valley site to operate as a second site of the new school until 28 January 2007; and
- replace Waikare School with a new Designated Character School (Te Kura o Waikare).

*Central Northland*

- retain Kawakawa School and Hukerenui School;
- merge Tautoro School and Te Kura o Awarua on the Tautoro site to form a Year 1-8 school with Tautoro as the continuing school;
- merge Moerewa School and Otiria School on the Otiria site with Moerewa as the continuing school;
- merge Maromaku School and Towai School on the Maromaku site with Maromaku as the continuing school with the Towai site to operate as a second site of the continuing school until 28 January 2007;
- close Te Kura o Matawaia and Orauta School; and
- undertake further consultation on the issue of Maori immersion provision in the area. To allow full consideration of all options, decisions on whether to retain Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Taumarere and close Motatau School will be postponed until after this consultation.

"The reports of the mediators have been taken into account in my decisions to retain Towai and Ngaiotonga Valley School sites until January 2007. The use of these sites will aid the process of transition to new schools. The mediator's report also influenced my decision to delay decisions about Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Taumarere and Motatau School," Trevor Mallard said.

The board of each continuing school will manage the transition period and govern the new school until elections can be held. In the case of new schools, the minister will appoint new boards. The Ministry of Education will be seeking nominations for board positions in the near future.

In the case of closing schools, the boards of these schools have up to 28 days to present further arguments in favour of the school remaining open.

The ministry will work closely with schools to make sure their requirements for a smooth changeover are met and that the review is implemented in time for the 2005 school year.

The ministry's submission to Trevor Mallard and the mediators' reports are available on the network review section of the ministry's website [www.minedu.govt.nz](http://www.minedu.govt.nz)
