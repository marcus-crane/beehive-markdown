Government departments have made 104 reductions in compliance requirements for business since 2001, Minister for Small Business John Tamihere says.

A report by the Ministry of Economic Development shows that government departments have saved businesses time and money when complying with government regulations in 104 instances, Mr Tamihere says.

In 75 cases, saving in time for businesses was achieved, and in 29 cases, financial savings were achieved.

The leading area for compliance cost reductions was Companies and Securities compliance (33 reductions), followed by tax (19 reductions), Hazardous Substances and New Organisms (14), Statistics NZ surveys (10), Resource Management Act (7), ACC (4), Transport (2), employment relations (1) and "other" compliance (14).

Mr Tamihere said it was heartening to see solid progress being made on easing the compliance burden for business.

"Compliance remains a concern for businesses, particularly small businesses, and it is great to see that significant inroads are being made so businesses can spend less time dealing with red tape, and more time doing business."

*Compliance costs are any costs, both direct (taxes and fees) and indirect (paperwork and time costs) that a business faces in complying with government regulations.*
