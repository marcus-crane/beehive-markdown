A significant expansion of the student allowance scheme heads up a $110 million package for students announced today by Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey.

Other initiatives include expanded access to the Student Loan Scheme and increased funding to Student Job Search.

"The government is committed to ensuring access to tertiary education for all New Zealanders. Budget 2004 continues our strong record of keeping tertiary education affordable through measures such as no-interest-while-studying and the new fee maxima system.

"The new changes are an initial response to the feedback we received on the discussion document Student Support in New Zealand.

"The key element of the package is the increase in eligibility for student allowances. By increasing the lower and upper parental income thresholds, nearly 12,000 students who currently receive a partial allowance will now be eligible for a full allowance and a further 28,000 students will receive a partial (or abated) allowance. Additionally, approximately 3,000 students each year who currently get a partial allowance will get a higher allowance.

"The lower parental income threshold will rise from $28,080 to $33,696 and the upper threshold from $50,572 to $62,148. And from now on, parental income thresholds will be annually adjusted for inflation so eligibility will no longer be able to be eaten away as it was in the 1990s.

"These changes fulfil our manifesto commitment to ensure more students from low to moderate income families are eligible for student allowances.

"Changes are being made to student allowance regulations to bring them into line with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act as part of a government-wide approach to ensure consistency. From 1 January 2005:

- Single students, who have been previously married, will need to show exceptional circumstances when applying for an Independent Circumstances Grant.
- The entitlement of a single student to an Independent Circumstances Grant if he or she has been in paid employment for 96 weeks will be removed.
- Married students under 25 with no dependants who apply for a Student Allowance will have a parental income test, but will not be subject to a test of their spouse's income.

"The changes are expected to affect 7,000 students in 2005. Some of these students may retain eligibility for student allowances because of changes in parental income thresholds. Other students will be able to access the Student Loan Scheme to cover their living costs.

"Further changes to the Student Loan Scheme extend its coverage:

- From 1 January 2005, students studying between 0.25 and 0.3 of a full time course load will be able to get a student loan for tuition fees if their course meets certain conditions and they are in employment or studying for a qualification that will lead to employment.
- 'No asset procedure' debtors will in future be able to qualify for a student loan.

"New funding of $2.4 million is being invested in Student Job Search (SJS) to support the organisation to help students find employment. The new funding will assist SJS to move away from short low skill job placements to a focus on assisting students into skilled placements of longer duration, by supporting better national-level coordination and enabling the establishment of an Advisory Board, involving employers and other stakeholders," Steve Maharey said.
