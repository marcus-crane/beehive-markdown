"The Budget will announce new measures to help both firms and entire sectors to break into new markets.

"It will also take further steps to attract foreign investment to job-rich new enterprises. We need to use investment capital to help unleash the potential of New Zealand's innovative and creative businesses, and the Budget will take further steps to encourage investment in our future development.

"There are immense opportunities for New Zealand from the increasing globalisation of research and development. Budget 2004 will put in place several initiatives to improve collaborations between New Zealand and overseas researchers.

"Overall, Budget 2004 will make a significant contribution to improving our links with the world. There is an enormous amount of innovation in the New Zealand economy. Most of it is the result of the incredible talent and creativity of New Zealanders. The Government is committed to standing alongside them and playing our role in partnership to realise our potential as nation," Jim Anderton said.
