PriceWaterhouseCoopers partner Brian Roche has been appointed as establishment chairman of the new Auckland Regional Transport Authority (ARTA), Local Government Minister Chris Carter announced today.

"Mr Roche has extensive senior management and governance experience, and an established track record in forming effective working relationships across a range of organisations," Mr Carter said.

"Mr Roche will work with the Auckland Regional Council, Auckland territorial authorities and other key parties to undertake preparatory work to establish ARTA, and enable the ARTA board, when it is appointed, to move swiftly forwards."

ARC Chair Gwen Bull said the Council welcomed the appointment of Mr Roche and looked forward to working with him over the coming months.

“Brian’s appointment will help to ensure that the process of setting up ARTA is as smooth as possible,” Cr Bull said.

The government is setting up a single authority to develop Auckland's transport system in a more integrated and efficient way.

Mr Roche is a former chief executive of Housing New Zealand, chief executive of the Crown Company Monitoring and Advisory Unit in Treasury, and a chief negotiator for the Crown in the Ngai Tahu treaty settlement.
