Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced the winners of the student essay competition on the Battle of Monte Cassino.

The four winners are James Keating, St Patrick’s College, Kilbirnie, Wellington; Alice Minhinnick, Epsom Girls’ Grammar School, Auckland; Christopher Jenkins, Howick College, Auckland; and Jonathan Falconer, Christ’s College, Christchurch.

"The authors of these essays will accompany the official New Zealand delegation to Italy in May for the commemorations marking the sixtieth anniversary of the Battle of Monte Cassino,” Helen Clark said.

“The winners were selected by the Speaker of the House and former history teacher, Jonathan Hunt. My congratulations go to all the students who participated in the competition.

“It is clear that a lot of research and effort has gone into the essays, which I believe reflects the growing interest in New Zealand’s history among young people. This is to be applauded,” Helen Clark said.

Helen Clark said she was looking forward to meeting the four essay winners at Cassino.

The four youngsters will join the Prime Minister and the official delegation in Italy for the commemoration and participate in ceremonies on 20 and 21 May. The delegation will also include 50 veterans, a New Zealand Defence Force honour guard, a cultural group, a government MP and an Opposition MP.
