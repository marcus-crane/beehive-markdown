The Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) has been assured by an independent report that no claims for public money have been made by Tairawhiti Polytechnic for learners who did not receive materials for the courses in which they enrolled, Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education) Steve Maharey said today.

A copy of the report into the management and recording of category 5.1 courses, commissioned by Tairawhiti Polytechnic, has been received by the TEC.

Steve Maharey said that this independent report, undertaken according to standards established by the TEC and the polytechnic’s own quality management system, gave assurances that no evidence was found of any invalid enrolments being recorded and claimed by the polytechnic.

“Although the report identified a number of issues, I am pleased to say that many of these have already been addressed by the polytechnic.

“Those areas requiring further action will be followed up by the TEC during its regular ongoing dialogue with the polytechnic in the coming weeks,” Steve Maharey said.
