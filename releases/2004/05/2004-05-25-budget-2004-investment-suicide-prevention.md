Jim Anderton announced today that his Progressive Party had secured significant new investment to address suicide prevention in the Budget because suicide remains a significant challenge to society.

"I believe our current programmes to reduce suicide and suicide attempts are having a positive effect and officials believe the general trend in our suicide rates is starting to decline.

"However, there’s still more work to do in order to save lives and Budget 2004 allocates $5.52 million over the next four financial years for this work to proceed," the Progressive leader said.

The new measures are aimed at all age groups and build on the New Zealand Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy.

They include:

Improving assessment and management of people at risk of suicide. Investment: $700,000 a year for the next three years, $250,000 thereafter;

Planning and designing a national initiative to combat depression. Investment: $300,000 in 2004/2005;

Expanding the Suicide Prevention Information New Zealand (SPINZ) project; Investment: $2.8m over four years;

Reprinting suicide prevention guidelines for schools; Investment: $60,000 over the next two years;

Improving the assessment and management of people at risk of suicide

Research suggests that people who are admitted to hospital after a suicide attempt are less likely to make a further attempt if they are referred for psychiatric assessment before discharge, and given the help they need.

A new guideline has been prepared to help emergency departments and mental health services assess and manage people at risk of suicide, and refer them for appropriate treatment.

The new initiative will assist in effectively implementing the guideline on a nationwide basis, providing an opportunity to change the practice of those clinicians and teams who would not otherwise have the knowledge, skills or time to adopt it so soon.

Its key focus will be on improving skills in the emergency department and mental health service workforce to better assess and manage suicide risk, and reviewing workforce configuration to better respond to risk, in accordance with the evidence based guideline.

Expert assistance and training will be made available to DHBs to help them implement the new guideline.

Investment for this initiative will be $700,000 a year for the next three years, and $250,000 subsequently. The project will be carefully evaluated to gauge its success.

Planning awareness-raising strategy to combat depression

Depression is a leading cause of suicide and carries major personal, social and economic costs.

The World Health Organization has estimated that by 2020 depression will rank second only to heart disease in terms of disability-adjusted life years which is a measure of health burden.

People with major depression report poorer health, lower quality of life and take more time off work. One estimate puts the cost of depression to New Zealand at approximately $750 million a year.

In spite of this, it appears that depression continues to be both under-recognised and under-treated. Conversely, a number of studies have shown benefit from the treatment of depression in a primary health care setting, including a reduction in suicides.

New Zealand research indicates that one of the major reasons for not seeking treatment arises from perceptions that symptoms are not severe enough to warrant treatment. In turn this implies that educative campaigns which advise and inform people and their families about mental health problems and how to access health services are successful in removing the stigma from seeking help and increase understanding about the benefits and efficacy of early treatment for depression.

This new initiative will help design a national project to raise awareness of depression and related mental health problems which will assist both treatment and recovery. It will identify effective approaches, costs, timing, and workforce issues. A survey will also be carried out to measure knowledge, attitudes and behaviours with regard to depression at a cost of $300,000.

Expanding the Suicide Prevention Information Project NZ

SPINZ, which provides community organisations with information, advice and resources on suicide prevention, has seen the demand for its services more than treble between 2001 and 2003.

Budget 2004 provides for the expansion of SPINZ in three key areas.

Strengthening the community liaison function, extending the scope of service delivery from a youth-focus to include information provision to all and developing more skills training for suicide prevention across all age groups.

Additional funds for community liaison will strengthen the ability of SPINZ to reach and resource the community effectively and provide an active presence across the country. It will also enable SPINZ to more proactively address and respond to the needs of specific communities by developing targeted resources that translate suicide prevention information into practical application.

Expansion of SPINZ services to include suicide prevention across all age groups recognises that while its focus has largely been on preventing youth suicide, SPINZ is now being asked for prevention information that relates to all age ranges (three quarters of people who commit suicide are aged over 24).

This expansion of SPINZ aligns with the work being led by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Youth Development on an all ages suicide prevention strategy.

The initiative will also fund SPINZ to deliver Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST), in partnership with Lifeline Auckland, to compliment the existing training it provides on suicide prevention awareness. This model of skills training will establish and maintain a New Zealand wide network of community and workplace based professionals trained in the work of suicide prevention. It encourages the parties to become self-funding after three years.

SPINZ currently receives $482,500 of government investment a year. Additional investment for this initiative, from Vote Youth Development, is $2.8 million over four years.

Updating suicide prevention guidelines for schools

The Ministry of Education and the National Health Committee published the booklet Young People at Risk of Suicide: A Guide for Schools in 1998. This was produced as a result of a report commissioned by the Ministry and written by four authors who have expertise in suicide prevention.

The publication is still seen as the guide for suicide prevention in schools. The Ministry of Education will now review and update the booklet to include the latest evidence and information, and distribute it again.

Over the next two years the booklet will be reviewed, updated and reprinted at a cost of $60,000 over two years.
