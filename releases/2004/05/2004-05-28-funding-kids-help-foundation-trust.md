Funding to assist the Kids Help Foundation Trust has been approved by the government, Child, Youth and Family Minister Ruth Dyson announced today.

The Trust operates the What’s Up national telephone counselling service for children and young people.

The Child, Youth and Family Service has agreed to put $40,000 towards meeting the Trust’s shortfall.

“I am pleased that further government financial assistance will enable the Kids Help Foundation Trust to continue,” Ruth Dyson said.

“The Child, Youth and Family Service and Ministry of Social Development will continue to work with the organisation with a view to securing its ongoing financial viability.”

The Kids Help Foundation Trust is also continuing its own efforts to secure private sponsorship.
