Prime Minister Helen Clark has extended her deepest sympathy and condolences to the family of John Robert Tyrrell who was killed yesterday in Kirkuk, Iraq.

"I am saddened at the tragic death of Mr Tyrrell and my thoughts are with his family and friends, both in New Zealand and overseas," Helen Clark said.

"It is a tragedy that a New Zealander has been caught up in the conflict. Iraq is an extremely dangerous place for foreigners.

"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is reiterating its longstanding advice that New Zealanders should not travel to Iraq and any civilians there should leave immediately.

"Our hearts go out to Mr Tyrrell's family and friends at this sad time," Helen Clark said.
