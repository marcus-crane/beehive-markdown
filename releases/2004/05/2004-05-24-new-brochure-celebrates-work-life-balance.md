The stories of four New Zealand women featured in a new brochure promoting work-life balance highlight some of the key issues facing women.

The brochure, produced by the National Council on the Employment of Women (NACEW), was released today by Associate Labour Minister and Minister of Women’s Affairs Ruth Dyson.

The women featured in the brochure, Kate, a farmer, Tania, a teacher, Catherine, a personal assistant and Sela, a policy analyst, tell very different stories, but they all struggle to achieve some semblance of balance in their lives.

“Most women will recognise themselves in some of these stories. These are women are constantly juggling their lives and making difficult choices, balancing work demands against family time,” Ruth Dyson said.

“Most of us have to work around deadlines of one kind or another. Our culture rewards long hours and loyalty to meeting work goals above and beyond our life outside work. Because women often have greater home responsibilities than men, a typical day can be a double shift of work interlaced with keeping the home and family ticking over.

“Women have the right to have real choices in life. The women in the brochure have taken the time to think about strategies that work for them. Their stories are pragmatic accounts of making the best out of life. They offer some valuable insights and some down-to-earth advice. They are well worth reading.”

The brochure also outlines some work-life options for employers to consider.

Informal measures include arrangements such as ensuring employees have access to a telephone so they can be contacted by their families or check on their children. Formal policy arrangements include options for flexible work hours or comprehensive family and carer leave entitlements for both men and women.

NACEW, which advises the Labour Minister on employment issues for women, is urging women to read the brochure and to talk to employers, friends, family and colleagues to help find solutions that work for their particular situation.

The government is due to publish a report next month on the state of New Zealand’s work and life balance following a nationwide public consultation exercise.
