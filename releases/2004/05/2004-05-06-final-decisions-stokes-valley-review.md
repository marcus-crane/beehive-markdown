Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today his final decisions on the review of Stokes Valley schools, a move that will unlock over $1.5 million in extra resources for the education of local students.

"I have agreed with all of the recommendations of the mediator who has been working with schools and the community to come up with a good solution for local students.

"I would like to thank all those involved in this project for their advice and feedback during what has been a challenging and stressful time.

"This reorganisation is aimed at ensuring Stokes Valley students have access to quality and sustainable education now and into the future. Students will also be able to enjoy the benefits of the extra operational resources released to individual schools.

"Using current estimates, $711,000 will be available to Stokes Valley schools, over and above their normal entitlements, for education development resources. There will be a fund of $203,220 for schools to use for joint education projects, and $609,739 of extra property funding will be available, " Trevor Mallard said.

The review decisions are:

- retain Tui Glen School as a full primary school, offering years 7 and 8;
- retain Tawhai School as a contributing school (years 1-6); and
- merge Kamahi School with Stokes Valley School on the Kamahi School site, with Stokes Valley School being the continuing contributing school.

The board of the continuing school will co-opt a member from the Kamahi board, manage the transition period and govern the new school until elections can be held.

The Ministry of Education will work closely with schools to make sure their requirements for a smooth changeover are met and that the review is implemented in time for the 2005 school year.

The ministry's submission to Trevor Mallard and the mediator's report will be available on the network review section of the ministry's website www.minedu.govt.nz

The list of approximate funding for the schools follows. Funding is worked out on a roll basis, and follows students to their chosen school.
