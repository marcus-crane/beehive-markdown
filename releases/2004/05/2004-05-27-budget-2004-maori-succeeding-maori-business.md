The Vote: Maori Affairs package in the budget is designed to advance Te Puni Kokiri's 'Maori succeeding as Maori' vision and to assist Maori develop their skills and assets.

"By 2021, one in five people aged 15 to 39 will be Maori. Their success will be vital to the growth and success of the country, Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said today.

"This budget will strengthen Maori contribution to the New Zealand economy - a contribution that will not only benefit Maori but New Zealand as a whole. What is good for Maori is good for New Zealand.

"Maori are entrepreneurial, youthful and dynamic. These are all qualities of successful commercial participants and this budget aims to harness this potential and grow it.

"Through this budget, the government will continue to support enterprise development.

"The budget supports and expands the successful Maori Business Facilitation Service (MBFS) to advise and mentor Maori in business: $10 million of operational funding has been provided for this purpose over the next four years.

"A new area of support is assistance with the Hui Taumata, a major summit focussed on expanding Maori economic pathways and accelerating Maori economic development. This hui, scheduled for later this year, will be tasked with setting 20 year goals for Maori development.

Additional resources will also be allocated to expand the current Maori Regional Tourism Programme. This initiative supports the Tourism Strategy 2010 and will help to ensure Maori business sustainability and growth in the tourism area.

"This budget acknowledges the positive contribution of Mäori to the wider New Zealand economy, and provides opportunity for Maori to build on this," Parekura Horomia said.
