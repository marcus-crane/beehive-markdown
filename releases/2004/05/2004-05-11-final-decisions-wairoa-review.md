Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today his final decisions on the review of schools in the Wairoa area, a move that will unlock nearly $5.85 million in extra resources for the education of local students.

"I have agreed with all of the recommendations of the mediator who has been working with schools and the community to come up with a good solution for local students.

"I would like to thank all those involved in this project for their advice and feedback during what has been a challenging and stressful time.

"This reorganisation is aimed at ensuring Wairoa students have access to quality and sustainable education now and into the future. Students will also be able to enjoy the benefits of the extra operational resources released to individual schools.

"Using current estimates, $1.92 million will be available to individual schools over and above their normal entitlements for education development resources. There will be a fund of $549,000 for schools to use jointly, and $3.38 million of extra property funding will be available," Trevor Mallard said.

The review decisions are:

- retain Kotemaori School, Ohuka School, Putere School, Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Te Wairoa, Tiniroto School, Nuhaka and Tukemokihi schools as full primary schools;
- Wairoa College becomes a Year 7 - 13 school;
- merge North Clyde School with Wairoa Primary School on the Wairoa Primary School site to form a Year 1 - 6 contributing school with Wairoa Primary being the continuing school;
- merge Turiroa School with Hillneath school on the Hillneath School site to form a Year 1 - 6 contributing school with Turiroa being the continuing school;
- merge Ruakituri School with Te Reinga School on the Ruakituri School site as a Year 1 - 8 full primary school with Ruakituri being the continuing school;
- merge Opoutama School and Te Mahia School on the Te Mahia School site as a Year 1 - 8 full primary school with Te Mahia being the continuing school;
- merge Raupunga School with Mohaka School on the Mohaka School site as a Year 1 - 8 full primary school with Mohaka being the continuing school;
- Frasertown School becomes a Year 1 - 6 contributing school;
- close Tuai School and Kokako School and establish a new full primary school on the Tuai School site, with an independent chairperson appointed as per the mediator’s recommendation.

Whakaki School will close on 14 May 2004 as requested by its board.

In the case of Tuai and Kokako schools, the boards of these schools have up to 28 days to present further arguments in favour of the schools remaining open.

The board of each continuing school will manage the transition period and govern the new school until elections can be held.

The Ministry of Education will work closely with schools to make sure their requirements for a smooth changeover are met and that the review is implemented in time for the 2005 school year.
