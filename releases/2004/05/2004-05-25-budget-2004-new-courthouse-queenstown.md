Budget 2004 will deliver Queenstown its long awaited new courthouse, Courts Minister Rick Barker announced today.

The Government is investing $3.5m over 2004/05 and 2005/06 to provide a modern courthouse to service the needs of Queenstown's expanding population.

Rick Barker says that although the current building, built in 1877, is quaint and historic, it is now far too small and out of date.

"The current courthouse is still in reasonable condition but falls well short of requirements for a modern day courthouse; it's too small and has inadequate security for users, the judiciary and staff."

"This investment means that rather than people having to go to Alexandra for civil and family court cases, the new courthouse will be large enough for work to be relocated to Queenstown.

"This is great news for locals who currently suffer from having to travel a long way to court

"Processing of fines and other fine collection activities for the Whakatipu basin will also occur in Queenstown.

"This is a fast growing town, so construction needs to get under way quickly. I've asked the Ministry of Justice to start work, identifying options for the new modern courthouse, aiming for completion by 2006," says Rick Barker.
