Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor has welcomed the debate over the legal purchase age for alcohol.

Speaking from a Food and Agriculture conference in China, Mr O'Connor, who's the Minister responsible for alcohol, said he hadn't supported lowering the age in 1999 and considered visions of a positive outcome quite naïve at the time.

"The Justice Ministry report backs up what a lot of people have been feeling about this, and that is that the lowering of the drinking age has not had the desired effect."

He said while he personally favoured a return to a minimum purchase age of 20, reversing the age would not be the silver bullet for New Zealand's teen drinking problems.

"If people think raising the age will mean everyone can sit back and consider the job done, they're wrong.

"The reality is that youth are reflecting the drinking attitudes and behaviours of adult New Zealanders.

"We as adults have to acknowledge that we're part of problem, and we need to start making more responsible choices about how we drink.

"We also need to redefine ourselves as a nation and get away from the pride we seem to have in our 'hard-drinking' culture."

There was a proven connection between intoxication and negative outcomes such as accidents, health problems, domestic violence and crime, he said.

"We worry about these harms, but we don't seem remotely worried about having a few too many drinks, which is more often than not the root of the problem.

"Parents can no longer hide behind the "rite of passage" or "it didn't do us any harm" arguments. If they want to keep their kids out of harm's way, they'll have to change too."
