"Today marks the beginning of another testing and challenging time with the introduction of the [Foreshore and Seabed Bill](http://www.knowledge-basket.co.nz/gpprint/docs/bills/20041291.txt)," said Parekura Horomia.

"Yesterday was an emotional day for all involved with the hikoi and has set the scene. Yesterday I gave the leaders of the hikoi the opportunity to meet with the Deputy Prime Minister and myself and to present their take. They chose not to, for the time being and that's OK.

"After today it won't be OK if individuals, whanau, hapu and iwi do not take the opportunity that is now before them to engage in the select committee process by making their views known.

"On Parliament's forecourt we saw an outpour of solidarity in relation to a wide range of issues that Maori are passionate about. The challenge now is for Maori around the country to channel their energy into making submissions on this very important bill. I am hopeful that genuine opponents will make submissions for the select committee to consider.

"Today I spoke in support of the Government's foreshore and seabed legislation and the protection it affords for whanau, hapu and iwi because I believe it delivers.

"It's my intention to actively promote the communications process that started today, because it's important that we keep moving forward to ensure Maori remain the Kaitiakitanga O Tangaroa.
