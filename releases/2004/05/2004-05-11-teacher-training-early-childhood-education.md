Early childhood education services will still be able to employ teachers who are gaining qualifications when teacher registration becomes compulsory in teacher-led services, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

"To do this the government is creating an exemption to the requirement for teacher registration. This exemption will apply to services employing teachers who are undertaking a teacher training course that is approved for teacher registration by the New Zealand Teachers Council," Trevor Mallard said.

"Early childhood education services will be able meet the target of registration for all early childhood education teachers by having up to 30 per cent of their teachers enrolled in approved teacher training programmes.

"Teacher training through centre-based programmes is an important way for early childhood teachers to get the qualifications they need to become registered.

"This is why the strategic plan for early childhood education Ngä Huarahi Arataki signalled the need for a way to allow centres to continue employing staff that are studying towards teacher registration.

"This change will provide services with more flexibility in staffing, maintain the strong tradition of centre-based teacher training, and ensure all staff in a service are either registered or working towards teacher registration.

"Kaumatua or elders who have valuable language skills play an important role in bi-lingual and immersion early childhood education services. Teacher registration requirements may make it more difficult for centres to employ kaumatua or elders, as many do not have qualifications.

"This issue will be discussed soon as part of the early childhood education regulatory review, with a view to considering including language leaders in the 30 per cent group of teachers who are not qualified," Trevor Mallard said.
