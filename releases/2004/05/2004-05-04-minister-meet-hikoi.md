There was never any doubt that the Minister of Maori Affairs would meet the hikoi tomorrow when it arrives at Parliament.

"I respect everyone's right to hikoi and accept that there are strong feelings amongst not just Maori, but Pakeha who are taking part in the hikoi," Parekura Horomia said today.

"As I've said previously I support the government's foreshore and seabed legislation and the protection it affords for whanau, hapu and iwi. Others clearly don't. The promotion of this bill through the select committee process will give opponents further opportunities to present their submissions.

"I was elected to do the best I could for my people. As Minister of Maori Affairs I am trying to ensure that we have a platform that is fair and provides security for our people as a first nations people and benefits all New Zealanders.

"It is my intention not to sway from this, but to continue moving forward. To that end I will be meeting the hikoi tomorrow and look forward to working with those who genuinely want to ensure our people remain the Kaitiakitanga 0 Tangaroa.
