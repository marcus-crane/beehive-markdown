Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that Saturday, 10 July has been set as the date for the Te Tai Hauauru by-election, should the vacancy be contested.

The Parliamentary vacancy results from Mrs Turia’s resignation from Parliament, effective from 17 May.

“The Chief Electoral Officer has indicated his preference for polling day to be 10 July, because of the large size of the Te Tai Hauauru electorate,” Helen Clark said.

“This timeframe will enable the Electoral Enrolment Centre to organise an enrolment campaign to ensure that Te Tai Hauauru voters are on the roll.

“It will also allow the Chief Electoral Officer to make appropriate preparations for a by-election across a very large electorate.”

Helen Clark said the Government will advise the Governor-General to issue the writ on 4 June, following which nominations can be made. Nominations for candidates will close at noon on 15 June.
