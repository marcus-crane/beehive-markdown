BUDGET ANNOUNCEMENT

EMBARGO: NOON, SUNDAY 23 MAY 2004

The [New Zealand Music Industry Commission](http://www.nzmusic.org.nz/default.cfm) (MIC) will receive new funding of $600,000 per annum for the next three years in the 2004 Budget, Culture and Heritage Associate Minister Judith Tizard announced today.

The Commission was established in June 2000 with funding of $2 million over 5 years from the May 2000 ‘Cultural Recovery Package’.

“Since its establishment, the Commission has undertaken a wide range of initiatives to successfully promote contemporary New Zealand music domestically and internationally” said Ms Tizard.

“I am delighted that the Government is able to continue to support the Commission in its work and to build on the momentum of the last four years.”

The MIC facilitates growth in the New Zealand Music Industry through a range of projects and partnerships. It has forged partnerships with a number of other government and other organisations to promote New Zealand music through programmes such as the annual [‘New Zealand music month’](http://www.nzmusicmonth.co.nz/) programme in association with NZ on Air, RBA, RIANZ and APRA and others; and Resonate – a three day music industry seminar, with the British Council.

The MIC also ensures a New Zealand presence at international trade shows, provides advice for music industry practitioners and provides resources and runs programmes supporting the arts curriculum under a contract with the Ministry of Education.

The growth of the New Zealand music industry and popularity of New Zealand music both domestically and internationally affirms the Government’s support for the Music Industry Commission and the work that it is involved in.

Ms Tizard commented, “funding the Music Industry Commission recognises the depth of the talent in New Zealand and the huge potential of the New Zealand music industry which makes a unique and valuable contribution to New Zealand culture. This success is demonstrated by the popularity and continued growth of New Zealand Music Month and the dramatic increase of New Zealand music content on radio.”
