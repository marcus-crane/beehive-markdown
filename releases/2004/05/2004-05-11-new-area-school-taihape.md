Following a 28-day consultation period, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today his decision regarding the new area school for Taihape.

“I have carefully considered the information that the boards of Taihape College and Taihape School presented to me regarding my decision to close both schools.

"The Ministry of Education has consulted affected boards on my behalf.

"After considering all the information provided to me I am satisfied that Taihape College and Taihape School should both close and a new area school be established on the Taihape School site. The Taihape College farm is also to be retained as the property of the new area school.

"The closures will be gazetted shortly to take effect on 28 January 2005.

"I'd like to thank everyone who has been involved in this process. There is a strong future for the new area school and I firmly believe that it will provide a quality education for local kids that is sustainable well into the future,” Trevor Mallard said.
