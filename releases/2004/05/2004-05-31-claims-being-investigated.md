The Crown is currently investigating 62 claims that have been filed in relation to allegations made about treatment at various psychiatric institutions including Porirua.

"It's understood that another 44 claims are expected to be filed," said Attorney-General Margaret Wilson.

"Until the Crown has completed its investigation, no decision can be made on whether or not to hold an inquiry.

"The Crown's investigations will take some time because many of the claims relate to incidents that took place more than 30 years ago.

"The Crown treats these claims seriously, and that's why they're all being investigated.

"Generally, the Crown will not make payments unless legal liability can be established."
