FBT rate for low interest loans rises

The prescribed rate used to calculate fringe benefit tax on low-interest, employment-related loans will rise from 7.30 per cent to 7.50 per cent from 1 July, Revenue Minister Michael Cullen announced today.

The rate is reviewed regularly in line with the results of the Reserve Bank’s survey of first mortgage interest rates. It was last changed with effect from 1 April 2004.

The change was approved by Order in Council today.
