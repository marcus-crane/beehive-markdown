David Cunliffe, Associate Minister of Information Technology, today released the Legislating against Spam discussion document. The document seeks input from interested parties on options for anti-Spam laws.

"This Government is committed to an anti-Spam law. Spam is a huge waste of time and money, over two thirds of all email is now Spam. This undermines the confidence, security and efficiency of New Zealanders on line." said David Cunliffe.

Officials have undertaken research into anti-spam regimes in a number of jurisdictions to inform their work on the discussion paper. A preference for a stand alone, 'opt-in' law is indicated in the discussion document.

"Legislation is part of a multi-pronged attack on Spam. Partnership with industry and the community on education and codes of practice also has a valuable role to play."

"I have released this discussion document so we can get feedback and ensure the bill is robust and achieves its aims. I encourage all groups with an interest to read the discussion document and provide feedback."

"The Government is taking the Spam problem very seriously. It will only worsen unless it is addressed comprehensively." said Mr Cunliffe

The discussion document and details for providing feedback are available on the Ministry of Economic Development's [www.med.govt.nz/pbt/infotech/spam/"&gt;website]()
