Housing Minister Steve Maharey visited Fordlands in Rotorua to look at the suburb’s Community Renewal programme today.

The aim of the Programme – a three-way partnership between Housing New Zealand Corporation, Rotorua District Council and the Fordlands Community Association – is to improve and enhance Fordland’s physical environment and amenities and address employment, safety, health, education and social service delivery issues.

Fordlands was established in the 1950s as a state housing area. Since July 2001, when the community renewal programme was launched, Fordlands has become a better place to live. It is one of six community renewal programmes around the country. Other communities involved in the programme are Northcote, Talbot Park (Glen Innes), Clendon (Manukau), Porirua, Aranui (Christchurch).

Steve Maharey said Fordlands is an example of successful community renewal in action.

“The community has been involved in the Fordlands project from the start, and we have already made improvements on some of the issues raised as part of the project’s early stages – such as cold, damp housing.

“Of Fordland’s 481 homes, 159 are owned by HNZC, and of these 71 will have been refurbished by July. HNZC homes in the area have also been insulated as part of an energy efficiency programme.

“Community renewal is about more than just physical improvements to home. It is also about supporting people into employment. This is happening in Fordlands with the creation of 13 full-time jobs to date for local people who have been working on refurbishments.

“Safety was another issue residents raised, and as a result the Corporation has worked with the Rotorua District Council on a programme of crime prevention through environmental design, including building fences for houses backing onto reserves.

“The Fordlands community renewal programme is set to continue through 2005, with $500,000 allocated for the 2004/2005 financial year. Just over $2m was spent on the programme this year,” Steve Maharey said.
