Associate Tourism Minister Dover Samuels is pleased that Maori tourism will get a boost as part of initiatives announced in Budget 2004.

The Maori Regional Tourism Programme (MRTP) is a package that offers more assistance to regional Mâori tourism organisations as well the national body.

The programme assists regional organisations to develop business plans, enhance the quality of Maori tourism in the regions, promote the interests of Maori tourism within key organisations and to strengthen relationships with existing regional tourism organisations.

"Funding will be allocated to support and develop a National Network, which is intended to support MRTOs through informing and maintaining links among member organisations. Provide linkages between the MRTOs and nationally focused tourism organisations, such as the Ministry of Tourism, Tourism New Zealand, Tourism Research Council and The Tourism Industry Association New Zealand," says Dover Samuels.

"The funding for the programme will also provide a Maori Regional Tourism Programme Manager says Dover Samuels.

"The objective of establishing this new position is to provide a single, dedicated point of contact and responsibility for the MRTP. This is intended to encourage better coordination of programme policy and operations, promote strong linkages with key industry and government organisations and promote consistency and clarity across the programme.

"Last year New Zealand hosted more than two million people who spent more than 6 billion dollars on the local economy.

"Maori tourism is still under developed. Maori tourism will benefit Maori, the tourism industry and the economy as a whole.  
"Assistance for Maori Regional Tourism Groups is one way the government can assist to enhance the potential that Maori tourism has to the New Zealand economy.

"The Labour government recognises the Maori tourism industry is growing quickly and it is important we assist this industry to develop in a positive and sustainable way," says Dover Samuels.
