Embargoed to 1am, FridayBounce in business confidence encouraging

Finance Minister Michael Cullen today welcomed the latest National Bank Business Outlook showing a rebound in confidence, saying it supported the growth track in this year’s budget.

“The lift to net 25 per cent positive in the important own activity indicator is particularly encouraging in this regard, he said.

Budget 2004 projects growth of 3.3 per cent in 2003-04; 2.8 per cent in 2004-05; 2.5 per cent in 2005-06 and 3.4 per cent in 2006-07.

“This was toward the top end of market expectations when the Treasury finalised its budget forecasts but is reinforced by the survey results,” Dr Cullen said.

However he warned against reading too much into the data, saying further volatility was likely given recent increases in both oil prices and interest rates.
