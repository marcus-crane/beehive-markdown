A $56.9 million package of new and expanded initiatives in Budget 2004 will cement in the government’s commitment to provide all 15 to 19 year olds with a kick start to their working lives.

The package includes the introduction of a new youth transitions service, personalised career planning for secondary school students and an expansion of the Gateway and Modern Apprenticeships programmes.

Steve Maharey made the announcement during a visit to the Porirua Visitor Information Centre, which has provided seventh-form Porirua College student Donna Ryan-Huntly with work experience this year as part of the Gateway programme.

“It is estimated that, at any point in time, between 10 to 17 per cent of those aged between 15 and 19 – or approximately 27,000 to 45,000 young people – do not enrol in tertiary study or get a job after leaving school.

“Although not all of this group are at risk, there are some that are at real risk of long term unemployment and other problems later in their lives. For other young people, simply making sense of the multitude of choices before them can be a real challenge.

“The Labour and Progressive partners in the coalition government made firm manifesto commitments to ensure that all young people get a good start in life. In October 2002 we also signed a formal memorandum with the Mayors’ Taskforce for Jobs adopting the formal goal that by 2007, all 15-19 year olds will be engaged in appropriate education, training, work or other options which will lead to long term economic independence and well-being.

“Over the next four years the government will invest an additional $56.9 million to provide this group of young people with a wider range of career-focused choices.”

The package comprises:

- The establishment of a new transitions service for young people leaving school. The service will be contracted to exisiting community-based organisations and will provide customised support and career planning, working with local employers, training and education providers. The service will be piloted in 14 communities by 2007 (starting with 5 communities next year).
- A two-year Designing Careers pilot programme in 75 schools which will see all Year 10 students preparing an individual learning and career plan with assistance from their parents, careers advisor and form teacher. Year 11, 12 and 13 students at pilot schools at risk of not making a successful transition from school will also participate in the programme.
- Expansion of the Gateway programme to all decile 6 schools by 2008. Gateway enables senior secondary students to begin structured workplace learning while still at school. Gateway is currently available 126 schools (4,000 students) and when fully expanded will by available to 269 schools (13,000 students).
- Providing an additional 500 Modern Apprenticeships taking the number of places available to 8,000 by June 2006.
- Providing increased support for STAR (Secondary Tertiary Alignment Resource) programmes at high schools. Schools can use STAR funding to run programmes for senior secondary school students that include work-based or tertiary type study and training. Five positions will be established at colleges of education, with national supported provided by the Ministry of Education, to better coordinate and support STAR programmes in schools.
- A three-year pilot programme to evaluate whether extending the Training Incentive Allowance (TIA) to teenage parents would encourage them in remain in, or return to education. The pilot programme will provide access to the TIA for 200 teenage parents.

“The package of new and expanded youth career initiatives builds on the $56 million package provided in Budget 2003,” Steve Maharey said.
