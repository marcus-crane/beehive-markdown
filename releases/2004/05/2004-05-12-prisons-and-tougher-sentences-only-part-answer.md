A determined government effort to reduce the rate of prisoner re-offending, kick-started by extra funding from Budget 2004, was launched today by Corrections Minister Paul Swain.

Mr Swain announced an extra $1.25m from July for reintegrating offenders into the community, about a third of which will go to the Prisoners Aid and Rehabilitation Society to support ongoing work with ex-inmates.

Tomorrow, Mr Swain is to address a meeting he has called of organisations and individuals involved in reintegrating prisoners into the community.

“I want their ideas because there’s now funding to pilot some initiatives. If these are successful, I will seek extra funding. My own view is we can start by better coordinating the services provided to released inmates, so they get real support, particularly in the crucial few months after they leave prison.”

Nearly one in four offenders are back in prison within a year of being released. More than a third are back within two years.

“This is not good enough. It costs more than $57,000 a year to keep an inmate in prison. If we can improve on this it will mean fewer victims, more people in work and huge savings for the taxpayer,’’ said Mr Swain. “We are building four new prisons, partly because we’ve toughened sentences but these are only part of the answer.”

Improved security for the community had to include opportunities to deter further offending. Mr Swain said the government has worked hard to introduce intervention programmes to identify and deal with likely offenders and youth re-offending.

“Prison officers tell me one of the saddest things is seeing a ten year old child visit his father – and then seeing him again at 17 as an inmate. We must do all in our power to stop the cycle of offence and re-offence.”

Mr Swain said the Department of Corrections already has some world-leading programmes in violence prevention, alcohol and drug treatment and reducing recidivism by sex offenders. This financial year, $43.6m was provided for rehabilitative programmes.

“My challenge is for us to become a world leader in reintegrating all prisoners back into the community. I’m open to ideas but we are determined to keep more people out of prison once they’ve left,” said Paul Swain.
