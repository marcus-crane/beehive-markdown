Associate Social Development Minister Ruth Dyson has welcomed the appointment of Paula Tyler as the new chief executive of the Department of Child, Youth and Family Services.

Canadian Paula Tyler takes up her new position on 2 August 2004. She currently holds a chief executive position within Alberta’s Children Services Department, where she has been since 1999.

“Ms Tyler joins us with invaluable management and social development experience that will serve the department well. It is interesting to note that before taking on government work in Canada, Ms Tyler hailed from a solid background as a special education teacher and played a leading community role in advocating for services for people with disabilities. She has had senior roles within the Alberta Public Service where she has worked since 1989.

“I welcome Ms Tyler to this position at a time when the government is making significant additional investment to support the department through structural changes to enable Child, Youth and Family to carry out its functions more effectively and to assist in making sustainable improvements in its services,” Ruth Dyson said.

“I also want to thank Dr Russ Ballard who will continue to act as chief executive until Paula Tyler takes up her new role. His management skills and commitment have provided invaluable momentum for the department’s change process.”
