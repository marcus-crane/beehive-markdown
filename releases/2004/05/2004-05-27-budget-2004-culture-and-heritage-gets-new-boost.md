Budget 2004  
Culture and heritage gets new boost

Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark said today that this year's budget increases government funding for the culture and heritage sector by over $30 million next year.

Major new investments for next year include:

- $10 million per annum for the Film Commission and for the administration of the Large Budget Screen Production Grant. This funding was announced last year.
- $6 million to purchase and landscape land for a National Memorial Park.
- $3 million per annum to NZ on Air to fund television programmes.
- $1.5 million to Creative New Zealand, to enhance the leadership role of major performing arts organisations.
- $1.868 million to Te Papa as a contribution to the refurbishment of its Tory St storage space.

Helen Clark said it was important to continue to invest in New Zealand's creative sector.

"The Cultural Recovery package, which we launched in May 2000, had a major impact. There is significantly more activity across the creative sector and a new awareness of the role of arts and culture in expressing what is unique about New Zealand.

"There have been and will continue to be considerable economic spin-offs from the investments we have and are continuing to make in the creative sector. It is providing sustainable and rewarding employment, and is contributing to economic growth and prosperity.

"This year's funding will ensure that the creative sector continues to make a very significant contribution to New Zealand in cultural, economic and social terms," Helen Clark said.
