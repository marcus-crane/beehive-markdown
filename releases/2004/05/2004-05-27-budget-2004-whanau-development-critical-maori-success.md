The success of Maori is not only good for Maori but for the country as a whole, says Minister of Maori Affairs Parekura Horomia.

"All groups in New Zealand, including Maori, have to succeed in order for New Zealanders to prosper and progress," Parekura Horomia said.

"This budget provides opportunities for Maori success, and in particular for 'Maori to succeed as Maori'. Critical to this is that Maori achievement should harness identity and culture to develop opportunities.

"The strength of the family, the whanau, is an extremely important contributor to the outcomes of the individuals, who collectively make up prosperous societies. This is well known not only in Maori society but also in societies throughout the world.

"That is why Budget 2004 delivers $14 million a year to Whanau Development. This money will support locally based whanau initiatives, with a focus on strengthening and supporting whanau based action and research programmes, sporting and cultural activities, and enterprise development.

"Whether it be *whanau* in the family sense where there is a whakapapa connection, or *whanau kaupapa*, which provides a sense of common purpose; the power, motivation and appropriateness for development at a whanau level is immense.

"Strengthening the whanau through front-end investment now will have many positive consequences - it will provide support, inspiration and guidance to individuals that make up the whanau," Parekura Horomia said.

"I am delighted that this budget has been able to give real effect to whanau wellbeing and development."
