Pre-eminent criminologist and legal scholar Dr Warren Young has been appointed to the Law Commission.

The six-member Law Commission is an independent government-funded advisory body that reviews areas of the law that need updating, reforming or developing.

Dr Young has spent 30 years working in, and studying, aspects of the criminal justice system and has conducted significant policy and research projects including studies on rape law, jury decision-making, and investigations into the victims of crime.

The minister responsible for the Law Commission, David Benson-Pope, today announced Dr Young's appointment, while at the same time confirming the re-appointment of Dr Ngatata Love, a member of the Law Commission since 2001.

"The Law Commission provides high-quality independent advice and helps create and lead informed debate on many public policy issues," says Mr Benson-Pope.

"Dr Young brings a unique mix of skills. I think it is a particularly exciting appointment because of his familiarity with the varied aspects of the justice system – criminals, victims and the courts. Add to this his understanding of the public policy and legislative environment and I am sure he will be able to make a valuable contribution to the continued improvement of our laws."

Most recently Dr Young has been General Manager (Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Group) at the Ministry of Justice. He joined the Ministry in 2000 as Deputy Secretary for Justice, after approximately 20 years at Victoria University. At Victoria he was, firstly, Director of the Institute of Criminology (1980-93) and later Professor of Law in areas of criminal law and criminal justice (1993-2000).

Dr Young will take up the appointment today (3 May, 2004). He replaces Judge Vivienne Ullrich, who left the Law Commission on being appointed to the District Court bench last year.
