Final decisions for Invercargill review

Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today his final decisions on the review of schools in the Invercargill area, a move that will unlock nearly $18.4 million in extra resources for the education of local students.

"I wish to thank the mediator, Deborah Clapshaw, who has helped to clarify options for the schooling network. My decisions are drawn from the alternative suggestions put forward by Ms Clapshaw," Trevor Mallard said.

"I would also like to thank all those involved in this project for their advice and feedback during what has been a challenging and stressful time.

"First and foremost this reorganisation has Invercargill students at its heart. It is aimed at ensuring students have access to quality and sustainable education now and into the future. Students will also be able to enjoy the benefits of the extra operational resources released to individual schools.

"Using current estimates, approximately $9 million will be available to schools over and above their normal entitlements for education development resources. There will be a fund of $2.6 million for schools to use jointly, and $6.8 million of extra property funding will be available."

**The review decisions are:**

*For primary provision:*

- retain Invercargill Middle, Myross Bush, Makarewa, Waihopai, Salford, Tisbury, Otatara, Invercargill North and Waverley Park schools;
- retain Ascot School as a Year 1 - 8 school until 2009, when the Year 7 - 8 component is to be reviewed. The board may wish to carry out such a review earlier than 2009 if it so chooses;
- merge Clarendon, Clifton, Kew and Invercargill South schools, as a Year 1 - 6 school, on the Kew site with Clifton as the continuing school;
- merge St George and Elston Lea schools, as a Year 1 - 6 school, on the St George site with Elston Lea as the continuing school. The Elston Lea site is to operate as a second site of the continuing school until the roll of the continuing school drops ten percent below its 1 July 2003 roll;
- merge Newfield and Rockdale Park schools, as a Year 1 - 6 school, on the Newfield site with Newfield as the continuing school. Maori immersion provision will be retained for at least 5 years;
- merge Waikiwi, Grasmere and West Plains schools as a Year 1 - 6 school, on the Collingwood site, with Grasmere as the continuing school; and
- merge Bluff and Konini schools on the Bluff site, as a Year 1 - 8 school, with Konini as the continuing school.

*For intermediate and secondary provision*

- Southland Boys’ High School becomes a Year 7 - 13 secondary school with the establishment of an intermediate department for years 7 and 8 as per s149 of the Education Act 1989;
- Southland Girls’ High School becomes a Year 7 - 13 secondary school with the establishment of an intermediate department for years 7 and 8 as per s149 of the Education Act 1989. It will use its current site and the Tweedsmuir Junior High School site;
- merge James Hargest High School with Rosedale and Collingwood Intermediate schools to become a Year 7 - 13 school on the James Hargest and Rosedale sites, with James Hargest as the continuing school; and
- close Tweedsmuir Junior High School and Mt Anglem College and establish a new Year 7 - 13 school on the Mt Anglem site. Trevor Mallard said he would like the newly established school’s board to comprise two board members from each of the boards of Tweedsmuir Junior High and Mt Anglem, and three independent board members.

The boards of both Tweedsmuir Junior High School and Mt Anglem College now have 28 days to present further arguments to the minister in favour of their schools remaining open.

*Maori Education*

- retain Te Wharekura O Arowhenua and relocate it to the Surrey Park site.

These decisions are to be implemented for the start of the 2005 school year.

*Special education provision:*

- as a result of submissions from Ruru Special School, a facilitator will be appointed to work with the Invercargill education community to develop a model for special education service provision which the Minister will consider.

In terms of the school mergers, the board of each continuing school will manage the transition period and govern the new school until elections can be held.

In the case of closing schools, the boards of these schools have up to 28 days to present further arguments in favour of the school remaining open.

The Ministry of Education will work closely with schools to make sure their requirements for a smooth changeover are met and that the review is implemented in time for the 2005 school year. A project manager will be in touch with schools as soon as possible to discuss the implementation of the reorganisation. A resource for schools outlining the process and the next steps is available on the network review section of www.minedu.govt.nz

The ministry's submission to Trevor Mallard is also available on the network review section of the ministry's website www.minedu.govt.nz

The list of estimated approximate funding for the schools follows. Funding is worked out on the basis of rolls, and follows students to their chosen school.

Southland Boys' and Southland Girls' will receive extra funding from the amount shown for the Hargest merger and formation of the new secondary school in the South. The amount will depend on the numbers of students going to the schools.
