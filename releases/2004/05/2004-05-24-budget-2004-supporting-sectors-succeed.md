Major projects enabling groups of New Zealand based businesses to take advantage of significant market opportunities will be supported in Budget 2004 with $26 million funding over four years, Minister of Economic Development, Jim Anderton said today.

"Sector based development initiatives will not only assist businesses to take up market opportunities, they will also improve access to investment, world-class technology, knowledge and skills that can fuel economic growth. In the medium term, these activities will help us increase the incomes of all New Zealanders," Progressive leader, Jim Anderton said.

"New Zealand Trade and Enterprise will continue to work with key sectors to expand opportunities for growth and maximise value. The sector focused development initiatives will help support projects that establish networks and relationships with leading global businesses," Jim Anderton said.

Part of the four year $500 million Growth and Innovation Budget Package, this sector focussed development programme includes $26 million over four years. That will be provided as $6 million in funding for each of 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07, rising to $8 million in 2007-08, to support companies taking up significant international market opportunities.

"Budget 2004 takes a comprehensive approach to economic development, focussed on strengthening and deepening New Zealand's connections with the world economy. A broad based approach that focuses on moving key sectors up the value chain has the potential to be a significant part of such a strategy," Jim Anderton said.
