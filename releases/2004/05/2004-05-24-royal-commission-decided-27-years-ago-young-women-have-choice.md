The [Care of Children Bill](http://www.knowledge-basket.co.nz/gpprint/docs/bills/20030541.txt) does not alter the long-established law in New Zealand that young women can make decisions for themselves about their pregnacy.

National's Bill English today accused Labour of having a permissive attitude to child sex but [the legislation he was referring to](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=3127256656&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7BFC950949%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC) was established 27 years ago as the result of a Royal Commission of inquiry.

The 1977 Royal Commission into Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion reached the view that a woman under the age of 16 years should decide for herself whether to continue or terminate a pregnancy.

It found to do otherwise would mean that a woman could be forced to have an abortion or continue a pregnancy against her wishes.

The Commission stated that where an abortion was otherwise legally permissible, it would be harsh and illogical to deny it to a woman because of her age.

The Commission noted that their concerns would only arise infrequently, but the protection was nonetheless necessary. The Commission also based its view on the state of common law at the time.

"In 2004 the approach taken in clause 37 of the Care of Children Bill is supported by the approach in other areas of the law," says Associate Justice Minister David Benson-Pope.

The [New Zealand Code of Health and Disability Services Consumers' Rights](http://www.hdc.org.nz/act_code/thecode.html) now require a child's capacity to consent to a medical procedure to be assessed, rather than assuming that capacity only exists after a certain age.

"Many submissions made on clause 37 have wrongly assumed that children under 16 years of age do not have rights to give effective consent to medical treatment," says Mr Benson-Pope.

Neither the existing or proposed law allows a child lacking competency to give consent to a termination of pregnancy.
