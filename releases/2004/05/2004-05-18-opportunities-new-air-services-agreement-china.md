Significant new opportunities are being created for the airlines of New Zealand and China, Transport Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

New air services arrangements negotiated with China mean New Zealand and Chinese airlines may now operate to and from any points in each country. Previously only two airports in each country were available.

There is also more flexibility provided for the airlines of each country to operate via third countries and beyond each other’s territory.

“Open skies” arrangements have been agreed for the operation of all-cargo services. Cargo aircraft may now operate without any restrictions on routes or the number of flights offered.

Restrictions on the types of aircraft that can be used for passenger services have been removed, effectively doubling the number of seats that can be offered. Restrictions on the number of airlines that may operate services have also been removed.

New code-share opportunities will allow Air New Zealand, for example, to access China in association with its partner airlines from third countries.

Provision has been made for the airlines to use leased aircraft in their operations.

"These new air services arrangements further strengthen the growing trade and economic relationship New Zealand enjoys with China," Mr Hodgson said.
