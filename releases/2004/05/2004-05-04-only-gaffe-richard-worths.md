Poor Richard Worth.  
The National MP notes the Judicial Matters Bill, reported back from select committee yesterday, contains no reference to judicial appointments.  
He appears, however, to have completely missed a discussion document released only three days earlier, which invites public opinions on the possibility of a Judicial Appointments Commission.  
"I have forwarded a copy to him, and look forward to his learned comment on it," said Attorney General Margaret Wilson.
