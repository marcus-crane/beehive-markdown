Hi-tech radio equipment will be introduced to help fisheries officers go after increasingly sophisticated poachers says Fisheries Minister David Benson-Pope.

Mr Benson-Pope says the up-coming Budget has set aside $4.3million over the next four years for a nationwide radio communications network for fisheries compliance officers.

He says that not only will the equipment ratchet-up pressure on poachers it also provides a very important additional safety measure for frontline staff in the field.

"Vehicle, vessel and personal radio equipment will keep officers in contact with their colleagues at all times, and enable them to call for assistance when needed," he says. "This is especially important in the more remote areas of New Zealand's extensive coastline.

"This communications system will be another weapon in our armoury as we go after poachers who have become an increasingly determined group of criminals."

Mr Benson-Pope said the success of recent high-profile anti-poaching operations “Pacman”, “Black Ice” and “Bond” proved that the collection of quality intelligence about the activities of poachers was the way to secure convictions and stop them in their tracks.

"Top communications equipment has an important role to play," he says.
