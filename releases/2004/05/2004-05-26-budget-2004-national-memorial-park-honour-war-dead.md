Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark today announced plans to establish a National Memorial Park to honour those who have served New Zealand in war.

The proposed park is one of three memorial projects for which the government has allocated $12.6 million over the next three years.

The funding will build the New Zealand Memorial at Hyde Park in London, help to upgrade facilities at Gallipoli for next year's 90th anniversary of the landings, and create a National Memorial Park in Wellington.

Helen Clark said the proposed National Memorial Park will be sited at the National War Memorial in Buckle St, Wellington.

"The Ministry of Culture and Heritage are now looking at acquiring land opposite the existing National War Memorial currently held by Transit New Zealand. A park would further enhance the area which is already being redeveloped with the building of the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior. It will provide a more appropriate setting for New Zealand's memorial to those New Zealanders who gave their lives in times of war."

Helen Clark said the new funding for the memorials recognises the recent resurgence of interest in remembering and commemorating those who served New Zealand.

"There is now more recognition of the fact that significant aspects of our heritage and identity were forged in difficult times of conflict.

"This is illustrated by the growing numbers of people who attend ANZAC Day services in New Zealand, and particularly those go to the great lengths involved in travelling to Gallipoli for Anzac Day.

"On a local level this growing interest has sparked the restoration of war memorials in cities and towns around New Zealand and on an international level, it facilitated the proposal to build a New Zealand Memorial in Canberra and a dedicated commemorative site at Gallipoli," Helen Clark said.
