Attracting more people into seasonal work is at the centre of a new budget initiative that changes benefit stand-down rules says Associate Social Development and Employment Minister Rick Barker.

From 1 May 2005 unemployment benefit applicants will be able to choose an income assessment of 26 or 52 weeks for the initial stand-down period rather than currently only having their income assessed over 26 weeks, Rick Barker announced today.

"What this means is, say someone's been working picking apples for a season and had a good income, but then little work at other times of the year, it would be inaccurate to only assess that short period when they were earning for the stand- down period. The change will mean income can be considered over the whole year period and is likely to result in shorter stand-down periods for these valued workers," he said.

The Government is committing $5.5 million to this Work and Income initiative for this stand-down change over the next four years. It is part of the implementation of a Seasonal Work Strategy.

The Minister says a 26 week stand-down assessment is not always appropriate or fair for seasonal workers who make hay while the sun shines, but may then face a long period without any income.

"For seasonal workers, the current assessment basis of 26 weeks pushes some over the high income threshold which means they may face a 10 week stand down before getting any government assistance. But they may've had no money coming in prior to that. I believe they deserve the fairer option of having their income viewed over the whole year.

"We urgently need more seasonal workers, but the current benefit situation may put people off, because they have to go like the clappers in the season and then face a stressful period of no income. This Work and Income change is good for seasonal workers and our industry.

"I want people to see seasonal work as a viable way of making a living, not a boom and bust nightmare. These changes to benefit stand-down rules mean that many people will have a shorter stand-down period before being eligible for government assistance.

"To fuel and maintain growth it is vital that we retain and encourage people into seasonal work because it is a valuable incubator of growth in New Zealand.

"I am confident that this change will address a real issue faced by many  
seasonal workers, at the same time it will help employers who are having difficulty recruiting seasonal labour because more people will be attracted to the work," he said.

The Minister is also working with key employer and industry groups to encourage them to address issues beyond the Ministry’s control including pay, conditions, accommodation, transport and occupational health and safety issues.
