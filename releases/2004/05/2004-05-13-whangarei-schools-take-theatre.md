Four Whangarei schools will receive a $50,000 funding boost towards a collaborative theatre project that combines fire safety education with the legend of Mahuika, the fire goddess, Associate Education Minister Marian Hobbs announced today.

"The Mahuika Project allows the schools to enhance their arts curriculum by using theatre as a medium to encourage creativity while also providing professional development for staff," Marian Hobbs said.

"The Mahuika Project was piloted last year in seven North Hokianga schools who worked in collaboration with the Arts Promotion Trust, the New Zealand Fire Service and Ministry of Education to develop a large-scale theatre production.

"The project is now being adapted to other schools and locations, giving these four Whangarei schools the opportunity to share in the same benefits and successes.

"The funding comes from the [Collaborative Innovations Fund](//www.minedu.govt.nz/index.cfm?layout=document&documentid=9251&indexid=1108&indexparentid=2107&goto=00%27), which each year provides $1 million to support clusters of schools wanting to work together to develop new styles of teaching and learning to improve educational achievement.

"The Collaborative Innovations Fund has the potential to raise student achievement and supports this government's goal of an all-inclusive education system that helps us, as a nation and as individuals, achieve to our full potential.

"I commend these schools for their commitment to ongoing collaboration to address common issues in education."

The schools involved in the project are: Tikipunga School, Totara Grove School, Manaia View School and Otangarei.
