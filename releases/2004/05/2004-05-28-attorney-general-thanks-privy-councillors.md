Attorney-General Margaret Wilson has attended a reception in London to mark the last sitting of New Zealand judges on the Privy Council.

From July 1, they will sit here in New Zealand, in our new Supreme Court.  
Margaret Wilson thanked the privy councilors for their contribution, and for the role the Privy Council has played.  
This was the second of two events marking the occasion. The first was held earlier this week by Lord Falconer of Thoroton, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs.  
"Each legal system will still benefit from development of jurisprudence in the other's jurisdiction through the fact that our legal systems are similar and look to each other's precedence-setting cases.  
"Coincidently, the United Kingdom is introducing its own new Supreme Court around the same time as New Zealand takes responsibility for its own final court of appeal."
