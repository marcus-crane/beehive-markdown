Minister of Research, Science and Technology Pete Hodgson departs New Zealand on Wednesday to lead a New Zealand biotechnology delegation to Iowa and the international BIO 2004 conference in San Francisco.

"This is a chance for New Zealand biotech companies to highlight their strengths and attract international investment, business and science partners," Mr Hodgson says. "The BIO conference is the world’s biggest annual biotech event and New Zealand's presence this year will be its strongest ever."

The New Zealand delegation to BIO 2004, which runs from 6 – 9 June, includes 60 people representing 33 New Zealand companies and organisations, more than twice the number at last year's event.

The New Zealand exhibition will be co-located with the Australian pavilion, reflecting the close ties between the two countries' biotech sectors and showcasing their combined capability. Three joint Australia-New Zealand events have been planned to promote the Australasian region as the fifth largest biotech hub globally.

"New Zealand’s relatively small size and distance from the rest of the world means it is particularly important for our biotechnology industry to be well-connected to global networks," Mr Hodgson says. "The companies going to BIO 2004 are outstanding examples of our biotechnology strengths and I am confident there will be many opportunities for new research and commercial partnerships."

Mr Hodgson will speak at a Ministerial Seminar at the event, outlining how New Zealand and Australia are working together to grow their combined biotechnology industries.

From 2 – 5 June a 24-strong New Zealand delegation will travel to Iowa at the invitation of the state’s Governor, Tom Vilsack. In March this year Governor Vilsack led a biotechnology and agritechnology mission from Iowa to New Zealand, taking representatives of 30 organisations to regional biotech clusters around New Zealand.
