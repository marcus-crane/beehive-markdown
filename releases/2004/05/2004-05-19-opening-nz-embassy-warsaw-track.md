Planning is on track for New Zealand’s Embassy in Warsaw to open at the end of the year, Prime Minister Helen Clark said today.

Helen Clark met Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski in Rome today. Both leaders are in Italy to participate in the 60th Commemorations of the Battle of Cassino.

“I was able to update President Kwasniewski on progress with the opening of the Embassy in Warsaw. We expect the Embassy to be operational by the end of this year, with a formal opening ceremony planned for early 2005.

“The long-standing and friendly relations between New Zealand and Poland are demonstrated by our joint attendance at the Cassino Commemorations. Both countries suffered heavy casualties in the battle.

“Another significant milestone is this year’s 60th anniversary of the arrival of over 730 Polish orphans in Pahiatua.

“We also work together internationally. Poland became a member of the EU three weeks ago and I was able to get a read-out from the President on developments and register our interests. Poland is the largest of the new members and carries significant political and economic weight,” Helen Clark said.

Poland recently upgraded its post in Wellington to Embassy status. Currently the New Zealand Embassy in Berlin is accredited to Warsaw.
