Associate Rural Affairs Minister Damien O'Connor will this afternoon visit local farmers and growers in the Manawatu, for an update on rehabilitation efforts following the February [floods](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/floods/).

After meeting briefly with the local agricultural recovery facilitators at the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's Massey Campus office, Mr O'Connor will visit a local vegetable grower to gauge replanting progress.

He'll then four-wheel drive from Shannon to the Whirokino Bridge, South of Foxton, along the top of the stopbank between the spillway and farmland.

"I'm interested to see how the rehabilitation and replanting is going, nearly three months after the height of the flooding.

"This is a good opportunity to keep up with progress, and as with my last visit to the area, to take first-hand information back to my colleagues."

In particular, Mr O'Connor wanted to make sure people who were eligible for assistance were getting it.

"Farmers, foresters and growers who haven't yet applied for assistance under the programme should contact MAF. While there's no deadline as such for getting the applications in, MAF is hoping to receive more by the end of June and requests for payment must be made by 1 May 2005."

Further information:

- For assistance application forms, email [Floods@maf.govt.nz](mailto:floods@maf.govt.nz), or write to [Agriculture Recovery Package](http://www.maf.govt.nz/mafnet/rural-nz/emergency-management/2004-floods/index.htm), PO Box 2526, Wellington, or phone 06 351 7921.
- The assistance process is designed to be flexible and responsive to farmers' needs.
- MAF have contracted nine local farmers and one forestry contact as Agricultural Recovery Facilitators to be local contacts and to provide local knowledge.
- Each claim will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
- The assessment and payment process will essentially be run over two distinct stages. The first stage involves assessing applications for eligibility while the second stage focuses on the payment process.
- Once the applications are received, they will be processed and each application will be considered by one of the Agricultural Recovery Facilitators with the help of a local committee made up of farmers and foresters.
- Once the committee has accepted the claim, farmers will be notified that their application has moved to stage two – the payment process. This means that farmers will only need to be assessed once even though they may have a number of receipts over a number of months. Payments will be made as soon as possible after receipts have been processed.
