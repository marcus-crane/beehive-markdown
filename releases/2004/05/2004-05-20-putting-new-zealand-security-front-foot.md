The [Border Security Bill](http://www.knowledge-basket.co.nz/gpprint/docs/bills/20040532.txt), having its second reading tonight, is part of a comprehensive approach to keeping New Zealand secure and puts traders on the front foot in a changing international security climate, says Customs Minister Rick Barker.

The Bill strengthens border control measures against terrorism and trans-national crime including drug smuggling, across both travel and trade sectors. It also provides the legislative framework for Customs' Supply Chain Security Strategy.

“ It is vital that New Zealand traders remain in the ‘green lane’ for Customs clearance at overseas borders. The Strategy will do that.

“ Already, the United States Customs and Border Protection Agency has expressed confidence in our strategy. We are working towards concluding an arrangement with them that would allow New Zealand goods to move expeditiously across borders at all times and times of heightened security.

" Recent figures show that in the United States, since 11 September 2001, there have been 88 port or airport closures due to bomb threats, and 214 bridge closures.  
Sooner or later one of these closures will impact on New Zealand trade. It would be irresponsible to delay the introduction of measures that could avoid that when we can keep ahead of the game,” said the Minister.

During discussion on the bill the government has listened to industry representatives concern at the added cost of new supply chain security measures.

" The government believes there are direct benefits to businesses in the new security measures. However I am aware of their concerns about extra costs, and I am committed to continuing to work with industry on a longer term review of the funding of all Customs goods clearance services," said Rick Barker.

The review will look at the quantum and apportionment of all Customs goods clearance charges and will involve input from all relevant stakeholders. While that review is taking place, Budget 2004 allocates a further $8 million over two years to assist exporters meet costs associated with increasing export security. This will reduce the export sector's contribution to $4 million per year, spread over approximately 500 thousand export consignments a year. Importers and transhippers will also contribute to meet the costs of increased security.  
The government contribution is in addition to spending $22 million for capital purchase and set up costs of $9 million.
