Budget 2004 provides $2.4 million to help raise management capability.

"Good management is critical to the success of business. Budget 2004, therefore, has provided $2.4 million in funding so we can work together with businesses to help them maximise their opportunities to build up management capability," Minister of Economic Development, Jim Anderton said.

"Management capability, or the skills, aptitudes and knowledge of managers to create value, is an important part of New Zealand's skill mix, and the growth and sustained development of firms.

"The programme aims to raise awareness of management capability and strategic management in order to help businesses build a sustained competitive advantage and grow their operations. This will contribute to strengthening our economy in order to raise living standards for all New Zealanders," Progressive leader, Jim Anderton said.

Part of the four year $500 million Growth and Innovation Budget Package, this management development programme includes $1.2 million of funding for each of 2004-05 and 2005-06 to improve understanding of, and support action to improve, New Zealand's management capability.

"Budget 2004 takes a comprehensive approach to economic development, focussed on strengthening and deepening New Zealand's connections with the world economy. Increasing our level of management capability has the potential to be a significant part of such a strategy," Jim Anderton said.
