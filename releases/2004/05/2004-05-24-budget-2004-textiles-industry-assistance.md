Initiatives to build skills and assist in the transformation of the textile, clothing, footwear and carpet industry, will receive $2.3 million in Budget 2004, Minister for Economic Development Jim Anderton announced today.

"The textiles, clothing, footwear and carpet industry in New Zealand has great potential for growth. There has already been substantial growth in exports in the past decade, but there is much more potential to be realised yet.

"This industry faces unique challenges, including the gradual reduction in tariffs beginning on 1 July 2005 after a six year Labour Progressive tariff freeze. Textiles New Zealand will be supported in their work to transform the industry into a globally competitive, high value production sector," the Progressive Leader said.

"Assistance will also be given to improve the industry's ability to cope with upcoming change and to assist businesses to build up the skills and knowledge necessary to increase their opportunities for sustainable employment and business development," Jim Anderton said.

As part of the four year $500 million Growth and Innovation Budget Package, these initiatives include $2.3 million of funding over three years to help transform the textiles industry into a high value export focussed sector.

"Budget 2004 takes a comprehensive approach to economic development, focussed on strengthening and deepening New Zealand's connections with the world economy. A high skill, high value textiles industry has the potential to be a significant part of such a strategy," Jim Anderton said.
