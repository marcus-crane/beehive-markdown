More than 6000 low-income families will have warmer, drier, healthier homes as a result of a near doubling of funding for home energy efficiency retrofits in the 2004 Budget.

Funding for the promotion of solar water heating is also doubling, says Energy Minister Pete Hodgson.

"Improving energy efficiency and increasing our use of renewable energy sources are essential steps towards a sustainable energy future," Mr Hodgson says. "Practical steps include making New Zealand homes more energy efficient and enabling growth in renewable technologies, such as solar water heating."

EnergyWise Home Grants, administered by the [Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority](http://www.eeca.govt.nz/) (EECA), are available to organisations that install insulation and other energy efficiency measures in older homes.

Funding for grants is almost doubling in this year's Budget, with $2.6 million of new funding – including contributions from Votes Health and the Social Development package – raising the total for 2004-05 to $5.3 million. With matching funding from community trusts, energy companies and councils, this will retrofit the homes of more than 6000 low income families a year.

The Budget also includes funding of $700,000 for the Ministry of the Environment to investigate how more households can be encouraged to make home energy efficiency improvements and install cleaner heating sources. This would help communities improve air quality, particularly in winter, and help consumers save on power bills.

Funding to encourage greater use of solar water heating is doubling to $400,000. EECA and the Solar Industries Association will evaluate the financial assistance scheme for solar installations that has operated in 2003-04 before finalising the details of the 2004-05 promotion.

"Hot water heating accounts for up to 45 percent of a home energy bill, so it makes sense to use more solar power," Mr Hodgson says. "This funding is a vote of confidence in the solar water heating industry and will help to maintain its growth."
