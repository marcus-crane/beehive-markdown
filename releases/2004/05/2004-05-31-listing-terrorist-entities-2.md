Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that the government has listed the following individual and organisations as terrorist entities pursuant to the provisions of the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002.

The government has also amended one current designation.

Individual  
Safet DURGUTI

Organisations  
Al-Haramain Foundation (Indonesia)  
Al-Haramayn Foundation (Kenya)  
Al-Haramain Foundation (Pakistan)  
Al-Haramayn Foundation (Tanzania)

Amended Designation  
The organisation listed earlier as Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation (Bosnia and Herzegovina) is now known as Vazir

These designations follow a decision by the United Nations Security Council Committee to list these groups and this individual as terrorist entities. They take effect immediately for a period of three years, unless extended.

The decision to proceed with these designations was taken by the Prime Minister, in consultation with the Attorney General, pursuant to the Terrorism Suppression Act.

The Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation is an Islamic non-governmental organisation dedicated to promoting Islamic teaching throughout the world. Information in the possession of the United States government indicates that the Al-Haramain Foundation in both Indonesia and Pakistan, and the Al-Haramayn Foundation in both Kenya and Tanzania provide financial, material, and logistical support to the al-Qaeda network and other terrorist organisations.

The amendment to a current designation follows a decision by the United Nations Security Council Committee to update its listing to include new information. The change takes effect immediately for the remaining period of the current designation, unless extended.

The decision to proceed with this amendment was taken by the Prime Minister, in consultation with the Attorney General, pursuant to the Terrorism Suppression Act.

The Bosnia and Herzegovina branch of the Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation closed down following its terrorist designation by the United States and Saudi Arabia after being suspected of supporting transnational terrorist organisations. Officials of the Bosnia and Herzegovina branch of the Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation were then prompted to reopen this organisation under a different name, Vazir, in a previously unknown office in Travnik. This new non-governmental organisation was founded in May 2003 and reopened early August 2003 in the same location as the former office of Al-Haramain under the representation of Safet DURGUTI.

The Prime Minister indicated that neither the designated group or individuals are known to have any current links to New Zealand.

“Nevertheless designating these entities as terrorists and terrorist entities will serve to deter New Zealanders from becoming inadvertently involved in their activities. It will also make it an offence to participate in Djamat Houmat Daawa Salafia, recruit members for this group, provide or collect funds for this group or make property or financial services available to it. The financing of international terrorism is a matter of grave concern to the international community as a whole and one that New Zealand, as a member of that community, recognises the need to effectively address. These designations assist in that process” Helen Clark said.
