"Parenting support programmes receive a major boost as part of a $75.5 million Supporting Families package in Budget 2004, Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

"Parenting is society's most important job and the new funding will enable government and non-government organisations to provide a comprehensive network of services to families who may experience a few difficulties or need a hand.

"Working for Families, the centrepiece of this budget, invests directly in families - supporting them in their vital parenting role. The Supporting Families package reinforces that approach by ensuring that families are backed by strong services for the times they need a little extra help," Steve Maharey said.

The package provides (all figures over four years unless otherwise stated):

- $31.9 million to expand Family Start from 16 to 24 communities over the next three years, reaching 2,205 additional high needs families by 2007.
- $16.4 million to employ an additional 38 Social Workers in Schools, increasing the number of low decile schools with access to the programme from 220 to approximately 330 by 2007.
- $20.7 million to expand the successful Waitakere Family Violence Intervention Pilot Programme to all 12 Work and Income regions, and to work with Pacific community leaders on family violence prevention strategies for their communities, as part of the implementation of Te Rito - New Zealand Family Violence Prevention Strategy.
- $3.3 million for home and community based mentoring programmes by older New Zealanders to support young families;
- $3.2 million to continue support for the seven communities piloting the Stronger Communities Action Fund in 2005 and 2006.
