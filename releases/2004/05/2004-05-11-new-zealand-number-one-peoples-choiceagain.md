New Zealand is on top in the UK tourism market today, after winning the Guardian & Observer’s People’s Choice award for best long-haul travel destination.

New Zealand has won the award three out of the past four years.

Tourism Minister Mark Burton says no other country has won this award as many times and the fact that the public decides makes it all the more valuable to the tourism sector.

“The Award shows that people in the United Kingdom are talking about us. If New Zealand is top of mind for the general public, they will be more likely to translate those thoughts into visits.”

Mark Burton also says the award couldn’t come at a better time, with Tourism New Zealand about to launch a major marketing blitz into London around the Chelsea Flower Show.

“May 24 will see the opening of New Zealand’s first-ever entry in the Chelsea Flower. When the garden is unveiled, Tourism New Zealand will be complimenting it with a major marketing campaign, profiling New Zealand in the underground, on double-decker buses and through the English media.”

Mr Burton said the award is the culmination for an outstanding year for New Zealand in the UK market.

“New Zealand currently has a high international profile due to media coverage brought about by our International Media Programme, publicity for New Zealand around The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Whale Rider and our 100% Pure New Zealand campaign. This, combined with competitive airfares and new products in the market, has meant that New Zealand continues to see steady growth in visitor numbers, and even more so in expenditure.”

The Guardian is one of the major national broadsheets in the UK for affluent professionals. Both The Guardian and The Observer (the Sunday version of The Guardian) have readerships of over 1 million each.

The awards, held in Rhodes, were launched 16 years ago to poll readers on their views of the travel industry.
