Minister of Defence Mark Burton has today slammed what he describes as the National party’s “complete abandonment of responsibility” for the Service men and women of New Zealand.

“In a recent address to National party faithful, Defence spokesperson Simon Power has made clear the depths of that party’s utter disregard for the responsibilities of government. For that, I suppose the people of New Zealand should be grateful. At least this appalling policy is at last out in the open.

“Mr Power proudly states that National ‘will support our close allies, Australia, the United States and Britain when and wheresoever our commitment is called upon.’

“Let me be very clear. The Labour-led government believes that New Zealand is a sovereign nation, and that New Zealanders expect nothing less than a considered, but independent New Zealand stance on when and where we engage in international military deployments.

“We have close and long-standing defence partnerships with these nations—strong, lasting, and true friendships we have built through genuine respect for each other’s sovereign interests and independence.

“The people of New Zealand now have a stark and clear choice. A Labour-led government will always retain what must be the ultimate responsibility of any truly credible government—decisions on when and where to deploy our Service men and women into harm’s way.

“We now know National will happily abandon that to the whim of others.”
