Adult and Community Education will receive new funding of $16.5 million over the next four years, Associate Education Minister Marian Hobbs announced today.

The spending, to be provided in next week's Budget, will build the capability of ACE providers and introduce quality assurance arrangements to the sector.

"ACE in its original form has been the area of volunteers and people committed to building 'community'," Marian Hobbs said. "With greatly increased financial support from the government we need flexible methods to check that what the community wants is what actually gets delivered. That is the essence of quality assurance.

"The government values what ACE offers adult learners and the new quality assurance arrangements will ensure that the importance of ACE programmes is recognised. These changes will help the sector support all adults to achieve their learning potential."

The Budget funding will provide for:  
·The initial costs of quality assurance for all ACE providers by the Education Review Office.  
·Co-ordination of all ACE quality assurance activities by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority  
·Developing the capability of ACE providers to meet quality assurance requirements. The Tertiary Education Commission will lead this work, although larger ACE providers will have a role in developing the capability of smaller ACE providers; and  
·Training tutors to effectively teach adult learners  
·Previously unfunded providers performing well in ACE priority areas.

"Quality assurance is an important milestone for ACE," Marian Hobbs said, "and builds on our comitment last year to encouraging lifelong learning, strengthening communities and social cohesion by meeting identified community learning needs, raising foundation skills and targeting learners whose initial learning was unsuccessful."

Associate Education Minister (Tertiary Education), Steve Maharey, will announce changes to the funding arrangements for community education programmes taught at public tertiary education institutions shortly.
