Racing Minister Damien O'Connor today expressed concern at allegations of illicit drug use within the harness racing industry.

Harness Racing New Zealand today revealed it was helping police with an investigation into the alleged use of prohibited performance-enhancing substances.

Mr O'Connor said the claims were worrying, but he had full confidence in the racing industry's high standards of probity and integrity.

"I'm confident that HRNZ has strong measures in place to preserve industry standards, and to ensure the industry lives up to its solid reputation.

"While the government has no role to play in the day-to-day operations of racing, we have a responsibility for the Racing Act, which is designed to ensure that horse and greyhound racing is conducted fairly. It's also aimed at protecting the public interest; the public must be able to feel confident that racing is free of corruption and that a fair outcome is guaranteed in every race."

The allegations also raised the issue of animal welfare, Mr O'Connor said. There was no place for the abuse of racing animals in the industry, he said.
