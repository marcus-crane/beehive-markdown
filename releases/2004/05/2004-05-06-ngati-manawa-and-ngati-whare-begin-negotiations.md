The government and two central north island iwi have achieved a significant milestone with the signing of terms of negotiation with Ngati Manawa and Ngati Whare today.

Treaty Negotiations Minister, Margaret Wilson, is in Murupara and Te Whaiti today signing terms of negotiation with both iwi to negotiate in good faith for the durable settlement of all their historical claims.

"This is an important step in resolving the historical grievances of Ngati Manawa and Ngati Whare", says Margaret Wilson.

"It is also the first step towards rebuilding the relationship between the two iwi and the Crown."

Ngati Manawa and Ngati Whare will negotiate jointly towards their own individual settlement packages. They will be represented in negotiations by Te Runanga o Ngati Manawa and Te Runanga o Ngati Whare Iwi Trust.

The signing of terms of negotiation with Ngati Manawa and Ngati Whare is a further indication of the increasing momentum of central North Island negotiations, which involve large tracts of forestry land.

"Negotiations with the central north island iwi are a priority for me personally, as well as for the government.

"Good progress continues to be made in this area. Both Te Arawa and Ngati Tuwharetoa have also recently had their mandates recognised by the Crown to enter negotiations."

The Crown and central North Island iwi are aiming to reach settlements within two years and will settle more than 150 claims made to the Waitangi Tribunal.
