A $20.6 million Budget 2004 package supports broadcasters to get New Zealand stories and people on air, says Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey.

The new funding builds on substantial increases committed in previous budgets and signals the government's commitment to support the development of New Zealand's cultural identity through radio and television.

"NZ on Air receives an additional $12 million (all figures over four years unless otherwise stated) to maintain local television programming hours as costs of production rise and to increase the quality and diversity of the projects it supports.

"An additional $4.7 million is going to Radio New Zealand to enable it to:

- enhance its news, current affairs and features programming;
- develop the RNZ website to provide audio on demand;
- carry out more in depth audience research; and
- promote National Radio on FM.

"Radio New Zealand International also receives $3.9 million over three years starting in 2005-06 (including $2.6 million capital funding in that year) to buy and operate a new transmitter (announced on 18 May 2004).

"Television New Zealand receives increased funding next year to implement its charter, as part of decisions announced in Budget 2003. Direct funding for charter programming rises from $15 million this financial year to $16 million in 2004-05 and $17 million annually from 2005-06 onwards," Steve Maharey said.
