The Ministry for the Environment's willingness to accept a late application to its Contaminated Sites Remediation Fund, following notice of potential contamination to a number of Auckland properties, was welcomed today by Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard.

"While the potential contamination doesn't present an immediate risk to residents, it is important that local authorities get a handle on the problem as soon as possible," Judith Tizard said.

"I'm concerned about this issue and I don't think individual property owners should be left in a state of limbo. Property owners and potential property buyers need to know there is a process in place to assess the nature of the problem and decide what needs to happen from here on.

"Any funding provided by MFE would assist Auckland's Regional and City Councils to do this.

"I am pleased that the Ministry may make funding available, and will be encouraging the Regional Council to take up the opportunity to make an application."

"I'll also be talking to other Auckland councils and working with my Auckland Parliamentary colleagues David Cunliffe and Mark Gosche whose electorates may have been affected by this."

Judith Tizard said the MFE Fund accepts applications from regional councils, however, the Auckland Regional Council can make an application on behalf of the Auckland City Council and the two can work together to assist with the investigation.
