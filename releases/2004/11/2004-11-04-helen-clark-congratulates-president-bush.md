Prime Minister Helen Clark today congratulated United States President George Bush on his election victory.

Helen Clark said it was a clear-cut result, with President Bush gaining a 51 per cent share of the popular vote.

“I congratulate President Bush on winning a second term, and I look forward to the New Zealand Government continuing its good relationship with President Bush and his administration,” Helen Clark said.

“Our two countries work together on a range of issues and I expect it will now be business as usual.

“I have established a good personal relationship with President Bush, and key ministers have also got to know their counterparts well. I expect those solid ties to be further developed during President Bush’s second term.

“I look forward to conveying my congratulations to President Bush personally at the APEC leaders’ summit in Santiago later this month.”

Helen Clark said she would be sending a letter of congratulations to President Bush today.
