The partnership approach between staff and employers in the public sector is delivering benefits, State Services Minister Trevor Mallard said today on the first anniversary of the revamped and renewed Partnership for Quality (PfQ).

"The Partnership for Quality is an agreement between the government and the PSA. This ‘partnership’ approach is the government’s preferred model for working between PSA and state sector agencies, as our government works towards building stronger public services for New Zealanders," Trevor Mallard said.

“The government has seen real benefits from this relationship in a number of agencies.

“Many departments have told us of success stories where their staff have worked jointly and productively with the PSA on matters of mutual interest. Examples include the shared development of human resources initiatives such as skill development or redesigning performance management systems.

“Of course we still have a way to go and PfQ take-up in departments is still variable. More information needs to be shared on the principles and benefits of PfQ.

“To help this process, officials are working with the PSA on developing PfQ resources for human resources teams and managers. These will help spread some shared lessons, drawing on some real life success stories.

“The government also recently agreed to the establishment of the new Partnership Resource Centre to assist all employers and unions (in both the public and private sectors) to develop positive relationships in the workplace. Constructive workplace relationships have an important role in supporting New Zealand’s growth and innovation.

"The state sector will benefit from this resource, which is being set up to share successes, expertise, research, and best practice on partnership.

“With the government’s support, and with the efforts of the PSA and employers, I am confident that the quality of employment relationships will continue to improve,” Trevor Mallard said.
