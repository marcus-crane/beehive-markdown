Wellington College of Education is to merge with Victoria University of Wellington, Education Minister Trevor Mallard and Associate Education(Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey announced today.

“The merger will combine the strengths of both institutions so that early childhood, primary and secondary teachers are trained to the highest standards,” Trevor Mallard said.

"This merger ensures that as well as learning how to teach, trainee students will study curriculum subjects to degree level in a university before having to teach them in a classroom.

“We know that the quality of teaching is the single greatest influence on students' achievement within the classroom. That is why this merger is so important and why it has my full support."

Steve Maharey said the merger was also expected to improve the quality and quantity of education research, leading to better teaching and learning practices.

“The recent Performance Based Research exercise showed the need for more high quality research into education in New Zealand,” Steve Maharey said.

“The merger will free up considerable resources. The University will invest these resources in a comprehensive programme that will allow more College staff to become active in research that will better inform their teaching.

"Once the merger has been through the cabinet process, an Order in Council will be signed to make the merger effective from 1 January 2005. This will cement in place the collaborative relationship developed between the College and the University in 2001.”

No redundancies are contemplated by the institutions at the point of merger.
