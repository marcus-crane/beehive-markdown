Two new reports on industry training provide further evidence that the government's strategy of partnering with training institutes, the business community and workers is delivering results, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Independent research produced by the New Zealand Institute for Economic Research has shown that workplace learning can create gains in productivity as high as 20%. In addition, the Industry Training Federation (ITF) has released a report showing that the number of workers who can benefit from industry training could potentially double by 2007.

"These reports are good news for New Zealand," Steve Maharey said. "They clearly demonstrate the value of the government's investment in industry training and show that good progress is being made to increase the skills of New Zealand workers.

"When people are provided with the opportunities to improve their skills, they benefit personally from increased knowledge and also make businesses more productive, which makes the New Zealand economy more competitive.

"The number of people completing a National Certificate in the workplace increased significantly in 2003 - up 45% to 14,181 people in just one year.

"The ITF report is measured in assessing the sector's ability to achieve the ambitious goal of 250,000 people in industry training by 2007. We set this as a stretch target in 2002 and it is certainly something to strive for.

"I appreciate the Federation's cautious approach. There is always a danger that bringing too many people into training too quickly could undermine the success story that industry training has become under this government. We will continue to work with the ITF to assess the potential for expanding the number of people who can benefit from workplace learning.

"With programmes like Skill New Zealand, a joint initiative between the government, Business New Zealand and the Council of Trade Unions, we have shown that working in partnership is the best way to ensure a more highly skilled and productive workforce."
