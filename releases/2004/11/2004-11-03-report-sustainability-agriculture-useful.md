The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment's report on the sustainability of agriculture was an important contribution, Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton said today.

The Parliamentary Commissioner today published a report, "Growing for Good: Intensive farming, sustainability and New Zealand¡¦s environment".

Mr Sutton said the issues surrounding sustainability were important, and it was good to see the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment addressing them.

"This report is a good overview of the sustainability issues facing New Zealand farming. The report takes a broad perspective on sustainability and overviews a range of issues which are likely to stimulate considerable debate."

Mr Sutton said the Government had already implemented many policies in the areas in the report, under a focus on sustainable development.

A key one was the agreement facilitated between the dairy industry, local government, and central government - the Clean Streams Accord - that addresses issues of intensive dairy farming.

"A recent survey of all dairy farmers carried out under the Dairy and Clean Streams Accord found that:

\* 62% of farmers have stock excluded from farm waterways;  
\* more than 50% of regular crossing-points have bridges or culverts;  
\* 99% of suppliers who require resource consents for dairy farm effluent have them;  
\* 17% of dairy farmers have an input/output nutrient management system; and  
\* where regionally significant wetlands have been identified, more than 50% have been fenced.

Mr Sutton said that the Sustainable Farming Fund has funded 101 specific projects addressing the issues the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment raises in his report, with a total investment of more than $17 million of taxpayer funding.

He said the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry also had a significant history of leadership in sustainable agriculture, notably:  
\* Development of a sustainable agriculture position and facilitation programme from 1993;  
\* Initiation and development of Overseer (a nutrient balance fertilizer management programme);  
\* Initiation of the "Focus Farm Programme", which spawned amongst other things, the "Kiwi Green Programme" and the pipfruit Integrated Fruit Production (IFP);  
\* The OECD position on Sustainable Agriculture;  
\* The Dairy and Clean Streams Accord; and  
\* Joint leadership for the Water Programme of Action, which has a close study of irrigation.

Mr Sutton said the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment's report would be studied closely to see where further improvements could be made.
