*Two Cars, One Night*, written and directed by New Zealander Taika Waititi, has won the Grand Jury Prize for best international short film at the AFI Los Angeles Film Festival.

The award tops off a year of international successes for New Zealand films, says Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Judith Tizard.

"2004 has been such a rewarding year for New Zealand films. We've seen big international successes from *Whale Rider* and *In My Father's Den* as well as *Lord of the Rings*, which brought unprecedented attention to New Zealand and its film industry.

"Taika is to be congratulated for *Two Cars One Night*. It is clearly capturing the imagination and hearts of both domestic and international audiences."

Judith Tizard said the [New Zealand Film Commission](http://www.nzfilm.co.nz/) was working alongside a range of New Zealand film makers to assist them to take their films to international audiences.

Key highlights for NZ films for 2004 include:

- *Whale Rider*, the most successful NZ film released this year, achieved a gross box office of $6.4 million making it the second most successful local film ever released in NZ cinemas after *Once Were Warriors*.
- On the international scene *Whale Rider’s* worldwide box office was $US 65 million and was sold to more than 50 countries. It set a record in the US with the biggest cinema audience for a Kiwi story.
- Keisha Castle-Hughes was nominated for an Academy Award and was a finalist in the US Screen Actors Guild awards. The film won best foreign film at the US Independent Spirit Awards and best film at the British Academy Children’s Film Awards.
- *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* which received 11 Academy Awards brought unprecedented attention to New Zealand and its film industry.
- *In My Father’s Den* completed production during the year and since its premiere in June has received wide critical acclaim, numerous international awards and commenced a very successful NZ cinema release.
- Other features which screened in NZ cinemas during the financial year with support from the Film Commission were *Perfect Strangers, The Locals, Kombi Nation, Nemesis Game, For Good, Fracture, Christmas, Tongan Ninja* and *Woodenhead*.

Judith Tizard said the government was committed to supporting the international potential of New Zealand film makers.

"The government increased its baseline funding to the Film Commission by $10 million a year from 2004 to enable the Commission to enhance its contribution towards the development, production, sales and marketing of New Zealand films."
