The new Department of Building and Housing will focus on improving the delivery of building and housing services to the public, Housing Minister Steve Maharey and Building Issues Minister Margaret Wilson said today.

“The new department recognises the importance of building, construction and housing in New Zealanders’ daily lives,” the Ministers said.

“Housing and building are interlinked," Margaret Wilson said. "The quality of housing in New Zealand is determined by the quality of building.

"The opening of the new department coincides well with the implementation of the new Building Act. This bill is designed to help meet New Zealanders’ expectations around the delivery of building services.”

In establishing the new department the government aims to have a sector that:  
·delivers quality housing and buildings at a reasonable cost  
·is supported by effective regulation that clearly sets out and enforces appropriate standards, rights and obligations  
·is driven by government receiving good policy advice on trends in the housing and building sector, on rental property markets and building systems and standards  
·has quality dispute resolution services for home owners and builders, landlords and tenants  
·ensures that landlords and tenants receive appropriate information, education and advice, and  
·recognises the importance of building and housing in our daily lives.

"The department will complement the role of Housing New Zealand Corporation, which focuses on housing provision and policy advice," Steve Maharey said.
