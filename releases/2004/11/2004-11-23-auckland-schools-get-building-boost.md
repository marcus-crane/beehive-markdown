Twenty five schools across the Auckland region are to get a total of over $19 million in funding for property projects.

Minister for Auckland Issues and Auckland Central MP Judith Tizard says the money is targeted to fund projects that meet roll growth or to upgrade and expand school facilities.

The funding can be used for a variety of projects such as administration blocks, or to build a new gymnasium or school hall.

The funding is part of an extra $60m being committed to 130 schools nationwide by the Labour-led government to ensure schools are modern and attractive places in which students feel encouraged to learn.

The government is investing nearly $420 million in 2004/05 for new spending on new schools, new classrooms, and other school buildings, bringing total property funding to above $1 billion.

"The government wants to ensure that schools are attractive, modern and well maintained assets for local communities. This funding will give Auckland schools a chance to upgrade their facilities in areas where they are not as good as they could be," Judith Tizard said.
