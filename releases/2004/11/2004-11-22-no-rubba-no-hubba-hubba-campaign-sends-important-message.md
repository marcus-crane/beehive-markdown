New Zealand’s rising rates of sexually transmitted infections will not just go away, Health Minister Annette King said today at the launch of a new youth sexual health campaign at Parliament.

The campaign encourages sexually active young people to use a condom. It features a variety of media, including television, cinema, radio, outdoor advertising, magazines, print resources and a website (www.hubba.co.nz).

“The campaign’s slogan is spot on – No Rubba, No Hubba Hubba. In other words, ‘no condom, no sex’.”

Ms King said that while teenage sex was an uncomfortable topic for some, it was important to be realistic about the situation. Studies suggest that more than 20 percent of secondary school students are sexually active. “If they are not using condoms, these young people are putting themselves at risk of sexually transmitted infections and viruses like chlamydia, gonorrhoea and HIV.

“Rates of chlamydia and gonorrhoea have increased significantly in the last few years. Laboratory data suggest the incidence of chlamydia in the New Zealand population is considerably higher than in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom. The Government has an obligation to support an approach that reflects what is actually happening. Sexually active young people must be given the information and tools to protect themselves from STIs.”

Ms King says campaign materials also discuss wider youth sexual health issues, such as the consequences of having sex. Young people are encouraged to think carefully about sexual decisions, and parents and caregivers encouraged to talk to teenagers about sex and to discuss issues like understanding that sexual relationships involve caring, concern and responsibility.

The No Rubba, no Hubba Hubba commercial, developed with the help of young people, is set at a hip hop party, and uses a mixture of animation and ‘real people’. The campaign, arising out of the Government’s 2001 Sexual and Reproductive Health Strategy, runs from 22 November to the end of February next year.
