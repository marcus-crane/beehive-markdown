Cabinet has approved funding for additional construction on existing prison sites that will add 213 beds to the country's prison capacity over the next two years.

This is in addition to the four new prisons opening over the next three years that will increase capacity by more than 1500 beds.

Corrections Minister Paul Swain said the extra beds would help manage record inmate numbers. Discussions are underway to add a total of 63 beds at Hawkes Bay, Wanganui and Tongariro/Rangipo prisons next year and 150 beds at Rimutaka prison in 2006.

These sites were chosen because they have the land and infrastructure available to cope with the extra beds. Cost, staffing issues and availability of contractors were other major factors considered.

"These prisons were the only sites that could deliver the extra beds within the cost restraints and timeframes we face," Paul Swain said.

Ministers will also next month consider whether further capacity is required following updated Justice Ministry inmate forecasts.

"The extra beds are needed because inmate numbers are increasing faster than projected. This is due to the government's tougher sentencing, bail and parole laws and improved police clearance rates.

Paul Swain said the Corrections Department has managed the record inmate numbers by already adding an extra 600 beds through using a 4 per cent operational buffer, increased double-bunking and reopening the Larch unit at Tongariro/Rangipo. Police and court cells have also been used when necessary.

In addition, a 40-bed unit at Wanganui is due to re-open next week after refurbishment. Paul Swain also thanked prison officer unions PSA and CANZ for agreeing to provide extra 77 beds through increased double-bunking.

Now Cabinet decisions have been made, background papers on inmate numbers will be available at [www.corrections.govt.nz](http://www.corrections.govt.nz) .
