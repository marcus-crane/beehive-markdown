Foreign Minister Phil Goff today paid tribute to the role played by Colin Powell as United States Secretary of State, and expressed regret at his decision to return to private life.

Mr Powell announced his resignation earlier today.

"It has been a pleasure to work with Colin Powell over the last four years. He was always constructive and personable, and was a good friend to New Zealand," Mr Goff said.

"I admired him as a person of integrity and moderation who formed his views after careful consideration of the issues.

"The professionalism, experience and dedication he brought to the job served both his country and the international community well.

"I look forward to the opportunity in Santiago this week to thank him personally for his contribution and to wish him and his family well for the future.

"I also look forward to the formal announcement of the new Secretary of State in due course, and to working constructively with that person," Mr Goff said.
