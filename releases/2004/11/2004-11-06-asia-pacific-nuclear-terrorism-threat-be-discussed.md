Disarmament and Arms Control Minister Marian Hobbs will be in Sydney on Monday for an Australian Government hosted conference focused on reducing the threat of nuclear terrorism.

The keynote speaker will be the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Dr Mohamed ElBaradei. The conference will be attended by ministers and officials from governments and organisations in the Asia Pacific region and the United Nations.

"With the increasing threats from nuclear and radiological materials falling into the wrong hands, participants will examine ways to help ensure that sensitive materials are managed properly in our region," Marian Hobbs said. "Dr ElBaradei will speak to this theme with an address on nuclear proliferation and the potential threat of nuclear terrorism in Asia and the Pacific."

Marian Hobbs will address the conference on implementing UN Security Council resolution 1540, passed on April 28, which calls on all States to 'promote dialogue and cooperation on non-proliferation so as to address the threat posed by proliferation of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons, and their means of delivery'.

Australian Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer, will chair the one-day conference.
