Launching a publication celebrating the 12 recipients of the 2004 Tertiary Teaching Excellence Awards, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey encouraged tertiary education providers to start considering nominations for next year’s awards.

“The awards celebrate excellence in tertiary teaching, promote good teaching practice, and enhance career development for tertiary teachers,” Steve Maharey said.

“Since they were made for the first time in 2002 we have been inspired by teachers who have in turn been inspiring learners to achieve great things for themselves, for New Zealand and on the international stage.”

“The 2004 Tertiary Teaching Excellence Awards publication is an important part of the award scheme, profiling the best practice of the recipients. It enables people across the sector, and the public, to take a closer look at the philosophies and passions of some extraordinary educators. This year’s booklet also features testimonials from students and colleagues.

“Sixty people have received Tertiary Teaching Excellence Awards since they were established in 2002, with prize money totalling over $600,000. We now have a pool of excellent teachers throughout the country and as further reforms for tertiary excellence are rolled out we will be ensuring that their expertise is made available to the sector.

“I encourage all tertiary institutions to play their part in fostering the ongoing development of outstanding teachers and to share their insights and methods with others in the sector. Above all, I encourage them to invest in and reward quality performance.”

Copies of the 2004 Tertiary Teaching Excellence Awards publication have been sent to tertiary providers with the guidelines for nominating entries to the 2005 awards. The publication is available on the  
[New Zealand Qualifications Authority website](http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/for-providers/awards/ttea/2004.html).

About the Tertiary Teaching Excellence Awards

The awards are administered by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority. The selection committee is made up of representatives from the tertiary sector.

Awards are considered in three categories:

1.Sustained Excellence  
Awarded to teachers who demonstrate continuing excellence in their teaching over a period of at least six years.

2.Excellence in Innovation  
Awarded to teachers who demonstrate innovation in their teaching methods, curriculum design or materials that encourage and enhance learning.

3.Excellence in Collaboration  
Awarded to groups or teams who demonstrate clearly that they have worked collaboratively within or between institutions, to improve learning.

There are nine awards of $20,000 each and a supreme award, the Prime Minister’s Award, of $30,000.

All tertiary providers, including universities, wânanga, polytechnics, colleges of education and private training establishments, have been invited to make nominations for the 2005 awards. Nominations close on 31 March 2005 and recipients will be announced at a ceremony in mid-2005.

Full contact details and procedures are given in the guideline document (available on the NZQA website at www.nzqa.govt.nz in the ‘For Providers’ section). Providers should contact the Qualifications Authority if they have any questions about the nomination process.
