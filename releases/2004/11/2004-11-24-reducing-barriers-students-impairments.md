Paralympian gold medallist Tim Prendergast joined tertiary students with impairments and tertiary education providers at Parliament today for the launch of a new Code of Practice to improve access for students with impairments.

Ruth Dyson, Minister for Disability Issues, said the new code, Kia Örite: Achieving Equity, sets out best practice standards to improve the awareness and responsiveness of tertiary education providers to issues for tertiary students with impairments.

“Kia Örite: Achieving Equity identifies ways that providers can improve access to services and reduce the everyday barriers faced by tertiary students with impairments,” Ruth Dyson said.

Issues covered in the code include admission and enrolment; access to general and specialist services; funding; services for Maori; access to buildings, facilities and equipment; teaching and learning; examinations and assessment; and staff development.

Steve Maharey, Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education), said the Code supports the government’s strategy for tertiary education. “It promotes equity of access and opportunity for all learners, highlights teaching capability and learning environments to meet diverse needs, and encourages providers to develop support services to help students with impairments to participate and succeed in tertiary education.”

Ruth Dyson congratulated ACHIEVE, the National Post Secondary Education Disability Network of New Zealand, for producing Kia Örite: Achieving Equity. “I encourage tertiary providers to apply this document to their organisation’s planning and education delivery.”

Kia Örite: Achieving Equity is available from ACHIEVE, Victoria University of Wellington, or can be downloaded from www.achieve.org.nz, www.tec.govt.nz and www.minedu.govt.nz .
