Motorists can cut their fuel bills by around 25 per cent by changing their driving style. That's the result of EECA's EnergyWise rally that finished on the evening of Friday, 05 November 2004.

Drivers of a four litre, turbo charged Ford Falcon XR6 beat the expected litres per 100km numbers by 24 per cent (9.8l/100km), while the drivers of a three and half litre Holden Commodore beat its by 28 per cent (8.0l/100km).

Many smaller cars can do half as many kilometres per litre again over the Falcon and the Commodore (less than 6.0l/100km).

Thirty six teams took part in the rally to promote fuel efficiency over a 1600 km course around the North Island.

"The savings that ordinary drivers can make by modifying their driving style are very impressive. I would expect most people would be able to knock at least 10 per cent off their fuel bills by driving more carefully and ensuring they keep their car's tyres at the correct pressures," says Energy Minister and Convenor, Ministerial Group on Climate Change, Pete Hodgson. "Who wouldn't want to knock 10 per cent off their fuel bill?"

The savings available to those who are considering changing cars are even more impressive. The average fuel consumption of a New Zealand car is about 10 litres per 100 kilometres (28.2mpg). Nine cars in the rally, and available to buy in New Zealand today, gave fuel efficiency figures near double that, or even higher, over the course of the rally.

The most efficient car in the rally was a Toyota Prius which returned 4 litres per 100 km (70 mpg).

"This rally proves that we can all save money at the pumps by driving more carefully. It also highlights the fact that many people could cut their fuel bills in half if they choose their next car carefully."
