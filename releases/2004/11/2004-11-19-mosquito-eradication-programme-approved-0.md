The Cabinet has approved a $10 million programme to attempt to eradicate the southern saltmarsh mosquito around the Wairau and Lake Grassmere, Associate Biosecurity Minister Marian Hobbs announced today.

"This exotic mosquito, a known vector of the Ross River virus, is a real nuisance and is particularly vicious and aggressive, biting during the day," Marian Hobbs said. "We have yet to have a case of New Zealand-acquired, mosquito-borne disease in this country and this eradication programme will help to keep it that way.

"We're encouraged by successfully eradicating SSM from the North Island's east coast and the positive results we are seeing so far in the Kaipara eradication programme. We expect a similar outcome from the Wairau/Grassmere programme."

Around $10 million will be spent over the next four years developing and implementing a plan to eradicate the exotic mosquito from the Wairau and Lake Grassmere areas, which cover a potential habitat of 900 hectares.

The programme will involve aerial and ground spraying, using S-methoprene, an insect growth regulator that stops the mosquito pupae hatching into adults, and the biological spray Bti.

The mosquito lays its eggs on vegetation just above the waterline but wetting is vital for the eggs to hatch. High tides, heavy rain and wind that increase the size of waves can all encourage hatching.
