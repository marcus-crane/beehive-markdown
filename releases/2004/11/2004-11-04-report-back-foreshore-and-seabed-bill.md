Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen said today that it was unfortunate but unsurprising that the Fisheries and other Sea-related Legislation Committee had been unable to come back with an agreed [report](http://www.clerk.parliament.govt.nz/Content/SelectCommitteeReports/Final%20FS%20Report.pdf) on the Foreshore and Seabed Bill.

"The issues covered by the Bill are complex and contentious so agreement among the different political parties represented on the committee was never likely.

"This does not detract from the value of the committee process and the forum it provided for submitters to have their voices heard and their views on the Bill communicated to the government.

"Officials from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet who monitored the committee hearings and assisted the committee in its deliberations have drawn up a list of recommendations to address practical concerns raised in the submissions. These are mostly technical in nature and uncontroversial.

"Further changes may emerge in discussions within the Labour caucus and with New Zealand First, which is supporting the Bill.

"The committee’s inability to come down with an agreed sheet of proposed amendments means that all changes to the Bill will be implemented through Supplementary Order Paper," Dr Cullen said.
