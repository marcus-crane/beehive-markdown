A new initiative aimed at reducing the accident rate in the General Aviation sector by 25 per cent over the next five years was launched tonight by Transport Safety Minister Harry Duynhoven and ACC Minister Ruth Dyson.

"The AIRCARE 'Managing Risk in Aviation' DVD is about reducing accidents, the aim to permanently change pilot behaviour, so that safety will be forefront in pilots’ minds." Mr Duynhoven said, "It will become second nature to ‘double check’ every element of flying an aircraft. This will mean we get the accident rate down, and, most importantly, ensure that it stays down."

ACC Minister Ruth Dyson said the aviation sector faced special challenges.

“Every year on average 26 crew and passengers are killed in the aviation industry, and a further 27 seriously injured. The AIRCARE programme as a whole, and the initiatives to manage risk – such as the DVD launched today – will contribute greatly towards developing a safety culture in the sector, and will make a valuable contribution to the government’s Injury Prevention Strategy,” Ruth Dyson said.

AIRCARE is a joint initiative between the Aviation Industry Association, the Civil Aviation Authority and ACC, and this risk management DVD is the first of the AIRCARE series.

"Since taking on the Ministerial responsibility for aviation, I have seen the partnership between industry and the CAA grow. The AIRCARE programme is exciting in that it highlights what can be achieved through a partnership approach. The willingness of agencies such as the AIA, CAA, and ACC to work together will ensure a greater chance of success. I look forward to seeing the accident rate come down, " Harry Duynhoven said.
