Co-ordinating Minister, Race Relations, Trevor Mallard, today announced the second phase of work for the government’s review of targeted policies and programmes.

“Departments have been asked to clearly demonstrate a need; show that the need still exists; and show that ethnicity is an indicator of the need. Evidence is required to show how the targeting helps to address the need,” Trevor Mallard said.

"As I said when I announced the first tranche of reviews, this process is aimed at giving ministers and the public an assurance that policies and programmes are targeted on the basis of need, not race.

"We are committed to improving Maori and Pacific Island educational achievement, health and welfare, and in order to do so we will use programmes and policies that work for these groups. That's also our approach for other New Zealanders who have specific needs such as the elderly or those in rural communities.

"Inclusion in the attached list does not mean these programmes will be dropped -as they may be working very well. The reviews will confirm this or otherwise."

The Ministerial Review Unit in the State Services Commission, in conjunction with departments, developed the list of policies and programmes for the second stage of reviews.

“The second stage involves reviews of policies and programmes at the Department of Child, Youth and Family Services, the Department of Corrections, Ministry for the Environment, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Ministry of Culture and Heritage, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs, Ministry of Research, Science and Technology, Ministry of Social Development and Te Puni Kokiri.

“The Ministerial Review Unit and departments will work together over the next two months to develop terms of reference for the individual reviews. All reviews will be completed in the middle of next year," Trevor Mallard said.
