Rongotai MP Annette King says she is delighted Defence Minister Mark Burton has advised her the Government has agreed to sell the hulk of the HMNZS Wellington to the Sink F69 Trust Project Wellington.

Ms King says the decision means that “four years of hard work by the trust and Wellington’s Labour MPs has paid off for the trust and for Wellington as a whole.

“This is really good news for the city, and it would not have happened without the enthusiasm the trust has shown to see their project through.”

Ms King says the trust aims to sink the HMNZS Wellington off Island Bay as a tourist attraction.

“The Government has agreed to sell the hulk for the Trust for a nominal sum of one dollar once the Chief of Defence Force declares it to be surplus to New Zealand Defence Force requirements.

“The Cabinet has also agreed that the Navy will prepare the vessel for sale and meet the costs of towing. All other costs relating to sinking the ship will be the Trust’s responsibility.”

Ms King says she is sure the Trust will be pleased with the outcome, and she wishes Trust members every success with the rest of the project.
