Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia is pleased that by the end of this week, with the passing of the governments foreshore and seabed legislation, traditional Maori rights and interests will be guaranteed, protected and enhanced in perpetuity.

“Maori have nothing to fear with the passing of this legislation. Customary rights – the interests of whanau, hapu and iwi are acknowledged and protected.

“Access to and use of the foreshore and beaches has always been an integral part of Maori culture, of New Zealand culture – that doesn’t change with the passing of this Bill. Rather, it ensures that all New Zealanders – Maori and non-Maori - will own the foreshore and seabed forever AND there will be free access for everyone.

“As I have said previously, this legislation offers protection and flexibility to whanau, hapu and iwi by ensuring a process is in place to recognise our tipuna connection with the foreshore and seabed and to ensure that as Maori we can pass on to our mokopuna what our tupuna passed on to us” said Parekura Horomia.
