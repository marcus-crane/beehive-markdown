Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and a special welcome to our distinguished overseas guests. I should like to thank the Wireless Forum for their invitation to open 'Convergence 2004'.

In 1900, New Zealand's first telegraph link with Britain came ashore near Cooper's Beach in North Auckland, an event that is commemorated in the name Cable Bay. For the first time, businessmen in this country had an immediate connection with our most important overseas market, and families of British descent with their relatives in what was then called 'Home'. The technology had its limitations. The basic charge for cablegrams allowed the sender only eight words, and considerable ingenuity was exercised to compress information as possible into the minimum number of words - much like our text-messaging teenagers today. 'Freight on board' became 'FOB' and so on.

For some, of course, eight words was more than ample. You may recall the story of the Glaswegian who telegraphed his brother in New Zealand with the news 'Father died last night. Rangers three, Celtic nil.'

Communications have moved a long way in the subsequent century. Our markets are world-wide. Our people have family connections with practically every country on earth. Our international communications carry, not eight words a minute, but thousands of words and images in seconds.

On October the Twelfth I had the privilege of opening a forum on the future of mobile technology at the Centre of Digital Enterprise, here in Auckland. The Centre, based at the University of Auckland's Business School, was established to promote research linkages between the university and its business partners. This Forum was its inaugural public event. A distinguished panel of speakers from New Zealand and overseas addressed the forum, some by real time teleconference link - in itself a recent and remarkable advance in communications that we are already beginning to take for granted.

Some interesting facts emerged from the Forum. It is evident that there is a marked shift from wire- and fibre-based business communications towards wireless technologies. In some cases it's a matter of cost - the wireless solution is cheaper to operate. In others, it is a matter of mobility. Business employees are able to access and send information, communicate and receive direction, report their location and locate clients wherever they happen to be at the time. A variety of technologies has been developed and marketed to support this revolution, and there are no doubt examples in this room - laptops with wireless modems, PDAs with built-in cellular phones, and so on.

R and D companies in New Zealand and overseas are taking these technologies to the next level. One well-known international company is working on the integration of business communications. Imagine, for example, all of a company's PCs, laptops, mobile radios and cellular telephones exchanging data directly, in a form appropriate to the device being addressed -broadband for a PC, narrowband for a phone or radio. A salesman in the field wanting a customer's credit record downloads it to his cellphone from the company's mainframe. A delivery driver sends his location and receives immediate directions to his next pickup.

A recently established New Zealand company is taken that last example a step further. Very soon it may be possible to point your cellphone at any downtown office block, and download the names, business interests, contact details and floor locations of its occupiers. Or transfer that concept to tourism. Click on the flagpole at Kororareka and hear the story of Hone Heke. Point to a hotel and press a key to get room rates and tonight's restaurant menu. The possibilities are limited only by our imaginations.

One of the most interesting and, perhaps, relevant presentations at the Forum was about Japan's use of cellular networks. Rather than adopt high tech mobile solutions - wireless Internet devices with ever more bells and whistles - the Japanese telcos have reconfigured their cellular networks to achieve much the same result. For example, email messages can be sent directly from any enabled PC to any cellphone, with embedded URLs accessing supplementary information at the touch of a key. Cellphone cameras detect bar-coded URLs in catalogues and advertisements that lead to product information on the Web. Barcodes on the back of cellphones are scanned to pay micro-transactions - less, say, than ten dollars - which appear on the phone bill. The advantages for, say, taxi drivers and coffee bars are immediately apparent.

The immediate and obvious implication for business is that mobile workers do not have to be equipped with expensive laptops and PDAs to stay in close and effective touch with managers. A less obvious benefit has been the ability to send out discount coupons by email to identified cellular customers, at an enormous saving in printing and distribution costs. So popular is this practice that restaurants and cinemas are using it to solicit local custom on slow nights.

The Government has taken a lead in ensuring that the economic and social benefits of this kind of technology, within the wider context of ICT -information and communications technology - are maximised. They have achieved this through market-friendly legislation - for example, the 2001 Telecommunications Act - and through regulation, but underlying the statutes are comprehensive policies that inform all government processes.  
These have been expounded and expanded in the Digital Strategy, a consultation document released in July, in response to which the Government has received over two hundred submissions.

The challenge was to lay the foundations of an ICT infrastructure that enhances this country's economic productivity and social achievements, and from which all will benefit. This will take more than enacting legislation or making regulations. There has to be a comprehensive plan with positive goals that that link the activities of government, national and local, with those of decision-makers, business leaders and managers, community groups and individuals. That is the Digital Strategy's purpose.

Even as the Strategy is being finalised, its principles are being put into  
effect.

Access. We have created an Internet portal giving the public access to all government and local government sites. Nationwide initiatives include Project PROBE, which will extend broadband capacity to rural schools and communities, Senior Net and the Tertiary E-learning Framework.

Training. The Government is funding school and community ICT learning programmes, and digital opportunity pilot programmes in the Far North – in Auckland's Pacific Island communities - in Gisborne and Wairoa -in Gore -wherever the need exists.

Security. The Internet Safety Group has been established, largely with Ministry of Education funding and I am now developing a policy on SPAM.

These programmes are a beginning. Our intention is that this country not only enjoys the maximum economic and social benefits from existing and emerging technologies, but to become a leader in the adoption and integration of technologies still below the horizon.

I mentioned earlier a company that has recently established itself in New Zealand. Its founder, a legend in the computer industry, made his career -and a couple of fortunes - in America's Silicon Valley. So why is here, on the edge of the world?

Part of the answer lies in the fact that we are no longer on the edge of the  
world. High speed communications put us as close to London, Tokyo or New York as any other nation. Most of the world's major R and D companies have offices right here, many in this city. One reason for that is our business-friendly regulatory and tax environment. Another is that we are in the perfect time-zone for accessing Australian and Asian markets - and a couple of hours ahead.

These are reasons enough, but add to that the fact New Zealanders are widely recognised as being hard-working and innovative. That they are particularly good at second-level derivatives - turning basic technology into something new, useful and profitable. And, with our small, highly localized population, this is a near-perfect test market for anything that is new and useful.

My message for you today, therefore, is don't just think of this gathering merely as an opportunity to find a simple and affordable business solution in wireless technology, important as that may be. You should also consider New Zealand as a potential hub for technology development and servicing in Asian, Pacific and American markets. Ireland, with similar advantages, has become a major North Atlantic hub, servicing American and European customers in R and D and finance. Then imagine what you and your companies could contribute to that development. Government has provided the environment, and technologists have provided the means. Where it all goes from here, however, is largely up to the businessmen among you.

You can begin today, with Convergence 2004. Somewhere in this building is an idea that will work for you. Find it and use it to create a business solution that is simple, affordable and works right now. Then consider how you might sell it to the world.

Enjoy the day. Thank you.
