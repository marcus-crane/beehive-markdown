Applications and nominations are being sought for members of a new Building Practitioners Board, Building Issues Minister Margaret Wilson said today.

The Board – established under the Building Act 2004 - will play a key role in the new licensing system for the building industry.

The independent Building Practitioners Board will:

·approve rules relating to licensed building practitioners;  
·hear complaints about licensed building practitioners;  
·hear appeals against licensing decisions by the Registrar; and  
·review and report to the Minister on board's performance.

The aim of licensing is to set national standards for design and construction work with the potential to harm people or cause costly property damage. Such work is likely to include foundations, cladding and structural framing.

"In order to get a licence a designer or builder will be assessed to ensure they meet licensing requirements, which could include a mix of practical assessment, work history and recognition of training," Margaret Wilson said.

The six to eight-member board will require a mix of skills including industry expertise in design construction and inspections services, legal, dispute resolution and mediation skills and an understanding of education and training issues.

Applications will be considered from candidates throughout the country and close on 28 January 2005.
