Communications Minister Paul Swain today announced the release of a discussion paper on the implementation review of the Telecommunications Act 2001.

The review seeks input and comment on a range of implementation related issues such as processes laid down in the Act, definitions and other related matters.

The main purpose of the review is to improve the processes set up by the Act with a particular focus on the monitoring and enforcement of the prompt development and implementation of regulated service supply agreements.

The review will also consider innovative ways of better addressing the resolution of users’ telecommunication service provision complaints that cannot be resolved directly by the parties.

The Ministry of Economic Development will consider submissions before making recommendations to the government on any possible legislative changes.

The discussion paper is available online from [www.med.govt.nz](http://www.med.govt.nz) .  
Submissions on the paper should be sent to:
