Rotorua District Council will be the first local authority to benefit from the government's Housing Innovation Fund, set up to provide more housing for people on low incomes or those with special needs.

Housing New Zealand, which administers the Fund, is lending the Rotorua District Council $1.46 million to replace 24 bedsits with 30 new one-bedroom units for older people.

Housing Minister Steve Maharey said Rotorua's plan to provide quality, affordable housing for older people was exactly the type of project the Fund was established to support.

“The revamped Rawhiti pensioner housing complex will increase the amount of quality housing for older people in Rotorua,” Steve Maharey said.

“This project is the first of what we expect to be a number of local body initiatives to improve and expand the pool of well-built and well-designed housing to meet community needs.

“The Housing Innovation Fund was set-up to help community-based groups, local government bodies, Maori and iwi to provide more housing for people on low incomes or those with special needs, which is what Rotorua District Council is doing.”

The Council is providing land, and matching Housing New Zealand’s financial contribution.

The units will be designed to cater to the needs of older people and will be within walking distance of shops, services and transport links. Design work is underway and construction work is expected to start next year.

Housing New Zealand is currently considering four other proposals from local authorities for access to funding from the $63 million Housing Innovation Fund.

Six community groups around the country have already received support through the Fund for innovative housing projects.
