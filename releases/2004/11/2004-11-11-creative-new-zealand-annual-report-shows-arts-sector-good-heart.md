Greater opportunities for New Zealand artists overseas and stronger support for regional arts initiatives are among the many achievements highlighted in [Creative New Zealand's Annual Report](http://www.creativenz.govt.nz/resources/annual-03-04.pdf) 2003/04 released today, says Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard.

"Creative New Zealand is to be congratulated for its contribution to fostering and promoting New Zealand's arts and artists both nationally and internationally," Judith Tizard said.

"This report is further evidence of the growing strength and vitality of New Zealand's arts sector four years on from the launch of the government's Cultural Recovery Package.

"I am delighted with the progress made over the past year to build closer working relationships with professional arts organisations and deliver on the priorities identified by this government, including development of new overseas audiences and strengthening regional arts."

Last year the government agreed to increase Creative New Zealand's funding by $11.6 million over the next four years to encourage, promote and support the arts in New Zealand for all New Zealanders.

Highlights for the 2003-04 year included:

- Ten regional partnerships established to position the arts sector in regional development strategies and to enhance regional arts infrastructure and arts participation
- 2367 community arts projects supported by the Creative Communities Scheme
- 15 new artists and seven retailers added to the toi iho register, taking the total to 129 artists and 20 retailers
- CNZ oversaw the NZ delegation to the 9th Festival of Pacific Arts in Palau
- Works from leading New Zealand artists were presented to international audiences at the prestigious Melbourne Art Fair and Australian Performing Arts Market in Adelaide
- The Prime Minister presented the three inaugural awards for Literary Achievement to Janet Frame for fiction, Michael King for non-fiction and Hone Tuwhare for poetry

Judith Tizard said Creative New Zealand had also launched a new [three-year strategic plan](http://www.creativenz.govt.nz/resources/strat-plan-e.pdf), developed after consultation with more than 3000 people from across the arts sector.

"The strategic plan builds on the solid work of the past year and sets the vision and strategic direction for the next three years. I welcome CNZ's commitment to supporting and nurturing artistic excellence, further developing international audiences and responding to New Zealand's growing cultural diversity."
