Rau rangatira maa,  
tenei te mihi ki a koutou i runga i te kaupapa o te ra.  
Tena koutou, tena koutou, tena koutou katoa.

\[Distinguished guests, greetings to you gathered here for this purpose today. Greetings once, twice, three times to you all.]

Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today. Greetings to you all – and particularly warm greetings to our overseas guests. It is a pleasure to have you in New Zealand.

Congratulations to the conference organisers for putting together such an impressive programme.

I am sure the presentations from such a prestigious list of speakers from New Zealand and abroad will generate much fruitful discussion to the benefit of the health of Asian people in New Zealand.

I value this opportunity to discuss with you the Government’s perspective on the matter of health and cultural diversity, and some of the key developments.

As my colleague Trevor Mallard mentioned yesterday, the Asian population is the fastest growing in New Zealand. We have a strong Asian community that contributes a great deal to the vibrancy of Auckland and New Zealand. And that contribution will continue to increase. Statistics New Zealand projects the number of Asian people will rise to 13% of the New Zealand population by 2021. Asian people make up 12.5% of Auckland’s population today.

That diversity brings challenges, for both host communities adjusting to change, and for migrant communities to become part of New Zealand society without losing their cultural identity.

In 2002 the Office of Ethnic Affairs released a document “Ethnic Perspectives in Policy”. It outlined the following policy values, upon which policies and services affecting ethnic people should be based:

Øacceptance of ethnic diversity – each ethnic community is celebrated as part of New Zealand society, and diversity in culture, language and religion is valued;

Øparticipation by the ethnic sector – where each ethnic community is supported, and enabled to contribute to all aspects of New Zealand life;

Øaccessibility to information and services – to which ethnicity, including language;

Øresponsiveness – where ethnic groups are identified and their needs recognised and provided for, in policy, programmes and services; and

Øequity – where ethnic groups are treated fairly and the outcomes for ethnic groups in areas such as in education, employment, health, housing, justice and welfare should be no less favourable than for other New Zealanders.

The Government’s health policy has a strong focus on population health – that is, addressing the wider health needs of different communities and populations. This involves not just treatment but, importantly, education, prevention and community development as well.

The Government recognises not only that certain populations such as Mäori or Pacific peoples have different health status to other New Zealanders, but also recognises that there are different ways to approach these differences, and address health inequalities. It has developed documents such as the Mäori Health Strategy, and the Pacific Health and Disability Action Plan as a result.

The question then might well be asked, what about the health of Asian peoples? We have begun to focus attention on the specific health status of Asian peoples, but it is not as far developed as that for other groups.

One reason for this is that over many years there has been a lot of research and a lot of evidence gathered regarding the unique health status of Mäori and Pacific peoples – and a large amount of evidence and research into the most appropriate response to those needs.

There is a lot less information and evidence regarding Asian health in New Zealand. That’s why I am so supportive of this conference in particular, as well as the wider initiatives to build that knowledge base both here at the University of Auckland and elsewhere.

I am very supportive of research programmes to investigate issues of Asian health, as well as health initiatives that appropriately target the health needs of Asian peoples.

In some respects that research will be difficult. The Asian population is a very diverse one. And while Asian peoples are among New Zealand’s earliest settlers, a large proportion of the Asian population are relatively recent migrants here.

And there are specific groups of Asian people who have particular health issues, such as students from overseas, or refugees. Both of those groups can have difficulties adapting to New Zealand society.

All these factors, and in particular the fact that the Asian demographic is neither homogenous nor stable, makes it more difficult to identify and address those particular health issues for Asian peoples. This makes research in general and this conference in particular all the more important.

As that research accumulates, then the Government may focus on developing a more comprehensive approach to Asian health needs. But it is important to note that work towards addressing the particular health needs of Asian people is already occurring, and it is important to continue to support that work. The various initiatives under way are a good base from which to build for the future. To outline some of the key ones…

Asian health initiatives  
The Auckland District Health Board has a project underway aimed at providing effective coordination of public health services to target the health needs of the Asian population in the Auckland region. This project addresses the wider determinants of health by paying attention to social environments in which refugees and new migrants live, and aims to mitigate inequitable access to services.

Services include providing Asian perspectives on research, providing input into policies that impact on Asian health, supporting community groups on specific projects, and providing an Asian perspective in Primary Health Organisations.

The Ministry of Health provides $150,000 a year to fund the Asian Network. This project aims to encourage public health action and to develop public health leadership around issues that influence Asian health status, maintaining a network to advocate for the wellbeing of Asian communities, promoting healthy communities and healthy environments for Asian people.

Services include cultural advice and training for other agencies, maintaining a network infrastructure of Asian communities, making submissions to a range of agencies on issues that help determine health for Asian people.

Non-Government Organisations are being encouraged to address the specific needs of Asian peoples. Initially, the Family Planning Association have funding to target sexual health among Asian peoples.

Other examples of working and responding to cultural diversity include the Asian Health Office at Waitemata District Health Board and the Auckland Regional Migrant Service.

With the exception of the Auckland Regional Migrant Service, these services were funded following the publication of the Asian Public Health Project Report in March 2003. The report found that, as well as the Asian population is diverse and increasing:

Ømost Asian people are young and middle-aged adults;  
Ømost Asian people are well-educated but have lower than average incomes;  
Øthe Asian population has diverse health issues;  
ØAsian communities want better access to health services that cater to their needs;  
ØAsian communities are ready and willing to participate in improving their communities’ health.  
Mental Health  
Until recently, the mental health of Asian peoples in New Zealand received very little public or professional attention. Low rates of crime and divorce, along with generally high education and occupational attainment, led to the popular belief that Asian people in New Zealand were extremely well adjusted.

Recent research on the mental health of Asian peoples in New Zealand is challenging that stereotype. Two broad themes emerge from that research, one of which identifies adaptation problems for Asian people arriving in New Zealand, and the other relates to barriers preventing Asian peoples in New Zealand accessing mental health services.

Adaptation problems include language difficulties, employment problems, and the disruption of family and social support networks. Many new migrants have suffered traumatic experiences prior to arriving in New Zealand, with associated mental health concerns.

The Mental Health Commission review of literature on Mental Health Issues for Asians in New Zealand sets out recommendations for promoting mental health in Asian communities and improving cultural responsiveness in Mental Health Services.

Initiatives such as the Asian Network will be important in working to implement those recommendations. But stigma remains a significant problem, and not just for Asian peoples. I have been impressed with the “Like Minds, Like Mine” campaign to address this issue.

There has been a tremendous investment in mental health services in general over the last decade. Funding has more than doubled since 1995. Mental health services have continued to increase in line with the Government’s objective to implement the “Blueprint” for mental health. This strategy covers all New Zealanders, including recent Asian immigrants.

The Mental Health Commission review also calls for further research on four particular groups within Asian communities: women, students, older people, and refugees. I hope that many of you here will be able to contribute to that research.

I was very pleased to hear about the Asian Mental Health Workforce Development Feasibility Study. This study will look at the requirements of mental health workers to meet the mental health needs of Asian peoples.

It involves a literature review, a study of overseas models of training and development in this area, and a pilot project – already underway – of a training programme in Auckland. This study will report in April 2005, and will then move to an implementation programme. This is a major development that I am very excited by.

Traditional Chinese Medicine  
The 2002/03 National Health Survey revealed that one in four people visited an alternative health practitioner during the previous year. The role of alternative healing practices such as traditional Chinese medicine within the New Zealand health sector is an important issue that we have been considering recently.

The Ministerial Advisory Committee on Complementary and Alternative Health (MACCAH), which was set up under the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act in June 2001, has examined a wide range of modalities, including traditional Chinese medicine, and acupuncture.

As you may be aware, that Committee’s report to the Minister of Health was publicly released in August. We are currently considering its recommendations. The Minister has asked the Ministry of Health to review the report, and she will have more to say about it in due course.

The key message of the report – that we should reduce barriers to the safe and appropriate use of complementary and alternative medicine – is one that I support.

The report highlights the need for more information about these treatments, such as herbal medicine and acupuncture. It is extremely important that users of alternative health care have access to unbiased and up-to-date information so they can make sound decisions about their health care.

I know that is something that you would agree with, and the professional research and study of this sort of treatment is very valuable. I am very supportive of work towards providing information that the public can rely on to make decisions about their health care options.

We have also been trying to make more information available on complementary medicine. The establishment of the Ministry of Health-funded CAM website \[www.cam.org.nz] in March of this year has an important role to play in informing the public about complementary medicine.

There are always things to learn about different approaches to treating illness, and I am interested in how traditional Chinese medicine can contribute to the health and wellbeing of New Zealanders.  
Again, research so that education and policy development are based on sound evidence is so important.

Since the reforms to the structure of our health system over recent years, District Health Boards and Primary Health Organisations are able to integrate complementary medicine where it can contribute to improving the health status of their local or enrolled population

I know there is interest from various groups regarding the role of acupuncturists now that we have the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act.

While representatives of different acupuncture groups have expressed to the Ministry of Health an interest in registering acupuncturists under the Act, the Ministry has not yet received an application that is supported by the majority of the profession.

Any application to come under the HPCA needs to demonstrate general agreement across the profession on qualifications, standards and competencies for scopes of practice. I understand that progress is being made towards preparing such a case.

Conclusion  
To conclude, Asian communities enrich and strengthen New Zealand society, and we must all work towards identifying and meeting their needs, in health and in general.

It is important that collectively we continue to develop our knowledge and expertise on Asian health issues to enable services to further develop in the future. This inaugural conference, which provides a great opportunity for sharing information and networking, is a significant development towards that aim. Thank you again for the opportunity to be part of it.
