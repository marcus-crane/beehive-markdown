New Zealand’s second-longest running trade issue has been successfully resolved, Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton said today.

Mr Sutton welcomed the public notification in the US Federal Register that New Zealand honeybees and honeybee semen may be exported to the United States from 22 November.

“The decision by the United States to allow New Zealand access for both honey bees and honey bee semen is good news. It allows our exporters access into a niche market.”

Shipments will also be able to transit more easily through the United States to Canada.

Mr Sutton said the United States Department of Agriculture has heavily scrutinised the biosecurity implications of importing New Zealand bees and was satisfied our bees pose no threat.

“New Zealand first requested honey bee access to the US in 1978. Efforts by the Foreign Affairs and Trade Ministry, our Embassy in Washington and the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry have been vital to reach this successful outcome.”

There are still some process steps that need to be finalised before trade can commence. MAF is drafting the first version of export certificates for the export of bees to continental US and transit through Hawaii. MAF will then negotiate with the United States conditions for the export of honeybees.

Exports of New Zealand honeybees and honeybee semen to the United States are expected to be valued at initially NZ$140,000 a year. Queen bee exports to Canada in 2003 were valued at NZ$1.09m.
