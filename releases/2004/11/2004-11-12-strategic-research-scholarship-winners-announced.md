Funding of $176,000 over three years was announced today to support students conducting co-operative research projects in key areas of the economy.

Eleven projects have received funding through the latest round of the [Tertiary Education Commission’s (TEC) Enterprise Scholarships scheme](http://www.tec.govt.nz/funding/scholarships/enterprise.htm). Under the scheme companies support the scholarship winners by matching contributions dollar for dollar to the Enterprise Scholarships funding provided by the TEC.

Scholarship winners are conducting research in areas as diverse as renewable power and energy conservation in Antarctica and using geographical techniques to aid groundwater management.

Some well-known companies and agencies are among the successful applicants in this round, including MWH New Zealand, Carter Holt Harvey, Transpower New Zealand and Beca Carter Hollings and Ferner.

Associate Education Minister (Tertiary Education) Steve Maharey said the investment of private enterprise into research, development and innovation is critical to New Zealand’s prosperity.

“Enterprise Scholarships are a very successful part of the government’s ‘Bright Future’ package that has supported more than 250 students to conduct research since the scheme started in 1999.

“Potential exists to enhance current arrangements to ensure that initiatives of this type can make an even greater contribution to the country’s economic and social development in the future.”
