The Crown and Ngäti Kahu ki Whangaroa have signed Terms of Negotiation for the settlement of the Far North iwi's historical Treaty of Waitangi claims, Treaty Negotiations Minister Margaret Wilson said today.  
"The Terms of Negotiation set out how the parties will negotiate a durable settlement of all Ngâti Kahu ki Whangaroa’s historical Treaty claims," Margaret Wilson said.  
“I am optimistic that these negotiations can be completed in a timely fashion, so that Ngäti Kahu ki Whangaroa’s historical claims can be resolved.”  
Ngâti Kahu ki Whangaroa are a small iwi based on the peninsula between the Mangonui and Whangaroa harbours in the Far North. The Waitangi Tribunal’s 1997 Muriwhenua Land Report found that the Crown’s actions in relation to Ngâti Kahu ki Whangaroa lands breached the Treaty of Waitangi.  
“Although Ngâti Kahu ki Whangaroa is a small iwi, the Crown is negotiating with it separately, because it does not fit naturally with any other group," Margaret Wilson said. "This is consistent with the Waitangi Tribunal hearing, also conducted separately."  
Once negotiations are completed the two parties will sign an Agreement in Principle. Work has already begun on this agreement, which will outline the components of a settlement package.  
Ngâti Kahu ki Whangaroa is the fifth group to sign Terms of Negotiation with the Crown this year. The signing follows the recent initialling of the Te Arawa lakes Deed of Settlement and today' introduction of the Ngâti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) Claims Settlement Bill.  
“These Terms of Negotiation are a further indication of the increasing momentum of settlements, and a demonstration of this government’s commitment to settling historical Treaty of Waitangi claims," Margaret Wilson said.
