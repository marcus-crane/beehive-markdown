Associate Justice Minister David Benson-Pope has described the decision of National's Don Brash to withdraw his support for the Civil Union Bill as "regrettable".

"Most New Zealanders have friends or indeed family who will directly benefit with the passing of the Civil Union Bill," says Mr Benson-Pope.

"Passage of this Civil Union Bill removes a form of discrimination, which has no place in the inclusive, tolerant and open-minded society that New Zealand should be.

"The majority of New Zealanders support this legislation and I am confident a majority of MPs will see this Bill pass."
