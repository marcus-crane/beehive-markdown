Environment Minister Marian Hobbs has intervened in the Auckland land contamination controversy, offering to assist the Auckland City Council resolve the issue.

The minister has written to Auckland Mayor Dick Hubbard advising what information should be attached to affected properties' Land Information Memorandum reports.

"A Ministry for the Environment draft guideline on managing contaminated land advises that a property should not be considered a 'contaminated site' until investigation shows the actual presence of contaminants and a risk to human health or the environment," Marian Hobbs said.

"I believe an early LIM notification is likely to distract from the real issue of following a good process to identify actual risks. Councils need to continue collecting information to determine whether there is any health and environmental risk associated with affected properties. "

Marian Hobbs acknowledged there was legal ambiguity about council responsibilities. But she undertook to ask the Ministry for Environment to investigate whether a council would fulfil its statutory duty, under Section 44 of the Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act 1987, by placing a notice on a LIM only when it is confirmed that there is an unacceptable health risk from contaminants on a property.

The minister also told Mr Hubbard the government would consider paying for soil testing on private properties in conjunction with city and regional councils after an effective sampling regime has been designed.

"Good information about previous land-use and likelihood of risk is key to the design," Marian Hobbs said. "And this goes for other areas around New Zealand too. The Green Party is calling for the government to test every house built on an old horticultural site. Without proper investigation beforehand, such testing could be enormously costly to the tax and ratepayer, and not yield any useful information."

The minister confirmed that advice from health officials and her own reading indicated the immediate health risk was low but people should still obey normal hygiene and food preparation practices.
