Sport and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard congratulated the parliamentary press gallery today for narrowly beating Labour MPs in the week-long challenge leading up to Push Play Day tomorrow (Friday November 5).

"I think both the journalists and my team colleagues will agree that we all feel a lot healthier, although maybe just a little stiff, after putting in such a huge effort over the past week in the interests of highlighting the benefits of doing physical activity," Trevor Mallard said.

"Today is Push Play Day and I'd like to encourage everyone to give it a go. There are activities on all over New Zealand.

"Evidence shows that healthy adults should aim to take at least 10,000 steps a day. Experts also recommend that we do a minimum of 30 minutes moderate-intensity physical activity each day (this may be part of or in addition to the 10,000 steps).

"The press gallery made a great start to the pedometer stepping challenge and poured it on in the first two days to gain an early lead of well over 40,000 steps. But while the MPs may have had a slow start we certainly finished strongly by out-stepping the journos on the last two days of the challenge. We've been taking stairs instead of lifts, walking instead of driving to meetings, and even having walking meetings.

"With the final steps tallied, the difference in the total number of steps was less than 15,000.

"The final team totals in the inaugural Labour MPs versus the Press Gallery are: MPs - 697,676 steps and the press gallery 712,649 steps."

Other results are:  
Top score overall is Barry Soper with 135,619 steps  
Top scorer in each team:  
Labour MPs: Trevor Mallard with 124,777 steps. Second was Ann Hartley on 123,700.  
Press Gallery: Barry Soper with 135,619 steps. Second was Guyon Espiner on 117,218.  
Most step taken on one day: Damien O'Connor with 26,931 steps recorded yesterday
