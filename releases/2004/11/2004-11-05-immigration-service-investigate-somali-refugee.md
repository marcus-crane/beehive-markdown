Immigration Minister Paul Swain has asked the Immigration Service to investigate the case of Somali refugee Asha Ali Abdille.

"I am concerned that this person now says she has criminal convictions. The investigation will establish the facts of her case and the service will give me a preliminary report by the end of next week."
