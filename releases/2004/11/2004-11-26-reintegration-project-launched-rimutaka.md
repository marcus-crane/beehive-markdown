Corrections Minister Paul Swain today launched a project to lower inmate reoffending that will be used a model for a nation-wide rollout of the scheme.

"Since 1999 the government has introduced tougher sentencing, bail and parole laws, which have seen inmate numbers increase. But the fact that more than a quarter of released inmates return to prison within a year shows this is not the whole answer and we need to do more. If we can reduce this to 20 per cent, that would mean about 350 people not returning to prison a year – that's the capacity of one new prison.

"What happens to inmates when they walk out the prison gates has a huge bearing on whether they successfully rejoin the community or fall into their life of crime again," Paul Swain said.

"The Corrections Department spends more than $9 million a year on reintegration and there is a lot of good work already being done to help inmates reintegrate into the community but these efforts lack coordination. That is why the project I am launching today is an important step forward."

A new position - a reintegration coordinator - has been created to work alongside key agencies and services such as WINZ, Housing, employer organisations, Corrections, PARS and community groups such as Te Hikoi at Orongomai Marae to make sure services are in place prior to an offenders release.

Offenders with the greatest needs will be identified as part of their assessment and sentencing planning. Those offenders who need assistance with housing, employment and other intervention or support services, who also have a high risk of reoffending will be targeted.

In the last year over 1,000 people were released from the three Wellington prisons with 40 per cent released within the Wellington region.

The project aims to work with up to 20 offenders per month (240 per year) addressing their needs, planning for their release and supporting them as they re-establish themselves in the community.

Dedicated reintegration workers will also be appointed early next year at Arohata women's prison and the youth offender unit at Waikeria Unit.

“These projects are designed to reduce the steady stream of people heading back to prison. Achieving this is good for victims, inmates, the community and taxpayers. My aim is to have this scheme replicated throughout the country."
