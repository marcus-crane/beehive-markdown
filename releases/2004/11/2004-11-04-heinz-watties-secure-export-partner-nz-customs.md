The New Zealand Customs Service and Heinz Wattie’s have signed a Secure Export Partnership Agreement that will see Heinz Wattie's on the front foot for security clearance for international trade.

General Manager, New Zealand Supply Chain for Heinz Wattie’s Max Birt said Heinz Wattie’s valued any initiative that improved its ability to get its export food products delivered to retail customers and into the hands of their consumers.

“The investment we have made in ‘proving’ our on-site security systems to become an export partner of NZ Customs will benefit not only ourselves but our retail customers," he said, “heightened focus on security issues internationally has the potential to disrupt export flows. We see the Secure Exports Partnership enhancing our ability to get goods to customers on time, and with a minimum of fuss."

Heinz Wattie’s is one of New Zealand's top 200 exporters, exporting approximately $225 million worth of goods each year. Mr Birt says this agreement brings the potential for gaining new business, as its partnership status would make Heinz Wattie’s more attractive as a supplier who can deliver on time.

This supply chain strategy forms the basis of an arrangement announced by the Prime Minister in October between the United States and New Zealand Customs Administrations. Customs Minister Rick Barker says that whilst the US agreement is the first, he expects many more will follow.

At the signing of the agreement today, Customs Minister Rick Barker said trade is the lifeblood of New Zealand's economy and the reality of the current international climate is that for the foreseeable future, security will be an integral part of trade facilitation.

"The supply chain security strategy will also form the basis of NZ Customs’ endeavours in international arenas such as APEC and World Customs Organisation to influence the development of international standards to secure global trade," said Rick Barker.

"Heinz Watties are an outstanding local company at the forefront of new ideas and technologies. They've made a smart move. Should trade be disrupted at times of heightened security, goods known to be secure will continue to move, while unsecure goods face the real prospect of staying put until their status is determined, " he added.

From 1 December the US and NZ Customs agencies will work closely together using joint intelligence information to screen all trader and shipper declarations. The Customs supply chain security strategy has four elements: Accurate advance electronic information, intelligence based risk assessment, examination of cargo identified as potential risk, and voluntary agreements to reduce risk through the Secure Exports Partnership programme.
