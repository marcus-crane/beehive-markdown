Rau rangatira maa,

\[Distinguished guests, greetings to you gathered here for this purpose today. Greetings once, twice, three times to you all.]

Good afternoon and thank you for the opportunity to be part of today’s launch. I bring greetings from my colleague, Sports and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard, who apologises for not being here today.

As a keen outdoors person, with a great passion for kayaking and tramping, it’s a pleasure to be part of this event. Even in a small event like this, careful preparation and close attention to risk management promote success and safety, as we have seen today.

New Zealanders like being active. From archery to yachting, over a million New Zealanders belong to the clubs of over 70 national sporting organisations. Many more take part at a casual level in leisure and sports activities. It is estimated at least 90 per cent of us play sport and/or enjoy other leisure activities every month.

The risk of sports injury is very real. Last year alone, ACC managed around 212,000 sports injury claims, with 22,500 considered moderate to serious. They cost a total of $183 million.

Developing a safety culture is especially crucial when people are organising activities for others. In the sport and recreation sector, risk of injury can arise from a number of causes such as poor coaching methods, poorly maintained venues and equipment, inadequately trained marshals and officials, and insufficient planning.

Club and event organisers have a special responsibility to take reasonable steps to ensure the safety of participants, spectators and officials.

The guidelines  
These guidelines are designed to assist everyone involved in the governance, management or delivery of sport and/or recreation events and programmes.

The guidelines were developed by a Standards New Zealand committee made up of representatives from ACC, the Australia/New Zealand Sports Law Association, Department of Labour, OSH, Ministry of Education, New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, Outdoors New Zealand, Sport and Recreation New Zealand, Water Safety New Zealand, and the New Zealand Recreation Association.

Such a partnership of key stakeholders in the community and government sectors holds the key to effective injury prevention. I congratulate all of you on your close and effective co-operation.

It is possible to foster a safety culture without sacrificing our love of action and adventure. I am confident these guidelines will contribute greatly towards a safety culture New Zealand-wide and I am sure they will be welcomed by hundreds of groups throughout New Zealand, from the tiniest rural sports club to the most internationally competitive organisation.

Thank you.
