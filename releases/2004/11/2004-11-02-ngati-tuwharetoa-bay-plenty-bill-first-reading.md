The Ngäti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) Claims Settlement Bill will have its first reading in Parliament today.

The bill settles the iwi’s historical Treaty of Waitangi claims. It is the second Bay of Plenty Treaty claims bill to be introduced to parliament, following the introduction of the Ngäti Awa Claims Settlement Bill in August.

“Ngäti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) was significantly affected by the confiscation of 87,000 acres of land in 1866," Treaty Negotiations Minister Margaret Wilson said.

“Ngäti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) suffered confiscation of a significant part of their rohe and, eventually, became virtually landless. This loss of land reduced the iwi's access to traditional sources of food, medicine and shelter.

"The settlement with Ngäti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) helps address historical grievances under the Treaty of Waitangi in the region.

"New Zealanders can be proud that such grievances are being recognised, and settled peacefully. They strengthen the relationship between the Crown and Ngäti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) and lay the foundations for us to build a strong and confident nation. The honour of the Crown is restored through Treaty settlements, and longstanding grievances put behind us.”

Ngäti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty), also known as Ngäti Tuwharetoa ki Kawerau, has about 3000 members, and is centred in the Kawerau and Matatä area. The settlement includes a Crown apology for breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles; cultural redress including the transfer of five sites of significance to Ngäti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty); and a combination of cash and Crown-owned land worth $10.5 million.

When passed, the Ngäti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) Claims Settlement Bill will provide for the transfer of settlement assets as agreed in the 2003 Deed of Settlement. It will also finalise Ngäti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty)’s historical Treaty of Waitangi claims.

The bill will be referred to the Maori Affairs Select Committee for consideration. The committee will report back to the House by 1 March 2005.
