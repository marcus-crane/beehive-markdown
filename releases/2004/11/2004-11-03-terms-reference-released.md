Former High Court Judge, Hon David Morris has begun work on the Ministerial Review into allegations of abuse at the Regular Force Cadet School at Waiouru.

Defence Minister Mark Burton says that all claims and views raised by former cadets will be evaluated in context, and investigated in a neutral manner.

“We want to ensure that former cadets and their families who have concerns can air them and be listened to. I encourage anyone who has not yet done so to either ring freephone 0800 222 044 or email mburton@ministers.govt.nz

“Details of all those who have already contacted my office or the Defence Force will be transferred to Mr Morris, who will contact them directly.”

David Morris will present his report and any appropriate recommendations to the Defence Minister by 31 March 2005.
