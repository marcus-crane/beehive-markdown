The announcement that work is to commence on the 8.5km Northern Busway from Constellation Drive to the Auckland Harbour Bridge, part of a $290 million project to improve bus services in Auckland, was welcomed today by Associate Minister of Transport and Minister for Auckland Issues, Judith Tizard.

"After 15 years on the drawing board, I am delighted that this project is finally underway. This is an important milestone in providing Auckland with the responsive and sustainable transport system it needs.

"When completed the Northern Busway, along with other projects underway, will provide a free-flowing link from the North Shore to Auckland City and Britomart, making public transport a much more attractive option for Auckland's commuters."

Judith Tizard says improvements to public transport, for bus and rail, are a key focus of the government's $1.62 billion funding package for Auckland transport along with new roads that are better linked.

"This government recognises that public transport needs to be part of the solution to Auckland's transport problems. Improving bus services, and linking them with the rail system, will help make our existing transport networks work more efficiently and in a more environmentally friendly way".

Judith Tizard says the government's funding for Auckland public transport is more than three times what it was in 1999 ($20 million in 1998/99 to $73 million in 2004/05).

"The results of this government's additional investment in public transport are already evident. Bus patronage in Auckland has increased from 35.4 million trips in 2000 to 46 million in 2003, an increase of over 30%. This project will provide further incentives for people to get out of their cars and on to public transport."
