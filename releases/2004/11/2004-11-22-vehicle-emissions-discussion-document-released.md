A [discussion document](http://www.transport.govt.nz/business/multimodal/environment/air-quality/programme-discussion/index.php) on the proposed shape of the New Zealand vehicle emissions screening programme was released today by Associate Minister of Transport, Judith Tizard.

“The discussion document is an important part of the government’s commitment to ensure the emissions screening programme is fair, equitable, and does not unduly penalise the vast majority of responsible vehicle owners,” says Judith Tizard.

“This government is committed to tackling the health and environmental impacts associated with vehicle exhaust emissions in New Zealand. We know poor vehicle emissions contribute to poor air quality, and that this can be a significant cause of health problems, including asthma, heart disease, and bronchitis.”

Last year, in response to concerns about declining air quality associated with vehicle-exhaust emissions, the Government, with the support of the Greens, announced a range of new fuel and emissions standards, including plans to introduce mandatory emissions screening from mid 2006.

“Emissions screening will target the very worst polluting vehicles and will cut overall vehicle emissions by ensuring high emitting vehicles are repaired or retired from the fleet. It is estimated that 10 percent of vehicles are responsible for between 40 and 50 percent of vehicle pollutants.”

The discussion document outlines the proposed framework of the emissions screening programme, which builds on the existing entry certification and in-service vehicle inspection (Warrant of Fitness and Certificate of Fitness) regimes. Issues such as emissions screening methods, the vehicles to be screened and the frequency of testing are discussed and comment is sought.

The discussion document will assist the further development of the screening programme by identifying the issues likely to be faced by the vehicle industry and vehicle owners. Comment received, together with the results of a vehicle emissions pilot testing programme and a social impact assessment, both underway, will feed into the development of a draft Land Transport Rule, which will go out for further consultation next year.

The document is available from the [Ministry of Transport](http://www.transport.govt.nz/business/multimodal/environment/air-quality/programme-discussion/index.php), phone (04) 472 1253 or email [emissions@transport.govt.nz](mailto:emissions@transport.govt.nz).

**Questions & Answers**  
**VEHICLE EMISSIONS POLICY**

**November 2004**

**1. What are vehicle emissions?**

Vehicles produce different types of emissions. These include noise, exhaust tailpipe emissions from the combustion of fuel in the engine after any subsequent exhaust system treatment, vapour emissions from the fuel and oil, oil from leaks, and dust particles from the wear of brakes, clutches and tyres.

These new vehicle emissions policy initiatives are designed to address the air quality related vehicle exhaust emissions such as carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons and particulates, and the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.

**2. Why are vehicle emissions a problem?**  
Vehicle exhaust emissions are a significant contributor to local air pollution. Other contributors include domestic fires and industry. Exceedances of the New Zealand ambient air quality guidelines and international standards are regular in many urban areas, including regional centres.

Local air pollution from motor vehicles are a significant source of health problems, including asthma, heart disease and bronchitis and hospitalisations for respiratory problems. Recent research1 estimates that about 400 premature deaths occur each year as a result of motor vehicle emissions. This problem is nationwide but worse in urban centres with high traffic rates and congestion where a large segment of the population are exposed to air pollution.

Local air pollution also results in poor visibility, including smog and haze and erosion of building surfaces.

Vehicle exhaust emissions are also a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. The domestic transport sector accounts for 45% of all CO2 emissions. Road transport is responsible for 89% of these total transport emissions and has increased an average of 4% per annum since 1990.

**3. What are the vehicle emissions policy initiatives announced?**  
The Associate Minister of Transport, Hon Judith Tizard announced initiatives in 2003 to address the environmental and health impacts of vehicle exhaust emissions.

The vehicle emissions policy package includes:

- Emissions screening of pre-used imported vehicles at the New Zealand border to ensure minimum emissions performance before entry to the fleet;
- Emissions screening of in-service vehicles regularly during their life on the road as part of Warrant of Fitness or Certificate of Fitness inspections;
- Education of vehicle users on the need for, and benefits of, vehicle maintenance.  
  Minimum emission performance requirements will be established for all vehicles based on the vehicle age and class.

A vehicle emissions pilot testing programme is underway that will provide detailed information to help develop emission performance requirements and determine appropriate screening test processes. It will also contribute to an assessment of the potential social impacts of the in-service emissions screening initiative.

**4. How does this vehicle emissions policy fit with the Government's broader objectives?**  
These vehicle emissions initiatives are consistent with the objectives of the New Zealand Transport Strategy in particular giving effect to the objectives of protecting and promoting public health and ensuring environmental sustainability. They also contribute to the Government's Climate Change Programme and the Sustainable Development Programme of Action.

**5. What is the timeframe for implementing the vehicle emissions policy initiatives?**  
A Land Transport Rule needs to be developed to enable emissions screening of imported used vehicles, and of the in-service fleet. This will take at least 18 months to 2 years, primarily due to public consultation requirements. Following this a 6 to 12 month period will be necessary to allow industry to set-up equipment and undertake training.

Public education campaigns will occur in the period before emission screening becomes compulsory. Compulsory emissions screening at the border and as part of the Warrant or Certificate of Fitness are expected to be implemented from mid to late 2006.

**6. Does New Zealand have existing vehicle emissions legislation?**  
Until 2003 there were no specific legal requirements setting out vehicle emissions standards in New Zealand transport law.

The Minister of Transport signed the Land Transport Vehicle Exhaust Emission Rule 2003 (33001), and it came into force from 1 January 2004 for light vehicles and from 2006 for heavy vehicles. It requires all vehicles entering New Zealand to be manufactured to an approved emissions standard from the United States, Europe, Japan or Australia. The new rule provides a foundation for further measures, such as emissions screening and public education, to reduce vehicle emissions and the associated impact on air quality, greenhouse gas emissions and adverse health impacts.

More information on this is available and can be found at the following website [www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node/17870]()

**7. If there is a rule for vehicle emission standards why are these further initiatives needed?**  
Despite the majority of vehicles entering the New Zealand fleet being built to an accepted international emissions standard, and this becoming a compliance condition of entry to the fleet from 1 January 2004, there is no certainty that used imported vehicles have not deteriorated to such an extent that they are entering New Zealand as 'gross' polluting vehicles, or that originally required emission control equipment, such as catalytic converters, has not been removed.

Vehicles already in the New Zealand fleet may also deteriorate due to a lack of maintenance or due to tampering with fuel systems or emission control equipment. This can also result in vehicles becoming gross polluters. The average age of the New Zealand vehicle fleet is 12 years, therefore there is significant scope to improve the emissions performance of vehicles throughout their service life by identifying those vehicles that are gross polluters and ensuring they are repaired. A 2003 study by the Auckland Regional Council and the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) demonstrated this. The remote sensing methods used identified that the most polluting 10% of vehicles were responsible for between 40 to 50% of the vehicle pollutants. High emission levels were associated with greater vehicle age and kilometres travelled. Addressing this 10% will bring about considerable reductions in emissions2.

**8. Who should be interested in the vehicle emissions policy?**  
Anyone who:

- imports vehicles into New Zealand;
- owns and/or operates a vehicle, or is planning to purchase a vehicle;
- repairs, tunes or maintains a vehicle, such as mechanics and "do-it-yourself" mechanics;
- is concerned about the environment, particularly air quality, greenhouse gases and health impacts from air pollution.

**9. What are the benefits from the vehicle emissions policy?**  
The benefits of reduced vehicle emissions will include improvements to local air quality, a reduction in premature deaths and morbidity due to air pollution, reduced fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (CO2) emissions.

All vehicle owners will benefit in the long term from their vehicle being regularly maintained and the resulting savings in fuel consumption and frequency of major repairs.

**10. What class of vehicle will be affected?**  
Both light and heavy vehicles that operate on petrol or diesel will be screened for emissions. Border screening will focus on used imported vehicles as some of these vehicles may have deteriorated to an unacceptable level since they were manufactured. All vehicles already in the New Zealand fleet will also be screened on a regular basis as part of the existing Warrant/Certificate of Fitness (WoF/CoF) system.

The inclusion of vehicles using alternative fuels such as CNG and LPG will be considered as part of the rule development process.

**11. How will emissions performance be checked?**  
The intentions of the vehicle emissions screening initiatives are to identify gross polluting vehicles and to ensure they are repaired to meet a minimum acceptable emissions performance requirements appropriate for that type of vehicle, based on its age, the engine technology and the fuel used..

Emissions screening checks will be included as part of the current Warrant of Fitness and Certificate of Fitness system, and the existing vehicle certification required for used imported vehicles. Details of the emissions screening procedures will be investigated as part of the rule development process.

The time required for emissions screening, and the likely cost to motor vehicle owners depends on the type of screening test adopted. This will be investigated further as part of the development of the screening initiatives.

**12. What will happen if a vehicle fails the emissions screening test?**  
Any vehicle failing the emissions screening test, either at a border certification inspection, or as part of a Warrant or Certificate of Fitness, would need to be repaired and then retested. . A small number of vehicles would not be able to be cost-effectively repaired and would need to be removed from the road.

The type and cost of repairs likely to be needed by different vehicle classes will be investigated further during the vehicle emissions pilot testing programme.

**As a vehicle owner am I required to change anything yet?**  
You can improve the way you look after your car and save on fuel bills. Get into good vehicle maintenance habits now. If you regularly tune your vehicle and repair it when necessary, you will breathe easier and may save money on fuel and long-term maintenance costs.

It is never too early to reduce vehicle emissions.

Public education campaigns will allow time for vehicle owners to ensure their vehicles are well maintained and operating as cleanly and efficiently as possible before the introduction of compulsory emissions screening.

**13. How can I do my part to reduce vehicle emissions?**  
You can do a lot just by keeping your vehicle tuned and fixing it when it needs it. You can also do a lot by trying to be a more efficient driver. For example, by not using your vehicle during times of high traffic congestion, you can reduce both the amount of fuel used and the amount of exhaust emissions created.

Exhaust emissions can be decreased by:

- Better maintaining your vehicle
- Where practical, switching to using cleaner, lower emitting or emission-free fuels
- Using low emission engines (built to modern emission standards) and vehicles fitted with efficient emissions control equipment (such as catalytic converters and particulate traps on vehicle exhaust pipes)
- Using transport alternatives, especially in urban areas where buses and trains are available. Consider walking or cycling for short journeys.
- Using your vehicle at off-peak times.

**How are these vehicle emissions screening initiatives different to the smoky vehicle rule?**

Many vehicle exhaust emissions are invisible, but affect air quality and have health impacts. Smoky vehicles are only one part of the problem of polluting vehicles.

These vehicle emissions screening initiatives and public education target those vehicles that are gross polluting vehicles, but that are harder to spot because the emissions are not visible to the human eye. The existing smoky vehicle 10-second rule provided by Traffic Regulations will continue to apply.

**14. What will happen now?**  
Details of the emissions screening initiatives for used imported vehicles and in-service vehicles will be developed further. The vehicle emissions pilot testing programme will gather further detailed information of the emissions performance and profile of the New Zealand vehicle fleet and will contribute to the development of emissions performance requirements.

A Land Transport Rule needs to be developed to implement the screening programme for used imported vehicles as they enter New Zealand and for in-service vehicles as part of the WoF/CoF system.

There are likely to be at least two stages in the rule development process, outlining these initiatives in more detail.

A discussion paper has been prepared and was released for public consultation in November 2004. The purpose of this document is to outline the preliminary proposals for the vehicle emissions screening programme. Feedback on the proposals in the document will contribute to the development and design of the screening programme. The discussion document is available on the Ministry of Transport’s website.

People will get another formal opportunity to comment on the proposals when the public (yellow) consultation draft of the Land Transport Rule is released, which is scheduled for 2005.
