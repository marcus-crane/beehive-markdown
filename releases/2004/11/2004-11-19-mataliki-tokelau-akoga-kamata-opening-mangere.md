The Associate Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, Hon Taito Phillip Field, opened Mataliki Tokelau Akoga Kamata new premises today in Mangere.

Taito Field said that he was very happy to open the expanded pre school as this allows the Tokelauan community to continue to promote the growth of their language to future generations as 80% of the Tokelauan population (6000) now reside in New Zealand with the remainder (1500) left in Tokelau.

Taito Field says "this is in line with Governments commitment to promoting the vulnerable languages of the Pacific in particular, Tokelau, Niue and Cook Islands who are all New Zealand territories, which is also in line with government's commitment to giving children a good start by way of early childhood education"

Currently Pacific communities early childhood participation levels are 10% below children of other ethnicities in New Zealand.

Taito Field visited Tokelau last November to sign the Principles of Partnership with Tokelau and with the Prime Minister visiting Tokelau after the Pacific forum this year, Taito Field says that "this strengthens the relationship that this Government has with the Tokelauan community, both in Tokelau and in New Zealand"
