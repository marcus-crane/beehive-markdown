The Minister of Mâori Affairs, Hon Parekura Horomia, announced today the appointment of a former Minister of Mâori Affairs, the Hon Doug Kidd, to the Waitangi Tribunal.

Mr Horomia said that Mr Kidd’s parliamentary career, including his former position of Minister of Mâori Affairs and his membership on the Mâori Affairs Select Committee would make him an ideal member of the Tribunal.

“Mr Kidd was the Minister of Mâori Affairs when Te Ture Whenua Mâori Act was enacted, and acted as joint negotiator for the Crown to secure the 1992 Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Claim Settlement. He has also practiced as a Barrister and Solicitor, including in the Mâori Land Law area”.

“His skills will complement the academic, historian and tikanga skills already on the Tribunal,” said Mr Horomia.

Mr Horomia also announced the reappointment of three members: Dame Margaret Bazley, Professor Wharehuia Milroy, and Dr Ann Parsonson. All three have been appointed for a further three year term.

Mr Horomia said that in welcoming Mr Kidd’s appointment and the three reappointments it was also appropriate to acknowledge the Hon Dr Michael Bassett, a valued Member of the Tribunal who would not be renewing his term.

Dr Bassett has been an active Member of the Tribunal since 1994. In this period he sat on the Ngâti Maniapoto/Ngâti Tama Settlement Cross Claims, Kiwifruit Marketing, Tauranga Moana, and Kaipara Tribunal inquiries.

“I wish Dr Bassett well in his future endeavours,” said Mr Horomia.
