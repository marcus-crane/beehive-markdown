A kayak race between ACC Minister Ruth Dyson and a team from SPARC launched the new Guidelines for Risk Management in Sport and Recreation with a splash today.

Developed by Standards New Zealand in association with SPARC and ACC, the guidelines are designed to promote good risk management practices in sporting and recreation organisations, from strategic and operational management to planning and delivering events.

ACC Minister Ruth Dyson and Olympic kayaking legend Ian Ferguson took on SPARC chief executive Nick Hill and trans-Atlantic rower Jude Ellis in a battle of paddles in Wellington harbour.

"Even in a small event like this, careful preparation and close attention to risk management promote success and safety," Ruth Dyson said.

"The guidelines provides tools and examples to help groups at all levels in the sport and recreation sector to understand and implement risk management in every aspect of their work.”

Sport and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard welcomed the new guidelines.

"While it is difficult to eliminate risk totally, the possibility of injuries can be minimised through sound planning. I encourage anyone involved in sport and recreation planning to get a copy of the guidelines and create a safer environment for their participants.”

The guidelines have been designed for everyone involved in the governance, management or delivery of sport and recreation events and programmes. They include examples, tools, and templates, as well as an overview of the legal requirements of the sector.

The guidelines can be obtained at www.standards.co.nz. Media requiring a copy of the guidelines should contact Anne Kernahan, Standards New Zealand, phone (04) 498 3986, email anne.kernahan@standards.co.nz.
