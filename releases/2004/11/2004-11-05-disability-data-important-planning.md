The most comprehensive report ever to look at people with disability in New Zealand will provide invaluable information for planning and policy development, Disability Issues Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

Releasing the 450-page report, Living With Disability In New Zealand - A Descriptive Analysis, Ms Dyson said it was an important resource for all people with an interest in disability-related issues.

The report is based on two surveys carried out by Statistics New Zealand in 2001.  
The first examined the living arrangements and activities of around 7200 adults and children with disability living in households. The second gathered information from around 900 disabled adults living in institutions such as rest homes and hospitals. Similar surveys were first conducted after the 1996 census.

“Living with Disability in New Zealand provides the most comprehensive data ever collected about the 22 per cent of adults and 11 per cent of children in this countrywho have a disability. The government’s commitment to fund a third and fourth survey after the census in 2006 and 2011 will further add to our knowledge base, and help us find the best ways to meet the needs of this group of New Zealanders.”

The report looks at the day-to-day lives of people with disability, including their access to education, employment and income, travel, transport and housing. It explores support services and patterns of disability across a range of ethnic groups, including Maori and Pacific peoples, and looks at whether people are receiving the assistance they feel they need. A large number of statistical graphs and tables are included.

The report was developed by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with government and non-government organisations including the Office for Disability Issues, Ministries of Social Development and Education, Housing New Zealand, Labour Department, ACC, Statistics NZ, Royal NZ Foundation of the Blind and DPA.

The full report can be found on the Ministry of Health website www.moh.govt.nz. A shortened version in hard copy and alternative formats will be available by the end of the year.
