Courts Minister Rick Barker has today called for a 'ground-up' rebuild of New Zealand's infringement regime, which he says is not working as effectively as it could.

Mr Barker says the infringements 'system', which started 35 years ago to issue and collect parking tickets, and now used by 100 different prosecuting authorities, has "grown like topsy" and is getting out of hand and unmanageable.

"The system is old and creaky and not achieving a quick response to infringements. It needs a thorough overhaul - to examine process, structure and issues with a view to making it more credible, simple and fair," said Rick Barker.

At this morning's press conference the Minister launched the discussion paper Review of the Infringement System – Options for Reform. Mr Barker says factors of particular interest in this review include the complex structure of administration, the long timeframes and the many steps involved in issuing infringement fines, treatment of those unable to pay fines, and the impact of recidivist defaulters.

"As there's only a 40% likelihood of a City Council, for example, getting the offender to pay a fine direct to them, it seems obvious it is time to do a system tidy up.

"I am asking issuing authorities to work with the Ministry of Justice to find solutions to questions such as; the best way to collect fines, whether there should be a way to intervene early when an individual is starting to clock up several fines, and whether there could be easier ways to pay such as by instalment.

" A few high profile cases lately of individuals letting their fines spiral out of control begs the question of whether we need a better overview of an individuals circumstances to avoid this and also alert authorities that an individual may have a problem with living within the law.

" These type of questions could led to solutions like vehicle confiscations, case by case management of offenders, easier ways to pay and ultimately a more under control and simpler system.

"I am hearing of frustration from all corners. Sometimes the fines mount up so fast the offender also feels they just can’t face it, so bury their head in the sand. I want a new model that has oversight and manages the process more easily for everybody, said Mr Barker.The discussion paper is the result of a year-long working partnership between the Ministry of Justice, Law Commission and other agencies involved in administering infringements and will be available on www.justice.govt.nz.

The discussion paper will be the subject of workshops held by the Ministry of Justice with those parties involved in the policy work to date. Public comment on the paper needs to be submitted by 24th December 2004. The Ministry of Justice will collate and consider submissions and consult on the first iteration of new system in March 2005, with a final set of recommendations being given to Ministers in June 2005.
