What helps an ambulance make it to your door in time? Or in a disaster, that emergency and civil defence services are working with the same location information? What database records that you officially own your own home?  
Acting Land Information Minister Paul Swain today released a discussion document about geospatial information, which underpins all these factors.  
“Geospatial information provides detail on physical locations. In a crisis, emergency response agencies rely on it to find the location of incidents and access routes to them. The quality and coordination of that information translates into timely responses and saving lives.  
“Up to 80 percent of government information has a geospatial component, but we face some major challenges, such as better coordination of our geospatial resources, avoiding duplicating efforts, and better sharing of information across government.”  
The discussion document by Land Information New Zealand is a timely opportunity to deal with these challenges and seek your views on the Government’s future role in managing geospatial information.  
It also sets out the key elements of a strategy for government that will help Government make the most of its information and the technological advances coming through all the time. The strategy is expected to be delivered early next year.  
"Geospatial information’ may not be an everyday term for many kiwis but it’s the information behind emergency services responses, disaster management, land title management, defence planning and counter-terrorism activities, resolution of claims under the Treaty of Waitangi, and navigation. And more," Paul Swain said.  
Central and local government and Crown entities are the three main providers of geospatial information and spend an estimated $100 million a year collecting, buying, maintaining and using it.  
“The development of an effective strategy depends on the involvement and commitment of all stakeholders." The discussion document is available at [www.linz.govt.nz/geospatial](http://www.linz.govt.nz/geospatial) .
