Background

The Human Right Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) was established under the Human Rights Act 1993 (the Act) and comprises a Chairperson and a panel of up to 20 persons, two of whom are appointed for each hearing.

Formerly named the Complaints Review Tribunal, the Tribunal hears and determines proceedings lodged pursuant to the Human Rights Act, the Privacy Act 1993 and the Health and Disability Code 1996 after complaints have first been made to the Human Rights Commission (in respect of matters under the Human Rights Act), or investigated by the Privacy Commissioner or the Health and Disability Commissioner. The principal matters considered by the Tribunal concern privacy, sexual harassment, race relations and issues about discrimination in the provision of goods and services, advertising, housing and accommodation. The Tribunal also has jurisdiction to deal with cases in which it is alleged that legislation is or may be contrary to the Bill of Rights Act.

Members are appointed to the panel by the Minister of Justice for a period of 5 years and may be reappointed.

In considering the suitability of people for inclusion on the Panel the legislation requires the Minister to have regard to the need for the Panel to comprise members who between them have knowledge of, or experience in:

·Different aspects of matters likely to come before the Tribunal;  
·New Zealand law, or the law of another country, or international law, on human rights;  
·Public administration, or the law relating to public administration;  
·Current economic, employment, or social issues; and  
·Cultural issues and the needs and aspirations (including life experiences) of different communities of interest and population groups in New Zealand society.
