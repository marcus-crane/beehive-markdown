The national roll out of forums on P, alcohol and other drugs commenced by Associate Health Minister Jim Anderton in June continues this week with a public meeting in Morrinsville on Thursday.

“I have chaired meetings in communities as diverse as Tauranga, Manukau and Waitakere and the feedback I am getting is that they are useful events for communities, community workers and for local and central government politicians and officials.

"I would encourage anyone with an interest in promoting a safer community in Morrinsville to turn up, share your ideas and ask questions of the panel of experts from different agencies," the Progressive leader said.

Jim Anderton will chair the public meeting in Morrinsville on Thursday and further meetings around the country, the details of which will be released as finalized.

"I will be leading a panel at each forum consisting of agency representatives to outline the “whole-of-government” approach to tackling drug and alcohol problems. Alcohol abuse is New Zealand’s biggest single drug problem, and there are concerns about the abuse of both legal substances as well as illegal drugs like P," Jim Anderton said.

The public meetings aim to inform the public on what is being done to secure our borders, how the police are working to enforce the law in the drugs and alcohol area, what prevention strategies can be used in communities particularly focusing on the Community Action Youth and Drugs programmes, the public health approaches and treatment availability.

The forums will be scheduled, for the most part, in locations where there is a Community Action on Youth Alcohol & Drug programme in place. There is currently a CAYAD programme in Morrinsville/Huntly.

Venue and format

The forum on Thursday 18 November will be held in the upstairs conference room, Westpac Trust Events Centre (off Moorhouse Street), Morrinsville.

The forum starts at 7.30 p.m.

The Associate Health Minister begins the evening with a discussion about the commitment of the coalition government to addressing alcohol and drug issues.

Following that, panelists provide an overview of the work their agency is undertaking to address issues.

The Minister then chairs an open session where questions are taken from the floor.

John Bailey, Student Support Development Officer, Ministry of Education  
Murray Hunt, Clinical Director of the Community Alcohol and Drug Service (CADS), Waikato District Health Board
