Commerce Minister Margaret Wilson today announced a review of Commerce Commission fees.

A discussion document on the review has been released today and relates to fees charged for authorisations and clearances under the Commerce Act. Those seeking clearance or authorisation of potentially anti-competitive practices pay fees to the Commerce Commission to have their applications heard.

“This is the first time the fees have been reviewed since their establishment in 1990," Margaret Wilson said. "There is now almost always a substantial discrepancy between fees charged and the actual cost incurred by the Commerce Commission.

“The key issue is how the burden of funding for these applications should be shared between private users and the Crown. We need to balance taxpayer funding with what those who benefit privately pay, while ensuring an accessible clearance/authorisation regime.

"Commerce Commission authorisations and clearances provide a way for businesses to establish whether proposed arrangements comply with the Commerce Act, without attracting liability. Setting fees at an appropriate, non-deterring level helps us provide a robust competition regime."

The Ministry of Economic Development will consider submissions before making recommendations to the government on any possible legislative reform.

The discussion paper is available online from the [Ministry of Economic Development](http://www.med.govt.nz/buslt/bus_pol/competition/fees/)
