Associate Communications Minister David Cunliffe today announced a process for allowing commercial satellite operators to access New Zealand satellite opportunities.

"Under international treaties New Zealand has rights to use certain frequency bands and to apply to coordinate satellites. The government needs to have fair, transparent and equitable policies in place to allow those rights to be exercised in the national interest." said David Cunliffe.

"Previously satellite networks covering New Zealand have been developed through other countries but there may now be commercial interest in establishing a satellite through New Zealand." said Mr Cunliffe.

The process provides for assessment and approval of applications according to acceptable work programme offers, which would result in an agreement with successful applicants.

The agreement will specify milestones and a basis for Crown agencies to negotiate access to the satellite to meet specific policy objectives. The process will be implemented by the Ministry of Economic Development."

The satellite policy is detailed on the Ministry of Economic Development's website at [http://www.med.govt.nz/rsm/spp/satellite/index.html](http://www.med.govt.nz/rsm/spp/satellite/index.html).
