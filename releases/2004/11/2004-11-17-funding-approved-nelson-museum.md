The Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark today announced final approval for the grant of $1.177 million (GST incl) to the Tasman Bays Heritage Trust for the redevelopment of the Nelson Provincial Museum.

This funding received conditional approval in May, under the government’s Regional Museums Policy for Capital Construction Projects.

“I am pleased to announce that the Trust has met the conditions of the grant, and we are now able to go ahead with funding assistance for the relocation and redevelopment of the Nelson Provincial Museum,” said Helen Clark.

“The redevelopment of the museum in Nelson is a collaborative project, with funding provided by central and local government as well as the Trust, which has also committed to a fundraising programme.

"The proposed development is an exciting cultural initiative. It will have a positive impact on the region's economy through increasing tourism, while also helping to preserve important aspects of Nelson's heritage.

“While primary responsibility for regional museums rests with their communities, the government wants to ensure that nationally significant museum collections are adequately housed and continue to be accessible to the public. That is why we make support available for significant capital construction projects such as this.

“The Tasman Bays Heritage Trust has also undertaken to address long term storage issues for its nationally significant collection, which was a concern when the funding was conditionally approved earlier in the year,” said Helen Clark.
