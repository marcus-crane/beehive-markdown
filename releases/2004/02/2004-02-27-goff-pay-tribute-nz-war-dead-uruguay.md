Foreign Minister Phil Goff will lay a wreath in Montevideo, Uruguay, tomorrow (approx 9.30am Saturday NZT), commemorating the role of New Zealand sailors in one of the Second World War’s best-known naval engagements.

HMS Achilles (as she was then known), a light cruiser, played a central role in the Battle of the River Plate, which led to the scuttling of the German pocket battleship Graf Spee in the river's estuary in December 1939.

“Despite being heavily outgunned, the Achilles, along with the HMS Exeter and HMS Ajax, took on the German raider and drove it into the neutral harbour of Montevideo, where it was later scuttled by its captain,” Mr Goff said.

“The Graf Spee built up a fearsome reputation by sinking many Allied merchant vessels in the opening months of the war, and its loss was an early blow to the German war effort. A New Zealand ship with a large number of New Zealand sailors played a crucial part and I want to pay my respects to those who did not return.”

Four sailors from the Achilles were killed in the battle, two of them New Zealanders whose bodies were never identified. Mr Goff will lay his wreath at a British war cemetery in Montevideo where the remains of three sailors, one of them very probably a New Zealander, are buried beneath a single headstone.

The next day (early Sunday afternoon NZT) Mr Goff will view the point off Punta del Este where the battle took place, and work is now beginning on a bid to salvage the Graf Spee.

Mr Goff is in Uruguay as part of a South America visit promoting New Zealand's political, trade and economic interests in Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil.
