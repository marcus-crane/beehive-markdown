[]()**SOCIAL PROSPECTS FOR 2004 POSITIVE**  
Improving social statistics give the government confidence that 2004  
will deliver a further year of social development, Steve Maharey told  
the Takaro Rotary Club last week during a social 'state of the nation'  
address.

The speech drew on social indicators data from the Ministry of  
Social Development which records a steady improvement in the  
position of New Zealanders over the last five year, including people  
living longer, a more prosperous and safe society, a better educated  
population, and a lot less unemployment.

Turning his attention to the kinds of policies being put in place  
to improve the social state of our nation, Steve Maharey focused on  
4 key  
areas:

- investing in lifelong education to help people achieve their potential, raise their capacity to add value to the economy, take charge of their lives and make a contribution to their families and communities;
- efforts underway to create more demand for labour, increase people's access to paid work, and provide better rewards for employment;
- changes in the welfare state to ensure the benefits system provides security for those who need it and leads to work opportunities for those who can take them; and
- an emphasis on developing strong communities resourced to support people, families and the communities themselves to run their own lives.

During his comments Steve Maharey also took aim at National leader  
Don Brash's recent comments criticising the government for customising  
social services to meet the particular needs of Maori, an approach  
that the data  
reveals is delivering results. In the attached opinion piece he  
asks  
whether New Zealanders really want a return to the days of monolithic  
state agencies.

Steve Maharey also indicated that he will be seeking Cabinet's  
agreement this year to introduce legislation requiring all future  
governments to  
report on social outcomes. Social reporting by governments will  
ensure  
that we never again get into a situation where the social well being of  
the  
nation is ignored or marginalized. The statistics would sit  
alongside  
economic data the government currently produces to give an overall  
picture of the nation's social and economic development

[]()**EMPLOYMENT GROWTH EXPECTED**  
The year is set to be a positive one on the job front. The Department  
of Labour has released its six-monthly regional labour market reports.  
They utilise a number of statistical measures and provide information  
about labour market conditions in each of Work and Income's regions  
along with a discussion of the expected outlook. The most recent  
reports point to a strongly performing domestic economy driving job  
growth in the major metropolitan cities and, in turn, providing the  
impetus for job growth in other regions. This pattern is expected to  
change in 2005 as a strengthening in exports acts to boost more rural  
regional labour markets.

The forecasts follow the release in December of the latest stocktake of  
the government's Employment Strategy. It shows employment grew by 3.3  
percent (or 61,000 new jobs) and unemployment fell to its lowest level  
in 16 years in the year to September 2003. Most of these jobs (51,000)  
were full-time positions.

Meanwhile students are also reaping the advantages of New Zealand's  
buoyant employment market and are being placed into jobs of longer  
duration this  
summer. By mid-January applications to StudyLink for the  
Unemployment  
Benefit (Student Hardship) were down nearly 2,400 this year and Student  
Job Search had placed students in to more than 94,000 weeks of  
work, an increase of more 2,600 weeks on last summer.

[]()**TEACHING AND LEARNING QUALITY**  
A new Enhancing Quality Project is to investigate how existing quality  
assurance arrangements can be enhanced to support better teaching and  
learning - part of moves to develop a stronger 'culture of quality'  
within the tertiary education sector. It was recommended by the now  
disbanded Tertiary Education Advisory Commission.

Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said  
the project will help realise an objective of the Tertiary Education  
Strategy that 'learners and the wider public have confidence in  
high levels of  
quality throughout the system'. It will be guided by an expert  
working  
group drawn from the tertiary education sector. An scoping exercise is  
now underway to seek the opinions of stakeholders on the key  
issues to be included for investigation.

Meanwhile Steve Maharey is welcoming plans by the New Zealand  
Association of Private Education Providers to establish a Quality  
Commissioner for the private tertiary education sector. The plans  
also include a new code of ethical practices towards students, model  
grievance processes and the  
introduction of Quality Mark standards to NZAPEP members.  
The  
Association represents providers catering for over 60 percent of  
the students studying with private training establishments. Steve  
Maharey said the government would welcome other private trainers  
organisations working with NZAPEP on the proposal so they can also  
offer greater protection to their students.

[]()**UPDATES**  
More than 200 people attended the New Future for Public Broadcasting  
conference called to debate the role of New Zealand's public service  
broadcasters in today's world. Papers delivered by the international  
and national speakers have been posted to the conference website at  
www.newfuture.govt.nz. Meanwhile the Ministry for Culture and Heritage  
continues to analyse submissions from public and private broadcasting  
stakeholders on future directions.

StudyLink will continue to receive applications for the new Step  
Up scholarships until March. The bonded scholarships are being  
piloted with students beginning human and animal health degrees this  
year and pay most tuition costs. www.studylink.govt.nz.

More than 2000 young people expressed an interest in the new Work  
and Income case manager cadetships. Because of the overwhelming  
interest in the scheme, announced in November by Associate Social  
Development and Employment Minister Rick Barker, the number of places  
available has been increased to 110 cadetships. Over 50 percent of the  
candidates invited for an interview were themselves previous Work and  
Income clients.

So far 89 families have moved in to their first home with the assistance  
of  
a KiwiBank In Reach mortgage. They are the first to benefit  
from a  
two-year pilot mortgage insurance partnership with Housing New  
Zealand Corporation that enables the bank to reduce the risk of  
lending to people with little or no deposit. Kiwibank is expected  
to approve about 1,800 loans as part of this trial, which may be  
extended and offered through a wider range of banks if successful.

The second Social Policy Research and Evaluation conference will be held  
in Wellington on 25 and 26 November 2004. It brings together  
national and international researchers, practitioners and evaluators  
and focuses this year on 'What Works?'. Around 800 delegates are  
expected.

One hundred and eighty-six formal expressions of interest were  
received from people seeking appointment to Families Commission,  
which is being established on 1 July to advocate for the  
interests of families. An independent interview panel will  
undertake interviews with short-listed candidates and appointments  
expected to be made in May. Up to three full-time and three  
part-time commissioners will be appointed.
