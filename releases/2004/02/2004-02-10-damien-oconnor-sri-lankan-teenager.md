Associate Immigration Minister Damien O’Connor today sought further information in the case of a Sri Lankan teenager and her grandmother, whom he'd earlier refused to allow to stay in New Zealand.

Mr O’Connor said the High Court had found there was no prospect of success in the legal challenge to his earlier decision not to intervene in the removal proceedings, mounted by the teenager and her grandmother.

However, the pair's lawyers have asked the Minister to revisit his earlier decision, following a further psychiatric assessment of the young woman’s condition.

“I have now read that report, and I am seeking further information, before I decide whether there is any reason to revisit my earlier decision” Damien O’Connor said.

“To dispel some of the misinformation in the public arena about this case, it is important to note that:  
·The Refugee Status Appeal Authority found that the teenager and her grandmother were not refugees under the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Status of Refugees.  
·They have no existing family connections with New Zealand.  
·They do not meet any immigration policy criteria.  
·The NZIS has been working to ensure appropriate support and care for the teenager on her arrival in Sri Lanka. This has involved discussions with appropriate agencies in Sri Lanka.  
·Any removal will involve several agencies, including consultation with medical, police and airline representatives. Such consultations are standard practice for all removals.

“Until I receive the additional information sought, I do not intend engaging in further public discussion about this case. The issues in the case are difficult but the process has been thorough and is robust,” Damien O’Connor said.
