The government has increased the rates of emergency payments to disaster victims and approved on-going financial assistance for flood affected farmers in the lower North Island, Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Flood affected farmers are now eligible to receive rural assistance payments equivalent to 75 percent of the unemployment benefit for the next 6 months. This period of assistance can be extended if there is ongoing need.

Payments have also been approved under the Civil Defence Scheme to assist evacuees with their immediate needs. The level of assistance available under this scheme has also been increased to recognise the increase in costs since the rates were last adjusted in 1991.

Steve Maharey said many people living in flood-affected areas have lost everything and need immediate assistance.

“These payments are available for farmers who have been forced off their land as well as those whose income and housing has been affected by the crisis.

“The payments cover housing, clothing and food expenses. The payments can be made without an income or asset test.

“The rural assistance payments will help farmers get through this difficult period and on the road to re-establishing themselves and their properties. The payments recognise that the flooding will have a major impact on farmer’s incomes for some time.

“Farmers who decide against returning to farming and elect to sell their farm, will be eligible to the Unemployment Benefit.

“People who have lost their job due to the flooding may also be eligible for an Emergency Benefit. If they can’t find work for an extended period they will be entitled to the Unemployment Benefit. Any person affected by the flooding, including those not evacuated from their homes, can apply for assistance under the standard hardship programmes.

“For further information about how to access rural assistance, please call the Government Flood Helpline 0800-779-997,” Steve Maharey said.
