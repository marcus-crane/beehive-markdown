Health Minister Annette King says the Government backs setting up a national organ donation agency to give a national focus to organ donation, to expand the education of health professionals and to co-ordinate organ donation.

Ms King today tabled the Government’s response to the [report of the Health Select Committee](http://www.clerk.parliament.govt.nz/Content/SelectCommitteeReports/hepet0225.pdf) on the petition of Andy Tookey and 1169 others requesting “that the House take action to address the organ donation shortage in New Zealand”.

Ms King said the Government accepted many of the committee’s recommendations designed to ensure organ donation processes in New Zealand are co-ordinated effectively.

The Minister says the Government sought advice from the organ donation and transplantation sector before responding to the committee’s recommendations.

“Establishing ‘Organ Donation New Zealand’ will give organ donation a national focus. The agency will work with health professionals, particularly in the intensive care setting, on developing greater understanding of issues. This is a sensitive and complex area and by its nature is always associated with grieving families, but I believe the new national agency will help allow the many perspectives on the issues to be better understood.”

Ms King said it was proposed that the agency, to be set up in 2004-05, would be led by a full or part-time medical director reporting to a national advisory board.

“The agency will also develop nationally consistent protocols for the donation consent process and public awareness campaigns aimed at increasing the organ donor rate – another of the Select Committee’s recommendations.”

Ms King said the new agency would not provide a quick fix to the shortage of organ donations. “All countries, even those with a better donation rate than New Zealand, report a gap between the demand for and supply of organs.”

Ms King said the select committee also recommended setting up a national organ donor registry to replace the current driver licensing system, but the Government wanted the committee to examine the effectiveness, cost, and other details of such a register first. “There are a number of significant problems associated with donor registries, including cost, likely uptake, and ethical problems. There is also little international evidence that registers increase the number of organ donors.”

Ms King said the Government supported the following four committee recommendations in principle as its initial priority:

- Additional education for health professionals involved in organ donation;
- Establishing and funding a national organ and tissue donation agency extending the National Donor Co-ordination Office’s existing role;
- Ensuring that all persons involved in organ and tissue donation and retrieval have appropriate expertise;
- Developing consistent protocols for discussing organ and tissue donation with families.

The Government also supported in principle another recommendation, to develop a system to encourage active discussion about organ and tissue donation within families, but believed such initiatives should be considered by the national organ donation agency.

The Government also supports in principle an ongoing national public awareness campaign, she said. “A national public awareness campaign will be undertaken following the establishment of a national organ donation agency, education of health professionals and the development of nationally consistent protocols for the consent process for organ donations, particularly within families.”

Ms King said the Ministry of Health was also examining the legislative framework for organ donation (part of the Review of the Regulation of Human Tissue and Tissue-Based Therapies). This includes consent issues and the role of families, and public consultation on this issue will begin next month.

The Ministry was also reviewing organ donation service and resource allocation issues, she said.
