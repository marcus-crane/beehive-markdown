Years of hard work by officials and industry representatives have achieved year-round access to French markets for New Zealand venison, Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton said today.

Mr Sutton warmly welcomed the decision by France to allow year-round access to the French market for New Zealand venison.

“This represents a significant break-through for our exporters and an opportunity to develop the market potential for a high quality New Zealand product.

“We have been working hard with industry over the past six years to remove the restriction on the year–round sale to the French market of New Zealand venison. I have raised this issue with French Ministers on several occasions and we have had detailed discussions at officials’ level to convince them of the merits of our case. It is very pleasing to reach this excellent outcome. “

The decision to allow the out-of-season sale of non-European Union venison required the approval of three French Ministers, a process that took some time. It was finally published in France’s Official Journal on 7 February.

Previously, New Zealand venison could only be sold in France during the hunting season (1 September to the end of February).

Exports of venison to France last year were worth around NZ$8.6 million.
