Claims in Parliament by Act MP Muriel Newman that government assistance to repair dangerous rural housing is only available to Maori are completely incorrect, Housing Minister Steve Maharey said this afternoon.

Dr Newman made the comments during Parliamentary Question and then tabled documents which she alleged proved her case.

Steve Maharey said he had reviewed the information tabled by Dr Newman and checked the eligibility criteria for the rural housing essential repairs scheme.

“As usual Dr Newman has got her facts wrong.

“Housing New Zealand’s Essential Repairs scheme provides suspensory loans to help home owners fix houses in critical and dangerous states of repair. This includes situations where health and safety are at risk.

“Assistance is available to New Zealand citizens and permanent residents on the basis of need – not race as Dr Newman asserted.

“This is yet another case of opposition parties using Maori for their own political ends by making false claims, which is deplorable,” Steve Maharey said.
