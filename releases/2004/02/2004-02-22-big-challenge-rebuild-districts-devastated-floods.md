Industry & Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton says he is shocked by the extent of the destruction caused to homes, farmland and infrastructure by last week's devastating floods.

Jim Anderton today travelled by road to Tangimoana, Rongotea, Marton, Whangaehu and surrounding districts, all areas severely affected by the floods.

"It is miraculous that there has been no reported loss of life. That is one piece of good news that has come out of this significant natural disaster," he said.

"There is also a magnificent spirit of cooperation between Maori and pakeha in the face of this disaster. It is a reminder, if we needed it, that the New Zealand spirit is a combination of us all," Jim Anderton said.

Looking ahead, Jim Anderton said there is now an enormous challenge before all New Zealanders to rebuild the affected districts back to their former glory. The government will play a leading role in the national effort, he said.
