Fisheries Minister Pete Hodgson today released the [Maori Land Court](http://www.courts.govt.nz/maorilandcourt/homepage.htm) Tribunal's report on a proposal for a taiapure-local fishery at Akaroa Harbour.

The Court conducted a hearing in December on the proposal, which has been put forward by the Runaka of Onuku, Wairewa and Koukourarata.

The report recommends that a taiapure-local fishery be established over an area excluding the proposed Dan Rogers Marine Reserve, in the south-eastern arm of Akaroa Harbour.

Mr Hodgson said he was releasing the Court report because of strong local interest in the issue.

In March 2002 Mr Hodgson agreed in principle to the application for the taiapure. He will now consult with the Minister of Maori Affairs and get further advice from the Ministry of Fisheries before deciding whether the taiapure should be established.

Following an agreement in 1998 between the Minister of Conservation and the proponents of both the taiapure and the Dan Rogers Marine Reserve, the marine reserve proposal is on hold until the taiapure application is resolved.

A taiapure-local fishery is an arrangement for local management of local resources by people who care about them and have strong ties to the area. A management committee is appointed by the Fisheries Minister to recommend regulations for the conservation and management of the area's fisheries resources. The management committee is usually made up of representatives of Maori, the local community, environmental interests and recreational and commercial fishing interest groups.
