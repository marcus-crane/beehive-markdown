Police Minister George Hawkins was at Wellington Airport tonight to welcome home 11 members of the first police contingent deployed as part of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI).

The Minister joined family and friends at Wellington airport to welcome the group home late tonight. The group had been stationed in the Solomons for six months.

Mr Hawkins said those returning had done a full six month rotation, with many ending up in remote and small, isolated provincial posts around the  
Solomons.

Facilities there were now better than six months ago for New Zealand police in the Solomons, he said.

"This group have had to 'break the ground' and endure more rudimentary conditions than subsequent rotations," Mr Hawkins said.

New Zealand maintains 35 police in RAMSI.

Superintendent Tony Annandale, Assistant Commissioner: Operations Support within the Royal Solomon Islands Police, was among those returning tonight. Superintendent Annandale was the Contingent Commander (NZ).
