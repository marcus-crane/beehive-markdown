More than 100 high-tech New Zealand companies will be connected with international science, technology and business leaders at an Innovation Showcase in Christchurch next month.

The five-part [New Zealand Trade and Enterprise](http://www.nzte.govt.nz/) event will run from 9-12 March alongside the [4th APEC Ministers’ Meeting on Regional Science and Technology Co-operation](http://www.apecscience2004.org.nz/home/) and two associated international meetings.

It will feature world-class New Zealand companies, Crown Research Institutes and universities representing the biotechnology, information and communication technology, creative and niche manufacturing sectors.

"The Innovation Showcase is an exciting opportunity to display New Zealand’s science and technology capability and build our reputation for innovation," says Minister of Research, Science and Technology Pete Hodgson.

"It also meets the need identified at the previous APEC Science Ministers Meeting to cater better to business delegates and to facilitate business exchanges – and fits perfectly with the APEC meeting theme of ‘Connecting Science, Policy and Business’."

The Innovation Showcase includes an exhibition, business meetings and site visits for international delegates. There is also a two-day symposium featuring a world-class line-up of speakers on topics relevant to building New Zealand companies’ capabilities.

"New Zealand’s high-tech and innovative enterprises have much to offer APEC economies, which include important trade partners such as Australia, China and the US," Mr Hodgson said. "I’m confident this event will help stimulate new business for those involved."

New Zealand Trade and Enterprise CEO Tim Gibson says the unique combination of activities at the Innovation Showcase have been developed to provide a series of commercial opportunities for APEC delegates and international distributors and investors NZTE has invited to attend the event.

"Bringing together New Zealand companies for the showcase and identifying appropriate international business and investment partners to link with them has involved a rigorous six-month process," Mr Gibson says.

"On top of the strong interest from official APEC delegations keen to attend the Science Ministers meeting and associated events we are very pleased with the response to our own efforts to attract international delegates. We’re positive the Innovation Showcase will provide real partnership and deal-making opportunities."

[Investment New Zealand](http://www.investnewzealand.govt.nz/page_Article/0%2C1300%2C3000%2C00.html) CEO Don Christiansen is delighted at the calibre of international speakers and investors his team has helped attract to the Innovation Showcase, describing the group as "first-class".

"I think we can justifiably claim that this is the result of our ‘fishing with a rod, rather than a net’ approach to getting a top quality catch," Mr Christiansen says.

More than 30 leading New Zealand companies in the biotechnology, information and communication technology, creative and niche manufacturing sectors, plus Crown Research Institutes and universities will be on display at a four-day exhibition at the Christchurch Conference Centre.

The high-tech New Zealand companies involved range from software developers and telecommunications companies to clothing designers, key crown research organisations, health product and appliance manufacturers.

Half-day, informal site visits will allow APEC Ministers and other delegates to visit some 20 New Zealand science, technology and research organisations in the Canterbury region to learn more about New Zealand’s capability and to provide an opportunity to share best practice examples.
