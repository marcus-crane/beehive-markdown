Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton plans to lead a trade delegation of key New Zealand industry members to Russia in the second half of May this year to explore a wide range of export opportunities.

Mr Sutton said the delegation, which may focus on the food, and beverages, education and agritech industries, would definitely travel to Moscow, St Petersburg and Vladivostok., but may visit other locations depending on the interest from exporters.

“The visit will provide an excellent opportunity to introduce exporters to Russian business people at the highest level and to support some of our exporters who have already established a foothold in the market ,” he said.

“The Russian market is growing fast and holds much untapped potential, and we hope this mission will help New Zealand exporters enter the market and or to build on their existing market presence there.”

In addition to the business component of the two-week visit, Mr Sutton plans to meet ministers and officials in the Russian government to discuss economic links and to promote New Zealand goods and services.

A range of New Zealand exports to Russia will benefit from reduced tariffs in future, thanks to a bilateral Goods Market Access deal concluded in November between New Zealand and Russia as part of Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation. The deal, which will come into effect when Russia gains membership of the WTO, is expected to encourage the development of closer economic links between Russia and New Zealand.
