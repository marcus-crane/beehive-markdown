Racing Minister Damien O’Connor today welcomed the announcement of Graeme Hansen as Chief Executive of the [New Zealand Racing Board](http://www.racenz.co.nz).

“I am delighted that Graeme has accepted the position after a long and exhaustive search by the board,” Mr O'Connor said. “His appointment represents the final cog in the wheel of recent industry reform.

“It’s great to see a talented New Zealander return home to face the challenge of reinvigorating New Zealand racing. I am assured that he comes with excellent credentials.

“I look forward to working closely with Graeme and board chairman Warren Larsen, as the industry continues to improve its fortunes.”

Mr O'Connor noted that Mr Hansen, who commences his duties on 29 March, was not a complete stranger to New Zealand racing.

“Despite being off-shore for a number of years, Graeme has an interest in the domestic industry. He has an un-raced broodmare and a couple of horses currently in training.

“Graeme will bring a fresh approach to racing administration and I know that he will be well supported by the talented team at the New Zealand Racing Board,” Mr O’Connor said.
