Hundreds line up for South Island Small Business Days

More than a thousand businesspeople have registered to take part in the first three regional Small Business Days in the South Island next week, Minister for Small Business John Tamihere says.

Mr Tamihere said it was fantastic to see so many businesses interested in taking part in the first three of the 24 regional Small Business Days.

"I'm interested in meeting as many people in small business face-to-face as we possibly can. This is a great opportunity for us to hear the ideas and concerns of businesspeople, and for them to hear first-hand what the Government is endeavouring to do on their behalf."

Mr Tamihere will speak at all three Small Business Days next week, and the days will also include seminars on topics including growing businesses, technology and employments relations, plus Small Business Expos and opportunity for business mentoring and advice.

The first three regional Small Business Days are:  
South Canterbury Small Business Day, Monday, March 1, Theatre Royale, Timaru  
Lunchtime Inspiration speaker tourism operator Mike Tamaki  
Celebrity debate: "Small business is the backbone of our country" and Business Excellence Awards
