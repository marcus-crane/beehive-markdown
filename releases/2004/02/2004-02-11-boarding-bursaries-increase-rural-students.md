Boarding bursaries for thousands of rural students are to increase by 17 per cent ($350) to $2,340 annually per student as a result of a $1 million annual funding boost, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

"Currently 2,650 students are receiving these boarding bursaries and I am sure this new funding will be a welcome top up that will further help rural students gain access to education," Trevor Mallard said.

"Our government is committed to providing opportunity for everyone. We are intent on ensuring every New Zealander, regardless of their background and where they live, has access to quality education.

"These students often live in rural and remote areas, or are unable to attend their local school for some other reason. The boarding bursaries help them stay in education."

Trevor Mallard said the increase is the first since 1994 and is in addition to the $5.8 million the government currently spends annually on boarding bursaries.

"This latest increase is part of the government's plan to improve the overall effectiveness of boarding bursaries so they properly meet the needs of today’s students as much as possible.

"This year I intend to thoroughly review boarding bursaries to ensure they are as effective as possible for the students who need them."

The review will be carried out by the Ministry of Education and will involve consultation with key groups in the rural and education sectors.
