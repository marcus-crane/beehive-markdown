The [Ministry of Health](http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/238fd5fb4fd051844c256669006aed57/55b8e684cb76f9c7cc256d9f000ace50?OpenDocument#Survey2002) today released the most complete survey to date of the New Zealand rural health GP workforce.

The [New Zealand Annual Rural Workforce Survey 2002](http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/238fd5fb4fd051844c256669006aed57/55b8e684cb76f9c7cc256d9f000ace50/$FILE/NZannualruralwkforce2002.pdf) sought information from 477 general practitioners working in rural communities and nurses sharing after hours responsibilities. It showed that workload issues and staff retention remain challenges for the rural workforce.

A key finding from the survey, which was carried out by independent rural health consultant Dr Martin London, showed that five GPs left the rural workforce in 2002 compared with a gain of five in 2001. Other findings included that too many GPs were affected by heavy workloads, and a quarter of 30-35 year olds intended to leave the rural workforce.

Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor said the government had recognized these challenges with its $32 million funding package over three years for the rural health sector, [announced in 2002](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F14159).

"The concerns raised in the survey clearly underline the need for the package, which is fully committed to supporting the retention and recruitment of the rural primary health care workforce," said Mr O'Connor.

"Slowly but steadily we are addressing the pressures facing the rural health workforce. The $32 million package has already resulted in substantial funding to help relieve rural doctors and nurses working onerous rosters, and retention funding has been made available to District Health Boards and [Primary Health Organisations](http://www.moh.govt.nz/primaryhealthcare) (PHOs) to implement workforce retention strategies.

"The most recent [initiative](),"&gt;nurse practitioners with prescribing capabilities, has 30 requests so far to recruit."

Mr O'Connor said it was important to note that the Rural Workforce Survey findings reflected the situation at December 2002, when it was too early to measure the impact of the funding injection, which took effect in July 2002.

"The new initiatives are expected to have a strong impact on the sector. Retaining and attracting new staff has always been a challenge for the rural sector. This survey gives the Ministry useful baseline data, from which the impact of the rural funding package can be measured into the future."

Ministry of Health Deputy Director-General Clinical Services, Dr Colin Feek, agreed that many rural GPs had heavy workloads and that more rural GPs were needed. But while the survey estimated that an additional 107 GPs were needed to bring workloads down to one GP per 1500 people, Dr Feek believed this figure oversimplified the situation.

"The survey's estimate was based on GP to total resident population figures, rather than figures of actual people who visit rural GPs. Therefore, the number of additional GPs needed may be less. As well as recruiting more GPs there also needs to be an overall strengthening of the rural health workforce. This means making greater use of the skills of the wider primary health care team in rural communities, especially nurses," said Dr Feek.

Six rural nurses have received scholarships to complete nurse practitioner requirements this year.

Also, from this year there will be 40 extra places available annually for medical students, to be shared equally between Auckland and Otago Universities, and students from rural backgrounds have filled those extra spaces this year. It is hoped this will have long-term benefits for the rural workforce, as students from rural backgrounds may be more likely to return to rural areas to work.

Mr O'Connor said PHOs would also benefit the rural GP workforce. "More rural areas now have access to PHOs, and the additional funding applied to PHOs enables more opportunities to attract GPs to areas where the current GPs are coping with high workload."

The Ministry is currently considering the best options for regularly monitoring the rural health workforce in the future.
