The economic impact assessment report from Venture Taranaki, of the filming of the The Last Samuari proves that supporting large budget screen production in New Zealand pays off, said Jim Anderton, Minister of Economic Development at the launch of the report today.

"The Last Samurai has paid a big dividend to both Taranaki and New Zealand. The production of the film not only meant $85.5 million was spent in New Zealand, but the impact on output is greater once flow -on activity is taken into account and is estimated at $195 million.

"The economic impact assessment also estimates the film created 1,403 jobs over the year. That is certainly a worthwhile contribution to New Zealand's economy, the film industry and its supporting businesses.

"Major productions like The Last Samurai help us build our creative industries, bring jobs, enhance skills development, help expand infrastructure in the film industry, and become an advertisement for New Zealand's innovation and creativity.

"The film industry isn't the only one to benefit by any means. The Last Samurai utilised fourteen different industry sectors from construction to retail and communications. That is the value of big productions coming to New Zealand, they create jobs and contribute to our local, regional and national economies.

"With advertisements like The Lord of the Rings and The Last Samurai, New Zealand is well placed to further develop our cutting edge film industry," said Jim Anderton.
