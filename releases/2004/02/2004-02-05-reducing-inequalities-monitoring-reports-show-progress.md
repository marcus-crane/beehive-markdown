Reducing inequalities monitoring reports released by the government today show improvements in the position of Maori and Pacific peoples.

The [reports](http://www.msd.govt.nz/publications/recent-publications.html) are the first to be produced by the Ministry of Social Development who took over responsibility for advising the Cabinet Social Development Committee on how the programmes are working in August 2003. The reports were forwarded to the Maori Affairs Select Committee today.

Social Development Committee Chair Steve Maharey said the reports show improvements across most measures.

“The reports show, for example, that Maori household incomes have improved, their unemployment rate has dropped, rates of child abuse and neglect have decreased and the proportion of Maori students leaving school with qualifications is up, among other improving measures.

“Recent evidence, not covered by these reports, points to an even faster improvement in the relative position of Maori and Pacific peoples. This includes:

- the Maori unemployment rate dropping below 10 per cent for the first time since December 1987,
- rapid increases in Maori participation in tertiary education, with 63,694 Maori learners enrolled in 2002,
- the roll-out of Public Health Organisations.

“At the same time the absolute position of all New Zealanders is improving. On some indicators this has meant that improvements among the population as a whole have been the same or greater than improvements for Maori and Pacific peoples.

“These improved reports are the first to be produced by the Ministry of Social Development and now incorporate an analysis of progress against selected indicators. The Ministry is now working on a follow-up report that will update the indicators against outcomes, provide advice on priorities for the future, and identify what has been effective in improving outcomes across the whole suite of programmes,” Steve Maharey said.
