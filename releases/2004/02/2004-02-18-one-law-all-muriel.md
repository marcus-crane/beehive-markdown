The government is continuing to refute incorrect claims by Act MP Muriel Newman that rural housing assistance is only available to Maori – and issued information this afternoon showing the MP herself has sought preferential treatment in the past.

For the second day in a row Dr Newman claimed in Parliament that the Special Housing Action Zone programme delivers services only to Maori. Answering Parliamentary questions on the scheme, Housing Minister Steve Maharey confirmed once again that assistance is available to New Zealand citizens and permanent residents on the basis of need – not race as Dr Newman again asserted.

Steve Maharey said it was ironic Dr Newman was continuing to make false claims when she herself had twice sought preferential treatment for her own Northland property in the past.

“Support to repair substandard and unsafe rural housing is delivered on the basis of need – not race. It’s very ironic that Dr Newman continues to raise this issue given her own previous attempts to evade the laws other New Zealanders must abide by.

“In 1997 Dr Newman was in dispute with the Whangarei District Council over a boatshed she erected on her property without resource consent. The following year she lost an appeal against Valuation New Zealand to have her lifestyle block declared a farm in order to qualify for reduced rates.

“For one who sounds off regularly about one law for all this is hardly leading by example,” Steve Maharey said.
