The Corrections Minister Paul Swain says the New Zealand First MP Ron Mark has once again made groundless claims about the Corrections Department, without producing a shred of evidence.

"Mind you, we're getting used to it," says Mr Swain.

"Last year Mr Mark claimed two Chubb security guards had been bashed and ended up in hospital while visiting an offender on home detention. It was a total fabrication."

"He also claimed a huge scandal involving Ukrainian farm workers, and was forced to eat humble pie."

"Corrections staff do a great job keeping the community safe and it's about time Mr Mark showed some respect for those who do this important job on our behalf."

"Mr Mark knows that if MPs have an issue and provide evidence, I will investigate."

"However, while he continues to make groundless claims, he won't be taken seriously."
