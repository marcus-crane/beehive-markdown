Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor will this afternoon visit Dannevirke Hospital and meet with representatives from the Tararua Primary Health Organisation.

The meeting will allow local health managers, administrators, PHO board members and MidCentral Health representatives to discuss health care in the region.

Central to these discussions are expected to be concerns relating to rural health provision, including the challenge of attracting rural GPs.

"There are a number of issues facing rural health practices nationwide and I want to discuss them with people at the coal face," said Mr O'Connor.

"Once we've identified problems in each area, we can work to address them.

"This government is committed to improving rural health care and it is essential to meet with providers directly and hear their thoughts."

The afternoon's discussions will commence following a tour of the hospital.
