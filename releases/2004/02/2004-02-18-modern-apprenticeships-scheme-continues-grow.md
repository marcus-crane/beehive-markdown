The Modern Apprenticeships scheme continues to expand, reaching 6,259 trainees across 30 industries in December 2003, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said today.

The figures come at the same time as the first graduates from the scheme complete their training. A total of 213 young people have now completed their modern apprenticeship, gaining the industry and nationally recognised qualifications.

Steve Maharey congratulated the first graduates of the programme and encouraged other young people to think about the industry training option.

“Modern Apprenticeships is a scheme designed to match young people with the large number of skilled jobs in industry. Reports from employers about the difficulties they face to recruit skilled staff suggests that Modern Apprentice graduates will have long and lucrative careers ahead of them.

“The scheme is currently available in 30 industries ranging from electrotechnology and hospitality through to the seafood sector, dairying and agriculture.

“The government increased funding for Modern Apprenticeships this year to enable 6,500 young people to begin training by June 2004 – and then a further increase to 7,500 trainees during 2006.
