Ireland has become the first country in Europe to ban smoking in pubs, bars and restaurants, a move Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor says is consistent with growing smokefree sentiment worldwide.

"Ireland's decision to go smokefree reflects a growing global awareness of smoking harms and a widespread move to address them," said Mr O'Connor.

"Over 4.9 million people die worldwide each year from smoking-related illnesses and that figure is expected to double in the next 20 years if current trends continue.

"More and more countries are seeing that comprehensive tobacco bans are necessary to protect both smokers and second–hand smokers from death and disease."

Ireland's tobacco ban will take effect on 29 March. It will cover all places of public transport and employment, except prisons and psychiatric hospitals.

Health groups in Ireland are hailing the ban as historic.

"Ireland has joined the likes of California, New York, Sweden, Norway and, of course, New Zealand, in the fight against smoking harms," said Mr O'Connor. "Several other individual states and cities are also smoke free and a number of countries are well on their way to introducing bans.

"All these jurisdictions are world leaders in tobacco control, who will benefit from reduced staff turnover, healthier staff and a healthier population overall. Taxpayers will also benefit from decreased smoking rates and reductions in the billions of dollars spent each year on tobacco-related costs."

The Smoke-free Environments Amendment Act 2003 was passed in New Zealand in December last year. It makes all our bars, restaurants and work places smoke free from December this year.

The Act aims to enhance protection against exposure to second hand smoke - which kills an estimated 388 people annually in New Zealand.
