Cabinet Minister Pete Hodgson departs for the United States on Monday to promote investment in New Zealand, particularly in the creative industries.

A key event is the New Zealand reception for about 300 people from the Hollywood film industry at the Beverly Hills Hotel on Friday 27 February – 48 hours before the Oscars. The evening will be a celebration of New Zealand filmmaking and New Zealand creative talent.

"Similar events in the past two years have been very successful in raising New Zealand’s profile in Hollywood," Mr Hodgson said. "These functions have helped forge links between New Zealand and Hollywood that have resulted in significant investments in our screen production industry. Investors want to know that the New Zealand Government welcomes them and supports the local industry and I will be there to assure them that it does."

Mr Hodgson travels first to New York City to deliver the keynote speech at an [Asia Society](http://www.asiasociety.org/) business and investment briefing on New Zealand’s creative economy, supported by Investment NZ and NZ Trade and Enterprise. He will also open the new Consulate-General office in New York and meet pharmaceutical industry senior executives to explore investment opportunities in New Zealand’s biotechnology industry.

In Philadelphia Mr Hodgson will visit the [Pennsylvania Life Sciences Greenhouse](http://www.lsgpa.com/), a life sciences research and business development model. He will also meet representatives of Pennsylvania's universities to discuss the State of Pennsylvania’s new legislation to develop ‘Keystone Innovation Zones’, which are aimed at facilitating technology transfer.

In Los Angeles, besides the pre-Oscar event, Mr Hodgson will continue discussions with senior executives of film studios on the development of plans for large screen and TV productions in New Zealand, and meet the [Motion Picture Association of America](http://www.mpaa.org/) with a New Zealand delegation.
