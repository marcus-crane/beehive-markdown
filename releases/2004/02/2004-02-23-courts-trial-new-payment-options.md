A pilot project allowing court users to pay for court services with EFT-POS and major credit cards starts today.

Minister for Courts Rick Barker said the trial was set up partially in response to customer demand.

“People have been asking for years why they cannot pay for court services by EFT-POS or credit card, and from today, at three courts, they can.”

Mr Barker said the pilot project, operating at the Wellington District Court, the Wellington High Court and the Masterton combined High and District Court, will trial electronic payment technologies and internal financial accounting systems to determine the best fit for the courts environment.

“We expect people to use the new payment option to pay for filing court documents, for example a divorce (dissolution) application, a disputes tribunal application, or getting a marriage licence at courts which provide this service.”

Mr Barker said although the move to a more user-friendly payment system was small, it signified an important step forward in providing better service to court users.

“Making the payment of services easier is beneficial for both Courts’ and its customers.”

The pilot will run for two months before being evaluated. After that Mr Barker said the new payment options would be extended to all courts.

Mastercard, VISA, Bankcard, American Express and Diners Club credit cards will be accepted during the Wellington and Masterton pilot.
