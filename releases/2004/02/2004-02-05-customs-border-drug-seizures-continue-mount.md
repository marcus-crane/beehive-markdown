Several major border drugs seizures last year showed that international drugs syndicates were still determined to bring illicit substances into New Zealand, Customs Minister Rick Barker said today.

“In 2003 the Customs Service made 28 significant drug seizures* at New Zealand’s border.

“As a result, 44 people, including 16 couriers were arrested by the Police and appeared in court.”

The 28 significant seizures made up a large proportion of the total drugs seized by [Customs](http://www.customs.govt.nz) in 2003.

They included 266,000 tablets (or powder equivalent) of MDMA (ecstasy), 862 grams of crystal methamphetamine (ice), 335 grams of methamphetamine, 1455 grams of heroin and 7060 grams of cocaine.

"These statistics are an increase on previous years' figures. Ecstasy was at an all time high," Mr Barker said.

Follow-up investigations by Customs drug investigators, working closely with their Police counterparts, identified that the heroin and cocaine seized was ultimately destined for the bigger Australian market.

“The estimated street value of those seizures alone was in excess of $6m. Customs and other law enforcement agencies that prevented these drugs from reaching their final destination are to be congratulated.”

Customs also seized over 830,000 tablets (or powder equivalent) of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine in 433 separate incidents at New Zealand's border.

“Both substances are key precursors used to make methamphetamine, now a Class A controlled drug,” Mr Barker said.

In addition to the reclassification of methamphetamine, the Government has also moved to classify ephedrine and pseudoephedrine as Class C drugs.

Customs did not anticipate that drug seizure activity at the border would abate in the near future, largely because of the huge profits that could be made by traffickers.

“Clearly, New Zealand is seen as an increasingly viable and profitable market by international drug trafficking syndicates.”

However, Mr Barker said the Government was committed to minimising the harm caused by illicit drugs in New Zealand.

“Last year’s Budget increased Customs’ annual drugs investigations funding by $1.9 million, allowing the service to boost the size of its investigation and proactive intelligence teams in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.

“By clamping down on the supply of illicit drugs, we will limit the social problems associated with habitual drug abuse.”
