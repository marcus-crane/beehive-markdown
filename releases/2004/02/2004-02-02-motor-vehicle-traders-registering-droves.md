Applications for the new [Motor Vehicle Traders Register](http://www.motortraders.med.govt.nz/pls/web/dbssiten.main) are rolling in, says Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard.

Six weeks after the new Motor Vehicle Traders Register (MVTR) went into operation, 1,998 applications have been received from individuals and companies applying to become registered motor vehicle traders.

On 15 December 2003 alone, the first day of the register’s operation, about 600 applications were received.

To date, out of an expected 3,000 registrations, a total of 903 registrations have been granted and an additional 1,092 applications are going through the registration process. Three applications have been refused because they did not meet the registration requirements set out in the [Motor Vehicle Sales Act (MVSA)](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=250830390&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7B2B0B4%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC).

"These numbers show that the Motor Traders Register is working well and is a success. Although most traders have until mid-March to register I am pleased to see that many are not leaving their applications to the last minute," said Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard.

"The fact that the overwhelming majority - 87% - of applications so far have been filed online indicates the ease of using the online service. It also demonstrates the success of the Ministry of Economic Development's trader training on how to register, which was provided before the Act came into effect.”

“The Ministry of Economic Development’s Companies Office built and released the MVTR within a very short timeframe. Capitalising on its experience of developing other electronic registers, the MVTR reflects the Ministry’s commitment to making its business information and services available quickly, cheaply and easily.

“The [online register](http://www.motortraders.med.govt.nz/pls/web/dbssiten.main) is also a free and easy way for consumers to check, at any time, if a motor vehicle trader is registered or has been banned from registering.”

Under the Motor Vehicle Sales Act all motor vehicle traders have to register on the Motor Vehicle Traders Register. A motor vehicle trader is any person whose business is motor vehicle trading, such as a car yard trader, car auctioneer or car market operator.

“Most traders have until 15 March to finalise their registration, but some need to register immediately - more information is available from the [MVTR website](http://www.motortraders.med.govt.nz). Motor vehicle traders can be fined up to $200,000 if they are not registered,” said Judith Tizard.

Implementation of the MVSA and MVTR is a joint project of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Development's Companies Office and Regulatory and Competition Policy Branch.
