Education Minister Trevor Mallard today announced extra funding to create new kindergartens and more places for young children in early childhood education centres around the country.

"I am putting an extra $2.8 million into this area in line with our government's goal of increasing the number of children taking part in early childhood education. Our government is intent on creating opportunity for all New Zealanders, regardless of their background. It's essential our very youngest New Zealanders get the right start to life, and learning.

"This funding will create an extra 179 new places for children in licensed and chartered early childhood education centres over the next year. The funding will also ensure the retention of 85 places in existing centres which would otherwise be forced to close.

"Also, two new kindergartens in areas of high population growth will be funded using capital grants - one in Richmond, Nelson, and the other at Silverdale, in Auckland, both providing 90 places a day each.

"We know that quality early childhood education makes a significant difference to the way children develop and achieve later in their lives. Research also shows that access to quality early childhood education has the greatest benefits for children who are the least likely to participate, including those from low socio-economic, rural, Maori or Pasifika communities.

"The [Discretionary Grants Scheme](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/index.cfm?layout=index&indexid=4334&indexparentid=1038), which is used to fund most of these extra places, is particularly targeted to these groups."

Today's announcement follows grants made to 72 groups in December. Each year, the Discretionary Grants Scheme provides annual capital assistance of $8.8 million to community based early childhood centres.

Trevor Mallard announced the extra money for early childhood education during a visit to Ngaio Kohanga Reo in Wellington. The kohanga received $112,590 in this funding allocation to extend and renovate their current building, creating 11 extra places for their tamariki.

A list of the early childhood education centres and kohanga reo is attached.
