Christchurch is reinforcing its reputation as a world class high tech, high value ICT hub says Minister of Economic Development, Jim Anderton after leading international engineering and environmental consultancy firm, MWH (Montgomery Watson Harza) launched their Information Technology global services unit there today.

"MWH's decision to locate one of its three global support functions in Christchurch was based on the calibre of staff and the quality of the technology development environment in Christchurch.

"This is a clear testament to New Zealand's ability to provide sophisticated information communications solutions and support. In particular, it is a good demonstration of the depth of ICT knowledge and skills being developed in Christchurch.

"The foresight of the Canterbury Development Corporation, Investment New Zealand and other key players in Christchurch to establish the HIT Lab is paying off. Christchurch is increasingly being viewed as a centre of technological innovation, not just nationally, but globally.

"We need far more high value industries in New Zealand and we need to sell more high value products to the world. Initiatives such as this one will help us reach new markets and develop our ICT industries even further. This is great news for Christchurch and very good news for New Zealand," Jim Anderton said.

MWH will join similarly innovative companies like Tait Electronics, Pulse Data and Niche Software which are also located in Christchurch.
