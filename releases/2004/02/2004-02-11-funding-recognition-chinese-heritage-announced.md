Prime Minister Helen Clark and Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter today announced the formation of a new charitable trust and other initiatives with the broad aim of raising awareness of the early Chinese community in New Zealand and their history, language, and culture.

The announcement follows the [government apology in 2002](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F13083) to those Chinese and their descendants who faced statutory discrimination in New Zealand, particularly through the infamous Poll Tax.

"Punitive legislation targeting Chinese alone imposed considerable hardship on earlier generations of Chinese settlers to New Zealand. It and other discriminatory immigration practices by earlier governments split families apart," Helen Clark said.

“Since the apology was offered in February 2002, the government has consulted widely on how it might best contribute to reconciliation over these events. It became clear that descendants of the Poll Tax payers were deeply concerned about maintaining the unique identity of the local Chinese community.”

The measures announced today were developed after consultation with representatives of those who paid the Poll Tax and their descendents. They comprise a variety of government initiatives, including:

- A $5m seeding grant for a government-administered community trust;
- New school resources which tell the stories of Chinese settlers in New Zealand; and
- The preservation of a significant Chinese heritage site in Central Otago.

It is envisaged that the community trust will fund projects to boost the study of Chinese New Zealand history, encourage cultural and language maintenance, promote greater public awareness of ethnic diversity, and support projects that strengthen the unique identity of Chinese New Zealanders.

“The establishment of a trust signifies the determination of the government to secure the place of the Chinese community and its role in our nation’s history,” Helen Clark said.

Chris Carter said the new initiatives marked a significant moment for Chinese people who had paid the Poll Tax and their descendants.

"As Minister for [Ethnic Affairs](http://www.ethnicaffairs.govt.nz), I am pleased with these decisions because I know how much they mean to the Chinese community."

From 1881, all Chinese migrants were required to pay a poll tax of 10 pounds, raised to 100 pounds in 1896, simply because they were Chinese. It is estimated that approximately 310,000 pounds were collected through the Poll Tax, between $25 and $30 million in today’s terms.

Other legislative initiatives also singled out Chinese people. Their right to naturalisation was withdrawn from 1908 to 1951. They were forced to give compulsory thumbprints whenever they returned to New Zealand after travelling overseas. Reading tests in English were also imposed for new Chinese migrants when all other ethnic groups simply had to fill in a standard form.
