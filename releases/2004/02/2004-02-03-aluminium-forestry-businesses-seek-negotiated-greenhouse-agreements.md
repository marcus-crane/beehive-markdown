The Government will enter negotiations for [Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements](http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/policy-initiatives/nga.html) with New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Limited and some of Carter Holt Harvey's key manufacturing operations.

Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements (NGAs) are a key element of New Zealand's climate change policy.

An NGA is a binding agreement between a firm and the Government that commits the firm to moving towards world's best practice in managing greenhouse gas emissions. In return, the Government provides a full or partial exemption for the firm from the emissions charge that is to be introduced by 2008. NGAs are limited to firms or industries whose international competitiveness would be at risk from an emissions charge.

In 2003, the Government signed New Zealand’s first NGA with the New Zealand Refining Company, which runs New Zealand's only oil refinery. In November, it announced agreements to negotiate with ACI Glass Packaging, paper mill operator Norske Skog Tasman and mining companies Newmont Waihi and GRD Macraes.

Mr Hodgson said the negotiations were a significant step in the implementation of climate change policy, which is designed to enable New Zealand to meet its obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.

"NGAs will constrain greenhouse gas emissions while protecting the international competitiveness of New Zealand businesses. They encourage businesses to pursue the economic and environmental advantages of best practice in emissions management."

The [New Zealand Climate Change Office](http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/) at the Ministry for the Environment takes applications from firms seeking NGAs and assesses their eligibility and priority. It has further applications under assessment.
