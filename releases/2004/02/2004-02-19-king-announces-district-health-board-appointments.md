Health Minister Annette King has announced a new deputy chair, Sharron Cole, for [Hutt District Health Board](http://www.huttvalleydhb.org.nz/) (DHB), and a new board member, Norman Dewes, for [Canterbury DHB](http://www.cdhb.govt.nz/).

Ms King says Mrs Cole has been a valuable member of the Hutt DHB board since her election in 2001, and will take over the deputy chair role following Peter Glensor’s appointment as board chair last year.

Mr Dewes is the Chief Executive of Te Runanga O Nga Maata Waka, the urban Maori authority based in Canterbury, Ms King said. Mr Dewes has a background in education, social work, sport and recreation, and other services, and is particularly experienced in helping unemployed into the workplace, and has also worked extensively with young urban Maori.

“The appointees bring substantial governance experience to the boards and have contributed extensively in their local communities. I look forward to working with them and their boards to improve health outcomes for people in their districts.”
