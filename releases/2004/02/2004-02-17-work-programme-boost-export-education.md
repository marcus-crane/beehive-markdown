Thousands of providers and students in the export education sector will benefit this year from an industry-funded $3.2 million work programme - the first of its kind, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

"This comprehensive work programme is funded by the export education industry which played a key role in putting it together. The programme spans research, quality assurance, promotion and professional development," Trevor Mallard said.

“The programme will boost our knowledge of international education issues through a number of key research projects and will help New Zealand institutions market the New Zealand brand overseas."

"The export education industry is a hugely important industry to New Zealand, worth around $1.7 billion a year. It's essential that we do everything possible to support it and build on the quality services already being provided to international students who come here to study."

Work programme initiatives include:

- professional development seminars, workshops and other initiatives;
- export education research projects;
- on-line access to research and professional development support materials;
- sector promotion in study guides and on mynzed.com web site, and
- media management, media hosting and market research.

Trevor Mallard said the work programme was funded by the Export Education Levy which applies to all 1200 recognised providers of international education in New Zealand.

The levy also funds administration and monitoring of implementation of the Code of Practice for the Pastoral Care of students, which was last year strengthened to further protect students and lift quality in the international education marketplace.

For providers other than private training establishments, the levy for the 2004 calendar year is at a flat fee of $185 (excluding GST) and 0.45 per cent of tuition fees.

"This year the government wants to raise the levy for private training establishments in response to the collapse late last year of Modern Age and Carich and the on-going costs associated with ensuring students affected by these closures are looked after and able to complete their studies," Trevor Mallard said.

"The [Education (Export Education Levy) Amendment Bill](http://www.knowledge-basket.co.nz/gpprint/docs/bills/20031011.txt), currently before the Education and Science Select Committee, will – for private training establishments – raise the tuition fee to 0.7 per cent while the flat fee will remain the same.

"The government expects to spend up to $1.37 million of taxpayer funds ensuring students affected by the collapse of the two private training establishments are able to complete their studies.

"This is a higher figure than previously estimated and the additional $400,000 generated in 2004 by the increased rate on private training establishments will go towards ensuring these costs are recovered so taxpayers do not foot the bill.

Trevor Mallard acknowledged the active part played by six reference groups, nominated by education sector bodies, in the development of the work programme.

Some projects are already underway or complete and a number are being tendered out. All projects are expected to be underway or complete by the middle of the year.
