Act MP Muriel Newman is off the pace again today with incorrect claims that aspiring artists are exempted from having to work for a living, says Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey.

“Muriel Newman has once again rushed to her typewriter with inaccurate information.

“For the record unemployment beneficiaries wanting a career in the arts or the creative sector are treated no differently to other beneficiaries, including being subject to the same work test requirements,” Steve Maharey said.
