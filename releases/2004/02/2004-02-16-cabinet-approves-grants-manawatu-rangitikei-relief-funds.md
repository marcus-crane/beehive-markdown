Cabinet today approved grants of $20,000 each to the Manawatu and Rangitikei Mayoral Relief funds, Civil Defence and Emergency Management Minister George Hawkins says.

Civil Defence emergencies have been declared in the Manawatu and Rangitikei districts following severe weather that battered the lower part of the North Island overnight. About 450 people evacuated from their homes in Manawatu and Rangitikei districts, and about 600 people in the Hutt area.

At this stage the Hutt area had not found it necessary to declare a Civil Emergency.

Mr Hawkins said with the support of police, volunteers, fire and defence, local and regional council Civil Defence staff are dealing well with the situation.

"There continue to be problems with access to some of these areas but we are pleased that there are no reports of injuries at this stage," Mr Hawkins said.

The Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency continues to monitor the situation from its National Emergency Operations Centre in Wellington, Mr Hawkins said.
