Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced the terms of reference for the Commission of Inquiry into recent allegations made against members of the Police with respect to sexual conduct and investigations of it.

Commissioners Justice Bruce Robertson and Dame Margaret Bazley will inquire into police conduct, standards and procedures when receiving and investigating allegations of sexual assault and abuse made against the police.

They will also investigate police standards and codes relating to police personal behaviour, including sexual conduct.

The commission will not determine the guilt or innocence of police officers involved in alleged sexual assault or other alleged criminal offences.

The commission will not review Police Complaints Authority’s investigations because of secrecy provisions in the authority’s governing statute, but it will be able to review the investigations carried out by Police which formed the basis for the Authority’s reports.

Helen Clark said a number of women have made complaints about sexual assaults by police officers or their associates, and the manner in which the Police handled those complaints. It is important that these complaints are thoroughly investigated.

“The Police hold a critical role in society in upholding law and order and it is vital that there is strong public confidence in and respect for the Police,” Helen Clark said.

“The public must be assured that the Police will thoroughly investigate any allegations of criminal behaviour by their own personnel. If the allegations that have been made indicate that there are systemic problems, they will be identified and dealt with.”

The Commission of Inquiry will announce the dates and venues for commission hearings, and outline how members of the public can make submissions as soon as possible. It will report to the Governor-General by 1 November.
