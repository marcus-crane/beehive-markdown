A work permit policy for Zimbabwean nationals, which was introduced in February 2003, will be extended due to the continued instability within Zimbabwe, Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel announced today.

The special open work permits, valid for 12 months, were granted to Zimbabweans already in New Zealand on 20 February 2003.

“As the situation in Zimbabwe has not stabilised, Zimbabwe nationals in New Zealand under temporary entry provisions may not be able to return home. Therefore, the government has extended the special open work permit policy for another 12 months for Zimbabweans who qualified under the 2003 policy.”

Eligible Zimbabweans will need to apply for a new permit at the nearest New Zealand Immigration Service branch before the expiry of their current permit.

Lianne Dalziel said approximately 2600 Zimbabweans in New Zealand on temporary permits could be affected by today’s announcement.

Zimbabwe nationals would continue to be eligible for temporary entry or residence under standard policies. Further options for residence are currently under development.
