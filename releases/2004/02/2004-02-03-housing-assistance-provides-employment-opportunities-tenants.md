Four former and two current Housing New Zealand Corporation tenants are among the 27 people who have gained employment with the new Housing Assistance Service 0800 801 601.

Housing Minister Steve Maharey today officially launched the Service today, which provides a 24 hour toll-free service for Housing New Zealand Corporation customers.

Housing Assistance has been available nation-wide since December. Housing Assistance is accessible by any mobile phone and complements services provided by the Corporation’s 43 Neighbourhood Units. It also provides customers with access to services in 30 languages through the inter-agency pilot: Language Line.

Steve Maharey says the service has provided benefits to customers nation-wide as well as the Porirua community.

“The team of Housing Advisors can handle all general inquiries about Housing New Zealand Corporation services and products, as well as calls for urgent repairs, maintenance, waiting list management and tenant inquiries.

“And if English isn’t your first language, that’s not a problem. Housing Assistance has access to the Language Line, which provides translations in 30 languages.

“In addition, the service has created job opportunities for 27 people.

“Employment is an important aspect of sustainable communities and the fact we’ve created opportunities for some of our tenants, is even better,” Steve Maharey said.

Housing Assistance currently receives on average about 900 calls per day.

Hearing impaired people can access Housing Assistance through free fax 0800 201 202.
