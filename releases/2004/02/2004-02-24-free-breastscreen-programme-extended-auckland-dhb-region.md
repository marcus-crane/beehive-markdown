Free breast screening will soon be available to thousands more women in the Auckland District Health Board's area, says Auckland Issues Minister and Auckland Central MP Judith Tizard.

From July 1, the BreastScreen Aotearoa programme will expand to include women between 45 and 69 years of age inclusive; previously, only women aged 50 to 64 were included.

Between June 2001 and June 2003 13,108 women had mammograms in Auckland District Health Board's area, and 95 cancers were detected.

"22,500 more women in the Auckland DHB area will now be able to access the free service, rather than facing a fee of around $100,” said Judith Tizard. "Breast screening is hugely important for all women and their families, and I urge as many as possible to have this vital health check.”

Judith Tizard said New Zealand had a world-class breast screening programme in BreastScreen Aotearoa, and early detection through regular mammograms offers the best chance of successful treatment.

The expanded programme has the potential to save another 32 lives a year across the country.

Free regular screening for breast cancer will be available to almost 600,000 women across the country, up from around 350,000. The Government is investing an extra $13 million in the programme in the first year.

Judith Tizard acknowledged there was some pressure for an even lower age range.

"The research currently available shows clearly a strong benefit in increasing the age-range, but it's less conclusive about taking the range below about 45."

Health Minister Annette King said yesterday she would look again at the possibility of lowering the age to 40, with the publication of a major study being done in the UK expected to publish its results in 2005.

"The Government is committed through strong public services to reducing the impact of cancer and saving lives. Funding the national screening programmes is just one priority. Increasing the numbers of related professionals is another," said Judith Tizard.

In 1999 there were 16 radiation therapy students beginning training and 46 in training across the three years of the degree course. Last year, 39 entered training and 103 were enrolled across the three years.
