Housing Minister Steve Maharey is offering to take Muriel Newman to the state house she described this afternoon as a state castle.

Answers to parliamentary questions indicate the valuation and location of the five most valuable Housing New Zealand Corporation houses in Auckland.

Steve Maharey said the valuations indicated the land on which the houses stood had appreciated in value very rapidly.

“It really is quite silly to claim that state houses are castles. Housing New Zealand Corporation provides modest housing to low income tenants – but certainly not palatial housing.

“The value of the homes cited by Dr Newman range from a very modest $41,000 through to $121,000. It’s the land on which they stand which has escalated very rapidly in recent years.

“What would Dr Newman have the Corporation do? Move all its tenants out of inner Auckland – away from jobs, public transport and public services.

“I’m sure if Dr Newman actually visited these properties she would see they were a world away from her own seaside residence,” Steve Maharey said.
