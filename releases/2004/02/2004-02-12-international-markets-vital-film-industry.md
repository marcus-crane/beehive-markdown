Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard says the Act Party’s attitude towards New Zealand’s creative industries is disdainful and depressing.

“Act’s out of touch broadcasting spokesman has a problem with the New Zealand Film Commission supporting our filmmakers to export through a series of well-managed missions to off-shore markets. However, the rest of us know that in a population of four million people, New Zealand films have to be distributed overseas to reach sizeable audiences and create economic return – just like our other export industries.

“Creating a successful film industry is not simply a matter of production and distribution. Marketing is absolutely vital. The film festivals attended by the Commission are an economically efficient means of promoting our growing film industry and reduces the need to travel to individual countries/markets.”

Judith Tizard added “I’m glad Ms Coddington is not a practicing journalist at present, because she’s still getting her ‘facts’ wrong. Her claim about what the Commission has spent on attending festivals and film markets is over by $100,000. The accurate figure is $745,097. That covered airfares, accommodation and daily expenses for 60 trips to 64 markets over the past four years. None of those trips was to Venice, as the member suggests.

“The Act member calls this ‘swanning off to international events’. However, these export missions are getting results. At the recent MIFED market in Milan – which Act calls an ‘exotic’ location but is otherwise known as one of the world’s key feature film markets – the Commission achieved 11 territory sales for The Locals and 12 more territories sold for Perfect Strangers including North America.”

Judith Tizard said that the $22 million Film Production Fund which has so far supported Whale Rider and Perfect Strangers, the new $10 million annual boost to the New Zealand Film Commission’s funding baseline, and the initiatives arising out of the Screen Production Taskforce, prove that the Labour-led government had put more money directly into New Zealand’s film industry than any government in New Zealand’s history.

“This is a sector in which passionate, dedicated people put in a huge amount of effort and innovation to create works which lift New Zealand’s international profile and earnings, yet Act would rather the world not know about it. Act’s arts policy is one of negligence and disdain.”
