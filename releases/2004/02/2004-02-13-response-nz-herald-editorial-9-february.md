I share the sense of urgency expressed in the NZ Herald editorial of February 9, but I am intrigued by its conclusion that a solution to Auckland's transport infrastructure problems is being delayed by "more talk."

Every Aucklander knows their transport problems have evolved over decades, through a combination of underfunding and poor governance with a myriad of bureaucratic structures. This government has blasted through the logjam with a package that was welcomed by the region's leaders.

One sure-fire way of guaranteeing no movement would have been for the government to impose a Wellington-designed package on the region. On the other hand, given the sums of money involved, a transport package with no central government input was unacceptable to the government. The Auckland region has its own unique needs and idiosyncrasies, but its transport infrastructure is a vital part of the wider national network.

These factors, plus the need for communities to be fully involved in transport planning, reinforce the need for a partnership approach. That is what is happening with the transport package "Investing for Growth" announced in December.

To recap briefly, the proposed transport package addresses the two critical issues facing Auckland's transport infrastructure: funding and governance. The new funding amounts to approximately $1.62 billion extra over 10 years for Auckland, made up of a special Crown contribution of $900 million, and money raised through a dedicated petrol excise - all of which will go to transport and none into general government coffers. As I said at the time of the announcement in December, the additional funding for Auckland will be focused on an accelerated programme of key strategic roads, within identified constraints on their buildability, as well as public transport, especially rail, and traffic demand management.

The funding is on top of existing transport spending in Auckland, which amounts to an estimated $356 million for the 2003/04 year. Spending to date has progressed roading projects like Spaghetti Junction, Grafton Gully, the Greenhithe deviation, and the Puhinui Interchange. It has also resulted in passenger transport funding almost doubling to $60 million between 2002/03 and 2003/04, and of course the government has purchased the rail tracks in Auckland for $87 million. So it is not correct, as implied in your editorial, that nothing is happening between now and 2005.

Given Auckland's current transport planning shambles everyone was calling for a more streamlined decision making process with a focus on delivery. For this reason the government has proposed a new transport entity, the Auckland Regional Transport Authority. ARTA Board members will be appointed by the Mayoral Forum and the ARC and be responsible to the ARC, an organisation accountable directly to Auckland voters.

It is only fair that the Regional Land Transport Strategy is redrafted to take account of the new transport environment and the extra $1.6 billion. Local authorities have always consulted communities on transport programmes. Ratepayers demand it, especially if a new motorway is planned through their backyards. The consultation is not designed to hold up progress, and I expect consultation will be finished before the first tranch of funding is released in July 2005. The reality is that Auckland commuters now have far more funding certainty than ever before, which is what Auckland was calling for.

While roading is critical to the Auckland region, we simply cannot motorway our way out of transport problems. This often only shifts the congestion a few kilometres further down the road. Congestion will only be cleared with a balanced approach involving all transport modes.

Encouraging more people into passenger transport will help reduce traffic volumes. For example, visitors to Wellington will be aware that if commuter train services were to end, the result would be roading chaos. And, contrary to assertions in your editorial, traffic demand management is not some madcap anti-car scheme. It is widely accepted in most OECD countries as a perfectly valid form of transport planning, and has been for some years.

Most Aucklanders know it's easier to get around the region during the school holidays. So, encouraging more Auckland students to walk, cycle or take public transport to school would reduce traffic volumes in peak periods. Traffic demand management is about using the existing roads we have more sensibly.

It is now up to Auckland to respond to the transport package. Formal feedback from Auckland's local and regional government is now awaited so the government can move quickly on the legislation and financial measures required.

Building world-class infrastructure is a key element of the government's growth and innovation framework. Our growing economy and population requires increased investment. The transport package is an important investment in New Zealand's economic infrastructure.
