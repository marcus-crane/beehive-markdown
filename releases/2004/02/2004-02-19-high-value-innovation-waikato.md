The [Waikato Innovation Park](http://www.innovationwaikato.co.nz/about.html) represents a major investment in high value research and economic development, Minister for Economic Development, Jim Anderton, said at the official opening of the Park today.

"We need far more high value industries in New Zealand if we are to strengthen our economy and raise living standards. The Waikato Innovation Park will help us develop the high value, high technology exports we need to do this," the Progressive leader said.

"Effective collaboration on technology development, resource and knowledge sharing will enable the Waikato and the country to make the most of our innovative and creative talents. I hope also that this initiative will result in spin off industries for the dairy, agriculture and biotechnology sectors," Jim Anderton said.

"The Waikato Innovation Park is an exciting development. By bringing science, research, technology and business together, we greatly improve our potential to increase economic growth for both the Waikato region and New Zealand.

"Waikato University informs me that the first new company to be developed at the park will be launched today. Ectus is a high tech electronic education company, a good example of the benefits of this approach," Jim Anderton said.
