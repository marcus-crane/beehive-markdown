A new Heartlands Service Centre was officially opened in Pahiatua this morning, serving the Tararua district.

The Centre is located in the Old Vet’s Building at 102 Main Street and will also be the base for an outreach, or mobile service, to Woodville (from Ormond Steet House) and Eketahuna (from the Health Centre). It restores face-to-face contact with 12 government agencies (ACC; Career Services; Child, Youth and Family; Community Employment Group; Housing New Zealand Corporation; Internal Affairs; Inland Revenue; the Maori Land Court; the Ministry of Justice; Te Puni Kokiri; Tenancy Services and Work and Income).

Steve Maharey said the Centre is one of 26 that have opened around across the country since 2001, cementing the government’s manifesto commitment to bring government agencies back to New Zealand’s small towns.

“Over recent years small towns across the country have experienced a flight of government departments. This has led to people in rural communities experiencing significant difficulties accessing government services.

"In Pahiatua a local coordinator, Shirley Hull, will provide the link between local people making enquiries and the government agencies. A public phone also provides a free 0800 line to any one of the 12 agencies. An on-site computer provides access to government websites. Forms and brochures are available—as are appointments with agency representatives,” Steve Maharey said.

Local MP Georgina Beyer welcomed the establishment of the Centre, saying it meets a real community need.

“Until now accessing government services from South Tararua has been an expensive and time consuming exercise with people either having to travel to larger towns or make toll calls.

“The new Centre will also provide a home for the Wairarapa Rural Education Activities Programme and has room to support other community agencies.

“Establishing the Centre has been very much a cooperative exercise involving Tararua Mayor Maureen Reynolds, Carolyn Barrell from Rangitane o Tamaki Nui-a-Rua, the Pahiatua and Eketahuna Community Boards, and Woodville District Vision. In Wellington I have been pushing Steve Maharey to set up this Heartlands service. The official opening of the Centre and outreach services today make all our efforts worthwhile.

“Having a Heartlands Service Centre up and running in our community is real evidence of the government’s commitment to rural New Zealand, and to the Tararua district in particular. I’m delighted our day has come,” Georgina Beyer said.
