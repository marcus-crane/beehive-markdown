New Zealand’s tourism sector continues to deliver economic benefits around the country.

According to the latest Statistics New Zealand Accommodation Survey, guest nights increased by five percent in December 2003, in comparison to the record figures of 2002, and nine percent on 2001. Nine of New Zealand’s 12 regions recorded increases, including Hawke’s Bay/Gisborne (19 percent), Otago (10 percent), and Canterbury (8 percent).

Minister of Tourism Mark Burton said that the figures were further proof of the tourism sector’s key role in the New Zealand economy.

“New Zealand tourism has seen outstanding growth over the past four years. 2003 was another record year, with over two million overseas visitor arrivals for the second year in a row.

“But even more important is that our international guests are staying longer and spending at a higher rate than ever. While visitor arrivals are forecast to grow by 5.7 percent annually to 2009, their expenditure is predicted to increase by 9.7 percent—nearly double the increase in numbers.

“Success such as this doesn’t happen by accident. This government has been committed from day one to working in partnership with the sector to build a sustainable, yield-driven industry—one that strikes a balance between managing the impacts of our growing tourism sector and maximising its obvious economic benefits.

“Tourism New Zealand continues to enjoy phenomenal success in marketing New Zealand to the kind of high-yield, high-quality visitors who are ideally suited to achieving this goal. They have worked tirelessly over the past four years to promote New Zealand as one of the world’s most sought-after destinations, and the world is taking notice.

“Last month, out of a field of 1500 international competitors, TNZ was honoured in New York City with an international public relations award for the 100% Pure marketing campaign. Treetops Lodge and Wharekauhau Country Estate were named among the world’s best lodges in this year’s prestigious Andrew Harper’s Hideaway Report. And in January, the staff at Lonely Planet named New Zealand as the world’s best destination for the second year in a row.

“Tourism already supports one in eleven jobs, contributes nine percent of GDP, and is second only to dairy in export earnings. I see it as New Zealand’s most exciting and potentially valuable industry, and look forward to continuing to work in partnership with the sector towards even greater successes in the future.”
