New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to Singapore will be career diplomat Richard Grant, Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced today.

Dr Grant is currently Deputy Secretary in charge of trade policy in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

“The seniority of the appointment reflects the fact that Singapore is a key partner for New Zealand in Asia and the two countries are good friends,” Mr Goff said.

“We collaborate closely with Singapore through our dialogue partnership with ASEAN, and in a range of regional and international forums such as APEC, the ASEAN Regional Forum, the Five Power Defence Arrangement, the Commonwealth and the United Nations.

“Both countries are keen to make the most of our long political, economic and defence ties which continue to deepen and strengthen,” Mr Goff said.

New Zealand and Singapore share a strong export focus and pursue common objectives in the World Trade Organisation. In November 2000, Singapore and New Zealand concluded a landmark Closer Economic Partnership Agreement (CEP) opening up opportunities for trade, business, and investment.

Dr Grant has previously as served as High Commissioner in London, Ambassador to France, Ambassador to Germany, and as Consul-General in Sydney and Noumea.

Dr Grant will replace Nigel Moore in Singapore. Prior to taking up his appointment in Singapore in August, Dr Grant will take up a visiting fellowship at Oxford University.
