Recently appointed Malaysian Minister of Consumer Affairs and Domestic Trade, Hon. Datuk Dr. Jamaluddin bin Jarjis is visiting New Zealand this week, as a guest of the Government, to discuss a range of consumer, intellectual property and other business issues.

Hon. Datuk Dr. Jamaluddin bin Jarjis met Minister of Consumer Affairs and Associate Minister of Commerce Judith Tizard today to discuss consumer protection policy, consumer awareness and consumer disputes mechanisms in New Zealand. The Ministers also discussed New Zealand's programme of intellectual property law reform and the measures New Zealand has adopted to strengthen the enforcement of intellectual property law.

“New Zealand has strong official, trade, business and education links with Malaysia. I am pleased to be able to discuss these issues with my counterpart from Malaysia and to find ways we can further develop the relationship that exists between our two countries,” said Judith Tizard.

Minister Jamaluddin is also meeting Consumers’ Institute Director David Russell, Paula Rebstock and Geoff Thorn from the Commerce Commission and Disputes Tribunal Principal Referee, Grant Aislabie. These meetings will provide him with more insight into the way New Zealand consumer policy is put into practice.

He will pay calls on Hon Jim Anderton (Minister of Economic Development, Hon Lianne Dalziel (Minister of Commerce) and Hon Dr Michael Cullen (Deputy Prime Minister).

Malaysia is New Zealand’s largest export market in South East Asia and in his capacity as Domestic Trade Minister, Minister Jamaluddin is also meeting with a number of New Zealand companies engaged in exporting goods to Malaysia.
