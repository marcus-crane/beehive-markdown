Racing Minister Damien O'Connor today welcomed an announcement that the Auckland Racing Club is lifting minimum stakes at Ellerslie to $10,000.

The minimum stakes - $3000 higher than previously and now the highest in the country - will apply to all races, including maidens and jumping races.

Mr O'Connor said the news was good not only for Ellerslie, but for the New Zealand racing industry as a whole.

"Increased stakes mean bigger fields, which mean increased betting turnover.  
And increased turnover leads to higher revenue for the whole industry.

"Raising stakes at the bottom end is just as important as lifting them at the top end, so all racehorse owners have a realistic expectation of a return on their investment.

"The Auckland Racing Club (ARC) should be congratulated for setting the highest minimum stake benchmark in the country. The increase cements the club's status as the country's flagship club and lays a great foundation for its future.

"The challenge is for other clubs to follow the lead and lift their stakes also."

The minimum stake hike is being funded through increases in sponsorship and interest income and brings the ARC closer to its Australian counterparts.

ARC chairman Lyn Stevens said the stakes increase was part of the club's stategic plan, which involved increasing stake levels by between $3 and $4 million over a 5-6 year period.
