Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard has announced the appointment and re-appointment of members to the National War Memorial Advisory Council.

David Cox has been reappointed for a further term expiring on 30 June 2004 as one of the NZ Returned Service Association’s representatives, in line with the NZRSA’s wish that their National President should always be one of their nominees to the Council. David Cox has served on the Council since 1996, and has served as Dominion President (now National President) of the NZRSA since 1993.

Colonel Joe Walker, a retired colonel with thirty years’ Army service, has been appointed on the recommendation of the Chief of Defence Force for a three-year term to 30 November 2006. Joe Walker was Comptroller of the Household at Government House for six years and is currently National Manager for Regional Fundraising for the Royal New Zealand Foundation of the Blind.

Judith Tizard expressed her confidence in the new and reappointed members. “I am delighted that these people have agreed to serve on the National War Memorial Advisory Council. They bring an impressive range of skills and experience to their positions and I am confident that the Council will be well served by them.”

The National War Memorial Advisory Council advises the Ministers for Arts, Culture and Heritage on all matters relevant to the control and maintenance of the National War Memorial.
