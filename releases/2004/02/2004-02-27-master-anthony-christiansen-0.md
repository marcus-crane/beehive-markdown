In the course of vetting of the judge, I was aware that the Otago Women Lawyers Association had raised a concern.

I had therefore asked that a further check be made, to see whether there was any outstanding complaint against the former judge.

There was no outstanding complaint.

He was qualified for the position, and was the preferred candidate.

The position was different to the one he had previously held.

I take concerns raised very seriously, but the fact remains that there was no outstanding complaint at the time of the appointment.
