Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard has announced appointments and re-appointment of members to the Council of Creative New Zealand.

Professor Ngahuia Te Awekotuku, a writer and academic based in Hamilton, has been re-appointed as a Council member for a further term to 31 October 2006. Professor Te Awekotuku has an extensive background in the arts (particularly Mâori) as a curator, lecturer and critic.

Dr James Ng, a retired family doctor from Dunedin with a long association with the New Zealand Chinese community, has been appointed to the Council for a term of three years to 31 October 2006. Dr Ng is the author of a number of publications about Chinese people in New Zealand and has contributed biographies to the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography. He was awarded the CNZM in 1996 for community service.

Alick Shaw, Deputy Mayor of Wellington and chair of the Wellington City Council Arts, Culture and Library Committee, has also been appointed to the Council for a term of three years. He is active in the cultural activities in the Wellington area, being chair of the Wellington Sinfonia, a member of the Embassy Theatre Trust, and involved with Creative New Zealand’s Local Arts Funding Scheme.

Judith Tizard expressed her confidence in the new and reappointed members. “I am delighted that these people have all agreed to serve or continue serving on the Creative New Zealand Council. They bring a wide range of skills and cultural perspectives to the Council and I am confident that Creative New Zealand will greatly benefit from their contributions in its developing work.”

Creative New Zealand encourages, promotes and supports the arts in New Zealand. It has an Arts Council and two boards, the Arts Board and Te Waka Toi each with seven members. The Council sets policy and strategic direction and has a major role in promoting and advocating for the arts.
