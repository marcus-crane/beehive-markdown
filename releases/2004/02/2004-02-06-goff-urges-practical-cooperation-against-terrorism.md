Foreign Minister Phil Goff underlined the importance of Asia-Pacific countries establishing clear channels of cooperation in the fight against terrorism, following a counter-terrorism meeting in Bali.

“Governments have to respect national boundaries; terrorists do not. That’s why we have to build the closest possible cooperation to counter terrorist activities,” Mr Goff said.

The two-day Regional Ministerial Meeting on Counter-Terrorism was co-sponsored by Indonesia and Australia, and brought together 26 countries and 20 Ministerial-level representatives, including United States Attorney-General John Ashcroft.

Speaking to the meeting, Mr Goff recalled the murderous 2002 bomb attacks in Bali, not far from the conference venue. He urged the countries present to take concrete steps to prevent such senseless acts of terrorism.

“We need to look at practical improvements to remove impediments to cooperation, and ensure a comprehensive and effective framework for counter terrorism is in place,” he said.

As a minister whose portfolios span both foreign policy and justice, Mr Goff was invited to address how regional legal arrangements could be strengthened to aid the fight against terror.

Among the suggestions he put to the meeting was offering technical assistance to help smaller states close jurisdictional gaps that terrorists might exploit. He also recommended an expert group be established to find ways of facilitate extradition requests and other mutual legal assistance among countries in the Asia-Pacific.

Ministers welcomed the ideas for practical action to build cooperation, and agreed to act upon them, Mr Goff said after the meeting.

“It was heartening to find that everyone spoke absolutely with one voice on the need to condemn and counter all forms of terrorism,” he said.

“This isn’t a problem that any country, least of all New Zealand, can tackle on its own. We want to move forward from here to put in place practical measures for practical cooperation, and I’ve made it clear that New Zealand is committed to working closely with its regional partners to make sure that happens.”
