Wanted: budding politicians to take part in the fourth [Youth Parliament](http://www.youthaffairs.govt.nz/sec.cfm?i=8).

Got an ambition to run the country? Good at kissing babies, outwitting opponents and putting the world to rights? Thick skin? Rebel with a cause? Attitude to burn? Are you a media manipulator extraordinaire with a firm handshake/hongi and a talent for political point-scoring? If so, then this could be the job for you!

This year Parliament will host the fourth Youth Parliament on 16-17 August – and this year is extra special as the 2004 Youth Parliament marks the 150-year anniversary of the New Zealand Parliament, 30 years since the voting age was lowered to 18, and 10 years since the first Youth Parliament.

Young people (aged 16-18 years) are now being invited to put their names forward for selection as a Youth MP for their area.

Youth Affairs Minister John Tamihere says he is confident that the Parliament will attract applicants of a high calibre with a fresh and positive approach that will be an inspiration to their real-life counterparts.

During the two-day Youth Parliament, the 120 Youth MPs will take part in mock debates, ask parliamentary questions, host select committees questioning real Government agencies and engage with a youth "press gallery".

The Youth Parliament aims to help young people understand and participate in parliamentary processes and learn how to influence decision-making, and gives them an opportunity to have their views heard.

Youth MPs will be selected by their local list and electorate MPs by May 21, and nominations are now open. Anyone interested in becoming a Youth MP should contact their MP or go to the website of the Ministry of Youth Development ([www.myd.govt.nz](http://www.myd.govt.nz/)) for more information.
