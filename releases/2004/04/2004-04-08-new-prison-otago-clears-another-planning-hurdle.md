The Corrections Minister Paul Swain says the proposed new regional prison in Otago has cleared another planning hurdle with the recommendation by the Clutha District Council's independent commissioners.

The commissioners appointed by the Clutha District Council have accepted in principle the proposal to designate [a site at Milburn](http://www.corrections.govt.nz/public/AboutUs/RegionalPrisons/locationotago.html) for the new Otago Region Corrections Facility.

"This brings us a step closer to building a much-needed new facility for Otago inmates," says Mr Swain.

Mr Swain says he will carefully consider the recommendation.

"I have up to 30 working days to formally indicate to the Council whether I accept or reject the recommendation.

"I'm very pleased that the commissioners have accepted the designation proposal in principle," he says.

"While the Commissioners have made some recommendations around the proposal, it would be inappropriate for me to respond in detail while I am at this formal stage of the RMA process. However some of the issues were covered in the evidence presented by the Corrections Department, and the Department will be able to comment in more detail."

Mr Swain says the facility is urgently needed, given the forecasted increase in inmate numbers.

The [Ministry of Justice forecast](http://www.justice.govt.nz/pubs/reports/2004/prison-forecast/update.html) estimates there will be around 7400 inmates in jail in 2010, an increase of 1300 on the 6100 inmates in 2003.

"The forecast says the predicted increase in the prison population is a reflection of legislative changes and a series of initiatives undertaken by this government,"

"The public referendum in 1999 showed New Zealanders wanted tougher measures taken against criminals, and the government has acted on that."

"The 59-bed Dunedin Prison, built in 1895, is well past its use-by date and too small to be very effective. A benefit of the new prison is that it will allow Otago inmates to serve their sentences locally and maintain family/whanau links - an important ingredient in their rehabilitation."

"I hope the local community will keep an open mind about a corrections facility in the neighbourhood. There are many benefits a prison offers. Its construction will boost the local economy and it will generate an ongoing contribution through staff wages and buying goods and services."

"There will also be job opportunities and I commend a career in the Prison Service as very worthwhile."

The commissioners' recommendation follows a six-day public hearing in December 2003, to consider the designation application and hear from submitters and the Corrections Department.

Organisations and individuals who made a submission on the designation application, and the Council, have the opportunity to appeal the Minister's decision to the Environment Court if they wish.

The new Otago facility is planned to open in 2006, one of four new corrections facilities opening between 2005 and 2007.

The modern facility will provide a range of rehabilitative programmes and may run a working farm, teaching inmates valuable employment-related skills.

**Background information:**

**Statutory timeframes**

Within 30 working days of the recommendation being received, the Corrections Minister must advise the Clutha District Council whether he accepts or rejects the recommendation, possibly modifying some of the conditions.

Within 15 working days of receiving the Corrections Minister's decision, the Clutha District Council must advise all submitters and directly-affected landowners/occupiers of the decision.

Within 15 working days of receiving the Minister's decision, the Council and/or submitters may lodge an appeal on the decision to the Environment Court.

**The designation**

Under the Resource Management Act, a designation is a provision in a District Plan that relates to a specific area of land and allows certain activities to be carried out on that land. In this case - the proposal is to build and operate a prison at the chosen site in Milburn, near Milton, in southern Otago.

The designation recommendation includes a list of conditions that the Department must follow to build and run the prison. These conditions are to minimise the facility's potential effects and relate to matters such as the scope of the designation, construction, traffic access, prison lighting, noise, signage and landscaping.

One recommended condition is to establish a community liaison group with representatives from the community, Department, local council, and police, as an ongoing point of community input and involvement with the prison.
