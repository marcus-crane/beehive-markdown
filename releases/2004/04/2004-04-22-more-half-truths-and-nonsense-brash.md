“The public is entitled to expect a higher standard from the Leader of the Opposition than the collection of half truths and nonsense trotted out by Don Brash today,” said Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen.

He was commenting on Dr Brash’s speech this morning to the Marine Industry Association; an occasion Dr Brash used to – again - misrepresent the [government’s policy on the foreshore and seabed](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/foreshore/home.cfm).

“In his rush to play politics on this most sensitive of issues, Dr Brash has overlooked an apparent area of agreement between National and the government.

“He says National has no problem recognising limited customary rights, but those customary rights have to be proven. That is exactly what the [legislation]()"&gt;only forecast around four to five years ahead and use technical assumptions beyond that point.”
