All War Disablement Pensions and Allowances and Veteran’s Pensions and Concessions will increase from 1 April as part of the annual cost of living adjustment.

Veterans’ Affairs Minister George Hawkins said the 1.55 per cent increase in net rates equates to the rise in the cost of living for the year to December 2003, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

Examples of the increases in the gross weekly rates are:

·Veterans on a 100 per cent War Disablement Pension will receive a $2.48 increase to $162.24.

·Veterans on a 160 percent War Disablement Pension will receive a $3.96 increase to $259.58.

·Those receiving a Surviving Spouse’s Pension will receive an increase of $1.83 to $119.68.

·The Attendant’s Allowance will increase $4.59 to $300.49.

·The Veteran’s Pension for a Married (Qualified Spouse) will increase $7.52 to $457.04.

·The Lump Sum Payment on Death of a Veteran will rise $69.41 to $4,547.47.

Mr Hawkins said other allowances to be adjusted in line with increases in the Consumers Price Index include clothing and travel allowances and Funeral Grants.

Adjustment of War Disablement Pensions and Allowances and Veteran’s Pensions and Concessions in line with the Consumers Price Index occurs annually.
