Last night's shooting of a man by police in Auckland underlines that policing is a dangerous job in which apparently routine callouts can escalate into violent confrontations, Police Minister George Hawkins says.

"Luckily, however, we still live in a country where firearms are not often used by police and such incidents remain rare," Mr Hawkins said.

The shooting occurred last night after police were called to assist North Shore City Council security officers following up a noise complaint in Birkdale.

As one man was being arrested, another was shot after advancing towards police with a machete. The man is reported to be in a stable condition in Auckland Hospital.

Mr Hawkins said the nature of police work means they are always acutely aware any situation they attend can change without warning, and of the need to keep in mind their own safety and that of the public.

"This type of incident is again a reminder that policing will always have within it a component of the unknown," Mr Hawkins said.

Police and the Police Complaints Authority have each begun an investigation into the incident.
