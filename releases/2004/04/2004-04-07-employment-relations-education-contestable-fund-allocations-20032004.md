In particular:

- the aim of employment relations education is to increase skills and knowledge of employment relations matters to enable employers, employees and unions to deal with each other in good faith and build productive relationships

**When was it established?**

The ERE Contestable Fund was established in October 2000 and has been operation for three and a half years.
