The Crown has agreed to the New Plymouth District Council's request to purchase the Waitara lands, subject to several conditions including the outcome of court action.

The Waitara Leaseholders' Association has argued to the High Court that the Council holds the Waitara lands in trust for Waitara residents and should not sell the lands to the Crown. The Leaseholders Association has asked the court to direct the Council to allow leaseholders to freehold their land.

Margaret Wilson said that, subject to the outcome of the Court proceedings, the Crown would be prepared to include the Waitara lands in a settlement of Te Atiawa's historical Treaty claims.

Any purchase by the Crown would also be subject to a settlement with Te Atiawa being finalised. The Council would continue to own and manage the lands until then.

The Waitara lands form part of the historical Pekapeka Block.

"Because of the importance of Pekapeka to Te Atiawa, and because it was unjustly confiscated by the Crown, it makes sense for the Crown to take this opportunity to secure these properties for use in Te Atiawa's settlement."

The Crown and Te Atiawa negotiators signed a heads of agreement to settle all Te Atiawa's historical claims in Taranaki in 1999, which included financial redress of $34 million, Margaret Wilson said.

"I am aware that the Council intends to advocate for the inclusion of these lands on top of this existing Crown offer. However, the Crown is not prepared to revisit the agreed sum. The lands will be included as part of the $34 million."

"The Crown must treat all claimant groups fairly. It would be unfair to other iwi who have reached settlement, including other Taranaki iwi, if the value of these properties was in addition to Te Atiawa's agreed settlement amount."
