Energy Minister Pete Hodgson has released the latest edition of the Ministry of Economic Development’s Energy Data File, a comprehensive biannual volume of energy statistics.

The January 2004 edition of the Energy Data File includes statistics on energy supply, demand and prices and shows that:

- Total primary energy supply in the year to September 2003 declined by about 1 percent, due primarily to a 17 percent reduction in gas supply (mainly due to lower Maui gas production) and a 9 percent reduction in geothermal supply. This was partially offset by a 25 percent increase in coal supply, 9 percent increase in imports of oil and oil products, 9 percent increase in hydro and 5 percent increase in wood bioenergy.
- Total final energy consumption for the same period increased by 7.7 percent. Oil consumption increased by about 7 percent and coal use (including exports) by 25 percent. This was partially offset by a reduction in gas use for electricity generation (including cogeneration) of about 10 percent and a reduction of about 35 percent in gas use for petrochemical production, primarily methanol production.
- In real terms (March 2003 dollars) the national weighted average electricity price for the year to March 2003 was 10.8 cents a kilowatt-hour, an increase of about 5 percent compared with 2002. Again in real terms, average residential electricity prices (incl. GST) at 15.5 c/kWh were 4 percent higher than in 2002; average commercial electricity prices (excl. GST) at 10.8 c/kWh were nearly 6 percent higher; and average industrial electricity prices (excl. GST) at 7.2 c/kWh were about 8 percent higher.
