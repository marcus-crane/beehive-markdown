Operation Ark, a major new conservation initiative, has been triggered following news that rat and stoat plagues could again be imminent in the remaining habitat of the fragile orange fronted kakariki (parakeet) and mohua (yellowhead).

"Numbers of orange-fronted kakariki and mohua more than halved following rat and stoat plagues which suddenly irrupted in South Island beech forests in 2000 and 2001," Conservation Minister Chris Carter said today.

"These plagues are supposed to be periodic events but specialist monitoring by DOC has recently established that there is a significantly increased risk of yet more plagues in three areas of the South Island again this year.

"Two of the areas where the plague risk is highest are the Hurunui and Hawdon valleys in North Canterbury, where the remaining 150 orange-fronted kakariki are located, and significant populations of mohua," Mr Carter said.

"Last year, I announced the development of Operation Ark, a rapid response initiative designed to blunt the impact of these plagues. Due to the new threat, I am announcing that Operation Ark has been formally triggered in the Hurunui and the Hawdon valleys. I am also announcing a further nine areas that have been identified to progressively form part of this initiative in the future, " Mr Carter said.

Operation Ark involves the progressive expansion of possum control and tens of thousands of stoat and rat traps in permanent trap lines throughout eleven Ark areas. Once this infrastructure is in place, special monitoring will take place in each of the Ark areas to identify when a plague might be about to occur. At that point, additional heavy-duty predator control will swing into place, including the possible use of 1080 and other toxins.

"The idea is we respond immediately and robustly to smash plagues before they get established," Mr Carter said.

The Ark areas have been selected by a team of Department of Conservation (DOC) experts and span 145,500 hectares throughout the South Island. They include four of the best sites for populations of mohua (yellowhead) and whio (blue duck), sites containing the last two populations of short-tailed peka peka (bat), as well as the key sites for orange fronted kakariki.

"Operation Ark is to have a phased introduction as funding becomes available to roll out the possum control and trap lines necessary for the initiative," Mr Carter said.

"We are in a position to immediately bring the Hurunui and Hawdon valleys on line because there are already stoat and rat trap lines in place. We are also preparing for Operation Ark in and around the Clinton Valley in Fiordland National Park, even though there is no plague predicted in this area this year.

"The Clinton area is home to a crucial whio population, and we want to improve the trapping infrastructure in it as a priority to ensure we are able to trigger Operation Ark if a plague occurs there in future," Mr Carter said.

The eleven Operation Ark areas are:

Hurunui (South Branch)  
Location: Inland Canterbury  
Size:8000 ha  
Key Species: mohua, orange fronted kakariki  
Hurunui mainland island is in the valley of the south branch of the Hurunui River in Lake Sumner Forest Park. The goal is to protect the main population of mohua in Canterbury, and one of the three known sites where orange fronted kakariki, are found.

Hawdon  
Location:Arthur’s Pass, Canterbury  
Size:6,000 ha  
Key Species: orange fronted kakariki, mohua  
The area is dominated by the Hawdon River which drains north to south and includes East Hawdon Stream. Forest ecosystems include mountain beech forest, some red beech and a small amount of silver beech with some patches of Hall’s totara – kaikawaka forest. The Hawdon is one of only three sites where orange fronted kakariki remain. In addition populations of mohua are present as well as a reasonably intact assemblage of the full suite of eastern beech forest bird species.

Wangapeka/Fyfe/Owen  
Location:Kahurangi National Park  
Size:20,000 ha  
Key Species: whio  
These catchments drain from one of New Zealand’s most outstanding karst landscapes, the Mt Owen massif. The head of these rivers are steep and rugged, flowing down to lowland forest. The valleys are thickly forested with red beech dominating the lowlands grading into silver then mountain beech higher up, typical of much of Kahurangi National Park. The fauna is typical of Kahurangi with common forest bird species present and the occassional kaka, great spotted kiwi, and falcon. The presence of whio in reasonable numbers, together with easy access to the lower reaches of the rivers, makes this an obvious site to protect whio on the eastern side of Kahurangi National Park.

Clinton/Arthur/Cleddau  
Location:Fiordland National Park  
Size:20,000 ha  
Key Species: whio  
The Milford track passes through the Clinton and Arthur Valleys. The road from Milford Sound to the Homer tunnel runs through the Cleddau Valley. The valley floor and sides are covered in beech forest, which gives way to snow covered peaks. The major reason for protecting this valley system is that it supports a significant population of whio. The valleys also support significant populations of kiwi, kaka, kea, and falcon.

Catlins  
Location: Coastal Otago  
Size:8,000 ha  
Key Species: mohua  
The vegetation includes valley-side podocarp/kamahi forests, montane rata/kamahi forests, localised silver beech forest and sub-alpine rata-Hall’s totara-kaikawaka-pink pine forests. The Catlins contains populations of kaka, yellow crowned kakariki (widespread) and mohua. Some of the few remaining whio occur east of the Main Divide. Falcon and fernbird are widespread in suitable habitats. Reptiles include jewelled gecko, forest gecko and green skink.

Oparara/Ugly  
Location:Kahurangi National Park  
Size:20,000 ha  
Key Species: whio, short tailed peka peka  
The forest is mainly mixed beech podocarp, with both silver and red beech. There are outstanding limestone features including arches, caves and within the caves internationally important fossil remains. Whio are present in the Oparara, Kohaihai and Ugly Rivers. Other key threatened fauna present include one of only two known populations of short-tailed bats in the South Island, great spotted kiwi and the threatened giant snail Powelliphanta annectens.

Moeraki  
Location:South Westland  
Size:20,000 ha  
Key Species whio  
The forest is mainly mixed beech podocarp hardwood forest with beech mistletoes common. Whio are present in the Moeraki River, the main river in the site. Other threatened fauna present include South Island kaka, beech mistletoes and possibly long-tailed bats and mohua. The last record for mohua was in the mid 1990’s. Long-tailed bats have been recorded nearby.

Dart/Caples  
Location:Mount Aspiring National Park  
Size:20,000 ha  
Key Species: mohua, whio,  
The Dart/Caples area is a system of valleys running from Lake Wakatipu to the main divide. It includes the popular tramping track, the Routeburn. The forest is dominated by red beech, but that dominance shifts to mountain beech towards the bush line and silver beech as rainfall increases near the divide. The area is home to the densest population of mohua in the country. Long-tailed bats are also found in good numbers. The Dart has the most diverse fauna in the Mount Aspiring National Park.

Blue Mountains  
Location:Southland hill country  
Size:12,400 ha  
Key Species: mohua  
Situated east of Tapanui, the Blue Mountains form a low mountain range (1020m) covered with a mixture of native vegetation (beech forest/tussock) and exotic pine plantations, surrounded by farmland. The major reason for protecting this area is that it supports one of the most significant mohua populations in New Zealand. The Blue Mountains also support falcon.

Landsborough  
Location:South Westland  
Size:17,000 ha  
Key Species: whio, mohua  
The Landsborough is dominated by silver beech with Peraxilla mistletoe spp. abundant. Mohua are found throughout the Landsborough Valley, and is considered the best mohua site on the West Coast. Other threatened species present includes whio, long-tail bats, South Island kaka and beech mistletoes. Stoat control to protect mohua and whio is already underway in a small section of the valley. Ongoing sustained possum control is underway throughout the valleys.

Eglinton Valley  
Location:Fiordland National Park  
Size:8,000 ha  
Key Species: peka peka, mohua  
The main road from Te Anau into Milford Sound passes through the Eglinton Valley before reaching the Homer Tunnel. The valley floor and sides are covered in beech forest, which gives way to snow covered peaks. The major reason for protecting the Eglinton Valley is that it supports one of only two short-tailed peka peka populations in the South Island. The valley also supports significant populations of kaka, mohua and mistletoe. Considerable research has already been invested in the Eglinton.

**Operation Ark – Questions and Answers**

Where are plagues expected to occur this year?

A high risk of a plague has been identified in the Hurunui and Hawdon valleys in North Canterbury, and in the Catlins in Coastal Otago.

We can't be 100 per cent sure whether a plague will occur, or what type (rat or stoat or both) but we know that the beech trees in these areas are likely to fruit heavily in the summer significantly increasing the likelihood of a plague.

What will happen in the Hawdon and Hurunui valleys as a result of Operation Ark being triggered?

In the first instance, trapping of stoats and rats will intensify. Traps will be checked and emptied much more often, requiring more manpower.

Once a plague is confirmed, DOC will identify particular hotspots where there are higher numbers of rats or stoats and these will be hit hard with the use of racumin toxin in bait bags. If this effort fails to keep rats in particular, below critical levels, then aerial 1080 will be considered.

The aim is to allow the bird species in the area atleast a twelve-week window of opportunity to fledge chicks.

Why has DOC chosen to do work in the Clinton Ark Area for Operation Ark and not the Catlins where there is a likelihood of a plague this year?

For Operation Ark to work we must develop trapping infrastructure in each of the Ark areas first. It takes time and money to lay down this infrastructure.

The Catlins doesn't have this infrastructure in place. It is home to a significant population of mohua, which DOC would like to protect. But mohua are also present in significant numbers in the Hurunui and Hawdon valleys, where Operation Ark will occur this year.

DOC has faced the choice of protecting the Catlins this year or accepting a potential loss in the area and laying in the infrastructure necessary for Operation Ark in and around the Clinton Valley in Fiordland, where there is a very significant population of the nationally critical species, whio.

Because there are no whio in Hurunui and Hawdon valleys, DOC has chosen to do the Clinton Ark Area first to ensure that Operation Ark provides some protection to whio as fast as it is possible to do so, in case of a plague in the future.

How much will be spent on Operation Ark this year?

DOC has earmarked $900,000 this year for the initiative. A proportion of this will be spent laying the trapping infrastructure into the Clinton Ark Area, and the remainder will be used for the plague response in the Hawdon and Hurunui area. If the predicted plagues in these areas do not occur then the left over money will probably be used laying infrastructure in the Catlins instead.
