The results of the first comprehensive and systematic assessment of research quality in many of the country's tertiary education organisations reveal much to be proud of, Associate Tertiary Education Minister Steve Maharey said today.

"The Quality Evaluation of New Zealand's research academics in the Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) report from the Tertiary Education Commission confirms what has long been believed, but not independently verified until now - that our world-class researchers are spread across virtually all the major fields of academic inquiry.

"Some academic disciplines in New Zealand - particularly the longer-established ones - have strong and productive research cultures. 'Younger' disciplines which are just starting out need time to develop and build their culture.

"Since taking office in 1999, part of the coalition government's vision to strengthen our tertiary education research community has been to strengthen our tertiary education research community so it can make an increasingly significant contribution to the nation's economic and social development. The development and implementation of the PBRF is a significant part of this.

"Focused specialisation, collaboration and co-operation are essential features of a thriving and successful culture of research excellence. The PBRF allows us to reward research excellence and move away from a crude 'bums on seats' approach to funding research which was based on student numbers.

"Right now, it's important that everyone with a stake in the standard of research in our tertiary education organisations takes a hard look at the results of the PRBF evaluation and asks what the results really mean, where the opportunities for improvement are and what could be done next.

"The Government has a role to play in this. Already, we have committed an additional $33 million into the PBRF over the next four years.

"The tertiary education sector has started along a pathway which encourages sustained research excellence. The results in the PBRF report released today show the journey has begun with a very large and important step forward."
