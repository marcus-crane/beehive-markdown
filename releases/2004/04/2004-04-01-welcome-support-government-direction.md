Proposals by United Future to revamp Child Youth and Family services in New Zealand are a welcome confirmation that the government’s current policy direction is on the right track.

Associate Social Development Minister Ruth Dyson said that while United Future’s newly released strategy offered some clear identification of problems, these issues were canvassed in last year’s Baseline Review of CYF.

“There is little in the party’s proposals that differ from the positive government measures already being implemented.

“I am pleased that United Future has adopted the same key initiatives that were recommended in the Baseline Review. It provided some much needed direction about where positive changes could be made and those changes are already being made.

“I agree with United’s suggestion that relevant agencies need to work more closely together, and this collaboration is already in place with many agencies signing up to joint Memorandums of Understanding,” Ruth Dyson said.
