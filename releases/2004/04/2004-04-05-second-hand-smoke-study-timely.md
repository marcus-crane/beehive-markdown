The alarming findings of a second hand smoke study, published today in the British Medical Journal, are an important wake-up call, says Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor.

The study, led by Dr Sarah Hill from the Wellington School of Medicine and Health Science, shows that people living with smokers have a 15 per cent higher risk of death than those living in a smoke-free household.

"Second hand smoke kills about 350 people a year in this country and hospitalises more than 500 under two year-olds from chest infections," Mr O'Connor said.

"Dr Hill's findings are very timely, because they provide further evidence that passive smoking kills."

People often didn’t realise that, in some cases, second hand smoke could be even more dangerous than mainstream smoke, because of higher toxin levels, Mr O'Connor said.

The release of the study's findings coincides with the launch this week of the Health Sponsorship Council and Quit Group's hard-hitting new television commercials, encouraging parents to protect their children from second-hand smoke.

"Children are much more vulnerable to second hand smoke, because they've got smaller, more sensitive lungs," said Mr O'Connor. "The advertisements will remind people living in a house with children that the only place for a cigarette is outside."

Mr O'Connor will speak at the launch of the second hand smoke commercials on Wednesday at Parliament.
