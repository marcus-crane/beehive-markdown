A new primary school and early childhood service are planned for central Frankton, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced on a visit to the site today.

"These new facilities between the Frankton Events Centre and golf course, will meet the anticipated population growth of primary school students in the Wakatipu Basin," Trevor Mallard said.

"I am delighted the area will have much needed additional facilities, including shared sports fields and car parking, in the heart of Frankton.

"Students will also be able to take advantage of the existing recreation facilities and a swimming pool the Queenstown Lakes District Council are planning for the Events Centre land.

"Otago MP David Parker has worked hard with the Council and the Ministry of Education to provide facilities in a central location that will benefit the wider community."

The Ministry is formalising an agreement with the Department of Conservation to exchange lakefront land previously bought for a school site in 1958, now deemed inadequate to meet projected roll growth, for a larger block of land at the new site.

This agreement is subject to the new site being designated for education purposes through normal town planning procedures and the playcentre facilities on the now redundant former school site being removed as part of the land exchange deal.

The land exchange would see the Department of Conservation establish a reserve area on the lakefront site.

"Building a replacement playcentre on the new site is planned to start later this year," Trevor Mallard said.

"Further consultation with the local education community, to ascertain the type of primary school and the year it will open, will follow the land acquisition."

While the new site is a straight land swap the new facilities are expected to cost around $5 million.
