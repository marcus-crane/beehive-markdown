Ways to help meet New Zealand’s changing housing needs over the next 10 years are outlined in a discussion document released today by Housing Minister Steve Maharey.

Building the Future: Towards a New Zealand Housing Strategy outlines key housing issues and a proposed way forward to achieve quality, affordable housing for all.

Speaking at the launch of the New Zealand Housing Strategy discussion document at Housing New Zealand Corporation’s Talbot Park community renewal project site, Steve Maharey said there are a number of pressure points within the housing sector.

“Rising house prices and rents, especially in high pressure areas, have put many households under stress

“There are concerns about housing quality and affordability. We have an ageing population and people from many different ethnic backgrounds. Different types of housing for many different needs are required.

“While the government remains committed to boosting the availability of social housing to meet the needs of the most disadvantaged in the community, there needs to be a wider strategy that addresses housing issues for all New Zealanders.

“The discussion document summarises the key housing issues facing New Zealand today and outlines a proposed plan of action under six areas:  
·improving housing assistance and affordability  
·responding to housing markets under stress  
·innovative home ownership programmes  
·developing the private rental sector  
·improving housing quality  
·building capacity and capability across the housing sector.

“One-size fits all housing policies will not address the specific needs of the range of New Zealand’s communities and housing markets.

“Instead we need a collaborative approach involving local and central government, hapu and iwi, business and industry, community groups and communities to respond to the specific needs of a particular place.

“This discussion document seeks public opinion to ensure we have the right balance of issues to move ahead and that we are all heading in the same direction.

“The government hopes the discussion document will encourage debate about housing and attract submissions from a wide range of people. It’s important that we hear views from everyone, regardless of their housing circumstances,” Steve Maharey said.

Consultation on the housing strategy takes place over the next three months by way of public submissions and a series of regional meetings. Submissions close Friday 5pm, 30 July.
