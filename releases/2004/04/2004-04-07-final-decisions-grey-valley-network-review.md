Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today his final decisions on the review of schools in the Grey Valley, West Coast area, a move that will unlock approximately $3.3 million in extra resources for the education of local students.

"I have been impressed with the level and depth of the advice and feedback we have received and would like to thank all those involved in this project during what has been a stressful and challenging time," Trevor Mallard said.

"I look forward to Grey Valley students having access to quality and sustainable education now and into the future. Students will also be able to enjoy the benefits of the extra funding released to schools."

The review decisions are:

- To create an upper Grey Valley school by merging Ahaura School, Moonlight School, Ngahere School and Totara Flat School on the Ahaura School site with Totara Flat School as the continuing school;
- To create a lower Grey Valley school by merging Blackball School, Brunnerton School and Stillwater School on the Brunnerton School site at Dobson, with Brunnerton School as the continuing school; and having a second site at Blackball, in the present Blackball School, which would be under the governance and management of Brunnerton School; and
- To either close Kaiata School or preferably merge it with a Greymouth school.

“Using current estimates, the two mergers will generate an extra $1,127,700 million for schools over and above their normal entitlements for education development resources. There will be a fund of $322,350 for schools to use jointly for education projects, and $1.9 million of extra property funding will be available,” Trevor Mallard said.

The extra funding in relation to Kaiata School will be determined once the 28-day period of consultation regarding Kaiata’s future is complete.

The board of each continuing school will manage the transition period and govern the new school until elections can be held.

The Ministry of Education will work closely with schools to make sure their requirements for a smooth changeover are met and that the review is implemented in time for the 2005 school year.

The ministry's submission to Trevor Mallard is available on the network review section of the ministry's website [www.minedu.govt.nz](http://www.minedu.govt.nz)

The list of approximate funding for the schools follows. Final funding is worked out on a roll basis, and follows students to their chosen school.
