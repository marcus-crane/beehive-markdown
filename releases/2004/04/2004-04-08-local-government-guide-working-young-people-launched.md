A new web-based toolkit helps councils engage more effectively with young people on issues that affect them.

The *Local Government Toolkit for Child and Youth Participation* was developed by the Ministry of Social Development, the Department of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Youth Development. Under the Local Government Act 2002 councils are required to consult with children and young people and to encourage greater participation by children and young people in council policy development and processes.

Acting Social Development and Employment Minister Ruth Dyson said the Toolkit responds to calls from councils for practical advice on the best ways to engage with children and young people.

“A survey by the Ministry of Social Development survey found that while councils were keen to consult with young people they wanted practical advice on the best ways to do so. The Toolkit will help Councils to do this and is designed to contribute to best practice consultation and participation.

“Real life examples of council activity featured in the Toolkit include:  
·five to 12 year old children worked with a council on redesigning a local walkway. They created a model of the street in their school gym and suggested road surfaces and landscaping to make the walkway safe, interesting and fun to use;  
·focus groups for 13 to 18 year olds run by the Hutt City Council to inform its youth policy; and  
·classroom discussions with seven to 11 year olds about the Hamilton City Council’s child and family policy.

“The Toolkit also invites councils and young people to tell others, via the website, about projects they have been involved in.

“The Toolkit helps to fulfil the aims of the Agenda for Children and Youth Development Strategy Aotearoa which coordinate work across government to improve the lives of children and young people,” Ruth Dyson said.
