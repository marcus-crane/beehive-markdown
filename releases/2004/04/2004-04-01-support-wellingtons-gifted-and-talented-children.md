Porirua's new [One Day School](http://www.georgeparkyncentre.org/ods.html) for gifted and talented children continues the investment in our future cultural, social and economic leaders, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

Trevor Mallard officially opened the [George Parkyn Centre](http://www.georgeparkyncentre.org/)'s One Day School at Tairangi School in Porirua this morning.

“This centre will be working in partnership with Tairangi School to provide enriched learning opportunities for gifted students," Trevor Mallard said.

Operating throughout New Zealand, the George Parkyn Centre one-day schools aim to provide professional support for gifted children, their families and their schools.

"These centres recognise schools, communities and government need to work together to ensure the learning needs of all our diverse students are met.

"This government is committed to ensuring every single student has the opportunity to reach their full potential and our gifted education policy is inclusive and primarily classroom based. All teachers can benefit from the expertise developed in the one-day schools.

"The government’s multi-tiered approach to gifted education recognises that these students are gifted and talented every day of the week and our gifted and talented learners are found in every group in society and in every school in New Zealand."

The new centre is funded in part by the Ministry of Education's contestable funding pool for gifted education.

Open three days a week the one-day school caters for a different age group each day. Students are aged 6-12 and there is a maximum of 15 students per class.

"Congratulations to everyone involved in today's opening," Trevor Mallard said.

"The George Parkyn Centre has a history of involvement in gifted education and director Rosemary Cathcart and her team have shaped the broad and diverse approaches we have to gifted education in New Zealand."
