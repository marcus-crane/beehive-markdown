New Zealand company Pacific Aerospace Corporation is ready to take its PAC 750XL aircraft into the Australian market after gaining Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority certification.

"New Zealand's aerospace industry can celebrate this great achievement. Export orders of between $400 to $500 million over the next ten years are now likely," Jim Anderton, Minister of Economic Development said today.

"This is great news for the New Zealand aerospace industry. Now Pacific Aerospace has both American and Australian certification for their aircraft - the PAC 750XL. They are showing the world that New Zealand has internationally proven expertise in this high tech industry.

"Adventurous Australians and tourists visiting Australia will soon be jumping out of New Zealand planes designed and built especially for the adventure parachuting market.

"I congratulate Pacific Aerospace for their excellent contribution in developing another high skill, high tech industry for New Zealand. These are the sorts of industries, which will help New Zealand compete in the world market and grow our economy for the future," Jim Anderton said.

New Zealand Trade and Enterprise has worked alongside PAC since 1999 introducing them to potential buyers in a variety of markets including South America, Europe, South East Asia and the Middle East. Potential new contacts include parachuting clubs and government agencies involved in various services.

More recently New Zealand Trade and Enterprise has helped the company develop a growth strategy, complete the flight testing programme and associated documentation required for CAA certification and provided assistance with Canadian and European Union certification procedures.
