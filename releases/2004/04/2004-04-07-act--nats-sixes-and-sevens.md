Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen said today that the two right wing parties were at sixes and sevens in their response to the government’s foreshore and seabed policy.

Act says ancestral connection is a consolation prize for Maori.

“National says it will lead to co-management and ticket clipping.

“As usual, the truth is in the middle.

“Ancestral connection will be available through the Maori Land Court and will provide for the expression of kaitiakitanga. It will bring with it a strengthened ability to participate in decision-making processes over the relevant area.

“Both parties want to turn this into a race issue but Act recognises there are property rights involved whereas National doesn’t seem to recognise property rights if Maori have them,” Dr Cullen said.
