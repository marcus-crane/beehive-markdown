The government has standardised the speed limit for heavy vehicles. From Monday 3 May 2004, the open road speed limit for all heavy vehicles (except school buses) will be standardised at 90km/h.

In the past, different types of heavy vehicles have been able to travel at different speeds on the open road.

This standardisation of speed limits is to take account of changes in heavy vehicle technology that makes vehicles safer.

Heavy vehicles operating in New Zealand which were previously restricted to 80km/h on the open road have now met stability requirements including a new static roll threshold. This means that they are more stable and are safer to drive at the 90km/h speed limit that currently applies to most heavy vehicles on our roads.

The speed limit change will affect around 16% of all trucks. From 3 May 2004, these vehicles will be able to travel at the same speed as the other 84% of heavy vehicles that currently have their open road speeds limited to 90km/hour.

“Having a standard speed limit for all heavy vehicles will make the roads safer for other drivers and enable Police to better enforce speed limits for heavy vehicles”, says Associate Minister of Transport Harry Duynhoven. "There should be no need for a truck to overtake another truck now that their speeds are uniform"

The change will help to:

§reduce speed variations between vehicles and encourage smoother traffic flows, which in turn will help reduce the risks of overtaking between vehicles and lessen driver frustration at being caught behind slower moving vehicles.

§make it easier for speed cameras and hand held radar detectors to identify and ticket heavy vehicle drivers breaking the speed limit.

§allow the Police to develop speed enforcement strategies that especially target heavy vehicles travelling at unsafe and excessive speeds.

In combination with this new measure, the tolerance threshold for heavy vehicles travelling over any applicable speed limit will be reduced from 10km/h over the limit to 5km/h over the limit. Having a single 90km/h for all heavy vehicles, and reduced tolerance, will enable the reduction in the overall speed of all heavy vehicles, not just those affected by this new measure, and therefore improve safety on our roads.

“Reducing the overall speed of road users will help meet the government’s road safety goal of having no more than 300 deaths and 4,500 hospitalisations by 2010”, said Mr Duynhoven.
