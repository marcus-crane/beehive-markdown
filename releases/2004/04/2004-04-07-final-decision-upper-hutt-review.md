Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today his final decisions on the review of Upper Hutt schools, a move that will unlock over $2 million in extra resources for the education of local students.

"I have been impressed with the level and depth of the advice and feedback we have received and would like to thank all those involved in this project during what has been a challenging and stressful time.

"After giving very serious consideration to feedback from the community, I have changed my original proposal to better meet the desires of individual schools and their communities.

"I have also asked that schools work together to create a network aimed at ensuring a strong and sustainable schooling system for their area.

"It's important that Upper Hutt students have access to quality and sustainable education now and into the future. The reorganisation I’m announcing will help students to enjoy the benefits of the extra operational resources released to individual schools.

"Using current estimates, $573,000 will be available to the new Trentham school, over and above normal funding entitlements, for education development resources. There will be a fund of $163,660 for schools to use for joint education projects throughout the Upper Hutt area, and $1,161,000of extra property funding will be available," Trevor Mallard said.

The review decisons are:  
*for primary and contributing schools*

- retain Birchville School, Maoribank School, Plateau School, Totara Park School, Fraser Crescent School, Oxford Crescent School, Upper Hutt School Silverstream School and Pinehaven School;
- retain Mangaroa School and it become a contributing school; and
- merge Brentwood School and Trentham School on the Trentham School site with Trentham School being the continuing school.

*for intermediates and colleges*

- retain Fergusson Intermediate, Maidstone Intermediate, Heretaunga College and Upper Hutt College;
- set up an overview group of boards and principals of these schools to develop a strategic plan to meet the education needs of Year 7 - 13 students in Upper Hutt in the years 2010 – 2015. This group will report regularly to the Education Minister and complete its strategic plan by the end of 2005. It is expected that the work of this group will lead to the establishment of a co-operative governance model for Fergusson Intermediate, Maidstone Intermediate, Heretaunga College and Upper Hutt College early in 2006; and
- lift the current capital works moratorium for previously agreed projects at Upper Hutt College and Maidstone Intermediate. The capital works moratorium will stay in place for other capital works until the strategic plan is finalised.

The board of Trentham School will manage the transition period and govern the new school until elections can be held.

The Ministry of Education will work closely with merging schools to make sure their requirements for a smooth changeover are met and that the review is implemented in time for the 2005 school year.

The list of approximate funding for the new school follows. Funding is worked out on a roll basis, and follows students to their chosen school.
