The first 10 of an estimated 850 new police vehicles to be bought under a new police vehicle purchase programme were displayed on Parliament's forecourt today.

Last October Police Minister George Hawkins announced the police vehicle purchase programme would increase by up to $29.2m for each of the next three financial years.

"Today's vehicles are the first of up to 850 new vehicles to be purchased under the programme," Mr Hawkins said. The cars are newer model Holden Commodores, which make up the majority of the current police patrol fleet.

Mr Hawkins said under the National Government in the 1990s, IT was targeted at the expense of other areas resulting in new vehicle purchases dropping to 140 and 188 respectively in the financial years 1996/97 and 1997/98.

"It's true to say under National money wasted on failed IT programmes like INCIS meant police were forced to drive old dungers with plenty of kilometers on the speedo.

"The low point came in the 1996/97 year when capital expenditure on police vehicles dropped to only $4.8m,” he said.

In 2000/01, 2001/02 and 2002/03 new vehicles totalled 502, 452 and 462 respectively. Capital expenditure on vehicles was $20m between 2000/01 and $14.8m in 2001/02.

Mr Hawkins said the new police vehicle purchase programme would see a greater percentage of the police owned fleet replaced after around three years.

"Over time, the programme will result in a modernised police fleet with lower average odometer readings, performs better overall and offers greater resale value later," Mr Hawkins said.

Police currently own or lease 2855 vehicles, including Highway Patrol and special purpose vehicles such as prison vans, dog units and the like.
