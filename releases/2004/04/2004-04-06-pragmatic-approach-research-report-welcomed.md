Acting Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Margaret Wilson is welcoming the Tertiary Education Commission’s (TEC) decision to proceed with a public release of the report of the Perfomance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) assessment without international comparisons included.

The decision follows a Court ruling made today at the High Court at Auckland. The Court has asked the TEC to consult with participating tertiary education organisations on whether it should also release a section in the draft report which uses data from the assessment to compare the results of the New Zealand exercise with a report into the research performance of universities in the United Kingdom.

Margaret Wilson said the Commission’s board had acted pragmatically in deciding today to release the PBRF report to participating tertiary education organisations initially, followed by a general public release, while it consulted further on whether to also release information on international comparisons.

“I know that the tertiary education sector have been keenly awaiting the release of this first PBRF report.

“The report represents the culmination of a comprehensive year long assessment of the quality of research carried out by participating tertiary education organisations. It provides the essential basis which the Commission will use to distribute increasing funding which the government is investing in top quality research.

“Improving the quality and relevance of tertiary sector research is one of the key initiatives the government is focusing on as a springboard for New Zealand’s future growth and development.

“The Commission has made a pragmatic and sensible decision to release this key benchmark information as soon as is practicable,” Margaret Wilson said.
