The Government has upgraded its travel advice to recommend that New Zealanders defer tourist and non-essential travel to Turkey, including the Gallipoli area,” Foreign Minister Phil Goff said today.

“Although the Government has no information about a specific threat to the ANZAC Day services, there remains a high risk of further terrorist attacks in Turkey," Mr Goff said.

"New Zealanders planning to travel to Turkey at this time should carefully consider the risk and decide whether their travel is essential.”

Mr Goff said that at this point the formal ANZAC Day ceremonies would proceed as planned, but they remained subject to review.

“The Turkish authorities have stepped up security measures since the terrorist attacks in Istanbul last November and will have increased security in place for ANZAC Day.

"The New Zealand and Australian governments have been consulting with the Turkish authorities about security for the commemoration at Gallipoli, given it is one of the largest gatherings of our citizens outside our two countries.

“Unfortunately, terrorist groups remain active in Turkey, and recent events show how difficult it is to counter those who are callously prepared to inflict civilian casualties.

“Any New Zealanders who decide to travel to Gallipoli despite the advisory should register on-line on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade website \[www.mfat.govt.nz] and continue to monitor the Ministry’s travel advice in the period up to ANZAC Day,” Mr Goff said.
