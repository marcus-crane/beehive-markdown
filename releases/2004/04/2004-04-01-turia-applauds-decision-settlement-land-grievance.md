Te Tai Hauauru MP Tariana Turia applauds the New Plymouth District  
Council on the just way they have dealt with the return of part of  
the  
Pekapeka block to Te Atiawa.

"The Council has shown real leadership on this issue," said Mrs  
Turia.  
"Their decision sends a signal of hope that fairness and justice  
can  
prevail in Aotearoa."

"The iwi have waited around 140 years for this day. There is  
probably  
no more significant piece of land in the country, when you consider  
the history.

"The land destined for return is only a small part of what was  
confiscated. The Council's recommendation does not return the whole  
of  
the block where the first shots were fired in what became the Land  
Wars, because some parts have been set aside as reserves, and the  
iwi  
have generously agreed to leave those lands in the Council's hands.

"The iwi have also given the leaseholders clear assurances that  
their  
rights will be protected, and they will discuss the possibility of  
freeholding the land. I hope they can enter into negotiations in  
good  
heart," said Mrs Turia
