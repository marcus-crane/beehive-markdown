“I am deeply concerned at the actions of National and Act in voting against the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra Bill today,” said Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard.

“It reflects a disturbing trend from those parties towards our flagship cultural institutions and is bad news for the development of New Zealand’s burgeoning arts and cultural sector.

“I worry that it foreshadows a move by any National-Act government – should they ever get into power – to abolish the Orchestra or cut its funding and restrict its opportunities in the way that National did in the 1990s.

“The NZSO was nearly destroyed by the last National-led government and it was only a review by Dr Graham Scott that saw barely adequate funding restored when the Orchestra was at a point of crisis.

“I would like to thank United Future, the Greens and New Zealand First for their support today.

“The New Zealand Symphony Orchestra is a flagship performing arts organisation that makes a vital contribution to the development of New Zealand’s unique cultural environment, which is returning economic, cultural and social benefits to all New Zealanders.”
