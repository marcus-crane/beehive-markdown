The electricity generation company TrustPower has been awarded carbon credits for two proposed projects to enhance hydro power production from water catchments at Waipori, near Dunedin, and in Taranaki.

The Waipori project aims to increase generation from the Waipori power station by diverting water from nearby streams into the catchment, using a combination of pumps, water conveyance and a small generation unit. The net increase in output is expected to average 35 gigawatt-hours a year.

The Taranaki project is designed to increase water flow through the Motukawa and Mangorei hydroelectric schemes, again by diverting water from nearby streams into the catchment. The net increase in output is expected to average 3.5 gigawatt-hours a year.

Together the projects would equate to about 1 megawatt of new generation.

[TrustPower’s](http://www.trustpower.co.nz/) plans for these enhancements have won up to 114,258 credits, or emission units, from the Government for cutting greenhouse gas emissions and helping to make New Zealand’s electricity supply more secure.

Pete Hodgson, Convenor of the Ministerial Group on Climate Change, announced the government support in Dunedin today and said both enhancement schemes would start producing electricity in 2005 if they proceeded as planned.

"I congratulate TrustPower for this innovative development of existing hydro schemes," Mr Hodgson said. "Together, the enhancements at Waipori and Taranaki have the potential to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases equal to more than170,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide between now and 2012. They also make a small but useful contribution to electricity generation capacity from renewable sources."

Energy projects that have won credits through the first tender round of the [Projects to Reduce Emissions](http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/policy-initiatives/projects/index.html) programme equate to about 240 megawatts of new generation. Details of projects equating to about 100 megawatts have been announced to date, with further details to be announced in coming weeks by arrangement with the project owners.
