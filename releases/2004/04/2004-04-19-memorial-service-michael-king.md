I very much regret that fog at Auckland Airport this morning has prevented me reaching the memorial service today.

It was, however, a privilege to attend the very moving funeral service in Auckland two Tuesdays ago for Michael and Maria, and to hear their family and friends talk about what made these two so special.

Maria was a contemporary of mine at Auckland University and I always remember her as a strikingly beautiful young woman from that time.

Michael became a public figure long before I did through his published work, with the biography on Te Puea published in 1977 marking him out relatively early in his career as an historian and writer of note.

By the time of his death with more than thirty books to his credit, he had made an immense contribution to New Zealand history and scholarship, and was a voice of reason and enlightenment on our race relations.

His contribution was all the greater because he reached beyond the important audience of those who studied and had a specialist interest in history to the wider New Zealand public. In doing so, he helped us understand more about the forces which shaped us as a people and New Zealand as a nation. This, together with the quality of his work, made Michael an obvious and outstanding candidate for the inaugural Prime Minister’s Award for Literary Achievement in 2003. That award followed many other significant awards and achievements during his career.

The universal theme of tributes to Michael these past three weeks has been that he was a person New Zealand could not afford to lose. There can be no greater tribute paid.

A cruel twist of fate has taken Michael and Maria away while they had still so many hopes and dreams and so much to contribute. The hearts of all New Zealanders go out to the families of Michael and Maria, knowing that their loss is also a loss for us all. May Michael and Maria rest in peace.
