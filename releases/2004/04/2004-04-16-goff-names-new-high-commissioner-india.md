New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to India will be career diplomat Graeme Waters, Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced today.

“India is an increasingly important partner for New Zealand and our two countries have a relationship that goes back many decades. We have much in common including Commonwealth ties and of course a fondness of cricket,” Mr Goff said.

“There is a growing number of high-level visits between India and New Zealand, and this demonstrates the increasing importance both sides place on the relationship.”

Two-way trade with India totalled $337 million last year. New Zealand's exports were led by wool and wood products, while trade in services – particularly in education and tourism – is increasingly important. Substantial growth in export opportunities is also expected, particularly for the forestry sector.

India’s participation in regional institutions such as the ASEAN brings it into a region in which New Zealand has a close interest. India’s interests also extend to the South Pacific, and in 2003 it became a dialogue partner of the Pacific Forum.

Mr Waters is currently Chief of Protocol at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. His previous overseas postings were to Port Moresby, Rarotonga, New Delhi, Seoul and Manila, where he was Ambassador from 1998 to 2001.

Mr Waters takes up his position in July.
