Racing Minister Damien O'Connor will cast aside his ministerial suit and tie tomorrow for a tandem sulky ride at Addington raceway. He’ll also meet with representatives from the New Zealand Metropolitan Trotting Club and Harness Racing New Zealand during the visit, for which "jeans and old shoes" have been recommended.

Gavin Cook and Trevor Ward from Harness Racing's amateur drivers' programme will meet Mr O'Connor at the raceway at 11am and give him an overview of the programme. The Minister will then make acquaintance with his horse and sulky and hit the track.

At noon Mr O'Connor will meet with key harness racing personnel to discuss industry issues, before heading to Mark Purdon's All Star Racing Stables at Yaldhurst, where he'll be met by Mark and his wife Vicki. Issues facing owners and trainers will be discussed.

Mr O'Connor said he was really looking forward to the day.

"This is a great opportunity for me to meet key harness racing stakeholders on their patch, and discuss opportunities for the industry."

Media are invited to attend the sulky drive. The Minister will be happy to field questions.
