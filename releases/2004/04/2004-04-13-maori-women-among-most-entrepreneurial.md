Maori women are among the most entrepreneurial business people in the world according to a recent international study, Women’s Affairs Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

Launching Mana Wahine week at Parliament, Ms Dyson said the latest Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Study, released in March 2004, shows that Maori women are considerably more entrepreneurial than non-Maori women, both in New Zealand and globally.  
“According to the study of 41 countries, women entrepreneurs account for 13 per cent of the general Maori population, compared with 8.7 per cent of non-Maori and 6.4 per cent globally.  
“The study also shows that Maori in general have a higher entrepreneurial rate than non-Maori. In fact, if Maori were defined as their own country, they would rank as the fourth most entrepreneurial country in the world.”

Ruth Dyson said the success of Maori women was good for New Zealand.

“Successful Maori business women are not only great role models, they are providing important job opportunities for whanau, hapu and iwi. We know that Maori enterprises invest in the regions of New Zealand. This is particularly significant because regional economic development is one of the reasons New Zealand is doing better than most economies at the moment.

“Maori women have also made a huge contribution to the renaissance of Maori language and culture, which underpins growing Maori achievement. They have been instrumental in setting up, and running, Tu Tangata, Kohanga Reo, Kura Kaupapa and Matua Whangai programmes. They have played a vital role in Iwi Authorities, Maori Trust Boards and Urban Maori Authorities. And they have been the driving force behind the success of health and social services by Maori, for Maori.”

Mana Wahine week was introduced in 1993 to highlight the achievements of Maori women.
