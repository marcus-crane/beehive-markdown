Associate Health Minister, Jim Anderton, says he has nothing but praise for the work of the Murupara community in the fight against methamphetamine abuse.

"The Progressive Party I lead secured $2.55 million to fund 15 community action programmes in the Labour Progressive government's 2003-2004 Budget.

"The Ministry of Health selected 15 priority CAYAD site locations based on an analysis of a range of data and unfortunately Murupara was not one of the priority sites selected for a CAYAD programme in the 2003-2004 year.

"What is clear to me, however, is that the Murupara community is experiencing similar challenges to those areas which were successfully chosen for the 15 CAYAD programmes announced recently," the Progressive leader said.

"I am signalling now that I will seek funding in the 2005-2006 Budget for more Community Action Programmes should the 20 now in place get good independent evaluations.

"The Progressive Party will also continue to strongly advocate within the coalition government for additional funding to be made available in the May 27 budget for anti-drug initiatives in the financial year that starts on July 1," Jim Anderton said.

"I have discussed Murupara with Health officials. Officials and I believe that from what we know Murupara would have a strong case to receive assistance should more funding become available," Jim Anderton said.

Jim Anderton hopes to travel to Murupara within the next few months to talk with groups working against drugs there.
