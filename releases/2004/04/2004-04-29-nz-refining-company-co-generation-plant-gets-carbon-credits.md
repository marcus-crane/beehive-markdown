A proposed electricity and steam co-generation plant at the Marsden Point refinery has been awarded a share of carbon credits from the Government.

"This project offers the double benefit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adding to the nation's electricity supply," said the Convenor of the Ministerial Group on Climate Change, Pete Hodgson.

The refinery proposes to build a biomass boiler, burning wood waste to produce steam for refinery processes, and two electricity generation turbines powered by refinery gas and natural gas. The plant would be able to export electricity to the national grid and waste heat from the turbines would be used to generate additional process steam.

The new plant would replace electricity purchased from the national grid and steam generated from refinery waste gases. It is scheduled to come on-stream in 2007, pending final approval early next year. The New Zealand Refining Company (NZRC) is developing the project with HRL Limited, an Australian energy, technology and project development company, that will build, own and operate the plant.

"The plant would provide new electricity generation capacity of about 80 megawatts," Mr Hodgson said. "By avoiding the need for extra generation from fossil fuels such as coal or gas, it has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions equal to more than one million tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2012."

The NZRC project has the single largest award of credits in the first tender round of the climate change [Projects to Reduce Emissions](http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/policy-initiatives/projects/index.html) programme. If it proceeds as planned, NZRC will receive up to 1,225,545 credits, or emission units.

The NZRC was also the first New Zealand company to secure a [Negotiated Greenhouse Agreement](http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/policy-initiatives/nga.html) (NGA) with the Government, in April 2003. This is a binding agreement that commits the firm to moving towards world's best practice in managing greenhouse gas emissions in return for a full or partial exemption for the emissions charge that is to be introduced by 2008. The proposed co-generation plant is outside the scope of the NGA.
