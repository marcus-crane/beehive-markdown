New Zealanders are continuing to move off welfare and in to the paid workforce.

Acting Social Development and Employment Minister Ruth Dyson said that New Zealand's unemployment rate is now back to levels not seen since late 1987. There are fewer than 78,000 people nationally on the Unemployment Benefit – nearly half the 1999 level.

The number of working age New Zealanders on a main (unemployment, invalid, sickness, or domestic purposes) benefit has dropped by more than 14 per cent - from over 381,000 when the Labour-led government came to office to under 326,000 today.

Ruth Dyson says government agencies, working in partnership with employers placed record numbers of job seekers into paid work and directed many more into training and skill development.

Ruth Dyson said that government wants to assist even more into work. This year’s budget aims at making work pay and will see significant boosts to income for low and modest income families.
