The Government has confirmed details of the aid package for flood-affected farmers and crop growers, Rural Affairs Minister Jim Sutton said today.

People who earn 51 per cent or more of their income from farming and cropgrowing within the boundaries of the South Taranaki, Wanganui, Ruapehu, Rangitikei, Manawatu, Horowhenua, Kapiti, Central Hawkes Bay, Tararua, Masterton,Carterton, and South Wairarapa local authorities are eligible for assistance through the Government¡¦s agricultural recovery programme.

Mr Sutton said the key aim of the programme was to enable farmers and crop growers to re-establish their businesses as quickly as possible.

¡§It isn¡¦t possible to make the effects of this go away for people. The impact of February¡¦s storm is such that people will continue to see the effects on their land, particularly in the hill country and in their balance sheets, for many years to come.

¡§But this package will help people get on with their lives and their businesses.¡¨

The assistance through the Agricultural Recovery Programme will be in two key areas:  
„hEssential infrastructure, which is eligible for 75 per cent government assistance; and  
„hCrop re-establishment, which is eligible for 90 per cent government assistance.

Mr Sutton said assistance to affected forestry would be through facilitating the use of skilled labour and equipment to enable wind throw harvesting to be undertaken.

Farmers will have to meet a threshold of $10,000, being the first $10,000 worth of expenditure on qualifying items. This will be assessed on the first payment request ¡V not on each payment request that is made.

There is no cap to government funding for eligible items.
