Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today his final decisions on the review of South Canterbury schools, a move that will unlock nearly $15.2 million in extra resources for the education of local students.

"I have agreed with all of the recommendations of the mediator who has been working with schools and the community to come up with a good solution for local students.

"I would like to thank all those involved in this project for their advice and feedback during what has been a challenging and stressful time.

"This reorganisation is aimed at ensuring South Canterbury students have access to quality and sustainable education now and into the future. Students will also be able to enjoy the benefits of the extra operational resources released to individual schools.

"Using current estimates, $5.23 million will be available to schools, over and above their normal entitlements, for education development resources. There will be a fund of $1.49 million for schools to use for joint education projects, and $8.46 million of extra property funding will be available.

"My decision also includes the establishment of a Joint Executive Group involving board representatives from Temuka High School, Timaru Girls' High School, Timaru Boys' High School and Mountainview High School.

"The group is to meet at least twice a year, with the aim of collaborating on joint education projects, and coming up with strategies to lift student achievement," Trevor Mallard said.
