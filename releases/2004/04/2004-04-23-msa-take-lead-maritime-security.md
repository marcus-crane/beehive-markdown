The Maritime Safety Authority (MSA) has today been appointed to be the Designated Authority under the Maritime Security Act 2004.

Associate Minister of Transport Hon Harry Duynhoven says “Today's announcement formalises the interim arrangements put in place last year. As Designated Authority, the MSA will be the regulatory body that ensures New Zealand's shipping and port companies comply with the Maritime Security Act 2004 which came into force on 6 April 2004. This in turn ensures New Zealand meets our international obligations to implement the Port Facility Security (ISPS)Code and SOLAS amendments.

"The MSA has already taken this new function onboard in a very professional and efficient manner and progress to date has been excellent.

“The MSA has established a good working relationship with industry to implement the new security regime. I expect this close co-operation to continue as we near closer to the 1 July 2004 deadline when the ISPS Code will come into force internationally.”
