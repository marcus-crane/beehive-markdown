RESPONSE TO LOWER NORTH ISLAND STORM: 'ON-FARM’ RELIEF MEASURES: OPERATIONAL DETAIL FOR AGRICULTURAL RECOVERY PROGRAMME

The Government has agreed to the following measures to assist farmers, growers and foresters recover from the Lower North Island Storm Event on 15-18 February 2004. The assistance is known as the Agricultural Recovery Programme, which is being administered by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF).

This programme is separate from assistance from other Government Agencies, such as Civil Defence and Emergency Management, Work and Income, and voluntary agencies.

Farmers, growers and foresters who meet the criteria outlined below are invited to request an information and application pack from MAF. Requests can be made by emailing floods@maf.govt.nz, faxing a request to 04 474 4206, or through the Agricultural Recovery Facilitators, who are listed in Section 8 of this paper.

Details of the programme outlined below are:  
·General criteria  
·Essential ‘on-farm’ infrastructure  
·Crop re-establishment  
·Forestry assistance  
·Other assistance measures  
·Process for the Agricultural Recovery Programme  
·Contacts for Agricultural and Forestry Recovery Facilitators.

Summary

The assistance through the Agricultural Recovery Programme will be in two key areas:  
·Essential infrastructure  
·Crop re-establishment

‘On-farm’ infrastructural items which will be eligible for 75% Government assistance will be:  
·Boundary fencing;  
·Essential access (tracks, races, farm bridges, culverts);  
·Re-establishing silt and water damaged pasture;  
·Re-establishing essential uninsurable water supplies (dams, reticulation, troughs);  
·Re-establishing essential drainage;  
·Re-establishing essential uninsurable stockyards  
·Repairing effluent ponds  
·Re-establishing ‘on-farm’ flood protection

Crop re-establishment which will be eligible for 90% Government assistance are vegetable, process, orchard and arable crops, including forage cash crops, which were damaged by water or silt.

Forestry assistance will be through facilitating the use of skilled labour and equipment to enable wind throw harvesting to be undertaken.

1.General criteria

NOTE: The terms ‘farm’ and ‘farmer’ used throughout apply to all agricultural, horticultural and forestry operations.

1.1The farm property should be located within the following District Council boundaries:

·South Taranaki·Wanganui·Ruapehu·Rangitikei·Manawatu·Horowhenua·Kapiti·Central Hawkes Bay·Tararua·Masterton·Carterton·South Wairarapa

1.2Farmers, growers and foresters receiving relief will have been significantly affected by the lower North Island storm between 15 and 18 February 2004.

1.3To be eligible farmers must earn 51% of their gross income from farming, cropping, vegetable growing, forestry activities or any combination thereof.

1.4Payments will only be made for non-insurable qualifying items.

1.5Farmers will meet a threshold of $10,000, being the first $10,000 worth of expenditure on qualifying items. This will be assessed on the first payment request – not on each payment request that is made.

1.6There is no cap to government funding for eligible items.

1.7Applications lodged for a property or entity will transfer to a verified successor in title if the property changes ownership before all restoration has been undertaken. Such change in ownership and responsibility would include sharemilkers.

1.8Payments will be made direct to the person or party who has incurred the cost. The criteria do not differentiate between owner operators and farmer/sharemilker arrangements in that Government assistance will be available to eligible business entities which meet the criteria. Government will not get involved in contractual arrangements between farm owners and sharemilkers.

1.9For essential ‘on-farm’ infrastructure damage, as described below, the payment rate will be 75%.

1.10For crop re-establishment, as described below, the payment rate will be 90%.

2.Essential On-farm Infrastructure

2.1Boundary Fencing

Boundary fencing is eligible for 75% support as follows:  
Boundary fences which are on the perimeter of the property and serve as the boundary between neighbours, roads, railway lines and rivers.

Where a property has a number of titles that are contiguous and comprise the same operational entity the boundary is regarded as the perimeter of the operational entity.

Where the boundary is with a neighbour the cost of the fence is shared on a 50/50 basis by the neighbours, with each party eligible to apply for assistance to the Agricultural Recovery Programme. Where DOC holds land under the Conservation Act, the Wildlife Act or the Reserves Act, the boundary fencing obligations are shared 50/50 between DOC with neighbours.

Where the boundary is adjacent to roads, railway lines and rivers and those parts of the DOC estate that are excluded from the requirements of The Fencing Act 1978 the payment will be based on 75% of the total cost.

2.2Essential Access (Tracks, Races, Farm Bridges and Culverts)

Essential access is as follows:  
Where the access is essential for:  
·The farmer to bring stock from all areas of the farm to stockyards or cowsheds;  
·The grower to transport machinery essential for crop establishment and harvesting;  
·For pruning and harvesting of forestry crops; and  
·To gain access for restoration of infrastructure such as water systems and fencing and supplying supplementary feed.

The access must have existed pre-event.

The cost of any Resource Consents required are included as part of the replacement cost.

Essential access does not require that the tracks be re-established, or bridges and culverts rebuilt in the same location if the previous location has been adversely impacted by slip damage or washouts.

Bridges

Bridges are those on-farm bridges past the homestead. (Bridges up to the homestead are an insurable item.)

Where improved access can be better provided by an alternative (rather than rebuilding the bridge) there will be discretion for Government to fund new work to the value of up to 75% of the cost which would have been incurred to replace the bridge to the previous standard.

Where the cost of replacing a bridge is required at a higher design standard due to Regional Council requirements the Government contribution will be capped at 75% of the cost to replace the bridge to the previous standard.

Note: Replacement of bridge or access to a higher standard than the pre-flood state is a business decision. Eligible costs will be only those related to replacing to the pre-flood state.

2.3Re-establishing Silt and Water Damaged Pasture

Where pasture has been damaged by silt and/or water 75% of the following costs will be met:  
·The regrassing costs of cultivation, seed and fertiliser;  
·Temporary pasture re-establishment, to be followed by permanent pasture when the soil is capable of being sown in permanent pasture, where it is best management practice to do so, but no later than Autumn 2005.

Re-establishment cultivation costs are based either:  
·On invoices for contractors used; or  
·Costs associated with a farmer using own machinery. Such eligible operating costs would include labour (at $15 hour) and fuel, but not include fixed costs (eg depreciation).

2.4Re-establishing Uninsurable Water Supplies

Re-establishing essential uninsurable water supplies includes:  
·Dams:  
oCleaning out of silt and debris generated by the storm event;  
oRebuilding to a commensurate capacity dam where a dam has been damaged beyond repair;  
·Reticulation lost through storm damage;  
·Troughs lost through storm damage.

2.5Essential Uninsurable Stock Yards

Replacing or repairing damaged stock yards to a size and standard as prior to the storm event.

2.6Essential Drainage

·That which is necessary as a prevention measure against future flood events and includes cleaning of drains and outfalls to maintain free flow;  
Essential drainage excludes:  
·Tile and mole drains and other forms of general subsoil drainage;  
·Drainage covered by Regional Council Community Drainage Schemes.

2.7‘On-farm’ flood protection works

The following flood protection works will be eligible for 75% support:  
·Re-instatement of on-farm flood protection works on private farm land (eg stopbanks) where approved by the Regional Council for appropriately planned, designed, engineered, consented and constructed works to ensure the integrity of the flood protection system.  
·Re-instatement of pre-flood, farmer funded bank stabilisation, where approved by the Regional Council for appropriately planned, designed, engineered, consented and constructed works to ensure the integrity of the flood protection system.

Excluded are:  
·Bank stabilisation not approved by the Regional Council or undertaken as Regional Council works;
