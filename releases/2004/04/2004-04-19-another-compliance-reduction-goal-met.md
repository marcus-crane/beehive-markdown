Today Cabinet agreed to another step in the fight against business compliance costs, Associate Commerce Minister John Tamihere says.

Currently when a Minister puts a paper to Cabinet proposing new legislation, it has to be accompanied by a Regulatory Impact Statement. Where the proposal has red-tape implications for business it also requires a Business Compliance Cost Statement.

Following today’s decision this regime will also apply when a Minister proposes that Cabinet support or adopt a bill proposed by a backbench MP rather than the government. In recent years the number of these members’ bills being enacted has increased and the impact of them has become greater.

“This is only one step in a process of tightening-up the way government makes decisions that impact on businesses,” Mr Tamihere says.

“While the regulatory impact and compliance cost statement regime doesn’t stop the government imposing compliance costs on business, it does make sure they are taken into account. I have also asked officials to look at other ways that the process can be made more robust.”

Mr Tamihere, who is also Minister for Small Business, said it was crucial that the impact on business is thoroughly considered by government before decisions are made.

"From a small business perspective, it’s nice to see a government decision that imposes the compliance costs on government departments, rather than on business.”

This decision also implements yet another recommendation of the Ministerial Panel on Business Compliance Costs and shows that the government continues to be committed to reducing compliance costs, says Mr Tamihere.
