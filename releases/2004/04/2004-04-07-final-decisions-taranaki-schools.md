Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today his final decisions on the review of schools in the South Egmont and Okato areas, a move that will unlock nearly $7.6 million in extra resources for the education of local students.

"I have been impressed with the level and depth of the advice and feedback we have received and would like to thank all those involved in this project during what has been a stressful and challenging time," Trevor Mallard said.

"I look forward to local students having access to quality and sustainable education now and into the future. Students will also be able to enjoy the benefits of the substantial extra funding released to schools.

"Using current estimates, $1.4 million will be available to South Egmont schools, over and above their normal entitlements, for education development resources. There will be a fund of $410,150 for schools to use jointly in education projects, and $877,118 of extra property funding will be available.

"$1.4 million will be available to Okato schools, over and above their normal entitlements, for education development resources. There will be a fund of $410,890 for schools to use for joint education projects, and $3.1 million of extra property funding will be available," Trevor Mallard said.

The review decisions are:  
*South Egmont*

- Kaponga School, Kapuni School and Mahoe School merge on the Kaponga School site to form a full Year 1-8 primary school with Kaponga School being the continuing school;
- Manaia School and Tokaora School merge on the Manaia School site to form a full Year 1-8 primary school with Manaia School being the continuing school;
- Mangatoki School, Okaiawa School and Matapu School merge on the Matapu School site to form a full Year 1-8 primary school with Matapu School being the continuing school; and
- Mahoe and Tokaora schools will be invited to sign memoranda with their nearest town schools on asset sharing.

*Okato*

- retain Oakura School as full Year 1-8 primary school;
- recapitate Omata School so it becomes a full year 1-8 primary school;
- close Okato College, Okato Primary School, Newall School and Warea School and establish a new Year 1 - 13 composite school on the Okato College site; and
- merge Pungarehu School with Rahotu School on the Rahotu site with Rahotu School being the continuing school.

The board of each continuing school will manage the transition period and govern the new school until elections can be held.

The Ministry of Education will work closely with schools to make sure their requirements for a smooth changeover are met and that the review is implemented in time for the 2005 school year.

The ministry's submission to Trevor Mallard is available on the network review section of the ministry's website [www.minedu.govt.nz](http://www.minedu.govt.nz)
