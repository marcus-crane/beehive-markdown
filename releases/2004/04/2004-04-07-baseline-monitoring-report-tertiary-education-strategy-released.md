A new report shows the tertiary education sector is well placed to respond to the needs of community, business and other stakeholders, says Acting Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education) Margaret Wilson.

The Baseline Monitoring Report on the Tertiary Education Strategy sets out a picture of the tertiary education sector as at the start of the Tertiary Education Strategy 2002-2007 and government's tertiary education reforms. It provides the base against which progress towards the goals of the Strategy will be monitored.

Margaret Wilson said the report confirms a number of areas where the government and tertiary education providers will need to focus on to achieve the vision set out in the Strategy.

"The Tertiary Education Strategy signalled the government's direction for building a strong and capable tertiary education system that is well aligned with the goals and development needs of the nation, the economy and society.

"This baseline report tells us that tertiary education sector is in a good position to address the challenges of providing the right kinds of education, skills and knowledge to support a growing knowledge economy and society. For example, we have more people than ever before participating in tertiary education, accompanied by improved financial stability of tertiary education providers.

"Future challenges include achieving equality of access to tertiary education and providing quality learning options for adults with lower skill levels, particularly those who have missed out on education.

"Further progress towards the goals of the Strategy will build on the strengths of our tertiary education system. In particular, further strengthening the linkages between the providers of tertiary education and their stakeholders will be important if the Strategy is to be realised," Margaret Wilson said.
