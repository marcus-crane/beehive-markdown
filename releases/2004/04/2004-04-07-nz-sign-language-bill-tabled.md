The New Zealand Sign Language Bill was tabled in Parliament today, signalling the first step towards its recognition as an official language, Disability Issues Minister Ruth Dyson has announced.

The Bill proposes to adopt NZ Sign Language as New Zealand’s third official language, alongside Maori and English. An estimated 28,000 New Zealanders use NZ Sign Language, of which about 7000 are Deaf New Zealanders.

“This government wants to recognise Deaf people’s language as a unique New Zealand language. NZ Sign Language is the first language for many New Zealanders, and to help build an inclusive community, we want to give it equal status to that of spoken languages,” Ruth Dyson said.

Following today’s introduction of the Bill, the government intends to pass the new legislation by the end of this year, with the act coming into force in 2005.

“The immediate effect of the Bill, once passed, will be to provide people with the right to use and access NZ Sign Language, in legal proceedings, including in court.

“Official recognition of NZ Sign language is a monumental achievement for the Deaf community which has been seeking official recognition of their language for 20 years.

“Deaf people make up a distinct and dynamic cultural group of New Zealanders. NZ Sign Language is central to Deaf culture and is essential for effective daily communication and participation in society. Official recognition will improve acknowledgement of NZ Sign Language as a real language and decrease injustices experienced by Deaf people,” Ruth Dyson said.

Parliamentary officials are currently arranging for NZ Sign Language interpreters to be present in the debating chamber during Parliament’s first reading of the bill, and during select committee consideration of public submissions. It will be the first time NZ Sign Language interpreters have been used for the reading of a bill.

“Further developments will proceed gradually, and the government will look at improving access to NZ Sign Language in education, health, employment and public broadcasting, as well as for Maori Deaf,” Ruth Dyson said.
