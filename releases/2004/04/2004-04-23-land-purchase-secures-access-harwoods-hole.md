A spectacular Nelson property has been purchased for the public, guaranteeing access to Harwood's Hole, the deepest vertical cave shaft in the country, Conservation Minister Chris Carter announced today.

Canaan Downs Farm covers 758 hectares around Takaka Hill next to the Abel Tasman National Park, and forms part of the last stronghold of a rare species of carnivorous land snail. The government agency that purchases conservation land, the Nature Heritage Fund, has bought the property for $1.8m.

"Canaan Downs is a natural gem, which could have very easily ended up as another subdivision, " Mr Carter said.

"The farm is the main access way to Harwood’s Hole, a 176m marble shaft that is an increasingly popular destination for cavers and sightseers. It also contains some very rare and remarkable karst (rock) landforms that are a significant part of our natural heritage," Mr Carter said.

"An outstanding feature of these land formations is a polje – a Slavic word for field. A polje is a flat-floored valley made up of karst that contains sink holes filled with sediment. In heavy rainfall large pools form over the sink holes which, being partially blocked, only very slowly drain the water. There are only a handful of polje in New Zealand."

“Canaan Downs is in six blocks each with separate title," Mr Carter said.

"These blocks could have been sold off separately to developers or foreign owners if the current owners, Tim and Jane Greenhough, hadn't offered the land for sale first to the Government for conservation purposes. I am very grateful to the Greenhough family for having the foresight to do this.

The Greenhoughs will continue to graze sheep on parts of the land for the next 16 months.
