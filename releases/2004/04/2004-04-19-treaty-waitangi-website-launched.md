State Services Minister Trevor Mallard today officially launched - [www.treatyofwaitangi.govt.nz](http://www.treatyofwaitangi.govt.nz) - a website which will play a key role in the government's Treaty of Waitangi Information Programme.

"When our government decided last May to launch the Treaty of Waitangi Information Programme, we were concerned at the time that the general public was not getting reliable information on the Treaty in a way that was easy to access and in a form that was easy to understand," Trevor Mallard said in a speech at the website launch in Wellington.

"It is obvious we need to close the information gap around the Treaty of Waitangi so that New Zealanders can see what the Treaty is about, with information readily at their fingertips.

"This website is designed to give easy access to information on the Treaty of Waitangi, and supplies a quick and convenient way of finding information about New Zealand’s founding document.

"It has sections on the Treaty history, different Treaty texts, key people, a Treaty timeline, settlement of Treaty claims, quotations on the Treaty, a resource list including links to relevant sites, and a Frequently Asked Questions section. A print advertising campaign for the website will begin in the next couple of days.

"Many different historians have contributed and reviewed the story of the Treaty on the website to ensure that it is as accurate and balanced a picture as possible.

"This is not the first initiative from the Treaty of Waitangi Information Programme, but the website is a key medium for ensuring that high quality information is made available in an enduring way to a wide audience.

"As well as the website there is also an active sponsorship scheme offering assistance to community-based organisations wanting to hold Treaty seminars, workshops or hui. There are also plans for television and radio programmes, drama presentations, information kits and pamphlets.

"What has been launched today is just a starting point. The website, and the programme will continue to broaden its coverage of this significant issue," Trevor Mallard said.
