Tourism New Zealand were today awarded the 2004 Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) Grand Award for Marketing for their work on the successful 100% Pure New Zealand campaign. They were also presented with gold awards for the 100% Pure travel poster and their official website, www.newzealand.com.

Minister of Tourism Mark Burton accepted the awards at the PATA Conference in Korea, and said that they were another stunning success for New Zealand’s tourism sector.

“Today’s awards are further proof of something I’ve known for a long time—TNZ is a world class marketing organisation.

“2004 has already been a very satisfying year. In January, TNZ was honoured with two awards by Hospitality Sales and Marketing Association International in New York: the international public relations award for destination marketing and gold for The Royal Tour, a documentary made in association with the Discovery Channel and featuring Prime Minister Helen Clark.

“Only a few years ago, we were a little known quantity in the international tourism market, and TNZ has contributed hugely to the sector’s successes over the past four years. They developed a comprehensive profile of New Zealand’s ideal visitor—guests who travel regularly, actively participate in the natural environment, seek a wide range of authentic experiences, and are large consumers of cultural product.

“TNZ has worked tirelessly to promote New Zealand to these ‘interactive travellers’ as a sophisticated, high-quality, year-round destination. By leveraging off such high-profile projects as The Lord of the Rings and Whale Rider, as well as through their successful partnership with the Discovery Channel, TNZ have greatly increased New Zealand’s profile internationally within this target market.

“These awards are proof positive that the world is taking notice of New Zealand, and a clear illustration of the value of the government’s continued investment in the innovative, successful 100% Pure campaign.

“Well done, TNZ—I’m looking forward to even more success in the future.”
