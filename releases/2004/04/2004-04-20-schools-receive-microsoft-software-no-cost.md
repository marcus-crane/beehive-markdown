The latest Microsoft software products will soon be available, at no cost, to all state and state-integrated schools as part of a multi-million dollar agreement struck with Microsoft, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

"Schools, through this agreement, will have the opportunity to build the capability of students, teachers and institutions to exploit the educational potential of ICT. This supports the government's commitment to provide all New Zealanders with skills to meet the technology demands of the 21st century," Trevor Mallard said.

"This agreement with Microsoft is part of a wider government programme of bulk purchasing of software and licences for schools including anti-virus and Apple software, worth a total of $27.45 million over three years," Trevor Mallard said.

"Schools will now be able to tap into a range of core Microsoft technology including Windows operating system upgrades, Microsoft Office 2003, server client licensing, and a range of commonly used applications.

Trevor Mallard said the new agreement with Microsoft contains a number of improvements over the previous agreement negotiated with Microsoft in 2002.

These include software licences now covering teachers and administration staff working at home, and an enhanced list of products available.

Datacom Systems Ltd, selected through a competitive tender process, will act as the distributor of the software and licences. Installation support will be available via the Ministry’s ICT Helpdesk for Schools.

Earlier this year the Ministry of Education signed two other agreements for the supply of eTrust anti-virus and Apple software to schools.

"Together these packages will provide assurances about the quality, performance and reliability of computers using Microsoft, anti-virus and Apple software in schools," Trevor Mallard said.

"Schools will also be able to purchase a range of non-core products. Through the advantages of bulk purchasing the Ministry of Education has been able to negotiate a significant cost saving on behalf of schools."

While independent schools would not automatically receive the core software products available under the agreement, they would be eligible to buy the software at the same unit prices negotiated by the Ministry of Education.

Trevor Mallard said the new agreement goes through to the end of 2006.

Schools will be able to register to receive their software within the next week using the www.tki.org.nz website.

Schools seeking information about the agreement should contact the Ministry’s ICT Helpdesk for Schools on 0800 22 55 42.
