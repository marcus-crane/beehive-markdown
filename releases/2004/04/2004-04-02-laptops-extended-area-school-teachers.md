The [Laptops for Teachers scheme](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/index.cfm?layout=document&documentid=8568&indexid=6919&indexparentid=1024) is being extended to all permanent, full-time primary teachers (years 1-6) at area schools over the next three months, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

"This move will see 400 teachers at 57 schools in mostly rural areas benefit from the laptop scheme in addition to the 15,000 secondary and intermediate teachers (years 7-13), and 2,680 principals who currently have laptops," Trevor Mallard said.

"The extension to the programme for these year 1-13 schools is being funded from savings from last year’s expansion of the scheme and will cost $1.2 million over three years.

“This is great news for these schools which are mainly in rural areas, and which are mainstream area schools and their Maori immersion equivalent. As a government we are committed to ensuring that everyone, regardless of background or where they live, has the same opportunities.

“This government wants to see all teachers using ICT as a professional tool, as it not only helps teachers, but also students in the classroom. Teachers in these schools have specific resource needs, and laptops will make access to these resources easier.”

"Access to laptops motivate teachers to become familiar with and skilled at using information technology and also helps with teaching workloads.

The Laptops for Teachers scheme reimburses schools for two-thirds of the cost of leasing a laptop, with schools or teachers paying the remaining cost. Savings from the programme last year were as a result of an overall drop in computer prices.

The government has invested $10 million in the Laptops for Teachers scheme so far, up until 2003/2004, while $8.18 million has been invested in laptops for principals.

Attached is the list of schools eligible. Schools will be invited in writing to make an application for laptops. More information is on [www.minedu.govt.nz]()
