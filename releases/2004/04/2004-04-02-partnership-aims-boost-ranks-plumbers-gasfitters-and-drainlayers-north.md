A job partnership agreement launched today will increase the numbers of skilled plumbers, gasfitters and drainlayers across Northland, says Associate Industry and Regional Development Minister Dover Samuels.

The partnership between Work and Income, Master Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers NZ Inc and the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) is the fourth Job Partnership to be signed. The hospitality, heavy transport and retail sectors are already benefiting from these ‘Straight 2 Work’ training and in-work support partnerships.

Dover Samuels says the agreement will see 115 Job Seekers placed into work in Northland, Auckland, Waikato, lower North Island and Christchurch.

The Auckland Trade Training Academy has been contracted to place 80 people into work in the plumbing industry, with 50 places for Auckland, 15 for Northland and 15 also for Waikato. Master Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers NZ Inc along with the Industry Training Organisation have designed the training programmes and set standards for assessments, pre-employment training and post placement support.

This is the first industry partnership that has included the TEC. It will provide additional support post placement to encourage career development and other training requirements to help address retention in the industry.

All those seeking work via the register may be referred via their case manager to attend this ‘Straight 2 Work’ job scheme. This will include participating in a structured training programme, including pre-placement and on the job training and the delivery of NZQA standards where appropriate.

“Today’s Partnership builds on the successful pilot that has been operating in Auckland for the past couple of years. So far there has been a 95% success rate of trainees completing this training moving into paid employment. We are pleased to expand this further across the country to areas of specific need,” said Dover Samuels.
