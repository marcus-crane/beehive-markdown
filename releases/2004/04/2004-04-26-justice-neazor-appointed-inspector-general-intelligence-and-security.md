Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that she will be recommending to the Governor-General that Justice Paul Neazor be appointed the new Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security for a three year term.

Justice Neazor is expected to take up the position on 8 June, following his retirement from the High Court on 7 June. His appointment follows the resignation of Laurie Greig, and was made after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition, as is required by statute.

Helen Clark said changes were being made to the location and servicing of the office of the Inspector-General.

“From the time the office was established under the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1996, it has been located in and serviced by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.

“While the independence of the office is absolute, I believe that it is important that perception matches reality. For that reason, the servicing of the Inspector-General is likely to be arranged through the Justice Department.”

The Inspector-General position was established by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1996. The Inspector-General is required to be a person who has been a judge of the High Court.

The Inspector-General has an oversight and review function over the activities of the Security Intelligence Service and the Government Communications Security Bureau.

Justice Neazor was born at Lower Hutt on 21 November, 1933. He studied law at Victoria University, is a former Solicitor-General, and was appointed to the High Court in 1989.
