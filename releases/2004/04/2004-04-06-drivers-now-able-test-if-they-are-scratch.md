Hundreds and thousands of people are about to have the opportunity to take part in the single biggest road safety education initiative ever seen in New Zealand, Associate Transport Minister Harry Duynhoven said today.

“The road safety initiative, Up to Scratch, is about to hit the streets. From April 7 people have the chance to test whether their knowledge of the road code and rules is up to scratch,” Mr Duynhoven said.

“Up to Scratch is a voluntary 10 question test that comes with your vehicle licence registration, when your vehicle passes its Warrant of Fitness, when you renew your Drivers Licence or when you change vehicle ownership.

“It’s a new Government road safety education initiative that fits into the Road Safety to 2010 strategy which focuses on the three Es – engineering, education and enforcement - to meet road safety goals.

Road Safety to 2010 aims to have no more than 300 deaths and 4,500 hospitalisations a year by 2010. Last year 460 people died on our roads.

The start of the Up to Scratch initiative coincides with World Health Day on April 7. The World Health Organisation has recognised road safety as a serious worldwide health issue by choosing it as the theme of this year’s World Health Day. By the year 2020, if current trends continue, road traffic injuries will have risen by more than 60 percent, making them the third leading contributor to the global burden of disease and injury worldwide.

“Up to Scratch is not a compulsory drivers licence test. It’s a voluntary, easily accessible way of getting your driving up to scratch.

“Most of us have been driving for years and have never brushed up on the road code or road rules. This doesn’t necessarily mean we’re not safe to drive, but it does mean we may not be up-to-date on road rules, and we may have formed bad habits,” Mr Duynhoven said.

“People will have on average four to six times a year to take part in Up to Scratch, and the educational outcome is immediate – the panel you scratch tells you whether you are right or wrong.”

There’s an incentive to take part. People will be able to enter into draws for prizes ranging from a new Toyota Avensis GX Wagon to safety related products from the Automobile Association and Beaurepaires.

The Up to Scratch education initiative supports recently announced road safety related engineering and enforcement measures.

In December the Government announced a package of enforcement measures to crackdown on dangerous speeding and repeat drink drivers.

And in October the Government announced an extra $47million over two years to be spent on accident black spots. This is in addition to the approximately $400 million in safety related work intrinsic to the wider construction and maintenance programmes each year.

"I would especially like to acknowledge the initiative and energy of the previous Minister of Transport, the Hon Paul Swain, in his enthusiastic input into the development of this campaign" Mr Duynhoven concluded.
