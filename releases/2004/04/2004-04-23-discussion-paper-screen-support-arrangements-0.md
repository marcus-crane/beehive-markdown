Discussion paper on screen support arrangements  
Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Helen Clark, has today released a discussion paper on ways of improving the government’s existing funding arrangements and facilitation of the screen production sector.

“This is an exciting time for the New Zealand screen sector with the stunning recent success of New Zealand films and films made in New Zealand. In addition, in the past four years, government funding for New Zealand film and television has increased significantly, a charter has been developed for Television New Zealand, and the Maori Television Service has been launched.

“Government arrangements for the sector are spread over a range of agencies. It is time that they were reviewed to ensure that they are as coherent as possible.

“Feedback on the discussion paper is being called for over the next month. This is an opportunity for those involved in the screen sector to contribute to the debate,” Helen Clark said.

The discussion paper raises several options for achieving better co-ordination between agencies like the Film Commission, New Zealand on Air, Te Mangai Paho, the Film Production Fund, NZ Trade and Enterprise, and Film NZ. It also notes the funding channels for Television New Zealand’s charter and for the Maori Television Service.

Helen Clark said that the options put forward in the paper are aimed at focusing discussion on the best way to organise government support to meet the future challenges in a complex industry.

The government will consider responses to the discussion document with a view to making decisions on any changes mid-year.

The discussion paper is available on the Ministry for Culture and Heritage website at www.mch.govt.nz.
