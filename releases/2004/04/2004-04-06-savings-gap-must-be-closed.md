"New Zealand's savings performance is poor and is affecting our future economic security." David Cunliffe, Associate Minister of Finance, today told a group of savings and investment specialists.

"As a nation we spend more than we earn. As individuals we are not saving enough and tend to fund our consumption by borrowing." said Mr Cunliffe.

"Part of the reason Kiwis are finding it hard to save is that we're not earning enough as an economy. Net investment outflows are driving the current account deficit.

That's why this Government has taken a proactive approach to economic growth and it appears to be working. GDP growth last year was faster than the US, the UK, Europe and Japan. Over time this will provide New Zealanders with more money to spend and more to save. We will also continue to encourage strategic foreign direct investment."

Mr Cunliffe's address outlined the steps this Government has taken to address the savings gap. Through the New Zealand Superannuation Fund the Government is saving for the increased spending that will be needed as the baby boomers retire.

The Government is also looking at the tax structures around retirement savings to ensure saving is not unnecessarily discouraged, and is working with the savings industry to address workplace savings and superannuation

It is also considering whether taxation supports investment that will lift economic productivity or whether it reinforces trends towards 'passive' investment in real estate.

"Saving is tough, especially when every dollar that comes in is being pulled in so many different directions. That is why the Government, the savings industry, employers and individuals must work together to close the savings gap."
