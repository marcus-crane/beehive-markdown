Fisheries Minister David Benson-Pope today announced a review of the amateur fishing regulations providing for [customary fishing](http://www.fish.govt.nz/customary/index.html).

Most customary fishing is currently done under Regulation 27 of the Fisheries (Amateur Fishing) Regulations 1986, which allow any group identifying itself as tangata whenua of an area to appoint people to authorise the taking of fish for hui or tangi.

"The long term goal is to have all customary fishing covered by the Kaimoana Customary Fishing Regulations, which have been developed in accordance with the 1992 Maori Fisheries Settlement," Mr Benson-Pope said.

"However until the customary fishing regulations can be implemented throughout New Zealand, most customary fishing will continue to be carried out under Regulation 27. This regulation has been tightened twice – most recently a year ago – but there is evidence of continuing abuse by an irresponsible minority of fishers. The review of Regulation 27 will focus on the rules around the issuing of permits, as investigations indicate this is the main area of abuse.

"The review will be conducted in collaboration with the Minister of Maori Affairs and Associate Minister of Fisheries, Hon Parekura Horomia. We will be endeavouring to work with Maori leaders to address a range of issues relating to the management of customary fishing.

"Customary fishing rights, as provided for under the Fisheries Deed of Settlement 1992, are collective rights held by iwi and hapu. We need to ensure that the obligations associated with these collective rights are clearly specified and that people can be held accountable to them."

Mr Benson-Pope said any changes to Regulation 27 would be consulted on, but given the current level of consensus amongst tangata whenua and the wider community on the need to prevent illegal fishing he did not anticipate a lengthy consultation period.

"I do stress that the majority of those issuing permits under Regulation 27 are doing so responsibly," the minister said. "This review is prompted by the actions of a small number of abusers."
