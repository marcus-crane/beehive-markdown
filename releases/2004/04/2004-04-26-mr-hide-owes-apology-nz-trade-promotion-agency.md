Progressive leader and Economic Development Minister, Jim Anderton, says Opposition MP Rodney Hide owes an apology to the country's trade development agency, New Zealand Trade & Enterprise (NZTE).

"A week ago, Rodney Hide issued a hastily put together statement attacking NZTE on the basis of allegations made by TVNZ's Sunday programme for which Sunday last night apologized.

"TVNZ did the responsible thing last night. It corrected its initial error.

"Now it is time for the Opposition to apologize for its unjustified attack on the important trade development work of NZTE which it made on the basis of false information which Rodney Hide, as usual, didn't bother check for accuracy before rushing into print.

"The promotion of New Zealand exports to global markets is a vital ingredient in any economic development strategy for New Zealand.

"Only a politician with absolutely no knowledge of the importance of exports would risk hurting the reputation of NZTE in a futile attempt to score political points," Jim Anderton said.

Rodney Hide has been an Opposition member since the day he entered Parliament in 1996 and it is possible his Parliamentary career will end next year without ever having experienced the responsibilities of government.

"I would urge the leader of the conservative parties, Don Brash, to counsel Mr Hide against his tendency to rush into print attacking the vital work of agencies such as NZTE and Investment NZ between now and the next election because these agencies will continue to be important to New Zealand's development regardless of which parties form the next government," Jim Anderton said.

Sunday last night advised that its story of a week earlier on paua smuggling, in which it said that the NZ Trade Commission had paid for a visit to New Zealand of a Chinese retailer, was incorrect.
