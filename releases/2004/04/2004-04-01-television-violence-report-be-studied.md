The government will carefully consider the report of the Television Violence Project Working Group which was presented to Acting Broadcasting Minister David Benson-Pope today.

The Working Group was set up in 2002 to look at the portrayal of violence on New Zealand television, to advise on whether it should be of concern and to examine whether the tools available to regulate television content are adequate. The project results from a Green Party initiative to investigate violence on television, for which $300,000 was negotiated with the government during the 2002 Budget.

David Benson-Pope said the report was a thoughtful contribution to the debate on television violence which the government would closely consider.

“Many New Zealanders are concerned about the level and nature of violence on television. Parents, in particular, worry about the consequences for their children of viewing violent programming.

“Research commissioned as part of the project has carefully examined whether such links can be drawn and it finds the evidence inconclusive, leading the Working Group to advise on the need for continued caution.

“The Working Group has recommended the Broadcasting Standards Authority expands its educative and informative role. The government is currently looking more generally at the future shape of our broadcasting environment and we will want to consider these recommendations as part of this work.

“The Working Group was made up of key broadcasters, regulators, viewer organisations, programme makers and academic representatives and I would like to thank them for working so well together to produce this report,” David Benson-Pope said.
