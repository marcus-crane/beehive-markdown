Education Minister Trevor Mallard leaves this afternoon for an education mission to Latin America, accompanied by a delegation of New Zealand education sector representatives.

Trevor Mallard's fourteen-day mission encompasses Mexico, Brazil and Chile and will focus on building closer co-operation in education services between New Zealand and those countries.

“I believe there is scope for further co-operation in education with Latin American countries, and I'm looking forward to discussing this with my counterparts and to visiting key education institutions,” Trevor Mallard said.

Trevor Mallard will attend the APEC Education Ministers' meeting in Chile.
