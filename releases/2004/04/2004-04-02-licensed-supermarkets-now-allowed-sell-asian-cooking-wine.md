An amendment to the Sale of Liquor Act will now allow Asian cooking wine and other food condiments containing alcohol to be sold from licensed supermarkets and grocers.

This week Associate Justice Minister Rick Barker moved a Special Order Paper to the Sale of Liquor Amendment Bill No 2, allowing for the sale of food condiments containing more than 1.15 percent alcohol from licensed supermarkets and grocery stores.

“The paper was agreed to and the amendment to the Bill’s off-licence provisions was supported and carried overwhelmingly, paving the way for food condiments containing alcohol to be sold from licensed premises.”

Asian cooking wine is made from rice or other grain either by a fermentation or distillation process and can vary in alcohol content from about 17 to 29 percent.

Because of this, it is classified as a liquor, restricting its sale to premises with a liquor licence – bottle stores or premises with an off-licence, but not usually specialist food stores.

“The reality is that some specialist food stores without an off-licence were selling these products, not for drinking purposes but as a food condiment. Such products have salt added, making them unsuitable for drinking.

“Amending the Sale of Liquor Act so that food condiments containing alcohol can legally be sold by licensed supermarkets and grocers widens the availability of such products, but maintains the condition on merchants to restrict the sale of such goods to persons aged 18 and over.

“It makes perfect sense that these products, although relatively high in alcohol, should be more accessible. They are integral to Asian cuisine and not marketed for drinking purposes.

“I’m sure that news of this sensible change to the Sale of Liquor Act will be warmly greeted by all persons who seek to obtain Asian cooking wine and other food condiments contining alcohol for the purposes they are genuinely made for,” Mr Barker said.
