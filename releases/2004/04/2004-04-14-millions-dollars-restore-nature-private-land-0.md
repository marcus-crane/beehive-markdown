A kiwi crèche is among 139 projects on private land to benefit from $2.6m of funding announced today by Conservation Minister Chris Carter and Environment Minister Marian Hobbs.

The funding has come from the Government's biodiversity condition and advisory funds set up to help landowners and community groups restore and preserve New Zealand's unique species on private land.

"The grants we have been able make from these funds this year will make possible the control of predators and the restoration of habitats across 43,000 hectares all over the country," Mr Carter and Marian Hobbs said.

"The initiative shown by the people and organisations who have applied for these grants and the hard work that lies behind many of the projects demonstrates the depth of commitment to conservation in our country."

Foremost among the grants is $100,000 to help build a predator proof fence around the 98ha of Bushy Park in Wanganui. Construction of this fence will allow a large kiwi crèche to be developed in the area for use in Operation Nest Egg, the kiwi conservation programme.

Two of the largest grants go to Queen Elizabeth II Trust. One of up to $118,000 will help rebuild fences around covenanted conservation areas destroyed in the recent flooding in the lower North Island. Another grant of $383, 545, will pay for weed and pest control on covenanted properties.

"These grants, in particular, demonstrate again the Government's ongoing willingness to assist private landowners, including farmers, with weed and pest control, where it preserves our natural environment," the ministers said.
