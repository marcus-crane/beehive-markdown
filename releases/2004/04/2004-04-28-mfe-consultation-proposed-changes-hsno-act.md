The Ministry for the Environment is seeking submissions on proposals to improve the management of hazardous substances under the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms (HSNO) Act 1996, Acting Environment Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

The suggested proposals are for streamlining the application process for hazardous substances and improving compliance, enforcement and communication.

Other proposals cover the rules on moving specialty substances between research institutions and the workability of exposure limit controls for substances that are toxic to human and animal health and to the environment.

The proposed changes are set out in a two-volume discussion paper available on the Ministry’s website at www.mfe.govt.nz

The first volume is aimed at everyone working with hazardous substances or with an interest in these substances while the second volume will also be of interest to people with a more technical interest.

Hard copies of the discussion document are also available by contacting Publications, Ministry for the Environment, P O Box 10362, Wellington.

Submissions on the proposed amendments close on Friday June 11 2004 and will be considered in drawing up the final policy.

Mr Benson-Pope said the latest amendment proposals are a further step in implementing the government’s Hazardous Substances Strategy, released in June last year. Earlier amendments, passed into law in March, were designed to speed up the transfer of existing substances in use in New Zealand to HSNO controls. Previously, different substances were subject to separate laws.

These amendments do not affect the way the HSNO Act operates for new organisms.
