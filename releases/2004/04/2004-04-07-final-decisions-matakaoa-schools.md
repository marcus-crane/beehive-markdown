Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today his final decisions on the review of Matakaoa schools on the East Coast, a move that will unlock about $980,000 in extra resources for the education of local students.

"I have been impressed with the level and depth of the advice and feedback we have received and would like to thank all those involved in this project during what has been a challenging and stressful time," Trevor Mallard said.

"I look forward to Matakaoa students having access to quality and sustainable education now and into the future. Students will also be able to enjoy the benefits of the extra operational resources released to individual schools.

"Using current estimates, $557,000 will be available to schools, over and above their normal entitlements, for education development resources. There will be a fund of $158,980 for schools to use for joint education projects, and $264,491 of extra property funding will be available," Trevor Mallard said.

The review decisions are:

- retain Potaka School as a Year 1-8 mainstream school;
- merge Wharekahika School, Whakaangiangi School and Te Waha O Rerekohu Area School on Te Waha O Rerekohu site as a Year 1-13 mainstream school with Te Waha O Rerekohu Area School being the continuing school; and
- approve entry to the Kura Kaupapa Maori establishment process for Kawakawa mai Tawhiti on the basis that it will provide full immersion Maori medium education for Year 1-8 students on the Wharekahika site for the time being.

The board of each continuing school will manage the transition period and govern the new school until elections can be held.

The Ministry of Education will work closely with schools to make sure their requirements for a smooth changeover are met and that the review is implemented in time for the 2005 school year.

The ministry's submission to Trevor Mallard will be available on the [network review section](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/index.cfm?layout=index&indexid=8697&indexparentid=6088) of the ministry's website [www.minedu.govt.nz](http://www.minedu.govt.nz)

The list of approximate funding for the schools follows. Funding is worked out on a roll basis, and follows students to their chosen school.

JSIF Extra Property Funding Merger of Whakaangiangi School, Wharekahika School and Te Waha O Rerekohu Area School $557,000 $158,980 $264,491

Please note that as Potaka School is being retained, and Kawakawa mai Tawhiti is entering into the Kura Kaupapa Maori establishment process, they do not receive any EDI or extra property funding. However, they will share in the joint fund initiatives.

At the end of the process a decision will be made as to whether a new building is put on the area school site.
