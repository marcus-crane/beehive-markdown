Amendments to the Sale of Liquor Act passed this week under Parliamentary urgency will allow for Easter Sunday winery sales and reinforce liquor licensing enforcement, Associate Justice Minister Rick Barker said.

“In 1999, the Sale of Liquor Act was amended to allow alcohol sales from premises with off-licences on Sundays, except Easter Sunday.

“Before the 1999 amendment, wineries had been able to sell their own wine on Easter Sunday, but the change five years ago mistakenly prohibited cellar door sales by wineries on this day. This was particularly hard on wineries at a time when cellar tours were just becoming popular.

“The amendment passed today restores the mistake of 1999 and wineries will now have the legal right to resume cellar sales on Easter Sunday,” Mr Barker said.

Wineries that held an off-licence under the Sale of Liquor Act and a wine licence under the Wine Makers Act 1981 would be covered by the new amendment.

Also today, Mr Barker said a key licensing enforcement tool previously not covered under the Sale of Liquor Act has now firmly been embedded.

“Previous enforcement measures for Liquor Licensing Act compliance included Controlled Purchase Operations (CPOs), where Police and public health officials sent underage volunteers into licensed premises in an attempt to buy alcohol.

“CPOs have become a critical tool for monitoring compliance of the Act, but in August last year doubts were raised about the basis on which they operated.

“It is vital that the Police have the necessary enforcement tools at their disposal, including CPOs, and amendments passed today to Sections 162 and 163 of the Sale of Liquor Act will address that.

“I’d also like to acknowledge the support of the Government’s coalition partners and opposition parties alike for their support in passing these important amendments,” Mr Barker said.
