It's encouraging to see such positive growth in the public sector says Customs Minister Rick Barker, as he welcomed fifteen new Customs inspections staff in Tauranga today.

The fifteen officers from Tauranga, Napier, and New Plymouth, beginning training this week, are among 60 new examinations officers that have begun careers with Customs in the last three months.

"I believe it’s important in today's society to show young people that a career in the public service, such as with Customs, is a rewarding and viable one, and can be a positive step that leads to many other meaningful career opportunities.

"Within Customs itself for example you can work in the airport or marine environment, become an inspector, an investigator, or an intelligence analyst for example, all the while consistently updating your skills with comprehensive ongoing training.

The opportunity for a long-term career with one organisation is also very important in building integrity and commitment within it – something that is evident in the New Zealand Customs Service with its strong emphasis on public service and integrity.

"Integrity is a vital ingredient in a strong public sector - which is critically important to a country's well-being.

"These are the people working for, and protecting, New Zealanders," says Mr Barker.

This intake brings the number of Customs staff in New Zealand to over 1000.

"This increase in capability is necessary to meet the new international challenges of increased security and growing trans-national crime," says Mr Barker.

To secure New Zealand's trade in this new international environment Customs has invested $17.9 million in cargo x-ray technology and employed 136 new staff (including the 60 new recruits) to enhance the screening of both import and export goods.
