Justice Minister Phil Goff will today launch a new website called LawAccess, which provides public access to an extensive range of law-related information.

"LawAccess is a fully searchable site that is essentially a gateway to the resources of more than 130 New Zealand government and non-government organisations," Mr Goff said.

"It offers people with legal problems or questions quick and easy access to quality information on rights and responsibilities under specific laws, as well as more practical information such as how to contact local community law centres.

"The website will also increase the Legal Services Agency's ability to support community groups such as Citizens Advice Bureaux and community law centres, and to offer educational material for libraries and schools. The LSA currently produces similar material in printed form, but online access will ensure the information is more readily available and always up to date.

"Users can search for information by key word, phrase, category or organisation. Each listing will generally provide the name and brief description of the resource, contact details for the organisation, the format (pamphlet, video, CD etc), date of production, any cost involved, translations available, and a link to the resource itself, an order form or the organisation’s website.

"LawAccess has the potential to save people time, money and difficulties in dealing with legal issues. Its development is a reflection of the government's commitment to providing strong public services and to ensuring all New Zealanders have access to a fair justice system," Mr Goff said.

The website will be available at www.lawaccess.lsa.govt.nz from April 29.
