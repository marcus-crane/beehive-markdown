The Immigration Minister Paul Swain says highly qualified professionals are being actively recruited in areas of skill shortages across the whole country as a result of the first full month's operation of the new Skilled Migrant Category.

"A key government objective is a return to the top half of the OECD, and this world-leading immigration programme gives New Zealand more control over increasing the level of skilled workers in the economy," says Mr Swain.

Highly qualified ICT professionals, a microbiologist, a psychiatrist, other scientists, doctors, nurses, secondary school teachers, and tradespeople such as mechanics and electricians are among those being invited to apply for residence.

The Skilled Migrant Category (SMC) was created by a law change last year, and is aimed at shifting the focus from the passive acceptance of residence applications, to the active recruitment of people with the skills that New Zealand needs.

The government has an annual programme of 45,000 places under its Immigration Programme, with around 60% of that - 27,000 places, allocated to the skilled/business stream.

Under the SMC, prospective migrants submit an Expression of Interest (EOI) which goes into a selection pool, and selected migrants are then invited to apply for residence.

"There have been four draws from this pooI, and the results so far illustrate that the Skilled Migrant Category is on track," says Mr Swain.

Today's draw had a selection point of 180. This means 330 Expressions of Interest (representing 879 people) were selected.

After verification checks, the NZ Immigration Service will formally invite those drawn from the pool to apply for residence.

Since the SMC has been in operation, 479 (excluding today's draw) Expressions of Interest have been selected and from these, a total of 144 Invitations to Apply have been issued.

"Interest in the new SMC has been high, with more than 3,000 EOI in the pool. The calibre of the EOI have exceeded expectations. Many applicants have achieved well over the 100 points minimum score. This allows us to select the very best migrants for New Zealand," said Paul Swain.

"Under the SMC, the NZIS will select only as many Expressions of Interest that match the places available in the programme. It also has the flexibility to increase or lower the selection point accordingly."

"Processing residence applications under the SMC is a priority for the NZIS, and processing times will depend on the level of checks and other verification procedures needed before a decision can be made to grant residence."

"This new programme is an important part of the government's drive to achieve sustainable growth for New Zealand."

### Media Kit Questions and Answers

**How often does the NZIS select Expressions of Interest from the Pool?**  
Selections are scheduled to take place fortnightly.

**How will I know whether my Expression of Interest has been selected?**  
If your Expression of Interest is selected from the Pool, you will be advised in writing soon after the selection. If you submitted your Expression of Interest online, you can also check to see if it has been selected by logging onto your Skilled Migrant Online Services homepage after the selection has been announced.

**My Expression of Interest has been selected - what is happening now?**  
Your Expression of Interest is undergoing preliminary verification by NZIS officers to determine whether the claims made in your Expression of Interest can be verified as being credible and legitimate. Then, if your details check out, you will be invited to apply for residence.

**What does 'preliminary verification' involve?**  
Preliminary verification involves a check to ensure the claims made in your Expression of Interest can be verified as being credible and legitimate, particularly factors for which you are claiming points. This may involve the NZIS contacting you, your New Zealand employer or others to confirm some of the details in your Expression of Interest. If you are invited to apply for residence, further assessment and verification will be carried out and you must provide documentation to support the claims made in your Expression of Interest.

**What is the cut-off point for Expressions of Interest to get into the Pool for a selection?**  
There is no set 'cut-off' point. The NZIS aims to process paper Expressions of Interest and get them into the Pool as quickly as possible, but if you are worried your Expression of Interest may not be accepted in time for the next selection, we recommend you submit it online. Advantages of the online Expression of Interest include the fact it is cheaper than submitting a paper form, and you will know instantly whether it has been submitted into the Pool.

**My Expression of Interest didn't get selected - how long will it stay in the Pool? Will there be more chances for it to be selected?**  
Expressions of Interest remain in the Pool for three months. The preliminary selection from the Pool on 18 February did not count for these purposes - Expressions of Interest submitted into the Pool before the selection on 3 March 2004 will remain in the Pool for three months from that date (i.e. until 3 June).

**What does 'selection point' mean? How do you calculate the selection point?**  
Expressions of Interest accepted into the Pool are ranked according to their points score. The NZIS determines how many Expressions of Interest it wishes to select based on a number of factors, including:

- the number of places available in the Skilled/Business stream of the New Zealand Immigration Programme,
- the quality of Expressions of Interest in the Pool (as indicated by their point scores), and
- the total number of Expressions of Interest in the Pool at selection time.

Taking these factors into account, the 'selection point' is set at a particular points level, and Expressions of Interest at that point score and above are selected from the Pool.

**Am I better off submitting my Expression of Interest online, rather than using the paper form?**  
Generally, yes. The NZIS recommends that you use the online Expression of Interest because:

- the fee to submit an online Expression of Interest is considerably less than the fee for the paper form
- you will know immediately whether your Expression of Interest has been successfully submitted into the Pool
- you can check the status of your Expression of Interest online and make instant updates to your Expression of Interest after it has been submitted into the Pool.

In contrast, if you submit a paper form you must send it to the NZIS in Wellington for processing. If the form is incomplete it cannot be submitted into the Pool and may be sent back to you. Also, if you wish to make any changes to your Expression of Interest after it has been submitted into the Pool you must do so in writing to the NZIS.

**How can I find out the latest selection point?**  
A history of selection points and the number of Expressions of Interest selected each time is available on the NZIS website at www.immigration.govt.nz.

**How many selections has the NZIS made since the new Category came into effect?**  
A preliminary selection was made on 18 February and there have been three selections since then, counting this week's selection.

**What happens if Expressions of Interest are selected from the Pool but the point score claimed is incorrect?**  
All Expressions of Interest selected from the Pool are checked by NZIS officers to ensure the point score is correct. In cases where the point score is found to be incorrect, the NZIS will recalculate the points and if the new point score is at or above the selection point, and other details in the Expression of Interest check out, the Expression of Interest will proceed to the Invitation to Apply stage.

If the new point score is lower than the selection point, and the NZIS is satisfied the incorrect score was the result of a genuine error, the Expression of Interest will be returned to the Pool and will be available for the next selection, at the revised point score. If the NZIS considers the customer deliberately attempted to mislead us, the Expression of Interest will not go any further.
