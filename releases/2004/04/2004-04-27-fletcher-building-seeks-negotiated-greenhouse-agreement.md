The Government will enter negotiations for a [Negotiated Greenhouse Agreement](http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/policy-initiatives/nga.html) with Fletcher Building Limited.

"Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements (NGAs) are a key element of New Zealand's climate change policy, says the Convenor of the Ministerial Group on Climate Change, Pete Hodgson. "These agreements will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions while safeguarding the international competitiveness of New Zealand businesses."

An NGA is a binding agreement between a firm and the Government that commits the firm to moving towards world's best practice in managing greenhouse gas emissions. In return, the Government provides a full or partial exemption for the firm from the emissions charge that is to be introduced by 2008. NGAs are limited to firms or industries whose international competitiveness would be at risk from an emissions charge.

"Encouraging best practice in emissions management offers both economic and environmental benefits," Mr Hodgson said. "NGAs and other climate change policies, such as the Projects to Reduce Emissions programme, are designed to help New Zealand secure the benefits of newer, cleaner energy technologies."

Fletcher Building’s manufacturing businesses that are eligible to negotiate an NGA include its cement, wood panels and laminates, and steel and wire operations.

The Government has signed one NGA, with the New Zealand Refining Company, and is negotiating with ACI Glass Packaging, Norske Skog Tasman, mining companies Newmont Waihi and OceanaGold (formerly GRD Macraes), Silicon Metal Industries Limited, New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Limited and some of Carter Holt Harvey's major New Zealand manufacturing operations.

The [New Zealand Climate Change Office](http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/) at the Ministry for the Environment takes applications from firms seeking NGAs and assesses their eligibility and priority. It has further applications under assessment.
