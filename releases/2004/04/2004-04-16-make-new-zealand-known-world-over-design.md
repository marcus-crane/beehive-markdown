A plan to increase the use of design in New Zealand business will be put in place over coming months with the release of a series of NZ Trade and Enterprise programmes.

NZ Trade and Enterprise is the Coalition Government's agency responsible for industry development.

The Economic Development Minister told the launch of Converge ’05 today that he wants New Zealand to be known worldwide for design excellence.

"I want our creativity to be envied the world over. I would like to see our innovation developed for the benefit of all New Zealanders, for the jobs, the incomes, for the living standards and for the excitement it can all bring," Jim Anderton said.

"Over the next few months New Zealand Trade and Enterprise will introduce a series of design based programmes. They will help companies to utilise design in order to improve the quality of both products and services.

"A board of leading designers, educators and businesspeople will be appointed to a Design Leadership Group.

"There will be a significant communications programme aimed at increasing awareness of the value of design - both for businesses and for New Zealand. It will help to promote a culture of creativity, innovation and excellence."

Jim Anderton says the quality of life New Zealanders aspire to can’t be produced by a low-cost, low-value, low-skill and low-rewards economy.

"Design creates the edge we need if we are going to sell our products on the basis of excellence, instead of trying to compete in a race to the bottom on price," Jim Anderton said.
