Civil Defence Minister George Hawkins has presented 12 Central Hawkes Bay Taskforce Green workers with certificates recognising their help following last February's floods.

Mr Hawkins met the team today for morning tea on a farm at Wallingford, near Porangahau in Central Hawkes Bay.

The team of long-term unemployed workers began the unpleasant job of clearing debris such as logs, silt, gorse and even dead stock, from farm fences in the area on 8 March.

Although initially expected to work for only three weeks, feedback from farmers had been so positive the team's employment period was twice extended to meet demand. They will now finish on 16 April.

Two of the workers have gained fulltime jobs during their involvement with the cleanup, and five others have interviews with local contractors.

Mr Hawkins said written testimonials from farmers and others such as lifestyle block owners who had benefited from the team's assistance, were full of praise for the team's work ethic and positive attitude.

"One farmer even commented that the team had lifted spirits at a time when it felt nothing positive was happening.

"It's been dirty, heavy work that has also been utterly vital to getting farms back into production.

"The farmers' testimonials show the difference you have made to people at a very difficult time in their lives," Mr Hawkins said.
