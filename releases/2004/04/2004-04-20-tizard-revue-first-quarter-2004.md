- [Funding Sources for New Zealand Artists](#14)

* * *

**Welcome to the Tizard Revue**  
The year in arts has started well with a number of festivals across the country. The New Zealand International Arts Festival was notable for the breadth and depth of the New Zealand work. It was fabulous to see New Zealand choreographers, dancers, artists, composers, musicians, playwrights and theatre groups all being featured and being such notable successes in the face of great international shows.

It indicates to me that the Cultural Recovery Package of May 2000 continues to have a good effect. We are now doing a lot of work thinking about how to make sure that we can capitalise on that foundation and continue to expand the opportunities for New Zealand artists to make a better living and develop new work.

Part of this will be in touring and marketing around New Zealand, part of it will be in exporting.

We are looking at policy development around export opportunities. I’d be interested to hear your thoughts and ideas. The opportunities continue to be tantalisingly close but often an airfare halfway round the world away. After going to South By Southwest in March 2003 to see our musicians perform in that export market, I spent a few days in February this year at the Australian Performing Arts Market in Adelaide.

What came through really strongly at Adelaide was the enormous range of New Zealanders who are performers and members of production companies in Australia, UK, Europe and North America – it’s got me thinking about how we can network with and through them. Their generosity and enthusiasm is important to what we do.

Both SXSW and APAM have confirmed for me that the world is hungry for New Zealand work – as long as it’s packaged for their festivals and touring circuits; available and ready to go. Creative New Zealand, the NZ Film Commission and NZ Music Industry Commission are working in these areas, often with NZ Trade and Enterprise and Tourism NZ, to make sure that the opportunities and support are available. Also during April and May, the Royal NZ Ballet is touring the UK, including performances at Sadler’s Wells in London.

Festivals are often the way the rest of the world brings the world to their communities and their communities to the rest of the world. The focus on many events in a single place gives people a compelling reason to visit that place. And the opportunities for the whole community are huge. I saw a great statistic the other day: there were 472 stalls at this year’s massive Pasifika Festival in Auckland. Many of these stalls were held by community groups to provide information to festival-goers, but most of them were engaging in commerce.

Partnerships with local government and private industry are as essential as partnerships with central government. Many councils are notable for the infrastructure they provide but we still have an awful way to go. Some small towns are making fantastic facilities and opportunities available, while some of the larger cities are slipping behind.

Culture is now a purpose of local government. I hope, in this local government election year, that you’ll be taking the opportunity to look at your councils’ long term community and financial plans. Encourage them to provide good infrastructure for the arts and promote the business of the arts throughout New Zealand.

Meanwhile, the New Zealand Comedy Festival is coming up. You are performers, you know how important forward-bookings are!

**CREATIVE NZ SURVEY CONFIRMS IMPORTANCE OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR THE ARTS**

A recently-published survey confirms the importance of the government’s cultural recovery package and other forms of support for New Zealand’s creative professionals, says Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard.

Creative New Zealand has published Portrait of the Artist/Te whakaahua o te Tangata pukenga, a survey of professional practising artists in New Zealand (available at the [Creative New Zealand website](http://www.creativenz.govt.nz) ).

“The survey of more than 1,000 professional practising artists provides an enormously valuable insight into the reality of being a practising arts professional in New Zealand,” says Judith Tizard.

“It confirms what we already knew from anecdotal evidence – that our professional artists work incredibly hard at what they do, that the majority of them also work at other jobs and projects over and above their primary arts practice, and that they do this knowing they will earn less than the average New Zealand wage.

“Artists surveyed described their roles as helping create a unique national cultural identity, and reflecting and expressing life in New Zealand, including its cultural diversity. Most were motivated by a love and passion for their work.”

Judith Tizard said the survey shows professional artists’ earnings have been at the lower end of New Zealanders’ average income. “This means that our arts professionals have for a long time been subsidising New Zealand’s image as a creative and innovative nation through their hard work.”

The survey also painted a vivid picture of the importance for artists of early arts experiences with families and teachers, and ongoing mentoring and support from family members, friends and peers, the Minister said.

“This report is a welcome confirmation that we have been on the right track with initiatives such as the new Arts Curriculum in schools, and the PACE programme through Work and Income, which assists job seekers to develop a career in the arts and creative industries.

“And it provides us with a clear view of issues that artists would like to focus on to help improve their financial status and business skills, such as marketing, contracts and copyright.

“Creative New Zealand has been using these findings in its strategic planning and work over the past few years. Now that the full survey has been published, I hope it will enable arts professionals, arts companies, tertiary institutions, other government agencies and businesses to better plan strategies for growth in the creative sector.

“I also want to thank the arts professionals who took part in the survey for their openness, generosity and willingness to share information about their working lives for the benefit of the sector.”

**REVIEW OF GOVERNMENT SCREEN FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS – DISCUSSION PAPER**

The government is seeking feedback from the public and industry, by 30 April 2004, on possible improvements to the way government organises its support for screen production in New Zealand .  
As recommended in 2003 by the Screen Production Taskforce, the government has launched a wide-ranging review of the various mechanisms and agencies involved in support for screen production. This discussion paper identifies and discusses various current issues and challenges and puts forward some possible options for enhancing the effectiveness of existing screen funding arrangements.

The discussion paper is available on-line at the [Ministry for Culture and Heritage website](http://www.mch.govt.nz/publications/screen-review/index.html) .

**PRIME MINISTER WELCOMES CHALLENGE FOR NZ BOOK INDUSTRY**

New Zealand-published books earned $117 million in export earnings last year, according to a new government report launched by Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark.

The report, Exports of New Zealand Published Books, presents the findings of a publishing research project commissioned by the Ministry for Culture and Heritage.

The aim of the research was to assess the significance of book publishing to the creative industries by determining, in particular, how many of the 3,600 titles published in New Zealand in 2002 were exported. The report was funded from the additional $1 million allocated for New Zealand authors and literature announced in the 2002 Budget.

Helen Clark said the report describes an industry which is significant both in terms of size and turnover, and one that has considerable economic potential.

“In 2002 more than 600 book publishers had a combined annual turnover estimated at $204 million, and more than 50 per cent, about $117 million, was generated by exports.

“These figures demonstrate that as well as making an important contribution to our country’s cultural life, writing and publishing also provide sustainable employment and contribute to economic growth.

“The $117 million in foreign exchange earnings from books published in New Zealand in 2002 compares with the $200 million per annum estimated export earnings from the screen production industry.

“I am confident that, in the wake of this report, the publishing industry will be encouraged to accept the challenge of delivering a sustainable future for publishers and authors.

“The Ministry for Culture and Heritage is now working with the Writers’ Consultative Group and industry representatives on a strategy to grow audiences and markets for New Zealand literature.

“The report underlines the economic opportunities which can flow from a strong creative sector, and I look forward to those opportunities being developed in the years ahead,” Helen Clark said.

The full media statement is on the Beehive website The [here](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F18797).

The two reports, Exports of New Zealand Published Books and A Measure of Culture, are available online [here](www.mch.govt.nz).

**TE MATATINI – RE-ENERGISING KAPA HAKA**

The Aotearoa Traditional Maori Performing Arts Society was re-branded as ‘Te Matatini’ at a Parliamentary function on 24th March.

The new name ’Te Matatini’ reflects ATMPAS’ kaupapa Maori and vision of kapa haka. The name refers to the meeting of earth and sky, and the ‘shimmer’ of sunlight reflected from wet ground, which represents the dancing of kapa haka.

At the launch, Judith Tizard said the re-branding marks an exciting new phase of the evolution of kapa haka and the evolution of the organisation, which was funded in 1998 to support the development of kapa haka.

“Kapa haka is incredibly disciplined, yet there is absolutely freedom to say what matters, to feel what matters, to express what matters.

”It is an integral part of the lives of Maori, and it’s traditional way of preserving the knowledge of tribal history and genealogy through song and dance. For our young people, the impact of first language and culture is very important and kapa haka provides a fun, intense, exhilarating way of learning history (as well as getting exercise and being able to yell at the top of your voice!)”

**NZSO LEGISLATION CONFIRMS CULTURAL IMPORTANCE OF ORCHESTRA**

The New Zealand Symphony Orchestra Bill passed on 1 April once again demonstrates the Labour-led Government’s commitment to ensuring the ongoing availability of arts, culture and heritage to the people of New Zealand.

“This legislation aligns the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra with other cultural organisations under the Crown,” says Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard. “It recognises the Orchestra’s role is as important culturally for New Zealand as its financial performance.”

Judith Tizard said the primary purpose of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra Bill was to change the status of the Orchestra from a limited liability company to an ‘autonomous’ non-company Crown entity. This conforms with the current reform of Crown entities.

The Bill clarifies in legislation the Orchestra’s role as a touring national orchestra by explicitly specifying its principal objectives and functions.

“These objectives and functions emphasise the Orchestra’s leadership role by requiring it to promote and encourage New Zealand symphonic music and composers and performance opportunities for New Zealand musicians.”

**NEW ZEALAND MUSIC MONTH – MAY 2004**

Once again May brings New Zealand Music Month: a month of promotions, gigs, celebrations and green t-shirts with the distinctive ‘target’ logo.

"2003 was by all accounts the best NZ music month yet," says NZ Music Month Committee chair David Innes.

In the last week of May alone, local content on New Zealand radio reached a record 22.76% - eclipsing previous records.

"We are determined to make 2004 NZ Music Month even bigger and better," says David. "Given the talents and commitment of the committee this should be easily achievable."

**NEW ZEALAND MUSICIANS A HIGHLIGHT AT SXSW**

Once again, New Zealand artists were a highlight at the infamous South By South West (SXSW) music convention, held in March in the US.

Pluto, the Have, the Coolies, Neil Hannan, Little Thief and Meterman were amongst more than 1000 bands invited to showcase their music to over 20, 000 delegates from around the world at the prestigious trade show and showcase convention in Austin, Texas.

The New Zealanders made a major impression with influential international music industry guests who attended the NZ music function, on opening night of SXSW. The Have and Pluto entertained representatives from BBC 1 and American college radio and record companies, concert promoters, managers and bookers.

“The NZ function was the best launching pad into SXSW for both bands and really started the buzz for them,” says The Have manager Teresa Patterson.

**MICHAEL KING**

A memorial service for Dr Michael King was held on Saturday 17th April at The Marae at The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington. Her Excellency Dame Silvia Cartwright, publisher Geoff Walker, historian Jock Phillips, Human Rights Commissioner Judy McGregor, writer Gordon McLauchlan, writer and daughter Rachael King and director and son Jonathan King were amongst those paying tribute.

Prime Minister Helen Clark said Michal King was one of New Zealand’s finest historians and his death along with his wife Maria Jungowska in a car accident on March 30th was a terrible tragedy.

“He made a huge contribution to New Zealand history and scholarship, and was a voice of reason and enlightenment on issues around New Zealand race relations.”
