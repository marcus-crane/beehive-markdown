The Associate Transport Minister Harry Duynhoven says last nights' passage of the Maritime Security Bill through Parliament, with unanimous support, means New Zealand is well on target to meet the international deadline of 1 July for port and ship security measures.

“Since the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, New Zealand and the rest of the world has faced an increased global terrorist risk. The government recognises that New Zealand's relative geographical isolation does not provide immunity from the threat of terrorism”, Mr Duynhoven said.

The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) responded quickly to September 11 to agree to a new framework for international maritime security. This was done through amendments to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) in December 2002. As a contracting party to SOLAS, New Zealand is required to enact legislation to put the new security framework in place.

The Maritime Security Act 2004 requires ships and port facilities to approach security with an increased level of seriousness, to develop personnel with expertise to assess the security status of their operations, and to come up with an auditable plan to manage security risks.

“Risk assessments for all the affected port facilities are now complete and ports have been submitting their security plans to the Maritime Safety Authority for approval" said Mr Duynhoven.

“All the parties involved have been acutely aware of the importance of getting this legislation right and the consequences to New Zealand’s trade and tourism industry of not progressing this legislation promptly.

“I have been particularly pleased with the high degree of co-operation that has been shown on this very important matter, and am grateful for the work done on the Bill by Dianne Yates and the other members of the Government Administration Select Committee. The very clear message that the passage of this Bill sends is that New Zealand takes its international obligations seriously and continues to be a safe place to visit”, says Mr Duynhoven. There are still some challenges to face as we move closer towards the 1 July deadline, and I am sure that any operational issues that arise will be able to be worked through.

“The Maritime Security Act is one of three pieces of legislation this government has introduced to safeguard New Zealand from terrorism and trans-national crime, and to keep our trade and tourist markets secure. Given the increased global terrorist risk, the Bill is intended to address gaps in current maritime security and is a vital step towards ensuring our ports and the ships visiting them are well protected”, he added.
