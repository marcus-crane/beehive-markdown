Expressions of interest in serving on the inaugural board of the Charities Commission are now being invited, Commerce Minister Margaret Wilson said today.

“The Government is establishing a Charities Commission to help foster a culture within New Zealand of philanthropy and generosity," she said.

“The establishment of the Commission is intended to increase the charitable sector’s transparency and accountability through the creation of a registration, reporting and monitoring system for charities.

“The Commissioners on the inaugural board will play a key role in the development of this important initiative.”

Five to seven board members would be appointed, including a Chair and deputy Chair. The positions were expected to be part-time.

“The Commissioners’ role will be to govern, direct and supervise the Commission’s business.

“The inaugural board will need a broad and deep range of experience including knowledge of the charitable sector, law, accounting and Crown entity governance.”

The Charities Bill is currently being considered by Parliament and the Social Services Select Committee has called for submissions which close on June 3 2004. The Bill is expected to be reported back to the House in time for legislation to be passed creating the Commission by November.

Margaret Wilson said appointments would not be made until after the Bill is passed into law.

“We are starting the selection process before the Commission is established because of the length of time it takes to appoint Commissioners. The selection process can easily take six months, and we are expecting significant interest in these positions due to the size of the charitable sector and the experience and skills associated with it.

“We are mindful of the submission process, and that the functions of the Commission could be changed during the Bill’s progress through Parliament. The recruitment process allows for this necessary flexibility, as the skills we are looking for will still be needed even if functions change as a result of Select Committee consideration,” Margaret Wilson said.

Advertisements are appearing in major newspapers, letters are being sent to key groups in the sector, and the advertisement and job descriptions are now available from www.charities.govt.nz.
