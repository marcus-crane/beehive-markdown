Associate Justice Minister Margaret Wilson today announced the appointment of Aucklander Marlene Oliver as an Environment Commissioner.

Marlene Oliver will replace Commissioner Bob Priest who died in January of this year after a brief illness.

A former County Planner for Rodney County Council, Marlene Oliver has had 30 years experience in planning and resource management. Her experience has included plan preparation and policy work, resource consents and multi-disciplinary projects.

For the past 16 years she has practised as a planning consultant with a range of government and private clients. She is also director of a company providing resource management related education services, and an Independent Commissioner with Auckland City Council.

"Marlene Oliver's appointment to the busy Auckland Court will help maintain the Court's momentum in reducing the number of outstanding cases and accelerating the time between filing and completion," Margaret Wilson said.
