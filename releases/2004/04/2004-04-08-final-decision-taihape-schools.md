Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today his final decisions on the review of Taihape schools, a move that will unlock over $2.9 million in extra resources for the education of local students.

"I have been impressed with the level and depth of the advice and feedback we have received and would like to thank all those involved in this project during what has been a challenging and stressful time," Trevor Mallard said.

"I look forward to Taihape students having access to quality and sustainable education now and into the future. Students will also be able to enjoy the benefits of the extra operational resources released to individual schools.

"Using current estimates, $657,000 will be available to schools, over and above their normal entitlements, for education development resources. There will be a fund of $187,740 for schools to use for joint education projects, and $2,091,458 of extra property funding will be available," Trevor Mallard said.

The review decisions are:

- retain Mataroa School, Mangaweka School, Moawhango School, Papanui Junction School, Pukeokahu School, Rangiwaea School, Taoroa School and Waiouru School;
- close Taihape Primary School and Taihape College and establish a new composite (Year 1 - 15) school on the Taihape College site under the initial governance of an establishment board appointed by the Education Minister; and
- that the boards of trustees of Mataroa, Papanui Junction and Rangiwaea schools continue to consult with their parent communities about the development of a combined board between the schools.

The Ministry of Education will work closely with schools to make sure their requirements for a smooth changeover are met and that the review is implemented in time for the 2005 school year.

The ministry's submission to Trevor Mallard will be available on the network review section of the ministry's website www.minedu.govt.nz

The list of approximate funding for the schools follows. Funding is worked out on a roll basis, and follows students to their chosen school.
