Family Court users and members of the public will now find more information about the Court in a [user-friendly and updated website](http://www.courts.govt.nz/family/), said Courts Minister Rick Barker at the website launch today.

“The content of the website has been updated to provide more information for people about Family Court proceedings. A wide cross-section of the community have an interest in the operation of the Family Court and the government, by delivering strong public services, is keen to meet the demand for straight forward information.

“The aim of this website is to help demystify the Family Court and how it works by presenting practical information in everyday language. This website is now less formal and easier to navigate around. So many use the net now for information, so it makes sense for people to log-on to the Family Court site.

“People can now view pictures of a typical courtroom to see who the key people are and what they do, this will remove some of the 'scrariness' of going to court.

"The pages for children and young people on how the Court works are colourful and in plain language. Children can find the separation of their parents really frightening and confusing. The government recognises this and is investing in making information more accessible to them," he said.

Other features of the site are an updated glossary, a summary of key pieces of Family Court legislation, on line forms and links to Family Court publications. The site also links to a wide number of organisations that support the work of the Family Court and provide additional information useful to court users.

The provision of this resource is a continuation of the Government's programme of updating the Court system and making it more accessible to all Court users. These include initiatives such as the Court Education for young witness program, open days being held in Courts throughout the country and the provision of additional information regarding the fines collection process.

The website doesn’t replace the expertise of Court staff, however, who will continue to provide information and help to court users.

The Minister encourages anyone with an interest in the Family Court to check out the website at www.courts.govt.nz/family/.
