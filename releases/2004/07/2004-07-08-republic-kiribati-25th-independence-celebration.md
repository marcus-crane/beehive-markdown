Associate Minister of Pacific Islands Affairs, Taito Phillip Field leaves today for a three-day visit to Kiribati to represent New Zealand at the country's 25th anniversary of independence.

Mr Field will meet with the President of Kiribati, Anote Tong, Minister of Fisheries and Marine Resources, Tetabo Nakara, and will call on NZAID projects operating in Kiribati.

“The visit will focus on strengthening New Zealand’s relationship with Kiribati. The visit will also provide a chance to hear Kiribati’s views on the Pacific Islands Forum, fisheries in the region, and development issues," Taito Phillip Field said.

In Kiribati, the Minister will visit NZAID funded projects including the University of the South Pacific extension centre, the Development Bank of Kiribati, and the Atoll Seaweed Company. Taito Phillip Field will also lay a wreath at the Memorial to the 17 New Zealand “Coastwatchers” executed by the Japanese during World War II.

“Kiribati is a valued member of the Pacific Islands Forum, and the visit will consolidate the good working relationship we have with the country, says Taito Phillip Field.
