Government and Citizens Advice Bureaux have entered a new era of partnership, says Consumer Affairs Minister, Judith Tizard.

Judith Tizard and CAB National President Lynne Barraclough have signed a two-year memorandum of understanding that further strengthens the relationship between government and the CAB.

The agreement will see the Ministry of Consumer Affairs working closely with the CAB on a number of new consumer-focussed initiatives, including a pilot project to capture data from the 75,000 consumer enquiries handled by CAB every year. Funding of $660,000 has been provided to undertake this project over the next four years.

"Information gathered from this project will enhance the Ministry's understanding of consumers and strengthen CAB capacity to provide up-to-date information and advice to consumers.

"Citizens Advice Bureaux volunteers handle over 2200 enquiries every working day across a range of consumer issues. They play an important role in ensuring consumers throughout New Zealand are well informed and able to transact with confidence."

"The Government recognises the vital link CAB provide to consumers at a community level. By working in partnership with CAB we are able to ensure information gets to the people who need it, especially those who are most vulnerable."

CAB President, Lynne Barraclough said the partnership reflected a common goal of ensuring consumers in New Zealand are well informed about their rights.
