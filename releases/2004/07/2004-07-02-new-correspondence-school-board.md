Education Minister Trevor Mallard today announced that he had reconstituted the Correspondence School's board to see the School through a period of change.

Trevor Mallard has appointed seven people to a Transition Board for a period of two years as the School is repositioned in the education system. The new board is charged with ensuring input is received from stakeholders, including representatives of students, parents, and staff.

"The next couple of years could well be a period of significant change and development for the School. I have decided that a skills based board, rather than a representative board, is necessary to address the School's sustainability, change and business recovery issues," Trevor Mallard said.

Ian McKinnon will head the Transition Board. The other members are Bruce Adin, Russell Ballard, Claire Hague, Polly Schaverien, Waimarama Taumaunu, and Michael Webb.

"The Correspondence School will continue to have a significant role within New Zealand's education system. I am confident that the range of skills and abilities of this team, together with those of the stakeholders who will be consulted, will reposition the School well for a sustainable future," Trevor Mallard said.
