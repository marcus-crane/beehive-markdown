Courts Minister Rick Barker says he is impressed with the information technology being trialed in Australian Courts and is looking at how court IT can be used to speed up New Zealand courts.

The Minister is currently being shown new innovative IT projects that are speeding up court processes and reducing the case backlog in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney.

"In court technology including video conferencing, remote recording and witnesses -audio –visual technology is being centrally managed in Victoria for their Supreme Courts, County and Magistrates Court. This along with off-site remote audio and video recording at the technical headquarters, is contributing to greater efficiency and effective hearing of cases," said Rick Barker.

In New South Wales a new innovative IT project called Courtlink is operating for the justice and legal system .It will link NSW Courts with the community by providing easy access to court services through one management system, secure internet access, and enable shared information between justice agencies.

Rick Barker explains that in Australia Courtlink is a web-based court system that provides centralised processing and information retrieval including case registration, fines and payments, lodging of documents, practitioner access to court diaries and on line access to transcripts.

" This speeds things up, Australian courts are able to interchange information between themselves and with external agencies. This will reduce duplication of data across courts, allow faster and easier access to information and improve case management.

" An exciting progress Australia has made with IT is the eCourt, in the Land and Environment Court NSW, which is an internet based computer system enabling access to lodgement services, remote electronic access to e-lodged documents and a record of activity in each matter.

" In Australia I have gathered more ideas and knowledge of what IT is possible for New Zealand and am confident new technologies will be of great advantage to the public.

"It's interesting to see how the three Australian states and NZ are wrestling with similar problems of increasing caseloads and budget pressures, making a compelling need to find efficiencies in the system. Looking at Australia we're able to see three different but similar jurisdictions and compare notes about what works well and not so well, he said.
