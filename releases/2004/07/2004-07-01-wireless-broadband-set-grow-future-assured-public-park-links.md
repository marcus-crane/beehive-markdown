"Wireless broadband is set to grow now that there is greater certainty around the radio spectrum available for fixed links." David Cunliffe, Associate Minister of Communications, announced today.

Networks using fixed radio links to carry broadband data will now be able to operate under a General User Radio Licence rather than an individual licence. The new arrangement has been piloted successfully over the past twelve months.

“The objective was to test market interest in fixed links operating under a General User Radio Licence.” David Cunliffe said. “The industry has responded enthusiastically and many systems have already been installed.”

The General User Radio Licence permits broadband point-to-point data transmissions in the 5.725 to 5.825 GHz band, which are also used for wireless local area networks (WLANs). Provided that basic conditions are met, such links can be established and operated in this “public park” spectrum with no individual licensing or fees. Distances of over 30 km are being achieved in rural areas.

The GURL does not provide protection from interference but operators can work together to ensure it is minimised. To assist with this co-ordination the Ministry of Economic Development is providing space on its website for operators to record details of their installations. This is a voluntary recording system, introduced at the request of the industry.

"Today’s announcement provides certainty to operators. This certainty will help to encourage the growth of wireless broadband services." said David Cunliffe
