Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today his final decisions on the review of schools in the Central Northland area. These decisions followed a period of additional consultation focussed on Maori medium provision in the review area.  
The decisions are to:

- retain Motatau School;
- retain Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Taumarere, but to relocate this school to the Moerewa School site; and
- allow the merged Moerewa/Otiria School to occupy the whole Otiria site.

“These decisions build on earlier decisions for this review by ensuring the ongoing development of te reo Maori education provision in the Central Northland area,” Trevor Mallard said.  
"I would like to thank all those involved in this review for their advice and feedback during what has been a challenging and stressful time.”  
Trevor Mallard also confirmed his interim decisions to close Orauta School and Te Kura o Matawaia. This will unlock approximately $400,000 in extra resources for the education of local students, in addition to amounts specified in the Central Northland review decisions announced in May 2004.  
All decisions will take effect on 28 January 2005.  
“I wish all central Northland schools every success as they implement these review decisions. Significant support will be provided to schools during the implementation phase.”
