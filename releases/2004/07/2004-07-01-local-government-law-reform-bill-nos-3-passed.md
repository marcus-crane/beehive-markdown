Legislation has been passed in Parliament clarifying that a person will be able to stand for both a mayoralty and councillor position on the same council at this year’s local authority elections.

The Local Government Law Reform Bill Nos 3 passed its third reading in Parliament late yesterday with that opportunity clarified.

The Bill, as passed, also contains a new clause added by the government reinstating the casting vote for mayors or people presiding at local authority meetings.

"The Bill clears up grammatical and technical drafting matters in local government legislation dating back to 1995," Local Government Minister Chris Carter said.

"Two of the most significant matters it deals with are the provision of the casting vote, and the ability of people to stand for council and mayor in the same council election.

"I am delighted we have been able to swiftly resolve these issues which have troubled the local government sector. It is another example of the government's partnership approach to its relationship with New Zealand's local and regional councils."
