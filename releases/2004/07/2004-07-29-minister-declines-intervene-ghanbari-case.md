Associate Immigration Minister Damien O'Connor has declined to intervene in the case of Iranian overstayer, Saied Ghanbari.

Mr Ghanbari now has a week to voluntarily depart New Zealand. The New Zealand Immigration Service is assisting him to obtain the necessary travel documents.

Mr Ghanbari arrived in New Zealand on a false passport seeking refugee status. Both the Refugee Status Branch and the Refugee Status Appeals Authority determined that his claim to refugee status lacked credibility and declined his application. Mr Ghanbari remained unlawfully in New Zealand, evading the Immigration Service until June this year.

Immigration served a removal order on Mr Ghanbari as soon as he presented. That removal order is still in place. Mr Ghanbari appealed to Mr O'Connor earlier this month to intervene in his removal.

Mr O'Connor said he reached his decision not to intervene after careful consideration of all aspects of Mr Ghanbari's case.

"Mr Ghanbari is in New Zealand illegally after failing to gain refugee status. Taking this, and all other factors put before me into account, I found there was insufficient reason to intervene in the Service's decision to remove him."

Mr O'Connor said an important message could be construed from the case.

"People cannot remain in New Zealand illegally. We have strict immigration policies in this country and people are expected to cooperate with Immigration to ensure they're not breached."

Mr O'Connor pointed out that Mr Ghanbari could apply for a visa to return to New Zealand in five years time, when his removal order had expired.
