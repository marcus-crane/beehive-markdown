A report on the Resource Management Act prepared by local government has been welcomed by the Minister leading a review of the Act.

Associate Environment Minister David Benson-Pope says the report, Enhancing New Zealand's Resource Management Performance, prepared by Local Government New Zealand is comprehensive and makes a number of recommendations that his review was sure to take into account.

"Interestingly, many of the recommendations that local government have proposed strongly reflect points raised with us by other sectors including business and the wider community," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"Local government is at the coalface of resource management in New Zealand which means they are particularly well placed to make comments on how the workings of the Act can be improved. The constructive nature of the report is particularly useful."

Local government has been heavily involved in the review process to date, including at the cross-agency policy discussion level and they also have a representative on the Ministerial reference group.

Mr Benson-Pope says this high level of involvement recognises the valuable contribution that local government has made and continues to make to this review.
