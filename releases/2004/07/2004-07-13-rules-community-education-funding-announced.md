The Tertiary Education Commission is writing to tertiary education institutions letting them know how they can qualify for funding through the government’s new ring-fenced pool for community education, Acting Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education) Margaret Wilson said today.

The government began discussions with the sector in February about its concerns at the level of growth in community education (funding classification 5.1), which was uncapped as part of the 1998 Budget, and in May announced its decision to cap the amount of enrolments in this area to enable the TEC to subject the offering in this classification to more scrutiny. The decisions made also involved a reduction in the funding rate from $5,707 per equivalent full-time student (EFTS) in 2004 to $5,000 in 2005.

Margaret Wilson said that the cap would allow 43,500 EFTS to be funded over the 2004-06 period, and that these would be allocated by the Tertiary Education Commission as part of its process of negotiating funding profiles with tertiary education institutions this year.

“Community education is an important part of the tertiary education sector with a proud history. Not everyone wants to sit an exam and get a certificate for every short course they attend. However, the major increase in this area undertaken by institutions, particularly in the last year, does not fit with the government’s spending priorities for tertiary education, and we were not satisfied that all of it was leading on to further learning or producing other benefits for our communities or economy.

“Following the recent growth, we need to get back to basics with community education. We want to bring community education delivered in tertiary education institutions more into line with other forms of Adult and Community Education.

“The government has agreed on five priorities for Adult and Community Education provision, which TEC will use in deciding whether or not to fund particular programmes. These are:  
·Targeting learners whose initial learning was unsuccessful;  
·Raising foundation skills.  
·Strengthening communities by meeting community learning needs;  
·Encouraging lifelong learning; and  
·Strengthening social cohesion.

“These priorities are being applied across all of the wider area of Adult and Community Education, for which Marian Hobbs has responsibility, including programmes in schools and community organisations like Rural Education Activities Programmes (REAPs). Their application to tertiary education institutions is an important step towards a more consistent approach to all Adult and Community Education. (There is, however, some provision within funding classification 5.1 such as continuing professional development, that does not fit the definition of Adult and Community Education, and this will be prioritised against more general Statement of Tertiary Education Priorities and Tertiary Education Strategy objectives.)

“In addition, in order to ensure that overall community education provision remains within the capped amount, there will be an amount, called a ‘notional allocation’, which TEC can allocate in full to an institution only if all its programmes fit with the relevant priorities. The only way an institution will be able to receive more than its ‘notional allocation’ is through a small additional allocation for priority areas.

“The ‘notional allocation’ will use a baseline of enrolment levels averaged over the period 2002-04, as well as the 2004 forecast 5.1 EFTS, plus the principle that 2005 enrolment levels should be 30% below this baseline, and 2006 levels 30% below 2005. Full details of this have been covered in TEC’s letter to TEIs.

“However, TEC will be flexible in allocating funding across the three years so long as the courses meet the relevant priorities and overall provision over the period fits within the institution’s ‘notional allocation’.

“The TEC will also be allowed to fund a further allocation of around 3,000 EFTS (from within the 43,500 available) to priority areas. For some institutions, this might be in addition to their ‘notional allocation’. This gives an opportunity to institutions that have traditionally not been large providers of community education to increase their provision.

“This announcement follows extensive consultation with tertiary institutions. A sector working party contributed suggestions to address the issues and government decisions have wherever possible been guided by this feedback, Margaret Wilson said.
