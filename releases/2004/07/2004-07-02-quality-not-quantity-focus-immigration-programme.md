New Zealand will accept up to 50,000 new residents in the year ending June 2005, Immigration Minister Paul Swain announced today.

The government's immigration planning cycle aims for an intake of 45,000 a year from 2003 to 2006. There is an allowance to approve an additional 5,000 if necessary. This year's higher target is to make up for a shortfall in the year to 30 June 2004. The Immigration Service is forecasting 39,000 approvals for the year just ended.

The Immigration Service puts this year's decline in approvals down to a reduction in the average family size of applications, the lapsing of lower quality applications when the new Skilled Migrant Category was introduced last December, and improved detection of fraudulent applications.

“The whole of New Zealand benefits from immigration, particularly when we're approving quality migrants who'll settle well and make a real contribution to our economy and society,” said Mr Swain.

“Given New Zealand’s tight labour market and demand both for and from skilled workers, the Immigration Service will be aiming to approve applications to the upper end of the range.”

Residence approvals for the next year will continue to focus on skilled/business migrants, who comprise 60 percent of the Immigration Programme. The growing number of people approved for residence from work-to-residence policies will also be included in the Skilled/Business Stream.

The Family Sponsored Stream will make up 30 percent of the Programme and the remaining 10 percent will be made up of refugees, Pacific migrants and others approved under the International/Humanitarian Stream.

“Immigration is always a balancing act between stimulating the economy and recognising New Zealand's ability to absorb new migrants – be they from Great Britain, the United States, Asia, the South Pacific or elsewhere," Mr Swain said.

The Skilled Migrant Category, (SMC) focuses on recruiting people with the skills New Zealand needs, in areas of labour shortage. The SMC is supported by an active marketing strategy targeting people who meet these criteria, and who have a reasonable command of the English language and will settle well into the community.

Under the SMC, people can self assess to see whether they meet the minimum threshold of 100 points. If they do, they can submit an Expression of Interest, which goes into a pool available for selection. Every two weeks a number of Expressions of Interest are selected from the pool. After checking, those selected are invited to apply for residence. The latest selection point was 150 points.

Strong interest is being shown in registering to come to New Zealand under the SMC. As at 1 July, 6,684 Expressions of Interest have been received. Some 3,812, covering 9,216 people (the principal applicant and family members) have been selected; 1245 invitations to apply have been sent and 183 applications, covering 517 people have been approved. As the pass mark drops, and the marketing strategy kicks in, the number of people registering interest in applying is expected to keep rising.

"About 60 percent of those selected to apply for residence so far have claimed bonus points for seeking employment outside Auckland, in growth areas or in areas where there is a specific skills shortage. The SMC is directly benefiting all corners of the country," Mr Swain said.
