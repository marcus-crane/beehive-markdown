Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister, Hon Judith Tizard, today announced the re-appointment of three members to the Board of Te Papa.

Current members David Gascoigne and Mark Solomon have been re-appointed to the Board for a further term of two years expiring 30 June 2006 and 31 July 2006 respectively. Josie Karanga has also been re-appointed for a period of three years to 31 July 2007.

Judith Tizard praised the re-appointed members, noting that their re-appointments would “ensure continuity and enable the Board to retain the benefit of their experience and expertise.”

The Museum was established as a "national forum to present, explore and preserve both cultural heritage and environmental knowledge in order to better understand and treasure the past, enrich the present, and meet the challenges of the future". The principal functions of the Board are to collect works of art and items relating to history and the natural environment, and to conserve and exhibit the national collections and to make those collections accessible to the public. The Museum also has research and educational roles, and is developing a National Service, in co-operation with other New Zealand museums, to provide adequate support to institutions and organisations holding objects or collections of national importance.
