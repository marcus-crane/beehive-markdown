A working party, consisting of Ministry of Health, Hospice New Zealand and District Health Board New Zealand representatives, has been set up to discuss concerns Hospice New Zealand has raised with Health Minister Annette King about hospice and palliative care funding issues.

Hospice New Zealand representatives met Ms King and Ministry officials today to discuss funding and other issues.

Ms King said after the meeting that the working group had been set up to examine a number of issues, including funding and service provisions.

“I expect the group to have their first meeting within a week or two, and to report back to me in about three months. The group, to include Hospice New Zealand chief executive Ann Martin, will examine Hospice New Zealand data and collect and examine other data from DHBs on their current provisions and future intentions.”
