Minister of Energy, Pete Hodgson, says the Greens are jumping at shadows following the Ministry of Economic Development's publication of the Water Bodies of National Importance and Identification of Potential Hydroelectric Resources reports.

"It's regrettable but the Greens are jumping to groundless conclusions. This report does not say that development is going to take place on any of the waterways mentioned – it simply identifies potential. In the same way, we know a lot about our national coal resource, but there are no plans to dig it all up and burn it tomorrow," says Pete Hodgson.

"It's a shame they have overreacted in this way especially when they have a track record that broadly supports this government's approach to sustainable development – especially in regard to wind and energy efficiency measures."

"Nor should anybody take this report as signaling the resurrection of project Aqua. The report pre-dates it being shelved and I would like to make it clear that there are absolutely no plans to revisit this decision."
