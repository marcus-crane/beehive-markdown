From today, around 38,000 people aged 65 and over living in South Auckland can get cheaper doctor visits and reduced charges for many prescribed medicines.

The benefits are available through the Primary Health Organisations (PHOs) around the country as part of a government drive to deliver better, more affordable community health care services

Mangere MP Taito Phillip Field says over 83 per cent of Counties Manukau DHB’s over-65 population is registered with a PHO and stand to gain from their share of a targeted cash injection of an extra $47 million into primary health care across the country.

South Auckland has around 38,000 people aged 65 and over who — if registered with a participating interim PHO — become eligible today for cheaper doctor’s visits and a maximum of $3 per item for most prescription items. (About 100,000 registered with Access-funded PHOs around the country are already benefiting).

From today, 73 PHOs will care for more than 3.5 million New Zealanders —almost two million of whom now have access to reduced or low-cost primary health care.

“It’s a remarkable achievement for the huge number of health professionals who’re involved in PHOs and the Counties Manukau DHB,” said Taito Phillip Field.

“An extra $759 million is being invested over four years in primary health thanks to the government’s commitment to building strong public services and improving the well being of all New Zealanders.”

PHOs ALSO encourage primary care providers to explore new ways of keeping their populations well – in their community rather than in the hospital.
