Minister for Regional Development, Jim Anderton, today welcomed Transfund's decision to further invest in the roading infrastructure in Northland.

"The decision is positive news for everyone interested in promoting the further economic development of the Northland region, including the continuing expansion of its tourism and forestry industries," Jim Anderton said.

"It will be welcomed by those at the coalface, working in tourism, forestry, businesses in the region and the community as a whole," the Progressive leader said.

"Over the past few years I have encouraged, and been encouraged by, the vision and commitment to Northland economic and social development shown by its local leaders. There is no doubt in my mind that upgrading the transport network is vital to underpinning the creation of new job opportunities for local people in their own region," Jim Anderton said.

"Upgrading the roading system, including constructing the Kerikeri Heritage Bypass and seal extensions in the Kaipara area, is essential to improve both the safety of the roads as well as to unleash the potential of the significant economic, social, cultural and environmental benefits the region has to offer," Jim Anderton said.
