The government has approved a new Packaging Accord that will reduce waste and increase the amount of packaging that can be recycled.

Environment Minister Marian Hobbs announced today that the five-year New Zealand Packaging Accord 2004 has been approved by the Cabinet and will be signed on 10 August.

The voluntary accord has been developed by the Ministry for the Environment and the Packaging Council of New Zealand, with support from Local Government New Zealand and the Recycling Operators of New Zealand (RONZ).

Key sectors involved are paper, plastic, glass, steel and aluminium; and brand owners and retailers.

“Packaging waste is a concern for New Zealanders and this is an excellent example of government and industry working together to address the issue,” Marian Hobbs said.

Under the accord producers have to consider the full packaging lifecycle, from initial need and design to what happens when the packaging is no longer needed.

This will see brand owners, retailers and packaging manufacturers become more efficient in the production, use and recovery of packaging materials.

Sector action plans have been developed for the accord’s main parties and the key packaging sectors.

The plans include national targets for recovering used packaging materials and annual reporting.

The accord has been developed in accordance with the New Zealand Waste Strategy, developed by the Environment Ministry in partnership with Local Government New Zealand.
