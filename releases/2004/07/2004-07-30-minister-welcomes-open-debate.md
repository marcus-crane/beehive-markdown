The minister responsible for Civil Union legislation is welcoming people taking an active part in public debate but he says this must be done in an up-front and open manner.

Associate Justice Minister David Benson-Pope was responding to an article in The Press today that highlighted the questionable tactics and motives of right-wing lobby group the Maxim Institute.

The article linked Maxim to US-based fundamentalist organisations and suggested Maxim were running a campaign against the Civil Union Bill and its tandem legislation the Relationships (Statutory References) Bill that fell short of democratic norms in New Zealand of openness and fairness.

These included paid members of Maxim taking part in a letter writing campaign without identifying themselves as Maxim members; Maxim using an electronic tool called a "letter wizard" which creates lobbying letters which are then passed-off as original; and Maxim members deliberately putting forward inaccurate information in the public domain in an attempt to skew the debate.

"The right of people and groups to publicly express views is one of the cornerstones of our democracy," says Mr Benson-Pope. "When legislation is passing through Parliament this right takes on an even greater significance.

"I believe all New Zealanders want to know this right is being exercised in a fair and proper way.

"Some of the issues raised in The Press today do concern me. Not least because it is clear that Maxim have large financial resources to set about achieving its aims, but it does not make clear where those resources come from.

"In my mind this places an even greater onus on Maxim to act in a way that will not lead people to question their motives because, inevitably, such questioning has to lead one to ask who is funding this organisation, and to what end?"
