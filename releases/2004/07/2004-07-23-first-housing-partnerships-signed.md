Six housing partnerships worth $3.7 million were announced today by Acting Housing Minister Rick Barker.

The projects are the first proposals accepted by the Government’s $63 million Housing Innovation Fund which was announced as part of Budget 2003. The Fund was established to encourage third sector groups (not-for-profit, non-government community), iwi/Maori organisations and local government to increase their involvement in providing rental housing and home ownership opportunities for low-income earners and people with special needs.

Rick Barker said the first six projects would provide housing for more than 41 people living in Ponsonby, Manurewa, New Plymouth, Rotorua, Hamilton and Palmerston North.

“Community groups, churches and local government have long played an important role in social housing provision and, with the new funding, the government would like to work with a wider range of organisations to increase the range and number.

“The real value of working in partnership with like-minded community-based organisations is that both they and the government can leverage off each others capital and expertise to realise specialist projects that would otherwise go unbuilt.

“It’s also going to take some time to replace the 13,000 state houses sold during the 1990s – although we have already added 4,200 homes to HNZC’s stock since 1999.”

The six organisations receiving funding totalling $3,743,587 are:  
·Community of Refuge Trust, Auckland – purchase of about five one or two-bedroom units in central Auckland for mental health consumers and people in need;  
·Te Roopu Taurima O Manukau, Auckland – building a six-bedroom home in Manurewa for Maori with intellectual and/or physical disability;  
·Barrett Homes, New Plymouth – building five new units for physically disabled young people;  
·Pukeroa Oruawhata Trust, Rotorua – building five two-bedroom units for Ngati Whakaue kaumatua;  
·Abbeyfield New Zealand Incorporated, Hamilton – building a 10-unit complex for older people; and  
·Lutheran Homes, Palmerston North – building five one-bedroom units for older people.

“HNZC will continue to assist these first groups with advice as their projects progress. It is also assisting a number of other third sector groups with feasibility and development advice, so they too can get similar projects off the ground.

“We have also had a positive response from local authorities. The Corporation is currently working with seven councils on proposals for loans from the parallel Local Government Housing Fund to develop new housing initiatives,” Rick Barker said.

*Background*  
In Budget 2003, the government announced new funding of $63 million over four years for third sector and local government housing initiatives. The funding will be used in two separate initiatives – the Housing Innovation Fund for third sector partnerships, and the Local Government Housing Fund for local authorities.

The Government acknowledges it cannot meet the demand for social housing on its own. The funding is intended to encourage third sector (not-for-profit, non-government community, church), and Maori/iwi organisations to increase their existing and future involvement in providing affordable housing options for people on low incomes or with special needs.

The funding will be allocated amongst the two initiatives each year, depending on priorities.

Both initiatives are administered by Housing New Zealand Corporation (HNZC), which also provides community based organisations and local councils with specialist advice – such as feasibility and development studies – for potential projects that may be eligible for funding.
