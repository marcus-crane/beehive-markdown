Maximum paid parental leave payments will increase from $334.75 per week to $346.63 per week from today, 1 July 2004, Associate Labour Minister Ruth Dyson has announced.

The new rate applies from today to new applicants and those already receiving parental leave payments. People who already receive payments will be advised of the increase by the Inland Revenue Department through their regular payments letter.

Under the Parental Leave and Employment Protection Act, the maximum rate is adjusted each year to reflect any increase in average weekly earnings, as determined by the Quarterly Employment Survey.

"Paid parental leave has made a very positive contribution to family life. Financial support makes a difference to parents at a fundamental level. This government is committed to wrestling with real issues people face when balancing their work and personal lives," Ruth Dyson said.

Statistics show that most employees accessing the scheme, use it for the full 12 week entitlement. Last year 16,000 people (99.7% of whom were women) tapped into the scheme. At any one time, about 4150 people are receiving parental leave payments.

The government is also looking to expand existing provisions of the scheme. The Parental Leave and Employment Protection Amendment Bill, following a review of the scheme last year, is currently before a Select Committee and seeks to:  
·Extend the eligibility for paid parental leave to employees who have worked for the same employer for at least six months, rather than 12 months as at present;  
·Extend the duration of paid parental leave from 12 weeks to 13 weeks on 1 December 2004 and to 14 weeks on 1 December 2005.
