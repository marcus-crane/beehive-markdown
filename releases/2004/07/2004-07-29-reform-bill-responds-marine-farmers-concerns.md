The Government has listened hard to the marine farming industry and responded by incorporating their ideas in new legislation, Fisheries Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

Speaking to the New Zealand Marine Farming Association's annual conference in Blenheim, Mr Benson-Pope said the Aquaculture Reform Bill will be ready to be introduced to Parliament by the end of August. He expected the Bill to be passed by the end of the year – to coincide with the lifting of the marine farming moratorium.

"The Aquaculture Reform Bill secures a sustainable future for New Zealand’s aquaculture," he said. "I’m confident it balances economic development, environmental sustainability, Treaty obligations and community concerns.

"There was a need for change. Industry members would be only too aware that many of them were having to spend more time and money on expensive legal processes than they were on developing marine farms and the industry."

**Key features of the Bill that reflect the concerns of industry include:**  
\-Replacing the old dual permit system with a streamlined one-stop-shop process through regional councils under the Resource Management Act (RMA).  
\-Introducing the option for a new private plan change process where industry can promote a plan change and have preferential access to a portion of any space resulting from the private plan change.  
\-Setting aside a 20 percent allocation of new marine farming space for Maori to address the unfinished business of the 1992 Fisheries Settlement, thus removing uncertainty.  
\-Agreeing that licences under the Marine Farming Act will be grand-parented as 20 year consents with a right of renewal if they are in Aquaculture Management Areas (AMAs) when renewed.  
\-Deciding that for farms under the dual RMA/Fisheries Act regime the Fisheries permit conditions are deemed consent conditions.  
\-Clarifying where farms are not exactly on the authorised site, a process will see the site regularised with either the authorisation or the farms moving.  
\-Agreeing that all marine farms with resource consents will be deemed to be AMA unless a coastal plan prohibits aquaculture in that site.

"While it has taken time to reach this point, I am confident we are proposing a workable solution that will take us into a future that will see the exciting potential of the marine farming industry realised," said Mr Benson-Pope.
