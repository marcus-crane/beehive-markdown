Fisheries minister David Benson-Pope has reissued an invitation to recreational fishing groups to identify regulations for improvement, in the wake of claims today that scallop-gathering regulations are dangerous.

He says the Outdoor Recreation Party is wrong when it says there are new regulations governing scallop divers this season but if a year-old court interpretation of the Amateur Fishing Regulations was illogical or dangerous, then the opportunity exists for scallop divers to make their case.

Last year the courts interpreted Section 19 of the Amateur Fishing Regulations to mean that scallops must be measured at the point of taking, that is, in the case of divers on the seafloor.

Outdoor Recreation Party spokesperson Stephanie Railey today issued a press release saying new scallop regulations were putting diver's lives at risk – presumably referring to recent Ministry of Fisheries advice to divers to comply with the existing regulations and measure scallops as they collect them.  
Mr Benson-Pope says previous Fisheries Minister Pete Hodgson had issued an invitation to the Recreational Fishers Reference Group to identify their top priorities for regulations in need of review. No response was received and Mr Benson-Pope has twice repeated the invitation to recreational fishers since taking over the portfolio.

"I am repeating that invitation to recreational fishers again today," said the minister. "If regulations aren't working well then it is up to fishers to tell us which ones they are and how they might be improved.

"I've said we'll listen. I've said if we find a problem, we'll try and fix it. I catch a bit of flak from recreational fishers from time to time but we've made this offer three times before without response. Now is the time for them to take responsibility and take some action."
