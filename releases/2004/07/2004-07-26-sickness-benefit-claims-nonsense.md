Claims that [Work and Income](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/) clients are deliberately being moved from the [unemployment](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/get-financial-assistance/main-benefit/unemployment-youth.html) to [sickness](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/get-financial-assistance/main-benefit/sickness.html) benefit, have been slammed by the government today as totally baseless.

Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey dismissed any suggestion that it was Work and Income policy to transfer those who were difficult to employ, from the unemployment benefit to the non-work tested sickness benefit.

“In fact, we rely completely on the professionalism and integrity of doctors, to make accurate medical assessments as to whether a claimant is fit for work or not.

“Work and Income staff are simply not qualified to make these medical assessments. Doctors who refuse to issue medical certificates to people who are able to work are doing exactly what we expect them to do.

Steve Maharey said the facts are that since 1999 over one million people have come off the [unemployment](http://www.stats.govt.nz/domino/external/pasfull/pasfull.nsf/7cf46ae26dcb6800cc256a62000a2248/4c2567ef00247c6acc256e91000a0394?OpenDocument) benefit – less than six per cent of those transferred to a sickness benefit. At the same time 42,000 people transferred from the sickness benefit to the unemployment benefit, where they are expected to be actively seeking work.

“We have to remember that unemployed people also get sick, and there are several factors influencing the numbers on the sickness benefit including the increasing average age of the working population, the [growing older population](http://www.stats.govt.nz/domino/external/pasfull/pasfull.nsf/web/Reference+Reports+Older+New+Zealanders+-+65+and+beyond+2004?open) (aged 60-64 years), and rising incidence of heart disease and obesity.

“Previous governments had a ‘pay and forget’ policy when it came to sickness benefits. This government wants real solutions for those wanting work, but for whom their health is a barrier to that employment.

“That’s why the government [launched](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F19538) the [Sickness and Invalids Benefit Strategy](http://www.msd.govt.nz/work-areas/people-with-disabilities/sbib-strategy/sbib-strategy.html) in April this year, which is specifically aimed at stepping up support for people with ill health or a disablity.

“We want to create real opportunities for these people to gain and keep paid employment,” Steve Maharey said.

This Strategy is world-leading in its innovation. The initiatives include:

- a pilot programme paying for health treatment where this will assist the return to work
- enhanced case management
- lowering the number of active cases for each case manager
- specialist work brokers to support clients and employers and,
- allowing Invalid beneficiaries to work 15 hours or more without losing their eligibility.

Ray Smith, head of Work and Income, is offering assistance to the NZ Medical Association (NZMA) which is to consider the issue at a meeting in Wellington tomorrow.

“Ray Smith has already made contact with NZMA, and I am confident that any issues of real concern will be addressed.”

Steve Maharey said that since this government took office in 1999, unemployment has fallen to among the lowest in the OECD at 4.3 percent.

“More people than ever before are in the paid work force,” he said.
