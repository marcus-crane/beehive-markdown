Education Minister Trevor Mallard today officially opened Oteha Valley School, a new and innovative state primary school in Albany, Auckland which started teaching students in February this year.

"The design of this new school is innovative and modern, and the board and staff have put in place high quality teaching programmes in a short space of time. This really bodes well for the education of Albany children. The local community is going to benefit greatly from this school and I congratulate everyone who has worked to make this happen," Trevor Mallard said.

In a different approach to the establishment of a new school, the Ministry of Education employed MultiServe Education Trust to provide governance support and facilitation to the establishment board.

"I am very pleased with the outcome of this teamwork. Our government is committed to raising education standards for all our students, and it's great to see students learning in an attractive and enjoyable environment that makes them enthused about their education," Trevor Mallard said.

The school is situated adjacent to Oteha Valley Road in Albany, with access off Medallion Drive, in the centre of significant new residential housing development.

"The decision to establish a new school for students from new entrants to year 6 (age 10) was made some time ago to meet Albany’s increasing population growth," Trevor Mallard said.

"It will take pressure off neighbouring primary schools, particularly Glamorgan, Sherwood and Pinehill Schools."

The school was designed by Babbage Architects, with considerable input from the establishment board of trustees. The construction project was led by Arrow International.
