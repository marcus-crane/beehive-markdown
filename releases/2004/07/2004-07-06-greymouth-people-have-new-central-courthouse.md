The government is spending $4.5 million to build a new courthouse for Greymouth, Courts Minister Rick Barker announced today.

Mawhera Incorporation and the Ministry of Justice have reached an agreement that will see the new courthouse located in the town centre. The new courthouse will replace the current 1908 courthouse in Guinness Street.

“I am delighted that The Supervalue Supermarket site, bordering Herbert, Guinness and Tarapuhi Streets, which was favoured by the vast majority of local people, will be the new site, we are just dotting the 'i' and crossing the 'ts' on the contract now.

“As soon as the paperworrk is through with Mawhera the Ministry can start developing detailed plans and consulting with local stakeholders. We hope to call tenders in early 2005 and see the new courthouse completed by the end of 2005, as planned.

"This is very good news for Greymouth people and I am pleased that both the government and Mawhera have worked to deliver the best result for them, I intend to visit once design plans are finalised, to get a feel for the new facility," said Rick Barker.

The new courthouse will provide 2 courtrooms, a hearing room for mediation and tribunals, jury rooms, large segregated waiting areas, interview rooms, a lawyers room, judges chambers, spacious administration areas, and state of the art security systems including new cells and a secure sallyport for the transfer of prisoners.

The Ministry of Justice intends to dispose of a previously proposed courthouse site at the corner of High and Cowper Streets.
