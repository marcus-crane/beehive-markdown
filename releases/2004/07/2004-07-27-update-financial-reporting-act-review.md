Commerce Minister Margaret Wilson has announced plans as a result of submissions on the review of the Financial Reporting Act 1993.

“In March this year I released a discussion paper containing a joint proposal of the Accounting Standards Review Board (ASRB) and the Institute of Chartered Accountants (ICANZ) setting out a three tier reporting framework. Feedback from submitters has generally been positive but there was concern with the proposed scope of tier two".

Ministry of Economic Development officials are now looking at this and certain other aspects of the first proposal, including the appropriateness of separate reporting regimes for the private and not-for-profit sectors.

“A revised proposal will then be set out in the forthcoming discussion document on Part II of the Review planned for release later this year,” Margaret Wilson said. "Following that discussion document, I intend to have a Bill introduced into the House by the middle of next year".

“This will not affect those entities seeking to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) from 2005. The current framework is sufficiently flexible enable early adoption.” Margaret Wilson said. “Further, those entities that will become subject to the Financial Reporting Act as a result of the review will not be affected immediately – there will be a suitable transition period and some will not be required to produce reports until 2009."

A key reason for the review of the Act is to maximize the benefits of adopting IFRS. “A rigorous set of internationally-compliant financial reporting standards is likely to have a number of benefits for New Zealand, including making us a more attractive investment destination.

"I would also like to express my thanks to ICANZ and the ASRB for their ongoing work in this area and making the transition to IFRS as smooth as possible," Margaret Wilson said.
