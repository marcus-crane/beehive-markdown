Information Technology Minister, Paul Swain, and Acting Associate Minister for Tertiary Education Margaret Wilson today announced $918,000 funding for projects that will encourage innovation and an entrepreneurial culture between the University of Auckland and industry.

The projects are Growth and Innovation Pilots funded by the Tertiary Education Commission. This new contestable funding initiative, announced last year, aims to encourage a culture of greater entrepreneurship within tertiary education organisations and closer collaborations between TEOs and industry to ensure education and training is more relevant to the needs of biotechnology, design and ICT businesses.

Speaking on a visit to the University of Auckland’s well-respected ICEHouse (International Centre for Entrepreneurship), Paul Swain said that the Growth and Innovation Pilots were a good example of the tertiary education reforms fostering innovation and entrepreneurship in important areas of our economy.

“We are pleased to help the University of Auckland build on the work of the ICEHouse with a project to nurture and develop an entrepreneurial culture across the University. A range of activities will foster this development including the establishment of an ‘Entrepreneurs in Residence’ programme, more business mentors for University staff and students, and setting up a Bi-Annual Enterprise Conference to showcase the university’s talent.

The Acting Associate Minister Tertiary Education Margaret Wilson said the three University of Auckland pilots announced today are groundbreaking examples of the type of initiative New Zealand’s knowledge economy needs.

“The Innovation Academy provides an advanced ‘summer school’ for information and communications technology graduates to gain relevant business experience from experienced practitioners, and we are also funding the development of new programmes to respond to the skills needs of plastics and polymer composites industries.”

“All three projects show how the Tertiary Education Commission can support the great ideas that the tertiary education sector has to offer,” Margaret Wilson said.

The purpose of the new government funding secured by the University of Auckland is to nurture a stronger entrepreneurial culture across the University and encourage greater commericalisation of research activities.

***Nurturing Entrepreneurship***  
The purpose of this pilot is to further develop the entrepreneurial culture in the University of Auckland and its stakeholders through a range of activities. These include: establishing an Entrepreneurs in Residence programme in a number of faculties; further expanding and sustaining their successful mentor programme with industry; developing a pool of enterprise mentors that are able to assist academics, researchers and students to advance their science and technology concepts further; network creation and innovation celebration through a Bi-Annual Enterprise Conference to showcase the University’s talent; and creating greater understanding of entrepreneurship models through a series of case studies.  
Funding: $253,000

***ICT Innovation Academy***  
This pilot proposes the formation of an ICT innovation academy, giving enthusiastic, novice practitioners (ICT degree programme undergraduates at the University of Auckland) a chance to receive mentoring/coaching, experiential project-based learning, and lessons in ICT entrepreneurship delivered by practitioners and academics. The academy programme will be structured as an academically-approved four-credit course. Student participants will: work over the summer on industry-based projects, with professional project management; receive tutoring from an industry mentor / academic (“pracademic”); and learn aspects of business development and entrepreneurship relevant to the ICT sector, through seminar-based coursework delivered in partnership with the University of Auckland ICEHouse and other private and public sector partners.  
Funding: $422,000

***Design & Specification for the Plastics & composites Industries***  
This pilot relates to the plastics and polymer composites industries. It will develop a “specifiers” course for the design of components manufactured for application in the electronics, health-care and related industries; offer a level-5 operator diploma training in specialised plastics materials and processing; and develop a “plastics design and engineering“ option to the Bachelor of Engineering (Mechanical) degree at the University of Auckland.  
Funding: $243,000.
