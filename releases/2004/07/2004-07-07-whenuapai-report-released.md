Defence Minister Mark Burton today released a report on the public consultation process over the future use and disposal process for Whenuapai airbase. It concludes the first stage of the process, and supports the need for a thorough analysis as the next step in determining any future use of the land.

“This report was undertaken by Defence to gauge local views on the four broad options outlined in the October 2003 Whenuapai Discussion Document: residential usage, an industrial/development site, a commercial airport, or other public works. Clearly, a thorough understanding of local views and concerns is essential to an informed decision making process,” said Mark Burton.

Jim Anderton said that “much of the debate that surrounds Whenuapai’s future involves whether it should be retained as an airport. Before a decision can be made, it is clear that the implications of this option need to be investigated further—notably whether or not there is a need for a second commercial airport in the Auckland region, the national and strategic considerations, and the likely local impacts.

“Cabinet has now directed the Ministry of Economic Development, in consultation with the Treasury, Ministry of Transport, Ministry for the Environment, and other appropriate agencies, to produce a thorough and robust whole-of-government report to answer these questions. This work will build on the consultation already done with local communities. This is the next essential step in a fully informed decision making process.”
