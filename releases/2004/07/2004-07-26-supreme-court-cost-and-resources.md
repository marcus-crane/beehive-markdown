"I am a little surprised at the chief justice's comments, as I have tried to consult on matters that affected the Supreme Court", says Attorney General Margaret Wilson.

"As to the name, I originally referred to the court of final appeal, but that was considered too much of a mouthful. That left few options, since we already have a High Court and a Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court was therefore considered the appropriate name for our highest court.

"As to resourcing, it was anticipated that the workload of the court would be light in its first year, and so it is proving.

"The Government has budgeted $8.6 million in capital spending on establishment costs. Operating costs, including setting up the library, are $3 million, excluding judges' salaries, which are $1.8 million.

"I have undertaken to review resources as the demand occurs.  
I would note, however, that upon the judges' rejecting the temporary accommodation in the Kate Sheppard building, I arranged for them  
to have their preferred accommodation in the Victoria University Law School building.

"I have also ensured there's continuing liaison with the judges on the new Supreme Court building.

"The reasons why staffing matters are through the Justice Ministry is to maintain the independence of the judiciary".
