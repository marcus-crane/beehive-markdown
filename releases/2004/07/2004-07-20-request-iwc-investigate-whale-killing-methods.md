New Zealand is calling for the International Whaling Commission (IWC) to examine the inhumane methods used to kill whales, Conservation Minister Chris Carter announced today.

"Despite a moratorium on commercial whaling, a number of nations - Japan, Norway and Iceland - continue to kill thousands of whales annually. The methods used to kill these whales are often very brutal," Mr Carter said.

"If the International Whaling Commission cannot stop whaling, it should at least be seeking to improve killing methods to minimize the suffering of hunted whales. For this reason, New Zealand will tonight (NZ Time) propose that the IWC reestablish a working group to further improve the efficiency of whale killing methods."

Mr Carter said large whaling vessels currently used harpoons that were designed to explode inside whales resulting in extensive tissue damage. Other methods included rifles of varying calibres and hand-held harpoons that were used to attach floats designed to slow down a wounded whale.

"These methods often result in a slow agonising death or wounded whales escaping to an unknown fate," Mr Carter said.

"A recent report has documented that the average time taken to die by harpooned or shot minke whales off Greenland was 14 minutes. For fin whales it was 114minutes. One observed whale took up to 12 hours to die," he said.

"We are very concerned about the welfare of whales that are wounded during whaling operations and then escape. Who knows how long these whales suffer."

Mr Carter said the resolution New Zealand would propose had the support of international conservation groups, and a great number of nations represented at the IWC. These included the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Austria, Mexico, South Africa, the Netherlands, Belgium, Brazil, Portugal, India, Spain, the United States, Sweden and Argentina.

"New Zealand is optimistic that the resolution will be adopted, although pro-whaling nations appear to be strongly opposed to any steps to identify more humane killing methods," Mr Carter said.

He said the resolution did not mark any change in New Zealand's total opposition to whaling, it was simply a recognition whaling was still taking place.
