The cost of processing permits for marine farms is set to be cut by around a third, Fisheries Minister David Benson-Pope has announced.

Mr Benson-Pope says the Fisheries Act requires the ministry to set an hourly fee that recovers the true cost of processing applications. Since October 2002 that fee was set at $202.62.

However, with the establishment of a National Allocations Team the ministry has created significant efficiencies allowing the hourly fee to be reduced.

The minister says he expects to shortly receive advice proposing the new fee would be around $134 per hour, a cut in the cost of permits of about one third.

"I am very pleased we are proposing to pass on lower costs to applicants," said Mr Benson-Pope. "Passing the costs on to the people who benefit from this service, permit applicants, is a fair system but clearly we should be striving to keep these costs as low as we can."

Mr Benson-Pope says the average cost of processing a small-medium marine farm application (2ha to 50ha) would be around $10,000. The actual cost however, will depend on the complexity of an application.

Applicants currently pay a $3039 deposit, which equates to the first 15 hours work. If an application takes less than 15 hours to process, money is refunded, or if additional hours are required then this additional cost is subsequently passed on to the applicant.

The minister says some applicants may be unhappy when the true costs are revealed and he was committed to finding a way to communicate hourly accruals and application charges so applicant's expectations would be realistic.
