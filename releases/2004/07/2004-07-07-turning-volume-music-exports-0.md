Moves to help New Zealand musicians achieve more export success, have been welcomed by Economic Development Minister, Jim Anderton and Associate Arts Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard today, speaking at the launch of the [Music Industry Export Development Group](http://www.nzte.govt.nz/section/13382.aspx)’s report Creating Heat - Tumata kia whita!

The report includes a proposed strategy for improving the export potential of our music industry across the board using opportunities from professional development to niche marketing and distribution.

"The music industry is extremely competitive, so we need to develop a concerted, strategic approach in order to increase the strike rate of our international successes and grow the music industry into a successful export earner for New Zealand. Our musicians will no longer have to rely on luck to gain profile overseas.

“The strength of the domestic industry combined with the heightened profile of New Zealand creative industries (especially film) means that there’s never been a better time to turn domestic success into employment and export success for New Zealand music.

“The Government believes the New Zealand music industry has real potential to support our economic growth. To capitalise on the healthy domestic growth of the past 10 years, we need to take our artists and our music, to the centre of the world stage and promote New Zealand to the world as a dynamic and innovative nation," Jim Anderton said.

“There is no better promotion for New Zealand's unique cultural expression, than our music. We already have New Zealand artists like The Datsuns, Hayley Westenra and Steriogram paving the way and reaching global audiences. We want more of them,” Judith Tizard said.

The Government-appointed Music Industry Export Development Group, established in September last year, authored the report. Its work has been facilitated by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise.

**Background Notes**

The Music Industry Export Development Group was formed in September 2003, following the Government’s identification of the Creative Industries (of which the music industry is part) as a key economic sector in helping New Zealand reach its economic growth targets. It is not a Growth and Innovation Framework taskforce.

Copies of the Creating Heat – Tumata kia whita! report, can be downloaded from [www.nzte.govt.nz/music](http://www.nzte.govt.nz/music). Submissions on the report are due by Friday 6 August.

The New Zealand music industry is a NZ$146 million industry (Dialogue Consultants report for NZ Music Commission, 2001).

Its exports in 2003/2004 exceeded NZ$5 million, including royalties.
