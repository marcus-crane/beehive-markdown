Labour Minister Paul Swain today said Don Brash wanted to drag New Zealand back to last century with his statements on labour market policies.

"Don Brash is just rehashing the failed old policies that were peddled in the 1990s. It's clear he's intent on dragging us all backwards. There is nothing new in what he has saying and it is all entirely predictable," Mr Swain said.

He was responding to Don Brash's speech last week, in which he said National would repeal the Employment Relations Law Reform Bill.

"The simple fact is our policies are working - we now have one of the highest rates of job growth and one of the lowest rates of unemployment in the OECD," Mr Swain said.

"In the last 4 years the number of people in work has risen – an extra 193,000 people are now in work and the unemployment rate is the lowest it has been for almost 20 years - 4.3%."

"He's also peddling the same old tired comments about the Employment Relations Law Reform Bill that we heard when the Employment Relations Act was passed in 2000. All National's predictions of doom and gloom never came to pass."

Mr Swain said the Government was committed to giving all New Zealanders fair and reasonable holidays but National has promised to scrap four weeks' leave for working people.

"The message to all New Zealanders is that Don Brash wants to take a holiday – yours.

"Its clear National is not committed to a fair go for everyone but then again that's not surprising," Mr Swain said.
