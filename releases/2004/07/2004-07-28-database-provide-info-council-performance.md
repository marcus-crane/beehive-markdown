A new database is to be developed by the government to help people assess the performance of their local councils, Local Government Minister Chris Carter announced today.

"The Local Government Information Database was funded in the budget and is to be made available to all members of the public through an easily accessible website. It will collect, analyse and disseminate a credible series of data on the performance of the local government sector," Mr Carter said.

"The database will not rank councils because it is almost impossible to do so fairly. Different communities have different values and thus different priorities. They want their council to do different things. Judgements about which community is right and which is wrong can't be sensibly made.

"However, I believe there is a strong case for providing a single database of information with which the public and councillors can assess the achievements of their own local councils in the context of what others are doing.

"I want a ratepayer or a councillor to be able to call up the database on the internet and find a local authority that has created efficiencies by sharing the provision of a service with its neighbour. I want people to be able to say: 'I wonder whether that will work in my area?'"

Mr Carter said the content of the database would build on requirements in the Local Government Act 2002 for councils to provide more, good quality information about their activities to their citizens.

"The precise details of what will be available on the website is still being worked through with the local government sector but I would expect it to eventually contain a host of indicators, including ones for rates and shared services.

"I hope that in time the database will help improve public participation in New Zealand's system of local government," Mr Carter said.

The database is expected to be online in 2005 although the information contained on it will be expanded over time.
