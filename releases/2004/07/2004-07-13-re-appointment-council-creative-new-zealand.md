Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Hon Judith Tizard, today announced the re-appointment of Peter Brunt as a member of the Council of Creative New Zealand.

Mr Brunt has been re-appointed to the Council for a further three-year term from 1 July this year to 30 June 2007.

As a Samoan New Zealander and a strong supporter of the Pacific art scene, Mr Brunt brings a valuable Pacific Island viewpoint to the Council. Mr Brunt is a lecturer in the Department of Art History at Victoria University of Wellington and has considerable academic experience as a lecturer at the Carrington Polytechnic and the Auckland Society of Arts. He worked as a professional actor in theatre, film and television in the USA and New Zealand, and has also exhibited as an artist.

Judith Tizard expressed her confidence in the re-appointed member. “I am delighted that Mr Brunt has agreed to continue to serve on the Creative New Zealand Council. He brings not only his academic arts experience but also his artistic and acting experience to the Council, I am confident that Creative New Zealand will continue to be well served by his re-appointment”.

The purpose of Creative New Zealand is to encourage, promote and supports the arts in New Zealand for the benefit of all New Zealanders. The Council is responsible for overall policy development and is the “public face” of the organization. It guides the development of Creative New Zealand’s three year Strategic Plan, and determines the division of funding between the two arts boards.
