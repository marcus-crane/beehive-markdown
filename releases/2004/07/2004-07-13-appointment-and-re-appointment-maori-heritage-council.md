Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Hon Judith Tizard, today announced two appointments to the Maori Heritage Council of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust.

Mr Tumu te Heuheu, paramount chief of Ngati Tuwharetoa and a member of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust Board since September 2003, has been appointed to the Maori Heritage Council for a term ending on 31 August 2006. Dr Monty Soutar, a history lecturer and writer, has been re-appointed to the Council for a second term ending on 30 June 2007.

Judith Tizard welcomed the appointments to the Council. “Both these appointments bring real value to the Council with their wide-ranging experience and networks in their Mâori communities and their impressive contributions to the heritage of their country. Through Mr te Heuheu’s knowledge of Maori and heritage issues and Dr Soutar’s work in Maori oral history and genealogy, the Council’s work will be greatly enriched.”

The Maori Heritage Council has responsibilities under the New Zealand Historic Places Act 1993 in relation to the protection of historic places and areas of Maori interest in New Zealand, and assisting the Trust to develop and reflect a bicultural view in the exercise of its powers and functions.
