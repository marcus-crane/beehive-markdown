Energy Minister, Pete Hodgson, responds to National Party Energy Spokesman, Roger Sowry's, assertions.

"Neither I nor any of my staff have contacted Transpower over its position on the Foreshore and Seabed Bill, says Pete Hodgson.

"Mr Sowry has done no more than interview himself. Not only has he claimed that contact was made but he seems to have insight into what a conversation that never took place was about. His accusation is 100 per cent pure fantasy and it is probably just as well for all of us that he has decided to leave politics."
