The government has committed to act quickly to repair roads in flood-ravaged Bay of Plenty.

" We are acting to re-connect local communities and getting the local economy back to normal as soon as possible," says Pete Hodgson. Re-opening and repairing roads is a matter of real urgency.

"Transfund, Transit, local government and contractors have made a start in dealing with the most immediate problems. And, by the end of this week, once floodwaters have receded, we will have a much clearer idea of the full scale of repairs and what they will cost.

"Money for emergency work such as this is ready and waiting. Transfund typically budgets $25 -$30 million per annum to deal with precisely the sort of problems we now have with state highways and local roads in the Bay of Plenty. Following spending from the emergency fund to deal with February's flooding of the lower central North Island, Transfund doubled this year's allocation to the emergency fund to $59 million.

"Transfund will prioritise spending and fast track projects where necessary in the Bay of Plenty in the same way it did in the lower central North Island."
