Investigations in to three housing cases reported by media this week have not substantiated the claims made.

The Northern Advocate reported earlier this week that three families had been sleeping in vehicles after being unable to get in to Housing New Zealand Corporation (HNZC) state houses.

Housing Minister Steve Maharey says the Corporation has checked out the three cases and has not been able to substantiate the claims.

“It’s important that media report these cases accurately.

“Dealing specifically with the three cases cited this week:  
·a woman living in a van with her two daughters for nearly four months – HNZC have been advised by the emergency housing provider that this family has not applied for a state house;  
·a woman and her two sons sleeping in a car for a week – HNZC cannot identify this case; and  
·a man in his 20s sleeping in a car with his 15-year-old brother for three days – HNZC records indicate that when this person applied for a state house one month ago he was living with his mother. He was given a list of emergency providers who could assist him. Yesterday this person approached HNZC again and advised that he and his brother were living with his mother at a new address and that he was currently sleeping in a car outside the property. The person declined HNZC’s offer of a referral to an emergency housing provider.

“Media wishing to verify cases before publication are invited to contact my office,” Steve Maharey said.
