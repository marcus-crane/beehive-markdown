Fisheries Minister David Benson-Pope promises to carefully consider a Ministry of Fisheries advice paper he received today about health and safety issues relating to frontline fisheries officers.

Mr Benson-Pope says this includes the need for further consideration of the possible future use of defensive equipment and a process to examine options to improve the working environment of fishery officers.

"These are important issues and I will be looking closely at the detail of the report before deciding what the appropriate course of action is," said Mr Benson-Pope.

Mr Benson-Pope says he wants people to be clear that the advice paper he had received represents a first step. He says there could be substantive policy issues involved, which may or may not require legislative change.

He says he will be consulting with his colleagues in Government about the content of today's advice paper before identifying the best way forward and the requirement for any future work programme.

Mr Benson-Pope said he would keep stakeholders and the public informed of progress.
