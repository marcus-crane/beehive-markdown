Associate Health Minister and Minister responsible for rural health, Damien O'Connor, will be in Northland next week.

Mr O'Connor's two-day trip will include visits to a range of local health providers, including PHOs in the Hokianga and Kaikohe, health trusts, and the Mobile Dental Clinic in Paihia.

He'll also meet with the two local Rural Nurse Scholarship recipients.
