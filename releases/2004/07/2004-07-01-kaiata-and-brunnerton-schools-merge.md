Education Minister Trevor Mallard today announced his decision to merge Kaiata School on the West Coast with Brunnerton School, following consultation and a request from Kaiata School.

"The Board of Trustees of Kaiata School wrote to me requesting that the school merge with Brunnerton School, with Brunnerton to be the continuing school. I have carefully considered the information that has been presented to me and have agreed to the merger," Trevor Mallard said.

"I had given the board of Kaiata School the option of either applying for closure of the school or preferably finding a partner school to merge with.

"I am confident that the inclusion of Kaiata School in the newly merged Brunnerton School will see a strengthening of the school community. I am in no doubt that the school will provide greater educational opportunities for local students although it is generally accepted that some of the students will choose to continue their education in Greymouth schools.

"Those involved in the development of the newly merged school have my best wishes," Trevor Mallard said.

The merger will be gazetted shortly to take effect on 28 January 2005.

A project manager will help schools with the implementation of the reorganisation. A resource for schools outlining the process and the next steps is available on the network review section of [www.minedu.govt.nz](http://www.minedu.govt.nz)
