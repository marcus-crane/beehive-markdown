The Kiwi Expat Association has been awarded $200,000 from the Ministry of Economic Development's Sector Initiatives Fund, to assist them in building up our global connections, Jim Anderton, Minister of Economic Development, announced today.

"The Kiwi Expat Association of successful expatriate New Zealanders across a wide range of businesses, in scientific and professional areas of achievement, is working with the government to build up our global connections across a range of industry sectors. These contacts enable us to develop networks, share knowledge and extend our international market opportunities.

"Successful expatriate New Zealanders are able, through this scheme, to pass their skills and knowledge back to New Zealand while publicising and promoting our country as a creative, talented and technologically advanced nation. This is exactly what we need to do in order to continue to strengthen our economic performance and raise the living standards of all New Zealanders.

"The international knowledge and expertise of these expat' New Zealanders will also contribute to our sector development programme. The biotech and creative sectors in particular, benefit from being in touch with international developments and world best practice.

"KEA has already been working effectively with government agencies such as NZTE and has been able to assist a number of New Zealand firms to enter global markets. Through programmes like this, New Zealanders all over the world can contribute to supporting economic development at home," Jim Anderton said.
