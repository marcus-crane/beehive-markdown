Children and young people are the big winners of an announcement today that a national phone counselling service for youth, has secured new sponsorship.

Child, Youth and Family Minister Ruth Dyson congratulated the What’s Up telephone service, run by the Kids Help Foundation Trust, for obtaining sponsorship to ensure its continued existence. The service was in danger of closing two months ago.

“Many children and young people have found this service to be invaluable because it is accessible, private and free.

“CYF was able to provide some funding towards a shortfall, giving the Trust time to search for new backing after two previous sponsors decided not to continue their support,” Ruth Dyson said.

“I’m delighted that in addition to continued support from long-term sponsors Griffins and Kelloggs, What’s Up, now has new operational support from Barnardos and financial backing from White Pages.”

Ruth Dyson attended the official announcement of the phone service’s new sponsorship at Randwick Park School in Auckland. Green MP Nandor Tanczos had previously visited the school after receiving a petition organised by a student.

“Today is a special occasion because we also acknowledge the efforts of a special young woman, 12-year-old Shonam Reddy, who was tenacious in collecting petition signatures to ensure What’s Up stayed online,” Ruth Dyson said.

“Her efforts, with the help of a few friends, ensured that politicians like myself, took notice of the concerns that young people had for the future of What’s Up. We did take notice, and so did the new sponsors. I’m sure Shonam has a promising career in politics should she choose it!” she said.
