Auckland’s first public service cadets in two decades will graduate today at Work and Income’s Mangere Service Centre.

Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment Taito Phillip Field said the graduation of the 39 cadets was a significant step for Work and Income.

“When the Ministry of Social Development introduced the cadetship programme in November last year, it reinstated a career path that was disestablished after the state sector reforms of the 1980s. It also reinforced the Government’s commitment to provide a strong public service and to help young people make a successful transition from school to work.

“Many others are now recognising the need to make the kind of investment in young people as Work and Income has. I see this in the youth transitions projects that have established in many places around the country including Manukau City and Papakura. I also see this in the increased numbers of young people taking part in the Modern Apprenticeships scheme.”

The Auckland cadets graduating today are part of group of 109 cadets taken on nationally in February 2004. Over the past five months the Auckland cadets have received training as case managers, alternating between classroom-based learning and gaining practical experience in service centres. Each has had an experienced case manager supporting them throughout their training.

“As new case managers, they will also study towards a National Certificate in Public Sector Services (Client Services), a nationally recognised tertiary qualification. This will allow them to pursue a career in the public sector with quality training linked to the Modern Apprenticeships scheme,” says Minister Field.
