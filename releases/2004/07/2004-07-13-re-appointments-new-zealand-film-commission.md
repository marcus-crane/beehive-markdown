The Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Hon Judith Tizard, today announced the re-appointment of the Chair and four members to the New Zealand Film Commission.

Current Chair Barrie Everard and members, Bill Birnie, Lisa Chatfield, Bob Harvey and James Wallace have been re-appointed to the Council, each for a further two-year term from 1 July this year until 30 June 2006.

Barrie Everard is the owner of an independent film distribution company in Auckland; Bill Birnie chairs the investment banking company FR Partners in Auckland; Lisa Chatfield is a self-employed film producer; Bob Harvey is Mayor of Waitakere City and an active promoter of the film industry; and James Wallace is Managing Director of Wallace Corporation Limited and James Wallace Charitable Arts Trust.

Judith Tizard expressed her confidence in the re-appointed members. “I am delighted that these people have all agreed to continue to serve on the Film Commission. They all bring an extensive range of skills and experience to the Commission and I am confident that the Commission will continue to be well served by these re-appointments”.

The New Zealand Film Commission is responsible for encouraging the making, promotion, distribution and exhibition of New Zealand films and the development of the New Zealand film industry. It is not a producer of films but supports New Zealand films through investment, marketing, industry support and other activities.
