Energy Minister and Convenor of the Ministerial Group on Climate Change, Pete Hodgson, today launched the Communities for Climate Protection (CCP) programme.

The Minister welcomed the first New Zealand councils to sign up to CCP: "I'm delighted to see so much interest in this Ministry for the Environment programme," says Mr Hodgson. "Councils are ideally placed to lead local action on climate change within the community and I hope more will join this initiative."

Waitakere City Council, Kapiti Coast District Council, Christchurch City Council and Masterton District Council are the first to sign up to this international programme to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Through the programme, participating councils take a multi step approach to reducing emissions:

·Developing emissions inventories  
·Setting targets for reductions  
·Developing action plans to achieving this, and  
·Ongoing monitoring against targets.

Action to reduce emissions can be taken by councils on a number of fronts including; waste management, sustainable transport, urban design, air quality, energy efficiency and sustainable land use and planning.

The international nature of the programme means New Zealand councils can tap into a broad range of best practice and experience in this field. The programme is complimentary to the Climate Change Office's provision of extensive guidance to Councils and the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority’s (EECA) EnergyWise Councils Partnership.

Councils interested in receiving further information on the CCP programme should contact the New Zealand Climate Change Office on info@climatechange.govt.nz or visit: www.climatechange.govt.nz
