New Zealand is increasing its commitment to the international aid response for Darfur in Western Sudan with a further $1 million, Aid Minister Hobbs announced today. This brings New Zealand’s humanitarian assistance to Sudan to $4 million.

Some 30,000 people are thought to have been killed and 2.2 million left in need of emergency food aid and medical assistance following the flare-up of fighting in the area 15 months ago.

"The extra funds will support humanitarian work by New Zealand NGOs working with their partners on the ground in Darfur and in neighbouring countries," Marian Hobbs said.

"NZAID, the government’s aid agency, will work with our NGO community to fast-track allocation of the extra funds so they can help meet the urgent and escalating needs of the Sudanese population."

Last month, the government contributed $2 million to the World Food Programme and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The New Zealand Red Cross and Médecins sans Frontierès (Doctors Without Borders) have each received $500,000 for their work in Sudan.
