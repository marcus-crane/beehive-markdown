The International Whaling Commission (IWC) has adopted New Zealand's resolution to explore the development of more humane methods of killing whales.

"This is a significant victory for New Zealand and other conservation-minded countries at the IWC," Conservation Minister Chris Carter said from the Commission meeting in Italy.

"It comes after an intensive effort by our delegation, which pushed the number of nations backing the resolution up to 29, well ahead of the 22 nations that voted against it.

"The resolution requires an IWC working group to improve the efficiency of whale killing methods and to seek ways to reduce the time its takes hunted whales to die," Mr Carter said.

"Although New Zealand is strongly opposed to whaling, we cannot ignore the reality that it is still going on. The killing methods used by whalers are very brutal, and can cause a great deal of suffering for whales. We believe these killing methods should at the very least be humane."

The IWC's working group will also examine methods for reducing the number of whales that are wounded during whaling operations and escape, as well as the welfare implications of methods used to kill whales caught in nets. Data collected on the killing of whales will also be improved, and better criteria developed for determining when a harpooned or shot whale is actually dead.

Mr Carter said the whale killing resolution was won shortly before another vote on the South Pacific Whale Sanctuary, jointly promoted by New Zealand and Australia.

"This proposal garnered 26 votes in favour, 21 against and four abstentions. However, unlike the humane killing resolution which required only a simple majority for the IWC to adopt it, the sanctuary proposal needed a 75 per cent majority. We didn't get that," Mr Carter said.

"While I am disappointed at this outcome, it was actually better than expected given the number of new pro-whaling nations in attendance at this year's IWC meeting.

"The South Pacific Whale Sanctuary has strong regional support – many Pacific states have already declared whale sanctuaries in their Exclusive Economic Zones, a vast area now covering almost 12 million km. Last year New Caledonia became the latest Pacific state to declare a sanctuary in its territory," Mr Carter said.

Two Pacific states voted against the proposal, Palau and Tuvalu.

"I am particularly disappointed that Tuvalu, which only joined the IWC a few weeks ago, voted against. In the past it has publicly stated its support for the sanctuary," Mr Carter said.
