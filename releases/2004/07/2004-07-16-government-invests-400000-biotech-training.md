A $400,000 pilot programme to develop industry training within the biotechnology sector is announced today by Research, Science and Technology Minister, Pete Hodgson.

"This is an excellent example of government, the tertiary education sector and industry working together to foster innovation and enterprise in a very important part of our economy," says Pete Hodgson. "Massey University’s team will work directly with industry to identify and provide specialist training with the specific objective of strengthening the capabilities of our biotechnology sector."

Through the Pilot, Massey University will raise the in-house capability of biotechnology firms by providing high-level, enterprise-specific, modular workshops. Content will be developed in consultation with industry and will be focused in four areas: biotechnology science, processing, regulatory compliance and business.

“We have already proven that New Zealanders are world beaters in biotechnology. This initiative will help consolidate and grow that position. This pilot also underlines the quality and value of our tertiary education providers, not only in biotechnology, but to the wider community and our economy."

The pilot is part of the government's Growth and Innovation Framework and has been developed in partnership with Massey University, Palmerston North. It is funded through the Tertiary Education Commission's contestable funding initiative that was announced last year.

The initiative shows how the Tertiary Education Commission is promoting the development of closer collaborations between tertiary education organisations and industry so that knowledge and expertise are shared and training best meets the needs of industry.
