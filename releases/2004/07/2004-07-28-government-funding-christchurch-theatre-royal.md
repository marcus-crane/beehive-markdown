Christchurch’s Theatre Royal is getting a $1.68 million funding boost from the government to help pay for redevelopment of the historic complex.

The funding announcement was made by Labour-Progressive MPs Jim Anderton, Tim Barnett, Clayton Cosgrove, Lianne Dalziel, Ruth Dyson and Mahara Okeroa.

Progressive leader Jim Anderton said Cabinet had agreed to the one-off funding from Vote: Arts, Culture and Heritage, to go towards the $6.1 million redevelopment costs.

“Sadly, parts of the theatre have suffered over the past 20 years, despite some restoration and upgrading work. This redevelopment is vital if the Theatre Royal is to remain a part of Canterbury’s arts scene,” he said.

Ruth Dyson said the government’s funding is a commitment to the future of the Theatre Royal alongside that already given by local government and the wider community.

Tim Barnett said with a seating capacity of 1300 seats, the Theatre Royal was the largest theatre in Christchurch.

“It’s our largest live theatre and it would have been a tragedy to see it close permanently if the funds for its urgent redevelopment could not be found,” Tim Barnett said.

The Theatre Royal underwent significant restoration to the front of the house in the 1980s with further work to meet earthquake and fire regulations in 2000.

The latest redevelopment is due to start in November and includes a total redesign of the stage, construction of a new fly tower, new dressing rooms and storage and set assembly areas.

“This work will ensure that theatre patrons will be able to enjoy a facility of excellent quality at the Theatre Royal,” Lianne Dalziel said.

“Christchurch is proud of its flag as the Garden City, but we are equally proud of our artistic talents. This work will help to cement our place in the arts community in New Zealand,” Lianne Dalziel said.

The 95-year-old building is officially recognised as a Category 1 Historic Place, by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. It is also listed in the Christchurch City Plan as Protected Heritage.

“It’s fantastic that this iconic feature of Christchurch has a much better chance of surviving for the next generation of theatre-going Cantabrians,” Clayton Cosgrove said. “This isn’t just great for Christchurch – it’s great for New Zealand.”

“The size of the venue will open the door to performances which will then go on to other parts of the South Island. Without the Theatre Royal, with its new capacity, the entire South Island misses out on these opportunities,” Ruth Dyson said.
