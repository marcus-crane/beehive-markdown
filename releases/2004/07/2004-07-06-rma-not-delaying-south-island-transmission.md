Associate Environment Minister David Benson-Pope says the Resource Management Act isn't delaying a power transmission project at the top of the South Island.

He says National's Nick Smith is mistaken when he blames the RMA.

Mr Benson-Pope says transmission companies have not yet approached landowners for easements to add lines and extra towers, but even when they do, this is a property right issue under the Electricity Act, not the RMA.

"This type of half-baked attack is typical of criticisms of the RMA being based on misunderstandings and erroneous assumptions," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"The Ministry for the Environment has been working for a considerable time to help Transpower with RMA issues. We have no reason to believe there will be any undue delays."

Mr Benson-Pope says a review of the RMA is progressing well. He says the ill-informed comments of Mr Smith highlight the need for better understanding and constructive contributions to the RMA review process."
