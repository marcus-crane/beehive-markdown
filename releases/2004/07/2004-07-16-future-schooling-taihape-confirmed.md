Education Minister Trevor Mallard today confirmed his decision to establish an area school in Taihape on the site of the present primary school.

Trevor Mallard was commenting following a meeting with a Taihape group who are dissatisfied with the decision to establish the new area school at the Taihape Primary site.

He told the group there had been thorough consultation about options for schooling in Taihape and it was now time to look forward.

"We need to focus on helping the establishment board set up a school that will meet the needs of today, and be ready for the challenges of the future," Trevor Mallard said.

Trevor Mallard said the decision to use the primary school site was based on what was best for children’s education.

"The real issues are about providing children in Taihape with sustainable and quality education now and into the future. Taihape children, their parents and the community will benefit from having a school in the community centre, rather than being some distance from it.

"It’s time to focus on the children’s needs and aspirations for the future. The way forward is through a community working together, united behind the new area school at the primary site. In that way we will see a school that will be the envy of many," Trevor Mallard said.
