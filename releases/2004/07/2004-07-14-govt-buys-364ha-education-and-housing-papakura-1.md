Education Minister Trevor Mallard and Acting Housing Minister Rick Barker today announced the purchase of 36.4 hectares of adjoining land in Papakura, Auckland for new schooling and housing.

The land was formerly owned by the Ministry of Defence and was declared surplus in 1993. The Ministry of Education have purchased 12 hectares, and Housing New Zealand Corporation (HNZC) 24.4 hectares. Both have been monitoring planned growth in Papakura and in particular, in the Takanini area. The purchase of this site will help cater for anticipated residential growth and schooling in the area.

Trevor Mallard said the development of the site, in consultation with the Papakura District Council, was a good example of central government agencies and local government all working together to meet the needs of a local community.

"Sufficient land had been purchased to allow for the development of a range of educational facilities, including an early childhood education centre on the Walters Road site, in accordance with this government's policy to make provision for early childhood education on all new school sites.

"The population in the Takanini area is expected to increase by approximately 10,000 people by 2020, and by the same amount again by 2050. The purchase of this site ensures that in the future we can provide additional school facilities to meet the needs of students in the area.

“No decisions have been made on the type of school of schools that may be provided on the site, but securing the site now affords the maximum time and scope to consider a range of options."

In addition, the ministry is looking for another two sites in the Takanini area to cater for further growth in the primary school-age population.

Rick Barker said about 20 hectares of land would be used for mixed housing to meet community needs.

"This translates to about 300 to 400 new homes in that area. It is expected that about 30 per cent of these could be used for social housing, with the balance available for middle-income home ownership.

“The Auckland region is experiencing high growth that is expected to continue, resulting in strong demand for housing. It’s great that HNZC have secured this land to ensure social housing features in the future development of the overall site.

“The government has already committed to 2,400 more state houses in Auckland over the next three years. Depending on timing, some of these could be included in the first stages of this development.”

The purchase of the site complements land also recently acquired by Papakura District Council. The three parties now control 48 hectares of adjoining land at the former military camp.

The Ministry of Education, the council and HNZC will be working together co-operatively to plan the best use of the entire site.

Papakura District Council Mayor David Buist said the council has had discussions with the Ministry and HNZC.

‘We are keen to work together towards the delivery of a good outcome for the overall site and the Papakura district,” he said.

Work is not expected to start on the site until 2005, and it is envisaged that it will be a six-year project.
