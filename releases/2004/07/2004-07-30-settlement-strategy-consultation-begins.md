The government today starts consultation on its [National Immigration Settlement Strategy](http://www.immigration.govt.nz/community/stream/support/nationalimmigrationsettlementstrategy/#top), which has been boosted by $62.5 million over four years.

The strategy, which was announced in May, will help migrants settle better by addressing issues many of them face. These include access to education, health, housing and employment.

It also focuses on cultural integration, discrimination and community involvement and aims to improve coordination among government agencies.

Immigration Minister Paul Swain said the Department of Labour's Immigration Service wants to hear from local government, ethnic communities and non-government organisations on where the money should go. The consultation begins today in Christchurch and is followed with sessions in Hamilton (2 August), Auckland (9 August) and Wellington (13 August).

"While we know most of the issues because of past consultations, we want to make sure the money is targeted where it's needed most. People need to prioritise."

The funding package has so far earmarked:

- $39m increase in ESOL (English Speakers of Other Languages) funding for adult education programmes and tertiary institutions
- $11.7m to establish a national network of migrant resource services $6m for the Refugee and Migrant Service
- $4.0m on career, labour market and workplace advice
- $.3m for NZQA to assess overseas qualifications for refugees
- $1m to support a national settlement secretariat to improve coordination between government agencies and other organisations.

Mr Swain said the results of the consultations would be collated to help decide the strategy’s long-term priorities.
