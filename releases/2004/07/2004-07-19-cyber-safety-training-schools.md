Five new training modules on cyber safety for schools were launched today by Education Minister Trevor Mallard.

"This project is a great example of how consultation with different groups can contribute to something very important – a world-class initiative enabling schools to create safer learning environments for their students," Trevor Mallard said.

The modules have been developed by the Internet Safety Group with funding from the Ministry of Education. They build on information in the [Netsafe Kit](http://www.netsafe.org.nz/kits/kits_default.asp) for [Schools](http://www.netsafe.org.nz/schools/schools_default.asp), also supported by the Ministry of Education and distributed to all schools. The [Internet Safety Group](http://www.netsafe.org.nz/home/home_default.asp) is the Ministry's designated agent for internet safety resources, advice and professional development.

The training programme is made up of a comprehensive set of teaching modules with workbooks. Targeted at the specific needs of key school personnel, they will be delivered by licensed providers in a series of workshops around the country.

"Our government is committed to raising student achievement and ensuring all our students can reach their full potential in education. For this to happen it's essential that we create and maintain technology-enriched learning environments that are both safe, enjoyable and productive," Trevor Mallard said.

In developing and trialling these modules, the Internet Safety Group involved a wide range of agencies and groups. These included: the [Police e-crime unit](http://www.police.govt.nz/service/ecrime/), the Department of [Internal Affairs](http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Services-Censorship-Compliance-Censorship-and-the-Internet?OpenDocument), Ministry of Education, private forensic experts, the New Zealand School Trustees Association, school insurers, lawyers, and [Multi Serve Education Trust](http://www.multiserve.co.nz/), along with teachers, board trustees, principals, advisers and information communications technology specialists working in schools.

"New Zealand teachers are leading the way in harnessing the potential of information and communication technologies for learning. We have much to be proud of in what has already been achieved, and in the work that is underway to further improve the benefits for our students and teachers," Trevor Mallard said.

"My thanks goes to Internet Safety Group for its dedication and hard work in this area, and in particular its school education manager Claire Balfour for managing the modules development process."

Attached is a summary of internet safety initiatives.

**Internet Safety Initiatives**  
The government through the Ministry of Education has been the prime funder of the work of Internet Safety Group since 2001. 2004 funding amounts to $550,000.  
This funding covers the sponsorship of the ISG's director's position, the Netsafety Kit, the training modules, the website, conference sponsorship, research and contributes to other cybersafety work which the ISG does in the community.

- **Netsafe website** provides information for parents and schools about internet safety on: [www.netsafe.org.nz](http://www.netsafe.org.nz)
- **Internet Safety Kit** - The Netsafety Kit (a world first) provides schools with practical and accurate information on how to establish and maintain a cybersafe school, and what to do if incidents occur. It was sent to all schools and libraries in mid-2003.
- **Training modules in cybersafety** build on information in the Netsafety Kit, targeting key personnel including principals, ICT managers, network administrators, boards of trustees and librarians. The modules will be delivered by licensed educational providers under the direction of the Internet Safety Group.
- **Presentations** are made to school staff and parents/board trustees and stress the need for appropriate policies, procedures and filtering and monitoring.
- **NetSafe resources** to schools, parents and community groups; this includes over 100,000 pamphlets distributed in the last year.
- The Ministry of Education’s ICT **Help Desk for Schools** works closely with the ISG and provides a first point of contact for all concerns and issues around internet safety issues. 0800 22 55 42

**Other Background Information:**

- New Zealand is regarded at the forefront of this work internationally, according to experts at international conferences attended by the ISG. Very few other countries have such an integrated national programme for internet safety supported by government.
- Under the Ministry of Education’s **National Administration Guideline 5**, schools are required to maintain a safe physical and emotional learning environment.
- In 2001 ERO reported that 82 per cent of schools were taking steps to address the inappropriate use of the internet. Since then anecdotal evidence and increased awareness suggests almost all schools have policies and practices related to internet safety.
- **The ISG works in a formal partnership with the Police Youth Education Service** so cybersafety education is included in Kia Kaha and Keeping Ourselves Safe programmes.
