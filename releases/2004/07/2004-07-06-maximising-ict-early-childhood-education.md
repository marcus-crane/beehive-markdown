Education Minister Trevor Mallard today announced the development of a new strategy around the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the early childhood education sector.

Trevor Mallard said the new strategy aims to encourage everyone involved in early childhood education to make the most of ICT, and is being developed by the government in collaboration with the early childhood education sector.

The Ministry of Education is in the early stages of developing the ICT strategy that will encourage the integrated and appropriate use of these technologies in early childhood education settings.

"I’m really excited about this project because the potential of ICT in teaching and learning in early childhood education is so great. We are focused on achieving the best possible learning outcomes for children," Trevor Mallard said to a teacher refresher course on developing ICT in early childhood education, in Auckland.

"This initiative supports [Pathways to the Future: Ngâ Huarahi Arataki](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/index.cfm?layout=document&documentid=7648&data=l) - A 10-year Strategic Plan for Early Childhood Education, which represents the shared vision of the early childhood education sector and the government.

"Information and communication technologies are not new to early childhood education. Video cameras, digital cameras, faxes, computers and the like are familiar to many and are often being used in innovative ways in early childhood education services.

"We have seen how the use of ICT in early childhood education can strengthen relationships between adults and children, and between children and children. Use of ICT can support the involvement of families and communities by valuing their experiences and contributions and by providing a means of making learning visible.

"Visual documentation of learning experiences also has the advantage of being equally accessible to people with English as an additional language.

"Over the past few months the Ministry has been collating information from the sector, talking to early childhood education organisations and visiting some centres that are using ICT.

"Consultation documents for everyone involved in the sector will be available in September and it is anticipated that a finalised strategy will be produced early next year."
