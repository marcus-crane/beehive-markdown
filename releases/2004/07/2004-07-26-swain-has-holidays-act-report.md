Labour Minister Paul Swain is considering a report from a working party set up to look at unintended consequences of the Holidays Act implementation.

Mr Swain formed the working party to look at unintended consequences of the Act, which became apparent after the Act came into force on April 1. These include payments for workers who are sick on public holidays.

The minister is now considering the report from the working party and he will be reporting back to Cabinet shortly.

Any legislation that may be needed to clarify the situation will need to be passed before Labour Weekend.
