Attorney-General Margaret Wilson today announced the appointment of Christopher John Allan as a Judge of the High Court.

Justice Allan graduated LLM (Hons) from Auckland University in 1966. He joined the Auckland firm Rudd Garland & Horrocks and became a partner in that firm in 1970, and continued as a partner in the merged firm Minter Ellison Rudd Watts most recently as senior litigation partner.

Justice Allan has practised extensively in civil, family and criminal litigation, since 1980 almost exclusively in civil and commercial cases.

He has been an active member of the Auckland District Law Society for a number of years and was convenor of the High Court committee.

Justice Allan will sit in Auckland.
