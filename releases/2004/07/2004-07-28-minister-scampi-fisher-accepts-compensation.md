One of the six aggrieved scampi fishers identified by a Parliamentary inquiry has accepted an offer of compensation, Fisheries Minister David Benson-Pope announced today.

Mr Benson-Pope says the fisher, whom he declines to name for privacy reasons, has agreed to an ex gratia payment of $400,000.

Negotiations with the other five fishers identified in a report by Parliament's Primary Production Committee, are continuing he says.

“Today's announcement of a negotiated settlement with this fisher is very pleasing,” Mr Benson-Pope said. "All along we felt that commenting on the negotiations as they progressed was inappropriate. This really left us unable to respond to some quite unfounded and cheap criticisms from certain quarters.

"This settlement I believe underscores the fact that we have set out to negotiate a solution in good faith that compensates the named fisher to their satisfaction, as government was asked by the select committee to do."

The select committee inquiry, completed in late 2003, was into the administration and management of the scampi fishery. The resulting report confirmed there was no corruption or impropriety by staff of either the former Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, or the current Ministry of Fisheries. However, it made a number of recommendations, including:  
\- ex gratia payments being negotiated with six named fishers identified as having a justified grievance  
\- introducing scampi to the Quota Management System from 1 October 2004, using catch history as the basis of quota allocation.

Mr Benson-Pope said the Fisheries Amendment Bill (No 4) would provide for scampi to be introduced into the Quota Management System from 1 October 2004.

"It has now been reported back from the Primary Production Committee and is awaiting consideration by Parliament," he said.
