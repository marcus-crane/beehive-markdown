A report highlighting the issues refugees face when settling in New Zealand was today launched by Immigration Minister Paul Swain.

*Refugee Voices: A Journey Towards Resettlement* was presented by the Minister to the National Refugee Settlement Forum held in Christchurch.

Nearly 400 refugees, asylum seekers and those brought here under family reunification schemes, were interviewed for the report. The research was conducted over five years by the Department of Labour’s Immigration Service.

“Settling into a new country is never easy. *Refugees Voices* will give everyone more understanding of the challenges refugees face and what more can be done to help. This report, together with the Immigration Resettlement Strategy, will make the transition easier”, Mr Swain said.

“We are doing many things right. Almost all the refugees interviewed found New Zealand to be a safe and friendly place to live. But there are always improvements to be made and this report will help us all identify them”, the Minister said.

The National Immigration Resettlement Strategy, announced in May, will address the issues raised in the report, such as access to education, health, housing and employment. It also focuses on cultural integration, discrimination and community involvement.

The government will initially invest an additional $62 million over the next four years to help migrants and refuges settle well in New Zealand.
