Older New Zealanders will be among the big winners of government plans to control electricity prices for some customers, Senior Citizens Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

Energy Minister Pete Hodgson yesterday announced a move to regulate some aspects of power pricing. He is introducing regulation which would obligate power companies to offer consumers a low fixed charge tariff, of not more than 30 cents a day excluding GST.

The tariff is aimed at delivering cheaper power prices for consumers who use less than the average 8000 kwh of power a year.

“This is great news for around half a million New Zealand homes, where consumers are fairly conservative with power use and would benefit from switching to a tariff,” Ruth Dyson said.

“For some time, consumer groups have been concerned about the impact of rising power prices particularly on older Kiwis. Many senior citizens have struggled to keep up with these power prices, despite being penny-wise with electricity use. Our government’s moves to address this issue should be welcomed by those older New Zealanders.

“The Energy Minister always promised intervention if power companies did not deliver a low fixed charge option for consumers who used less than the average amount of power. Pete Hodgson is now delivering on that promise and he has specifically acknowledged older New Zealanders as typical of those needing relief from increasing power prices most.

“This move will reward those who generally use less power. This is about making power more affordable for those who need it. I am sure that this latest move will go a long way to ensuring many older Kiwis get a fairer deal out of their power company,” Ruth Dyson said.
