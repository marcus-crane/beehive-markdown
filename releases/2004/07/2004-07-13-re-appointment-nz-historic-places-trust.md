Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Hon Judith Tizard, today announced the re-appointment of Dr Merata Kawharu to the Board of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust for a further three-year term.

Dr Kawharu is a Research Fellow at the James Henare Maori Research Centre in Auckland. Her research and publications on Maori socio-environmental and development studies and her work for various Maori bodies provides cultural awareness and community involvement to the Trust Board.

Judith Tizard welcomed Dr Kawharu’s re-appointment to the Trust Board and to the Mâori Heritage Council. “This re-appointment will ensure that Dr Kawharu’s considerable research knowledge and her community networks will continue to be available to both bodies and therefore to the heritage of her country.” Ms Tizard paid tribute to the commitment and effort already demonstrated by Dr Kawharu in her first term on the Historic Places Trust Board and the Council.

The purpose of the Historic Places Trust is to promote the identification, protection, preservation and conservation of the historical and cultural heritage of New Zealand. The Maori Heritage Council has responsibilities under the New Zealand Historic Places Act 1993 in relation to the protection of historic places and areas of Maori interest in New Zealand, and assisting the Trust to develop and reflect a bicultural view in the exercise of its powers and functions.
