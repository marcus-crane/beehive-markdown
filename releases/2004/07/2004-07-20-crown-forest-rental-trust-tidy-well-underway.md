Receiving the Report to Appointors from the Crown Forest Rental Trust today, the Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia commended the Trust for their hard toil over recent months.

"I'm delighted to see that the way the Trust is operating today demonstrates that aspects of the Maori Affairs Select Committee report and the Trusts own review of its operations have been taken seriously" Mr Horomia said.

I am convinced that the Crown Forestry Rental Trust is moving strongly into the future and is committed to the task for which they were established – assisting Maori in the preparation, presentation and negotiation of claims involving Crown forest lands".
