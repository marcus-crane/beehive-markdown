Senior Citizens Minister Ruth Dyson today congratulated Hamilton City Council and Environment Waikato for introducing cheaper fares for senior citizens, which came into effect today.

The discounted fares are available to everyone 60 years and over on all inner-city bus routes between 9am and 3pm on weekdays, and all day at weekends.

“Many older people rely on public transport to get out and about in their community. The cost of bus fares can be a limiting factor. These discounted fares will encourage older people to use buses to travel, without the hassle of driving their own car, or relying on someone else to take them,” Ruth Dyson said.

The initiative was a good example of the New Zealand Positive Ageing Strategy in action, she said.

“Affordable and accessible transport is one of the key goals of the government’s Positive Ageing Strategy. I commend Hamilton City Council and Environment Waikato for addressing the transport needs of the older people of Hamilton.”

Ruth Dyson said it was up to older people in the region to ensure the trial was a success.

“I encourage older Hamiltonians to get behind this offer. Make the most of the cheap bus fares, and get out and enjoy the region!”
