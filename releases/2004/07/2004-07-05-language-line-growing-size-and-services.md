Language Line, a telephone interpreting service funded by the government, is now open earlier and has added more agencies and languages to its menu, Minister for Ethnic Affairs Chris Carter announced today.

“I’m delighted to say that Language Line has almost doubled the number of agencies from which clients with little or no English-speaking ability can request advice and certain services in their own language.

“Language Line is also open an hour earlier and Japanese and Spanish have been added to the 35 languages already offered by the service."

Mr Carter launched Language Line as a 12-month pilot with six participating agencies in April 2003 and the government recently funded the service to the tune of $1.2m for the 2004-05 financial year.

From July 1 the participating agencies are: the Accident Compensation Corporation, Department of Internal Affairs, Housing New Zealand Corporation, New Zealand Immigration Service, New Zealand Police, National Poisons Centre, Tertiary Education Commission (English for Migrants), Commerce Commission, Ministry of Economic Development, and Ministry of Social Development.

Language Line operates from 9am to 6pm (Monday to Friday) and is managed by the Office of Ethnic Affairs. When a client phones a participating government agency he or she can request that their conversation with the agency is conducted through Language Line. Within minutes an interpreter who speaks the client's language is on the telephone, allowing the agency and client to communicate efficiently and confidentially.

Mr Carter said growing demand for Language Line had secured it as a permanent service and allowed it to expand. The service continues to be free to clients.

“To date, 12,500 telephone interpreting sessions have taken place and I expect to see that figure grow significantly with the new agencies on-board. Language Line reflects the growing ethnic diversity of New Zealand and I am sure that everyone who comes into contact with the service will continue to benefit greatly from it.”
