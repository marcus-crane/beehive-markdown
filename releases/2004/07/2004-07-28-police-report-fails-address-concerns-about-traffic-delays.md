A police report released today fails to answer Auckland residents' questions about what will be done to avoid delays following traffic crashes, says Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard.

"Many people in Auckland lost time and money as a result of a failure by police to adequately consider the impact road closures had on traffic flows following a serious crash in central Auckland a fortnight ago.

"The police have had significant new funding for highway patrols, traffic management, staff training and equipment over the last five years.

"It is not satisfactory that they held up Auckland because of a failure to maintain an overview of the impact of freezing both on and off ramps on Fanshawe Street and failed to consider all options in terms of clearing the scene."

Judith Tizard said recommendations in the report appeared to restate what she understood was already in place.

"I am meeting with the Auckland City Police District Commander on Friday to find out what went wrong and what police intend to do to stop this happening again.

"I will be urging police to work with local authorities and public transport and freight providers to make sure that unnecessary hold-ups don't happen in the future."
