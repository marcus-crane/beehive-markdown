Proposals are being considered to streamline Treaty of Waitangi historic settlements, Treaty Negotiations Minister Margaret Wilson says.

"Of course we are constantly reviewing the Treaty settlements process to make it more efficient. There's always ongoing work surrounding it.

"I've been very clear that ten to 15 years is a realistic target for settling the majority of historical claims in the settlement process.

"That's realistic given the current rate of progress. For example there were three deeds of settlement signed last year, and we've further resourced the process with another $1.25 million a year in the last Budget."

"We're also looking at a number of issues, including post-settlement governance entities, and streamlining legislation.

"The idea has been floated for a cutoff for lodging historical claims, but not contemporary ones.

"No decision has been made on any of these matters, and on-going work is being done."

"There's absolutely no change in the government's policy on large natural groupings being the Government's preferred method of negotiationg historical grievances.

"Of course, however, there are many examples where the Crown also engages in hapu or iwi settlements. Taranaki could have been done as one, it was done as eight. Muri Whenua could have been done as one, it is being done as five.
