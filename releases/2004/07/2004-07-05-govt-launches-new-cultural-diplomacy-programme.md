Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark today announced a $2.35 million per annum Cultural Diplomacy International Programme to promote New Zealand and New Zealand’s culture overseas.

Helen Clark said the programme’s aim is to contribute to a New Zealand cultural presence in key regions overseas, in order to promote economic, trade, tourism, diplomatic, and cultural interests.

“Cultural diplomacy is a powerful way for New Zealand to assert itself to the world as a unique and creative nation.

“We are a culturally diverse and contemporary nation, with a strong and unique cultural heritage. We will promote this more actively in the way we broaden and deepen New Zealand's ties with countries that are important to our own interests.

“We envisage the programme utilising organisations like, for example, the NZ Symphony Orchestra, the Royal NZ Ballet, or Black Grace, or individuals like Dame Malvina Major, in a way which promotes New Zealand’s cultural heritage while leveraging off their profile to enhance New Zealand trade and tourism.

“Economic and cultural successes are mutually important to New Zealand – and they can go hand in hand. The experiences of films such as Lord of the Rings and Whale Rider, have shown that cultural projects can have major spill-over benefits into the wider New Zealand economy.

“This Programme will support the growth of creative industries through overseas promotion and through long term country-to-country links, and will support and lift the profile of other trade initiatives offshore,” Helen Clark said.

The Ministry for Culture and Heritage is the lead agency for the programme, which was developed through the Grown and Innovation Framework. It is working closely with government agencies such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, New Zealand Trade & Enterprise and Tourism NZ, which have a major external focus. Cultural organisations and agencies will also be closely involved.
