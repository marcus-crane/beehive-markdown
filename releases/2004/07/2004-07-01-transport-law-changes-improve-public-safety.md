The Land Transport Amendment Bill, tabled in Parliament today, aims to improve safety and reduce the road toll through the amendment of existing legislation.

Proposals in the bill include action to:

·Stop those convicted of serious sexual or violence offences from holding P (passenger) licenses

·Effect tougher enforcement measures for repeat drink-drivers, repeat disqualified drivers and those that drive at excessive speed

·No change to existing speed or blood alcohol limits but a reduction in the amount over these at which roadside license disqualification is triggered

·Tighten up licensing laws around the operation of public service vehicles

“This government has listened to public and media concern and has acted. The Bill, as introduced, prohibits those with serious sexual and violence convictions for holding passenger licenses in the future, and toughens up on the worst drink drivers and speeders," said Minister of Transport, Pete Hodgson.

These, and other measures follow wide consultation with the commercial driving industry, Police, Department of Corrections, Justice, and the Land Transport Safety Authority. The aim of these changes is to make the roads and public transport safer for everyone and to lower the road toll.

The Bill has been developed in collaboration with the Green party, and its introduction also has the support of United Future and New Zealand First.

The Bill will result in changes to existing legislation including the Land Transport Act 1998, Transport Act 1962, Transport Services Licensing Act 1989 and subordinate legislation, and the Boilers, Lifts and Cranes Act 1950.

A copy of the Bill together with a document outlining expected questions and their answers is available online at www.transport.govt.nz.
