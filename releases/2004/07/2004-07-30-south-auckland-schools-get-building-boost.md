Eight schools in South Auckland are to receive a total of over $3m in funding to upgrade their school properties, Mangere MP Taito Phillip Field announced today.

The schools are the last in the Mangere, Manurewa, and Manukau East electorates to join a five-year programme that gives certainty to non-integrated state schools about how much they can spend on school buildings and grounds.

Taito Phillip Field says the Ministry of Education’s programme enables Koru, Mangere Bridge, Mangere East, Papatoetoe High, Papatoetoe Intermediate, Rowandale, and Wiri Central schools, plus Te Kura Kaupapa Maori O Mangere to upgrade existing property, with access to funding from July this year.

"The government’s commitment to high education standards means making sure there’s opportunity for all students to have modern, up-to-date and enjoyable places to learn.

“Schools in South Auckland are also a regular home for all manner of community groups who also deserve attractive and well-maintained premises," said Mr Field.

"This programme means schools are better able to plan their property needs over the long-term, rather than not knowing what urgent property need would arise from one year to the next.”

School property budgets take into account previous spending and the overall state of the property. Schools that haven’t received much funding in the past get more than schools that had previously received a lot. Schools can also get extra property funding for roll growth for extra classrooms and for bringing school property up and appropriate standard.

The schools in the Mangere, Manurewa, and Manukau East electorates now joining the five-year property programme, and the amount of funding they will receive are:  
Papatoetoe High School$1,033,174  
Papatoetoe Intermediate$591,634  
Mangere East School$318,259  
Koru School$294,236  
Rowandale School$240,418  
Mangere Bridge School$214,769  
Wiri Central School$177,440  
Te Kura Kaupapa Maori O Mangere$166,070
