The Department of Conservation has placed its kakapo recovery programme on an emergency footing after three of the last 86 kakapo have died from an infectious disease in the past three days.

"I'm very sad to have to announce that three young female kakapo have now been found dead on Te Kakahu (Chalky Island). Autopsies at Massey University in Palmerston North have confirmed a bacterial infection caused fatal blood poisoning in two of the birds, " Conservation Minister Chris Carter said.

"At this point, we can't confirm what has caused the third death, which was discovered on Te Kakahu this afternoon, but the bird appears to have died of the same disease.

"These deaths are the first caused by disease in decades of managing kakapo, one of our most precious and loveable bird species," Mr Carter said.

"Our concern is that the disease may pose a significant risk to all young kakapo, of which there are about 21 on Whenua Hou (Codfish Island), the kakapo stronghold, and Te Kakahu. We are determined to protect as many of these birds as possible and are pouring resources into the effort," he said.

A strategy is being developed which will see sick and at risk kakapo placed in hospital-style intensive care. Antibiotics, medical supplies and additional DOC staff have been flown in to Whenua Hou and Te Kakahu and daily health checks are being carried out on all remaining kakapo.

Mr Carter said at this stage DOC did not know what the disease was.

"We do know that it appears to have originated from Whenua Hou. About three months ago a young male was found sick with the same symptoms as those birds that have died recently. It responded to antibiotics well and has recovered.

"Over the last two weeks, DOC has been transferring 19 two-year-old kakapo off Whenua Hou to Te Kakahu. In the process of rounding up these birds, another young female on Whenua Hou was found to be sick. She is also responding to antibiotics, which is a good sign," Mr Carter said.

"The worrying factor about this disease is that prior to transferring the 19 young birds off Whenua Hou, DOC checked them for symptoms of disease, and took random blood tests. No illness was detected at that time. In fact one of the birds was checked last night and displayed no symptoms but died sometime this morning.

"The public can be assured that every thing that can be done is being done to save this critically endangered species," Mr Carter said.
