Labour Minister Paul Swain today completely rejected statements by the National Party that the Engineers, Printers and Manufacturing Union received $480,000 last year from the [Employment Relations Education Contestable Fund](http://www.ers.dol.govt.nz/ere/fund_applicant_guidelines.html).

"Roger Sowry is wrong - the single biggest allocation from the fund for the 2003/04 year was to [Business New Zealand](http://www.ers.dol.govt.nz/ere/approved_courses/biznz.html). They received $510,000. The EPMU actually received $6,648 for a joint project with the PSA and the PPTA", the Minister said.

"To suggest this fund has some kind of bias towards the unions is simply wrong and [the facts back this up](http://www.ers.dol.govt.nz/ere/fund_applicant_guidelines.html#whocanapply)", the Minister said. Allocations in 2003/04 were made to 31 different employer and union groups.

The Employment Relations Education Contestable Fund supports employment relations education under the [Employment Relations Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=129514443&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7B41BC4DFF%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC) and health and safety representative training under the [Health and Safety in Employment Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=129514443&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7BFDB814B7%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC). The contestable fund was established in 2000 and $2 million was available during the 2003/04 year.

"The Employment Relations Education Advisory Committee assesses applications against publicly available criteria and makes recommendations about the allocation of funding to me, as Minister of Labour. The Committee includes representatives from Business New Zealand and the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions and has an independent chairperson", Mr Swain said.

The fund is open to employers and employer organisations, unions and union organisations and any other provider recognised under the Education Act or by NZQA.

Examples of courses and projects that have been funded since 2000 include health and safety training targeting small businesses, silviculture workers, farm workers, residential construction workers and adventure tourism workers.

**Questions and Answers**

What is the Employment Relations Education Contestable Fund?

The Employment Relations Education (ERE) Contestable Fund supports employment relations education under the Employment Relations Act and the training of health and safety representatives under the Health and Safety in Employment Act.

In particular:

- the aim of employment relations education is to increase skills and knowledge of employment relations matters to enable employers, employees and unions to deal with each other in good faith and build productive relationships
- the aim of health and safety representative training is to promote co-operation among employers, employees and unions in health and safety management, especially by facilitating the constructive input of the persons doing the work.

**When was it established?**

The ERE Contestable Fund was established in October 2000 and has been operation for three and a half years.

**Who decides which organisations get funding?**

The Employment Relations Education Advisory Committee assesses applications against publicly available criteria and makes recommendations about the allocation of funding to the Minister of Labour.

The Committee comprises three representatives of Business New Zealand; three representatives from the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions; a representative from Victoria University; a representative from the Association of Polytechnics; a representative providing a Maori perspective; a representative providing a Pacific perspective and an independent chairperson.

**Who can apply to the fund?**

The fund is open to applicants who are a registered union; a union organisation; an employer; an employers' organisation; any other provider recognised under the Education Act or by NZQA.

**What kinds of projects receive funding?**

Most projects that receive funding are for the development and delivery of employment relations education courses for employers and/or employees.

**How is funding monitored?**

The Department of Labour's contracts with fund recipients contain staged payments and require recipients to regularly complete progress reports. On completion of funding contracts, organisations are required to report on the outcomes of ERE delivered.

**How is the ERE Contestable Fund evaluated?**

A comprehensive review of the delivery of ERE was undertaken in 2002. The review confirmed the general direction of fund and made recommendations which have been progressively implemented by the Department of Labour. Work on further developing evaluation of the overall educational outcomes of the programme is progressing.
