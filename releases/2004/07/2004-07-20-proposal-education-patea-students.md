Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today that he proposes to close Patea School and Patea High School from next year due to falling rolls which are seriously compromising the education that students are getting.

"Students are being prevented from accessing the same sort educational, cultural and recreational opportunities as students elsewhere in the country.

"Education provision in Patea has been subject to difficulty over an extended period of time, linked to sustained roll decline, school governance and management problems, and questions raised about the quality of teaching. There has been extra support given to the schools by the Ministry of Education and there have been statutory interventions aimed at ensuring better school governance.

"The population of Patea has been in steady decline, and so has the school age population. As a result, the rolls of Patea High School and Patea School have reached a point at which the delivery of the required range of curriculum by the high school is no longer achievable and the sustainability of the primary school is questionable. In addition, Patea School has had a series of adverse Education Review Office (ERO) reports critical of school governance and the quality of teaching.

“The roll of each of the two schools is now half what it was five years ago. Patea High School had 179 students in 1999 compared to 88 students now, while Patea School's roll has dropped from 91 to 40 students in the same period. Already some 100 Patea students are travelling outside Patea to attend other schools in the area.

"Decline of this magnitude, and at the current rate, means students can no longer access the range and depth of educational opportunity that they need. It is important that we look forward to a new future for education provision for all Patea students, so they can access the same sort of curriculum and subject choices as students elsewhere in the country,” Trevor Mallard said.

“I have considered a local proposal for a composite school in Patea which would see the primary and high schools combine. However, it's expected that the combined roll is likely to be less than 100 students next year. This is still not enough for us to be sure that students will receive an adequate education.

"I do recognise the efforts made and the improvements and successes achieved at both of the Patea schools. This is a hard call, but to ensure that Patea students are not disadvantaged and will have access to quality education into the future, I propose to:

- close Patea School and Patea High School at the end of the year;
- change Kakaramea, Whenuakura and Hurleyville school from Years 1 – 6 contributing school to Years 1 – 8 full primary schools;
- provide school transport assistance for eligible Years 1 to 8 Patea children to Kakaramea and Whenuakura schools or to Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Ngati Ruanui in Hawera; and
- provide school transport assistance to eligible Years 9 to 13 Patea students to Hawera High School, or to Waverley High School.

The schools now have 28 days to make submissions if they disagree with this proposal.
