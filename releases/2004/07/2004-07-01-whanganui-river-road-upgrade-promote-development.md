Minister for Regional Development, Jim Anderton, today welcomed Transfund's decision to place the long sought-after proposal to strengthen and seal the Whanganui River Road onto its road construction priority list.

"The decision is very positive news for everyone interested in promoting the further economic development of the Wanganui region, including the expansion of its unique tourism potential," Jim Anderton said.

"It is a victory for those at the coalface, the Wanganui and Ruapehu District Councils and local iwi and hapu, who had the foresight, time and patience to put together and then articulate a sound business case which has now secured the backing of the operationally-independent Transfund board," the Progressive leader said.

"Over the past few years I have encouraged, and been encouraged by, the vision and commitment to Wanganui's economic and social development shown by its local leaders. There is no doubt in my mind that this project is vital to underpinning the creation of new job opportunities for local people in their own region," Jim Anderton said.

"The Wanganui District Council and local iwi requested Transfund funding to upgrade the Whanganui River Road and Pipiriki Road because they knew that upgrading the roading system was essential to improve both the safety of the road as well as to unleash significant economic, social, cultural and environmental benefits the region has to offer," Jim Anderton said.
