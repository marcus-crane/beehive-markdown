Nelson MP Nick Smith must apologise to Parliament for dishonest statements made in the House yesterday, says Associate Environment Minister David Benson-Pope.

Mr Benson-Pope says it is another example of erratic behaviour by Dr Smith who has a track record of seeking publicity with stories that don't hold water.

Dr Smith's allegations in the House that Jim Anderton had been "rolled" in a "major fight" over the RMA at a Cabinet Committee, and further, that David Benson-Pope had stated this at a local government workshop earlier in the week, are both nonsense.

Mr Benson-Pope has today identified a number of respected members of Local Government New Zealand who were present at the workshop who all refute Dr Smith's claims. Mr Benson-Pope is passing the names of those audience members on to interested media, so they can independently confirm the statement was never made and is just fantasy.

"Dr Smith is telling porkies," said Mr Benson-Pope. "But then, what's new here. It is another sorry performance from the National frontbencher. It is clear that Dr Smith and the truth are strangers, and that he cannot be relied upon.

"Earlier this month Transpower, the company responsible for a top of the South Island transmission project, took the extraordinary step of issuing a news release to distance itself from the wild accusations of Dr Smith.

"Having been corrected by these experts several days before his party's national conference, you would have expected Dr Smith to stop repeating such ridiculous claims. No, Dr Smith's regrettable speech on the RMA carried the same untruths regardless.

"The litany of Smith myths has grown over the years. He has certainly been caught out by both the courts and the media making assertions that later proved to be inaccurate, and sadly, this latest situation has a remarkably similar feel to it.

"We recall his deplorable behaviour that led to the High Court finding Dr Smith in contempt earlier this year, fining him $5,000. Dr Smith had no credibility, the judges preferring the evidence of other witnesses instead.

"In 2003 Dr Smith claimed he had discovered NZ’s first apartheid pre-school in Christchurch, having conveniently forgotten the fence built between the childcare centre and köhanga was put in place while he was the Minister of Education, under regulations he made.

"In 2000 Dr Smith performed a citizen's arrest on three rugs in the corporate foyer of Meridian Energy's Wellington office, only later to discover he had been completely wrong in his allegation that one of the rugs had cost $60,000.

"Dr Smith's behaviour is erratic. His ability to so consistently make mistakes and his unfailing refusals to accept he is ever in error must make him an embarrassment to the National Party, where he serves on their front bench."
