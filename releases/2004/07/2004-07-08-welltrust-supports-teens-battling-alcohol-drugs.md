Associate Health Minister Jim Anderton said today that it is great news that WellTrust, the youth drug agency that provides support to teenagers and their families who are faced with alcohol and drug abuse problems in the Wellington region, has had its services recognized with new funding by the Ministry of Health.

"WellTrust has secured new funding after the ministry received a very positive evaluation of WellTrust services.

"WellTrust works closely with the Department of Courts, Child, Youth and Family, as well as schools in the Wellington region.

"I secured funding last year to enable WellTrust to continue its work while an evaluation process could be carried out to determine future government funding.

"The evaluation has concluded that WellTrust is indeed providing very necessary treatment services in Wellington for young adults who are having trouble with drugs and alcohol, and I am very pleased it will be able to continue to do so,” the Progressive leader said.
