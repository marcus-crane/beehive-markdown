Funding to develop engineering qualifications that foster entrepreneurial skills was announced today by Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Acting Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Margaret Wilson.

The Institute for Professional Engineers of New Zealand (IPENZ), major ICT enterprises, industry associations and tertiary education organisations – University of Auckland, Auckland University of Technology, University of Canterbury, Massey University, Manukau Institute of Technology, University of Waikato and UNITEC – have formed a consortium to establish postgraduate qualifications in entrepreneurial and advanced engineering technical skills.

The $135,000 project is one of the Growth and Innovation Pilots funded by the Tertiary Education Commission.

Speaking at the Institute of Professional Engineers (IPENZ) today, Michael Cullen said that the Growth and Innovation Pilots are a good example of the tertiary education reforms fostering collaboration, innovation and entrepreneurship in important areas of our economy.

“The initiative announced today will encourage professional engineers and engineering students to study for important new qualifications.

“The consortium will also identify skills gaps in engineering and look at whether qualifications being offered meet the needs of the engineering sector. It will then promote and market the new qualifications in the engineering sector.”

Acting Associate Minister Tertiary Education Margaret Wilson said the project is a practical demonstration of the type of change the government is seeking from the nation’s tertiary institutions.

“This project is highly relevant to the development of New Zealand’s knowledge economy. It encourages engineers to study and develop entrepreneurial skills – as well as fostering innovation and a creative approach to developing industry opportunities.

***Professional Engineers of the Future***  
This initiative involves a wide-ranging industry-led consortium including the Institute for Professional Engineers of NZ (IPENZ), industry associations, major ICT enterprises, and tertiary education organisations – University of Auckland, Auckland University of Technology, University of Canterbury, Massey University, Manukau Institute of Technology, University of Waikato and UNITEC). The consortium will establish formal postgraduate qualifications recognising entrepreneurial and advanced technical skills for the engineering sector. It will conduct research in the ICT sector to identify skill gaps in the occupational group of professional engineers and between the postgraduate qualifications and projects on offer for ICT industries; design the structure and content of the qualifications from the results of this research; present the qualifications to the Committee on University Academic Programmes (CUAP) for approval; trial selections from the content of the qualifications to IPENZ members and industries in the ICT sector; and market the qualifications to industries in the ICT sector, following CUAP approval.
