Acting Broadcasting Minister David Benson-Pope announced the appointment of chartered accountant Ken Williams to the National Pacific Radio Trust Board today.

The Board is responsible for running NiuFM, the nationwide Pacific radio network which began broadcasting in August 2002.

David Benson-Pope said Mr Williams’ financial and business management background would be very useful on the Trust Board.

“Ken Williams is a qualified chartered accountant who has run his own accountancy business in Auckland since 1981. Before that, he held senior positions in some large businesses, including NZI Trust and Fisher & Paykel Engineering Ltd.

“Ken is of Samoan descent and is well-respected in the Auckland Pacific community. He is an Honorary Fellow of the Unitec Institute of Technology and currently chairs the Advisory Board of the Accountancy Law and Finance School.”
