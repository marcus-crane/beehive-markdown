Education Minister Trevor Mallard today welcomed the arrival in the capital of Top Art, an exhibition of the best artwork from 2003 University Bursaries students.

Twenty-five of the top art folios in Design, Painting, Photography, Printmaking and Sculpture are on show at the Dowse Museum, Lower Hutt, until 3 August, when Top Art will continue its tour around the country.

"The Top Art exhibition is an example of the impressive artistic talent of young New Zealanders in secondary education today," Trevor Mallard said.

"These examples of excellence give a great deal back to the education system. They inspire excellence in others and are testament to the high quality of teaching on offer in our schools today.

"The arts have a vital place in education. An arts education is central to the development of innovative, creative, literate and critical-thinking New Zealanders."

Last year was the final year that students sat University Bursaries examinations. From 2004, students will be assessed against standards on the National Qualifications Framework and gain credits towards their NCEA qualifications. Some will also enter the New Zealand Scholarship qualification.

"The tradition of exhibiting this artwork will continue next year under the NCEA system. The work will be assessed in different ways against NCEA level 3 and New Zealand Scholarship standards, but I expect the level of excellence to remain as high as that we see today," Trevor Mallard said.
