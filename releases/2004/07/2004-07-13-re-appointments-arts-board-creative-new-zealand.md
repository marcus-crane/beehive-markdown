Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Hon Judith Tizard, today announced the appointment of Alastair Carruthers as Chair of the Arts Board of Creative New Zealand and the re-appointment of two other members, Judith Fyfe and Graeme Gorton.

All three have been re-appointed to the Board for further three-year terms from 1 July this year to 30 June 2007.

Alastair Carruthers is Chief Executive of Chapman Tripp, Judith Fyfe is a solicitor and past lecturer in oral history at Victoria University in Wellington, and Graeme Gorton recently retired as General Manager of the Theatre Royal, Christchurch.

Judith Tizard expressed her confidence in the re-appointed members. “I am delighted that Alastair Carruthers has agreed to chair the Arts Board and that Judith Fyfe and Graeme Gorton have agreed to continue to serve as members. They have brought an extremely impressive range of skills and experience to their positions and I am confident that Creative New Zealand will continue to be well served by these appointments”.

The Arts Board of Creative New Zealand promotes and supports the arts of all New Zealanders by developing art-form policy, allocating grants and carrying out initiatives that support the strategic direction set by the Arts Council.
