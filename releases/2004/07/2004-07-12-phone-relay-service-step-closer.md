A telecommunications service for Deaf and hearing impaired people is now on track for a November start after the government confirmed a supplier, ministers announced today.

An agreement has been negotiated with Sprint International New Zealand to supply a telecommunications service for Deaf, hearing impaired and speech impaired people, Disability Issues Minister Ruth Dyson and Associate Communications Minister David Cunliffe said.

“Ensuring that Deaf and hearing impaired New Zealanders can fully participate in society is a key focus of our government’s Disability Strategy,” Ruth Dyson said.

"This is a significant step towards achieving that. The Service will open up a world of communication which has not been accessible to many New Zealanders,” she said.

“Officials went through a rigorous process in selecting Sprint and we look forward to getting a world class Telecommunications Relay Service (TRS). Users will be able to apply for a textphone before the TRS is operational so that consumers can be ready to make calls,” said David Cunliffe.

The TRS works with an intermediary assistant who relays and clarifies phone calls between a hearing or speech impaired person and a hearing person. The assistant speaks words to a hearing person that are typed by a hearing impaired person on a textphone. The relay assistant also turns the hearing person’s response into type back to the hearing impaired person.

Information on how to apply for textphones will be provided to the Deaf Association, Hearing Association and other disability organisations soon.
