"National always talks tough but does nothing," Mr Swain said. "The law and order referendum in 1999 was a reflection of the fact that National talked tough on crime but did nothing for nine years in office.

"It took a Labour-led government to introduce longer sentences, tougher [bail](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=2471228491&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7B51113095%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC) and [parole](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=2471228491&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7BC7F512AE%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC) laws, [victims' rights legislation](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=2471228491&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7B8C1FC888%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC), record police numbers, record police budget, and tough new DNA laws. As a result, the prison population is rising and the crime rate is falling.

"Under the [parole](http://www.corrections.govt.nz/public/AboutUs/FactSheets/reducingreoffending/parole.html) laws introduced in 2002, [public safety](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=2471228491&hitsperheading=on&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&jump=a2002-010%2Fs.7&softpage=DOC#JUMPDEST_a2002-010/s.7) is the overriding factor, and offenders considered a risk must be denied parole. Judges can also set long [minimum non-parole periods](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=2471228491&hitsperheading=on&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&jump=a2002-010%2Fs.84&softpage=DOC#JUMPDEST_a2002-010/s.84) and inmates can be kept in prison until the very last day of their sentence if they pose a risk to public safety.

"Re-offending rates on parole are also much lower than re-offending rates of people who are just turned out on the streets when they complete their sentences.

"Existing laws are far better at protecting the public than National's old sentencing and parole laws. It's ironic that the offenders that Dr Brash highlighted in his speech today - William Bell and Taffy Hotene - re-offended after being released under National's inadequate laws.

"Under this government's legislation, Bell is now serving a minimum non-parole period of at least 30 years - the longest ever handed down in New Zealand.

"This government has delivered on its promises but you just can't trust National. 'Abolish parole' will probably turn out to be like 'abolish the surcharge' or 'abolish student fees'. It makes you wonder if their policy of abolishing parole will be gone by lunchtime, just like their nuclear policy."

Mr Swain said National was promising to spend billions of dollars building a whole lot of new prisons.

"National needs to front up and tell people where they plan to build them. Will they be built in Kaipara, North Shore, Bay of Plenty, Nelson, and Southland?  
"New Zealanders should also be worried that Dr Brash is now indicating that he will slash government social services to find the billions he will need to pay for, and run, all these prisons.

"National have also been banging on about police numbers, but when they had the opportunity to spell out their policy today, all we heard was a whole lot of weasel words and no commitment.

"In contrast, this Government has already added more than 450 police. We now have a record number of police and a record police Budget of $1.06 billion."

Mr Swain said that while the government had toughened up on sentencing, building new prisons was only part of the answer.

"We need to make sure that fewer people go to prison in the first place, through early intervention, and that fewer return after they are released, through better rehabilitation and reintegration. We think we have the approach about right.

"Rhetoric from National simply will not do," Mr Swain said.

**Law and Order – the Facts**

The following facts may be of interest to talkback radio hosts when discussing Dr Brash's law and order speech over the coming days:

The Department of Corrections' recidivism index shows that for prisoners released in the year ending 31 March 2001:

- in the 24 months from after release by the Parole Board, 15.6% of those released on discretionary parole (granted parole by the board) were reconvicted.
- Those released mandatorily (where the board had to release because they had reached their final release date) had a reconviction rate of 28.7% -- nearly twice as high.

Dr Brash highlighted the offending of released prisoners William **Bell**, Taffy **Hotene** and Alexander **Gray**:

- Bell and Hotene were both released under National's parole laws, which included automatic release for serious violent offenders at 2/3 of their sentence. That provision has been scrapped, and the current parole law says violent offenders posing a risk to the community should not be released.
- Bell is now serving 30 years non-parole, the toughest sentence ever handed down in New Zealand. Gray was released from jail because he had served the full length of his sentence. He was not on parole.

New Zealand does not have the highest crime rate in the Western world. The [Seventh United Nations survey on crime](http://www.unodc.org/unodc/crime_cicp_survey_seventh.html) (done in 2000), showed the following rates per 100,000 population:

Country Homicide Rape Robbery New Zealand 1.17 22.48 46.33 Australia 1.57 81.41 121.43 Canada 1.59 78.08 87.7 Eng&Wales 1.61 16.23 179.73 South Africa 51.39 123.85 460.37 USA (1999) 4.55 32.05 147.36

- New Zealand's crime rate is 13.8% lower now than it was at its peak in 1996.
- Since 1999 the crime rate has come down 3.4%.
- At the same time, crime resolution rates are over 43% -- the highest since 1987.
- The worst resolution rates were 29% in the early 1990s.

There are a record number of sworn police (around 7,450). There are at least 450 more police now than there were in 1999. The current [police budget](http://www.treasury.govt.nz/budget2004/estimates/est04police.pdf) is a record $1.06 billion. This is more than $200 million more per year than under National in 1999.

The new sentencing and parole laws mean much tougher sentences for the worst offenders, and dangerous criminals are serving more of their sentence behind bars. As a result, the predicted prison population (released in March) shows the number of prisoners will go up from 6100 now, to 7400 by 2010.

The Government is tackling the causes of crime through early intervention ([Project Early, Reducing Youth Offending](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F16713)), strengthening families, and economic policies which have delivered the [lowest unemployment rates](http://www.stats.govt.nz/domino/external/pasfull/pasfull.nsf/7cf46ae26dcb6800cc256a62000a2248/4c2567ef00247c6acc256e91000a0394?OpenDocument) (4.3%) since 1987.
