The National Party doesn't seem to be able to make up its mind over the Resource Management Act (RMA) says Associate Environment Minister David Benson-Pope.

Mr Benson-Pope said National showed over the weekend that it couldn't agree on what was wrong with the RMA or how they might fix it.

On Friday National's economics spokesperson John Key told the conference the Resource Management Act was "anti-infrastructure, anti-entrepreneurship, anti-growth and anti-progress".

However, in a conference session run by environment spokesman Nick Smith the very next day, he spoke of the need for reforms to an Act he described as having "some good features".

In between the two, party leader Don Brash told the media the RMA might need to be ditched completely.

Mr Benson-Pope says National does not seem to have any consensus and it's clear that while they have come up with a number of slogans they haven't been able to back them up with critical thinking.

"The National Party are well behind where we are at and are trying to play catch-up," said Mr Benson-Pope. "We have been working through a review of the Act that will see new legislation before Parliament by the end of this year.

"We are taking action to reduce delays, eliminate unnecessary costs and ensure full opportunities for participation by affected parties. We don't think the RMA is fatally flawed. The RMA is an important environmental safeguard. But we've got a number of timely, sensible and well thought out solutions to make it work better for all New Zealanders."

Mr Benson-Pope says an example of National's warped view of the Act could be seen in Nick Smith's claim that the RMA was "anti-development".

"The facts just don't back-up that kind of statement," said Mr Benson-Pope. "At least 20 new power generation plants have been consented under the RMA. The majority of our major power generation plants have also renewed consents in the last decade. Less than 1% of consent applications are declined each year. In 2003/04 less than 300 consents were declined out of 49,000."
