Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard says it is unacceptable that police took nearly four hours to re-open a key central Auckland road, following a pre-dawn car smash on Monday morning.

However, the Minister said she welcomed a statement from police today that they were committed to minimising future delays, and would encourage them to work closely with Transit to improve management of future traffic incidents.

"Aucklanders want a good road system that works in a predictable way. While we all accept that accidents happen, it is not acceptable when the response compounds the problems they cause.

"I look forward to reading the report from police, including their recommendations on ways to expedite crash scene investigations."

Judith Tizard said the government has put significant funding into traffic demand management to improve traffic flows and relieve congestion in Auckland. A recent example is a website, [www.trafficnz.info](http://www.trafficnz.info), which allows motorists to view traffic conditions on major Auckland routes in real time.
