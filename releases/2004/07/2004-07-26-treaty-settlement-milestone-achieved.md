The government and Moriori have taken a significant step towards settling their historical Treaty of Waitangi claims.

Treaty Negotiations Minister, Margaret Wilson, today signed terms of negotiation with the Hokotehi Moriori Trust to negotiate in good faith for the durable settlement of all Moriori's historical claims.

"Moriori developed a unique culture on the Chatham Islands, which has survived hard times and now enriches the country as a whole. They are neither extinct nor a myth, as many believe, and deserve the full protection of the Treaty of Waitangi," Margaret Wilson said. "I look forward to negotiating the settlement of their claims on this basis. "

The Waitangi Tribunal published its report Rekohu: A Report on Moriori and Ngati Mutunga Claims in the Chatham Islands in 2001. The Tribunal report found Moriori were entitled, as native people of New Zealand, to make claims under the Treaty.

Moriori are the third claimant group to sign terms with the government this year. Wellington claimants, Te Arawa, and Tüwharetoa are expected to follow suit shortly. More claimant groups than ever before have engaged with the Crown in order to negotiate Treaty settlements.

"Recent progress in Treaty settlements confirms my prediction that the vast majority of claims will be settled within ten to fifteen years. I look forward to progressing negotiations with each of these groups to this end."
