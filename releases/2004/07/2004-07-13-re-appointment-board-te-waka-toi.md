Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Hon Judith Tizard, today announced the re-appointment of Keri Kaa as a member of the Board of Te Waka Toi, one of two arts boards operating under the Arts Council of Creative New Zealand.

Keri Kaa has been re-appointed to the Board for a further two-year term from 1 July this year to 30 June 2006.

Keri Kaa’s strong cultural awareness has enriched her work as an arts and education consultant and previously a teacher and senior lecturer on performing arts and tikanga Maori.

Judith Tizard expressed her confidence in the re-appointment. “I am delighted that Keri Kaa has agreed to continue to serve on the Te Waka Toi Board. She brings not only her wide knowledge of arts communities to the Board but also a strong regional perspective and a practitioner’s voice. I am confident that Creative New Zealand will continue to be well served by her re-appointment”. She paid tribute to “the work and effort Keri has contributed to the Board and to New Zealand arts and culture as a whole. Her commitment is greatly appreciated,” she said.

Te Waka Toi is responsible for encouraging, promoting and supporting Maori arts in Aotearoa through the allocation of funding to artists, arts organizations, and arts projects.
