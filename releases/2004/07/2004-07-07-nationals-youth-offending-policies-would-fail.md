National’s policies for young offenders wouldn’t work, Child, Youth and Family Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

“Research shows that family group conferences are more effective than the court system in reducing re-offending by young people. It also tells us that lowering the age of prosecution will not reduce re-offending, but merely send more young people through the court system.

“The fact is that family group conferences are actually tougher for young offenders than going through the Youth Court. They have to face up to their victims in the presence of families and supporters. This is far more likely to make a young person think about the consequences of their actions.”

She said repeat offenders made up only a tiny proportion of young offenders that came to the attention of the Child, Youth and Family Service.

“The truth is that fewer than 1.3 per cent of the total youth population committed offences in the last year. Of these, more than 80 per cent attended only one or two family group conferences.”

Ruth Dyson said the government was taking a broad, responsible approach to the complex youth justice area.

“We have boosted residential services for young people, with more youth justice beds in Auckland and Christchurch. A new targeted bail programme will provide intensive community-based support for young people on remand, and we are providing better opportunities for families to support young offenders.

“We are also moving to strengthen existing youth justice provisions through amendments to the Children, Young Persons and Their Families Act, currently before Parliament. This includes lowering the age that a young person can be transferred to the district court from 15 to 14 years. The act already allows for children as young as 10 to be tried for murder and manslaughter.
