Tourism Minister Mark Burton will travel to Sydney tomorrow, to promote New Zealand at the 100% Pure New Zealand Showcase—an event that will showcase New Zealand to over 300 Australian business and political leaders, as well as key media representatives.

Prime Minister Helen Clark will also be attending.

Mark Burton says that it is important to further enhance New Zealand’s image as a vibrant, sophisticated destination in our biggest tourism market.

“New Zealand has a truly unique combination of cultures which fosters creativity and innovative thinking. New Zealanders are joining the world’s stage of creative excellence.

“The 100% Pure New Zealand Showcase Event will feature some of New Zealand’s best talent: garments from Suzie Moncrieff’s World of Wearable Art, composer [Gareth Farr, percussion group Strike](http://www.strike.co.nz/), dance company [Black Grace](http://www.blackgrace.co.nz/), and musicians [Hinewehi Mohi](http://www.tki.org.nz/r/farnet/rongonui/archive_hinewehi_m.php) and [Brooke Fraser](http://www.brookefraser.com/artists/brookefraser/featuredInfo/home.do).

“Our world-class food and wine will also be on show, with product tastings from the Northland/Auckland, Gisborne/Hawke’s Bay, Nelson/Marlborough, Canterbury, and Otago/Southland regions.

“Tourism is already an economic powerhouse and our number one export earner. The sector overall supports one in ten jobs and makes up 9.6% of GDP. International visitors spent $7.4 billion last year alone—$1 billion of which was spent by Australian travellers alone. They are without a doubt [our biggest market](http://www.tourisminfo.govt.nz/documents/Regional%20Rap%20Jun-Jul%2004.pdf), with over 770,000 visitors arriving over the past twelve months—up 18 per cent on last year.

“We are no ordinary long-haul destination. Today, New Zealand has a wide variety of experiences available. Food and wine, boutique luxury lodges, adventure tourism, wildlife, skiing, and unique cultural events are all waiting less than three hours from the eastern seaboard of Australia,” said Mark Burton.

“These events provide an ideal opportunity to let Australia know exactly how much we have on offer.”
