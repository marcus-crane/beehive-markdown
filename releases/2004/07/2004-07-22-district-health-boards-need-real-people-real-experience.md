Health Minister Annette King is looking for “real people with real experience” to stand in this year’s District Health Board elections.

Nominations open tomorrow (July 23) for October’s District Health Board (DHB) elections, which will use Single Transferable Voting (STV) for the first time.

Ms King says she would like to see the boards include people with a wider variety of backgrounds and skills to ensure a greater community voice in DHB decision making. “The public might ask ‘Who me?’ but we need real people with real experience so that boards truly reflect the communities they serve.”

The introduction of STV, where voters rank their desired candidates in order of preference, gives voters more choice and power to determine the total make-up of the boards, says Ms King.

“Voters are not restricted to just voting for a few candidates. They are able to rank as many or as few candidates as they wish under STV. STV and the ‘at-large’ structures allow boards to better reflect the regional nature of health service provision.”

Voters in this year’s DHB elections will have a say in the election of all seven elected board members using ‘at-large’ structures, instead of just voting for the candidates that were in their ward or constituency.

Ms King encourages people who want to make a difference to the health of their community to act now. “Nearly 150 elected positions are available nationally for people passionate about how health services are delivered in their region.”

For further information on standing as a candidate, call toll-free on 0508 9 10 2004, visit www.moh.govt.nz/dhbelections or contact your DHB.

Nominations for candidates close at midday on August 20.

Frequently Asked Questions

What is a District Health Board?  
District Health Boards (DHBs) are responsible for providing, or funding the provision of, health and disability services in their districts. There are 21 DHBs in New Zealand and each DHB is governed by a board.

What is the role of a DHB board?  
The board of a DHB has all powers necessary for the governance and management of the DHB. However, the board must delegate to the DHB’s Chief Executive the power to make decisions on management matters relating to the DHB. This delegation may be made on such terms and conditions as the board thinks fit.

How are boards made up?  
Each DHB board consists of seven elected members, and up to a further four members appointed by the Minister of Health. This structure allows for a range of perspectives, skills and knowledge on each DHB board.

The Minister of Health also appoints a chairperson and deputy chairperson for each board from among the board’s elected and appointed members.

Who can be a candidate at a DHB election?  
As a general rule, any person who is a New Zealand citizen and is a parliamentary elector can stand for election to a DHB board. However, there are several exceptions to this and these are set out in the New Zealand Public Heath and Disability Act 2000 (clause 17 of Schedule 2).

Are board members remunerated?  
Yes. The Minister of Health determines board members’ terms and conditions of office and levels of remuneration. Board members are paid an annual fee for their service on the board, and fee levels vary from DHB to DHB (depending on the size and assessed complexity of the DHB and the board’s workload). Fees currently range from $15,000 to $24,000 per annum. The board chairperson and deputy chairperson receive a higher fee.

Board members are paid an additional annual fee of up to $2500 for each statutory advisory committee they are a member of. Board members are also covered for reasonable expenses associated with board and statutory advisory committee business (such as travel costs), with the approval of the board chairperson.

Who are board members responsible to?  
While elected board members are elected by the public, all board members (both elected and appointed) are directly responsible and accountable to the Minister of Health. This is because DHBs are funded by the Government, using taxpayer dollars. The Minister is responsible for setting New Zealand’s health and disability strategies and ensuring that the tax dollar is spent in an appropriate way.

What voting system will be used at the 2004 DHB elections?  
From 2004 onwards, DHB elections will be conducted using the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system. This replaces the First-Past-the-Post system used in the first DHB elections in 2001.

Under STV, voters rank their desired candidates in order of preference. Candidates are elected when they reach a specific level of support from voters (known as the ‘STV quota’). To be elected to a DHB, candidates will need to get a little over 12.5 percent of the vote.

October’s DHB elections will also be held ‘at-large’. This means that all votes cast in a district will contribute to electing all seven elected board members. This is different to the 2001 elections, where voters could only vote for a limited number of candidates on a constituency basis.
