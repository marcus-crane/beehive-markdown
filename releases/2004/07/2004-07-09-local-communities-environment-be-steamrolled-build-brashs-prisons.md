National's promise to build 10 new prisons will come at a high price to the environment and local communities, warned Associate Environment Minister David Benson-Pope today.

Speaking at the Otago Resource Management Law Association, Mr Benson-Pope said National's aim to build prisons at break-neck speed could only be achieved by bulldozing through legislation that removes a community's ability to have a voice in the important decisions that affect it.

"National's prescription for the Resource Management Act (RMA) is to severely limit who can have a say," Mr Benson-Pope told the audience of resource management experts. "Local communities would be by-passed with little ability for local people to have a voice on the environmental problems and development proposals that affect them.

"This takes us back to the days of the National Development Act and the Clyde Dam legislation, where locals were shut out and projects half built, before discovering they were not economically or environmentally sound.

"Only this week Don Brash promised to bulldoze through a raft of unspecified changes to the RMA within three months of coming to office.

"He claims the changes will make possible the 10 new prisons he needs to house all those young criminals he wants sentenced to hard labour.

"Even if we could depend on National to deliver on its pie-in-the-sky promises, can you imagine the alarm in communities the length of this country waking up one morning to find prisons built in their backyard without a whisper of being asked if this was a suitable place to be housing criminals?

"If National are to have any credibility they must say where they would build their new prisons.

"National MPs have had a record of not supporting prison building in recent times. Paul Hutchison opposed Springhill. Phil Heatley railed against the Northland prison to save his seat. Bill English is not keen on the Milton site. And when there was a hint of a Bay of Plenty site, their law and order spokesman Tony Ryall went into overdrive."

Mr Benson-Pope told the audience the review he is leading into the RMA is progressing well, and new legislation would be in front of Parliament before the end of the year.

"We've had fantastic buy-in to the review process to date," he said. "The message we have received loud and clear from all stakeholders, has been that the RMA is an important environmental safeguard.  
"Everyone from business people to environmental groups have acknowledged New Zealand's environment is our greatest asset.  
"We've rejected the calls of a few extreme voices that want to see the Act ripped apart for the sake of unfettered development. Quite frankly, that's not sensible, it's not necessary, nor is it what business itself have asked us to do.  
"We are doing the work that is needed to reduce delays, eliminate unnecessary costs and ensure full opportunities for participation by affected parties.

"We have identified a series of issues and are coming up with timely, sensible and well thought out solutions.

"We're not pretending the RMA is perfect. But we will not be watering down the RMA's ability to protect the environment or sacrificing local decision-making and public participation."
