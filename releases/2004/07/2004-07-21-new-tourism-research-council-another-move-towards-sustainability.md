Quality research is key to building a truly sustainable tourism sector, and Tourism Minister Mark Burton says that the new membership of the [Tourism Research Council New Zealand](http://www.trcnz.govt.nz/) (TRCNZ) provides the right kind of leadership to generate it.

“Tourism in New Zealand is an international success story. After facing such worldwide industry challenges as SARS, global conflict, and terrorism, very few nations are seeing positive growth in either visitor numbers or expenditure. New Zealand is achieving both.

“But long-term sector sustainability means that we must balance the impacts of tourism on our unique environments with its potential economic benefits. To do that, we must be armed with quality research. Since I [established the TRCNZ](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F7485) in 2000, significant progress has been made.

“Sean Murray, previous Council chair, established a very solid foundation of data. Under his guidance, we have seen core tourism statistics enhanced and the launch of the “one-stop-shop” tourism research website, [www.trcnz.govt.nz](http:).

“Now, under the chair and guidance of Lex Henry, and supported by the Ministry of Tourism, the Council will increase the tourism research base.”

The Council membership is:  
**Lex Henry (Chair)** - Special Counsel, Minter Ellison Rudd Watts  
**Gordon Wilson** - Chair, Hotel Council New Zealand  
**Wally Stone** - Chair, Tourism New Zealand  
**Geoff Burns** - Chair, Tourism Industry Association New Zealand  
**Ralph Norris** - CE, Air New Zealand  
**Adrian Januszkiewicz** - CE, Shotover Jet  
**Ann Sherry** - CE, Westpac Bank  
**Ian Ewing** - Deputy Government Statistician, Statistics New Zealand  
**Paul Yeo** - Chair, Regional Tourism Organisations of New Zealand  
**Ray Salter** - General Manager, Ministry of Tourism

“TRCNZ’s new membership, made up of pre-eminent industry leaders, is a clear illustration of the strong government/sector partnerships we have built over the past four and a half years. Together, we will continue to identify and meet the challenges surrounding a truly sustainable tourism sector for New Zealand,” said Mark Burton.
