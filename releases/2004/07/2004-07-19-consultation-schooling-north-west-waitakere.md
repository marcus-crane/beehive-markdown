Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today the beginning of community consultation on future schooling options for students in the North West Waitakere area.

Trevor Mallard said extensive population growth is projected for the area, which includes Kumeu, Huapai and Waimauku and their surrounding areas as well as Hobsonville, West Harbour and Massey.

"There is a clear need for more secondary level provision soon, but its location, and what form it should take, are factors to be decided with input from existing schools and the local community," Trevor Mallard said.

"I have asked the Ministry of Education to put in place a consultation process which identifies the issues, and ensures that the ideas of all stakeholders are heard and taken into account."

A facilitator will lead the consultation process with school boards of trustees, other key interest groups and the public. The consultation is planned for August and September.

"I expect to receive a report on the outcomes of the consultation by the end of the year. This will allow decisions to be made and planning to begin in 2005 for the implementation of the chosen options."
