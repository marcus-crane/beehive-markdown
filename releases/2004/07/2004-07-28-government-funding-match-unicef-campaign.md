Prime Minister Helen Clark has announced funding of up to $600,000 over three years has been approved for UNICEF New Zealand's campaign "Strong Women for Strong Women."

Helen Clark made the announcement at the launch of the UNICEF campaign at Parliament this afternoon.

Other high profile New Zealand women including Dame Kate Harcourt and Bernice Mene attended the launch to lend their support to the UNICEF campaign.

"UNICEF approached the government for support and we have agreed to match its own fundraising campaign dollar for dollar," said Helen Clark.

"The UNICEF campaign is a very worthwhile cause, and its three priorities of child protection, gender parity in education, and HIV/AIDS are all about opportunity and safety.

"The contribution from government takes the potential fundraising target to $1.2 million, which will go a long way towards making a difference at the community level," said Helen Clark.

Aid Minister Marian Hobbs said the funding had been approved by NZAID, the government's official development assistance agency, for a maximum of $200,000 for each of the three years of the campaign.

"The $600,000 will be given largely to the UNICEF funds on education, HIV/AIDS and child protection. NZAID and UNICEF may also consider using a portion of the funds for targeted projects in countries where girls are particularly vulnerable," Marian Hobbs said.
