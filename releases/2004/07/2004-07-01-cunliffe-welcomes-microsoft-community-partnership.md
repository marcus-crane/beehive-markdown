David Cunliffe, Associate Information Technology Minister, today welcomed Microsoft's Unlimited Potential Initiative, which provides financial grants, software, and training material to non-profit organisations to improve computer literacy. South Dunedin’s Approach Adult Learning Centre, part of the Dunedin Methodist Mission, and Helensville’s Te Awaroa Youth Club are the inaugural New Zealand beneficiaries of the initiative.

"This initiative complements the visions set out in the Government's recently released draft digital strategy." said David Cunliffe.

"It is about empowering communities to ensure all New Zealanders gain digital skills and confidence. It also demonstrates the important role that industry can play closing the digital divide.

"The Government believes there is a real win-win for industry in helping get all New Zealanders on line and confident in the use of computers. It means good jobs and access to services in remote areas. It also means growing the market for the ICT industry over the longer term." said David Cunliffe.

"Congratulations to the Approach Adult Learning centre and the Te Awaroa Youth club and congratulations to Microsoft for its commitment to closing the digital divide."
