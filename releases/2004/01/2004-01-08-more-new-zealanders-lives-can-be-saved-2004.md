The lower [Christmas holiday road toll](http://www.ltsa.govt.nz/media/2004/040105.html) is a hopeful signal that more New Zealanders lives can be saved, says Transport Minister Paul Swain.

The 2003/04 holiday period saw 12 fatalities, the lowest since 1966/67.

Mr Swain said the figures may indicate that New Zealanders are beginning to recognise the value of sometimes controversial efforts to reduce the road toll.

“I know a lot of people aren’t always pleased by the extra use of speed cameras and the reintroduction of highway patrols. But the reality is that speed is a killer. It contributed to an estimated third of the 459 road fatalities last year.

“Even though this was the third lowest road toll over many years and the overall trend of fatalities is declining, there were 55 more deaths than 2002.

“Every death on the road is a tragedy and a loss that will be felt forever.

“This is the reason why the government is committed to its target of reducing road deaths to no more than 300 a year by 2010,” said Mr Swain.

“We need to reduce the road toll by 25 deaths a year – every year – if we are to reach our target.”

That is why the government in the latter part of last year launched its three-pronged road safety strategy, the 3 Es, to help meet the lower road toll target.

- **Engineering**. An extra $47m in funding over two years to tackle road safety black spots was unveiled in October. In December a $3b transport package over 10 years was released, which will include significant new funding for roading improvements
- **Education**. In November, the Up to Scratch programme to re-acquaint drivers with the road code was announced. Starting in March, it will include road code ‘scratchies’ in mail containing motor vehicle, driver licence and Warrant of Fitness information.
- **Enforcement**. Prior to Christmas, the government announced a 28-day suspension for drivers exceeding a speed limit by 40kph (previously 50kph), the Anywhere, Anytime location of speed cameras and tougher measures against repeat drink drivers.

Paul Swain said he acknowledges it can be annoying to get a speeding ticket but said these were part of a comprehensive strategy to lower the road toll, which New Zealanders now appeared to be acknowledging.

“My view is that people have really got the message – that even speeding modestly beyond the limit carries huge risks. A child hit at 60 kph has a 90 percent chance of dying; a child hit at 50kph has an even chance of surviving.”

His own driving experience over the summer break has encouraged him that the strategies to improve driving behaviour and reduce the road toll are taking effect.

“I drove from Wellington to Whitianga and back. In more than a thousand kilometres I only saw one example of walnut-brain driving – someone who overtook on a yellow line just 100m before a passing bay.

“That aside, I was hugely impressed with the driving of New Zealanders. Everyone was observing the speed limit, being patient and polite.”

Paul Swain said the one driving problem he encountered on his holiday travels were people who were driving too slowly on the open road.

“It is frustrating for motorists to be stuck in a snake of cars behind a slow vehicle. Slower drivers should be using the rear vision mirror and pulling over at safe places to let other vehicles pass.

“Slower drivers can cause motorists to speed to pass them. That can lead to accidents which might have been avoided if more courtesy was shown.”

Mr Swain plans to raise the issue with the LTSA and the police to see what can be done to encourage and educate slower motorists to drive with more regard for other people on the road.
