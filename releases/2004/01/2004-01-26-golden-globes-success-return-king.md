The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King has won the four awards it was nominated for at the Hollywood Foreign Press Association’s annual Golden Globes ceremony, including Best Motion Picture, Drama.

Peter Jackson won for Best Director, Howard Shore for Best Original Score, and Howard Shore, Fran Walsh and Annie Lennox for Best Original Song (“Into the West”).

“The worldwide success of the film trilogy is the mark of a visionary director. Peter’s imagination and dedication and the support of his incredible team have resulted in the largest film production in history,” said Judith Tizard.

“New Zealand film and filmmakers are firmly in the global spotlight at the moment with Whale Rider also deservedly receiving accolades."

Whale Rider recently won the Best Young Actress and Best Family Film awards at the American Broadcast Critics’ Association 2004 Critics’ Choice Awards. Keisha Castle-Hughes has also been nominated for the Screen Actors’ Guild Best Supporting Actress award.
