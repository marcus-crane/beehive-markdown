Minister of Tourism Mark Burton Associate Minister of Tourism Dover Samuels today announced appointments to the Board of the [Maori Arts and Crafts Institute](http://www.nzmaori.co.nz/) (MACI). Current members Robert Macfarlane (Chairman), Judith Stanway, David Thomas, and Ani Waaka have been reappointed for a period of three years. New appointments Erenora Puketapu-Hetet, Mike Simm, and David Tapsell will also serve for a three-year period.

Established in 1963, MACI’s role is to promote Maori arts and crafts, to train Maori in them, and to protect and develop the land at Whakarewarewa. MACI operates tours of the Whakarewarewa thermal valley, runs concerts and other performances, holds demonstrations of carving and weaving, and also retails arts and crafts on site.

Mark Burton said that the combination of new members and reappointments would bring a strong range of skills and cultural awareness to the Board.

Dover Samuels also commented on the strong range of skill sets in the new make up, noting that they will bring a balance to the board that will compliment the fiscal and strategic responsibilities the board has with tourism specific initiatives.

“Robert Macfarlane will continue in his role as Chairman, bringing senior level management experience from his role as former Managing Director and New Zealand Chairman of Cable Price. Judith Stanway’s strong accounting and financial experience, David Thomas’ business management skills, and Ani Waaka’s strategic planning expertise are all key to overseeing MACI’s continued success,” said Mark Burton.

“Our new members, too, bring a valuable mix of skills. Erenora Puketapu-Hetet, co-founder of the Maori Treasures arts and craft centre, has been weaving for 25 years, including 17 as a tutor and lecturer. Her work is held in very high regard, and has been exhibited internationally.

“Mike Simm currently holds directorships with Top Energy, Hansen Associates, and Jason’s Travel Media, as well as serving as Chair of Destination Northland and as a trustee on the Northland Regional Council Community Trust. Mr Simm also held the position of Executive Director of Fullers for 12 years, and served on the New Zealand Tourism Board and the Tourism Industry Association Executive.

“David Tapsell is a partner at Bell Gully, where he specialises in commercial and securities law and works extensively with Maori clients. His work includes Treaty and commercial issues, assisting in restructuring iwi and designing appropriate legal and commercial structures.

“All seven members have excellent skills, a deep cultural awareness, and are focused on quality outcomes for MACI. I am delighted at the high calibre of the Board, and know they will ensure good governance over the next three years.
