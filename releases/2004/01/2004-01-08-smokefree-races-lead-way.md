New Zealand's first smokefree races, the [Kumara races](http://www.racenz.co.nz/KumaraRC/) on the West Coast, are a brilliant example of a successful smokefree event, says Associate Minister of Health and Minister for Racing Damien O'Connor.

"The first smoke-free Kumara races were held last year and were a great success," he said. "The club has had really positive feedback. "

The iconic West Coast Gold Nuggets race meeting on January 10 attracts thousands of people each year, boosting Kumara's population from 500 to 15,000 on the day.

The Kumara Racing Club made history last year when it declared the event [smokefree]()."&gt;Smokefree Environments Amendment Act 2003.

Damien O'Connor said it was great to see groups like the Kumara Racing Club taking the initiative and going smokefree by choice, rather than because of the new legislation.

"The club obviously sees the benefits of a healthy, family-friendly, smokefree environment. I hope other clubs implement the policy with as much enthusiasm and success as Kumara."
