Prime Minister Helen Clark has designated the following individuals as terrorist entities pursuant to the provisions of the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002:

Mohamad Nasir ABAS  
Zulkifli ABDUL HIR  
Fathur Rohman AL-GHOZHI  
Agus DWIKARNA  
Huda bin Abdul HAQ  
Azahari HUSIN  
Salim Y Salamuddin JULKIPLI  
Abdul Manaf KASMURI  
Amran MANSOR  
Zulkifli MARZUKI  
Aris MUNANDAR  
Abdul Hakim MURAD  
Imam SAMUDRA  
Parlindungan SIREGAR  
Yazld SUFAAT  
Yassin SYWAL  
Nordin Mohd. TOP  
Wan Min WAN MAT  
Mukhlis YUNOS  
Zaini ZAKARIA

Prime Minister Clark said that the designations follow a decision by the United Nations Security Council to list these individuals as terrorist entities. The designations take effect immediately for a period of three years, unless extended.

The decision to proceed with these designations was taken in consultation with the Attorney General, pursuant to the Terrorism Suppression Act.

All of the individuals in question are members and associates of Jemaah Islamiyah (more commonly known by its acronym “JI”).

JI has well-established links to al-Qaeda based on a shared ideology and co-operation in relation to terrorist activities. It has cells operating in several countries in Southeast Asia. Its stated goal is “to create an Islamic state comprising Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and the southern Philippines”. JI is held responsible for the Bali Bombings in October 2002 that killed 202 people and the J.W. Marriott Hotel Bombing in Jakarta in August 2003 in which 12 people were killed.

Jemaah Islamiyah is currently designated within New Zealand as a terrorist entity.

A number of the designated individuals, SAMUDRA and HAQ in particular, are known to have been involved in the October 2002 Bali bombings in which three New Zealanders died, and many more received physical injuries, with a wider group sustaining various levels of psychological effects.

None of the designated individuals is known to have any current links to New Zealand.

“Nevertheless designating these entities as terrorists will serve to deter New Zealanders from becoming inadvertently involved in their activities. It obliges all UN member-countries to freeze bank deposits and other assets owned by them, and to deny them entry or transit visas. The financing of international terrorism is a matter of grave concern to the international community as a whole, and one that New Zealand recognises the need to effectively address. These designations assist in that process,” Helen Clark said.
