An interim solution has been found to the problem of paediatric care on the West Coast.

The West Coast District Health Board (WCDHB) has confirmed a locum will help provide necessary paediatric cover in Greymouth, while a permanent solution is worked on.

The confirmation follows an announcement yesterday by the DHB that children's care would have to be cut back on the Coast, after a physician at Grey Base Hospital chose to cease paediatric work.

The locum will mean three physicians will continue to provide a level of paediatric care in Greymouth.

West Coast-Tasman MP and Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor welcomed the announcement of a locum.

"The idea of there being inadequate paediatric care available on the Coast was of great concern to me, and to all West Coasters with children and I am pleased the board has moved so quickly to address the situation."

But he stressed this was only an interim solution and understood that it will be over to each physician as to the level of care that would be provided before a child might be referred to a tertiary level service for the best level of care for that patient.

"A long-term solution is being worked through following discussions between Ministry of Health Chief Medical Advisor Dr David Geddis, the WCDHB, local physicians and the Canterbury District Health Board. "

West Coast mayors and the West Coast District Council Chief Executive are to meet with the WCDHB on Monday to discuss paediatric services on the West Coast.

Mr O'Connor encouraged the meeting.

"Despite this issue being largely resolved for the time being, I think it's a great idea for mayors to discuss this and other health issues with the Health Board."
