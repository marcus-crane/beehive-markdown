A Government cadetship programme launched last year to attract future managers for Work and Income has generated overwhelming interest, Associate Social Development and Employment Minister Rick Barker said today.

Last November Mr Barker announced that the Ministry of Social Development would seek applications for 100 cadetships from young people throughout the country, allowing them to make a successful transition from school to a career.

The programme is linked to the Government’s already successful Modern Apprenticeship scheme and reinstates a career path disestablished after the state sector reforms of the 1980s.

Mr Barker said today that advertising for the cadetships had clearly hit the mark and due to the high calibre of applicants, it was decided to expand the original intake figure to 110.

“By the close-off date last month, over 2000 expressions of interest had been received from people wanting to know more about the programme.

“From that overwhelming number, Work and Income undertook a preliminary screening of 264 candidates who were asked to submit a written application.”

Of those who responded, the majority were invited to attend an interview earlier this month at Work and Income offices throughout the country.

The appointment of the successful 110 candidates will be confirmed soon and they will be asked to attend a four-week Work and Income induction programme.

Over 50 percent of the successful candidates were themselves previous Work and Income clients.

Mr Barker said the cadetship programme would help reinforce a strong public service, while providing opportunities for young people with good leadership potential.

“The cadets will be supported to obtain a National Certificate in Client Service (Public Sector), a nationally recognised tertiary qualification, and quality training linked to the Modern Apprenticeship scheme.

“Once upon a time, young people had a clear career path in the public sector. This Government recognises the importance of that career option and has done something about it.

“With an ageing population and workforce, it is crucial that we take steps now to invest in young people and help reduce the loss of skilled workers as baby boomers begin to retire.

“The up-side for young people is a buoyant New Zealand economy and an increasing demand for skills, which means the conditions are right for a younger generation to achieve excellent training and employment outcomes.”

Mr Barker said the Ministry of Social Development had a central role in helping young people into employment and would therefore take on a number of cadets each year.

“The challenge now is for other government agencies and local authorities to demonstrate their commitment to investing in the future of young people and do likewise.”
