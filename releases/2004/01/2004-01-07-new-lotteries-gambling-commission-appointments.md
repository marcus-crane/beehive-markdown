Internal Affairs Minister George Hawkins has announced new appointments to the Gambling Commission and the [New Zealand Lotteries Commission](http://www.nzlotteries.co.nz/).

The Gambling Commission is a new, independent statutory decision-making body established under the [Gambling Act 2003](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=573603094&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7B6C228059%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC).

The Commission will provide advice to the Minister, act as a licensing authority in relation to casinos, and be an appeal authority against a range of decisions relating to licensing and enforcement for non-casino gambling.

**Peter Wing Ho Chin** (Chief Gambling Commissioner) is a partner in the Dunedin law firm Webb Farry, and a longstanding Dunedin City Councilor.

**Mary Lythe** has a background in the health sector, and is a current member of the Casino Control Authority. Ms Lythe has held a number of government and voluntary sector board appointments.

**Kenneth (Mark) Ford** holds a number of directorships and is a current member of the Casino Control Authority.

**Paul Stanley** has a background in Maori Health issues and has held a number of voluntary and community sector committee positions.

All members have been appointed for a term of three years from 1 March 2004.
