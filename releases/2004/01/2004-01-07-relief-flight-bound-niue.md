An Air Force flight will depart for Niue as soon as possible with emergency relief supplies to help residents deal with extensive damage wrought by Cyclone Heta overnight.

At least one fatality and several injuries have been caused by the Cyclone, described by New Zealand’s High Commissioner on the island, Sandra Lee Vercoe, as the worst in living memory.

Duty Minister Paul Swain said the Niue Government had declared a national disaster. Sandra Lee Vercoe had reported that the main town, Alofi, had been “flattened.” She said there was “considerable devastation” to buildings, including houses, the hospital, a fuel dump, and the satellite dish used for telephone communication. Power and phone links were down, many roads were closed, and crops were badly damaged. The airport runway is operational.

All New Zealanders on the island are believed to be safe and well. Twelve New Zealand tourists stayed at the High Commissioner’s residence during the Cyclone, having moved from a resort on the coast. The High Commission office has been damaged.

Niue Police, New Zealand High Commission staff and others are currently out in teams assessing damage on the island so a full list of requirements can be prepared.

“The initial relief flight will depart as soon as it is loaded,” Mr Swain said. “It will carry tarpaulins, blankets, water and water purification equipment. Two assessors will also be on the flight, as will Niue’s Premier, Young Vivian. He has been in Auckland with his wife, who died this week.”
