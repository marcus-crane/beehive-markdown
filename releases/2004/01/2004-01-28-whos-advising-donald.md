New Zealand is a better place in 2004 than it was in 1999 according to Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia.

"Last nights speech by Dr Brash signals a backward thinking approach by the Opposition rather than the visionary based policies that the government has implemented over the past five years."

His remarks about the Treaty highlight the obvious need for an information programme to educate all New Zealanders about this country's history.

On the 5th of November last year, when asked his views on the Treaty, Brash replied, "I am not able to comment sensibly, this is new territory for me but to say I’m looking for Wayne Mapp and indeed Georgina."

"I suggest he finds Georgina Te Heu heu in a hurry because last nights speech shows how out of touch he is with mainstream New Zealand. Georgina Te Heu heu sat on the first Waitangi tribunal and I am sure she will be able to educate her leader on the treaty.

"I am glad that my mokopuna can sing the National anthem in both English and Maori because it demonstrates where the new generation of New Zealanders are emerging in their understanding of race relations in this country.

"I urge Dr Brash to start talking to ordinary New Zealanders about the real issues that affect them rather than embarking on this anti Maori campaign.
