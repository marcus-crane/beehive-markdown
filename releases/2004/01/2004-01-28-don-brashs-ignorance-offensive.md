Treaty negotiations Minister Margaret Wilson says Don Brash's claim that the settlement process has slowed is demonstrably incorrect - settlements are progressing at an unprecedented rate.

"It is not a trickle, it is a river."

"Settlements help to heal real grievances. They put cultural and financial investment into often poor, rural communities. This will not only strengthen tribes, but also their communities and New Zealand as a whole."

"The ignorance of Mr Brash's comments is offensive. Using racial divisiveness will never accelerate the settlement process. This takes good will, on all sides."

Over a decade, National negotiated three settlements - Ngai Tahu, Tainui and fisheries, as well as several very small and non-comprehensive settlements.

Since National lost power in 1999, comprehensive settlements have been reached with the following tribes:

Te Uri o Hau (North Kaipara)  
Ngati Ruanui (South Taranaki)  
Ngati Tama (North Taranaki)  
Ngati Awa (Bay of Plenty)  
Ngati Tuwharetoa ki Kawerau (Bay of Plenty)  
Ngaa Rauru (South Taranaki)

Other settlements are close:

A fourth Taranaki settlement, with Ngati Mutunga.

Te Arawa Maori Trust Board have accepted in principle an offer to settle claims over the Rotorua lakes.

Others are midst negotiations, including:  
Whanganui iwi (claims over the Whanganui River)  
Ngati Whatua o Orekei (Auckland)  
Te Rarawa (Far North)  
Ngati Kahu (Far North)

Others are preparing to enter negotiations:

Taranaki whanui ki te Whanganui-a-Tara (Wellington)  
Moriori (Chathams)  
Central North Island iwi, including the large iwi confederations of Ngati Tuwharetoa and Te Arawa, as well as Ngati Manawa and Ngati Whare.

Ngati Apa (Rangitikei)  
In total the Office of Treaty Settlements is now engaged with about 25 different groups, evidence of the desire by the Crown and by Maori to progress.
