Niue has informed New Zealand, as Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum, that it wishes to defer hosting this year’s Forum for at least a year, Foreign Minister Phil Goff said today.

“In light of the devastation caused to the island by Cyclone Heta, and the urgent task of reconstruction facing the Niuean government, it is an understandable decision and one that New Zealand thinks is appropriate,” Mr Goff said.

“As Chair, New Zealand will now talk to Forum partners and the Forum Secretariat about who might host this year’s meeting, scheduled for August.”
