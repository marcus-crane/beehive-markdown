Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia says Dr Don Brash should concentrate on developing a coherent Maori Affairs policy rather than ranting about the abolition of the Maori electorate seats.

"I am not surprised Dr Brash chose to tell the media rather than the thousands of Maori about the National Party's extreme right wing policy at Ratana Pa on Saturday.

I am disappointed that Dr Brash is embarking on a destructive path that seeks to drive a wedge between Maori and non-Maori".

There are more Maori in paid employment than at any time over the last 16 years. The average wage for Maori has also increased from 67 percent of the National average to 80.6 percent.

"There are over 800 young Maori taking part in modern apprenticeship programmes which is benefiting both students and employers. These young Maori will join the 5-thousand or so other trainees who under the National-Act coalition will have had little or no opportunity to join the workforce.

"There are more Maori attending university than ever before – indeed this government is providing the economic climate so that graduates qualify for good sustainable jobs.

"Maori achievement is accelerating under this government and I make absolutely no apologies to Dr Brash or his Act coalition partner for boosting Maori involvement in tertiary education and training opportunities.

"These are the types of policies that will serve New Zealand in the medium and long term, as opposed to having people line up outside of Post Offices to embark on daily chain gang ventures.
