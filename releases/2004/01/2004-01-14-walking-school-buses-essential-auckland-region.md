East Auckland primary schools concerned that walking school buses may not continue when Infrastructure Auckland is disestablished need not worry, says Auckland Issues and Associate Transport Minister Judith Tizard.

The Minister was responding to a newspaper report that primary schools in Auckland’s eastern suburbs feared the scheme could ‘grind to a halt’ in the changeover from Infrastructure Auckland to the proposed new Auckland Regional Transport Authority.

“Infrastructure Auckland has provided funding for the walking school buses, but it does not administer the scheme. The Auckland Regional Council applied for and administers the Infrastructure Auckland grant, and provides ongoing support for the programme.

“There is no reason to believe that a new regional transport body working towards the same objectives would make any different decision. I have been in contact with the ARC and they have assured me that walking school buses remain an important and longstanding commitment for them.

“The walking school bus scheme plays an essential role in managing Auckland’s transport congestion, and fits in well with the government’s walking and cycling objectives in the New Zealand Transport Strategy,” Judith Tizard said.

Education traffic makes up 40 per cent of peak-hour morning traffic. Recent research by the ARC and Infrastructure Auckland showed more than half of the families involved in education travel are willing to change the way they travel.

“Walking school buses currently operating throughout the Auckland region are reducing the number of car trips by a thousand per day.

“As well as helping to reduce congestion and chaos at the school gate, walking school buses are a great way for kids and parents to exercise and get to know their neighbourhoods, which makes for safer and closer communities.”
