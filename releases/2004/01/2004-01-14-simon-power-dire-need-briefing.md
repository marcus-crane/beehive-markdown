Minister of Defence Mark Burton is today offering National’s Defence Spokesman, Simon Power, a much-needed briefing on the history and purpose of the New Zealand Army badge.

“Mr Power suggests that our Army’s badge has a reverent, unchanged tradition of nearly a century. In fact, it has been redesigned four times between its adoption in 1949 and 1999, to reflect changing attitudes and environments. The Taiaha wasn’t even added until 1995.

“The Army made the decision to develop this new logo—and a logo is exactly what we are talking about—as part of recruiting and retaining quality personnel. I would think Mr Power would know that a strong, contemporary brand is an essential part of recruitment and retention for any organisation.

“Of course, gauging from the outdated, Vietnam era equipment Mr Power’s party left our forces with, I suppose he feels the logo should still be in the 1960’s as well.

“The Army have tested our a range of designs with ordinary New Zealanders. Their reaction has identified this logo as simple, strong, and reflective of Kiwi ownership. The inclusion of Ngati Tumatauenga reflects the ongoing close connection our Army has with Maori, and gives the Army a uniquely New Zealand identity.

“This is yet another example of Mr Power’s complete lack of understanding of real New Zealand Defence Force issues. Once again, he is meddling where he doesn’t belong—in the details of daily operational decision-making.”
