Urgently-needed skills and supplies will be included in the third RNZAF C-130 relief flight bound for Niue tomorrow, Foreign Minister Phil Goff said today.

Mr Goff, Niue Premier Young Vivian and Australian High Commissioner to New Zealand Dr Alan Hawke will travel on the flight, which leaves from Whenuapai airbase early tomorrow. It will carry asbestos-handling equipment, chainsaws, water supply equipment, and food.

“The passenger list includes several tradespersons with skills needed to help with the clean-up and restoration of essential services, including telecommunications experts, builders, plumbers, electricians and a doctor,” Mr Goff said.

“As well as getting a direct overview of the damage done and what is required in the reconstruction process, I will be meeting with Niue Cabinet Ministers, private sector representatives, our High Commissioner, Sandra Lee Vercoe, and her staff,” Mr Goff said.

Mr Goff will spend around six hours on Niue before the aircraft returns around midnight.
