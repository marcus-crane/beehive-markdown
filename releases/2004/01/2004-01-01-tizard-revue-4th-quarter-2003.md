- [Funding Sources for New Zealand Artists](#13)

* * *

**Welcome to the Tizard Revue**  
2003 contained many impressive achievements for New Zealand’s creative sector.  
In music, new New Zealand albums sat prominently in the pre-Christmas sales charts at a time usually dominated by “best-ofs”, live albums and re-releases; more New Zealand music than ever was heard on our commercial radio stations. In theatre, the “Year of the New Zealand Play” and Playmarket’s 30th anniversary came to a close with many new New Zealand plays among the theatrical highlights of the year.  
Other achievements included many of our major arts organisations reaching more New Zealanders around the country. The Royal New Zealand Ballet set out to achieve 70% of performances outside of its Wellington base, and in fact performed 80% of its shows outside Wellington. The NZ Symphony Orchestra continued its successful tours of the country, performing sell-out concerts in parts of New Zealand it hadn’t previously reached, such as Gore during its Tour of Southland.  
It’s great to see that the Cultural Recovery Package of May 2000 and further funding boosts since are enabling our artists and arts organisations to reach more New Zealanders.  
We’re reaching further afield, too. 2003 was a significant year for many New Zealanders showcasing their work overseas. In film, the first New Zealand movie to receive NZ Film Production Fund finance – Whale Rider – has achieved huge box office and critical success as well as winning noteworthy “people’s choice” awards at festivals around the world and an Oscar nomination for Keisha Castle-Hughes. And of course we all know how well the final instalment of Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings has done in the month since it was released.  
New Zealand music across the board went well overseas last year. March 2003 saw the largest line-up of New Zealand acts yet attend the major South by Southwest music showcase in Austin, Texas. Cloudboy performed a series of shows across Europe incorporating NZ Film Archive material. NZ composer Christopher Marshall had a spectacular world premiere of his piece “Tihei Mauri Ora!” in Washington in May with an excellent review in the Washington Post, and his works continue to premiere around the world. A special New Zealand showcase was held during Central Park’s “Summerstage” festival in New York City.  
These are just a very few examples of how all over New Zealand, and the world, our creative people are making great achievements.  
2004 promises more of the same. Here are just two examples: the Royal NZ Ballet undertakes a UK tour in March and April, including a performance at Sadler’s Wells; and the Asia Society in New York hosts a major exhibition of NZ and Pacific art entitled Paradise Now? Contemporary Art from the Pacific from February to May this year.

As always, I welcome your news, ideas and feedback on how our vibrant creative sector can and will continue to grow. The next Tizard Revue will be out in April 2004.

**PERFECT STRANGERS OPENS TO NZ PUBLIC ON FEBRUARY 5th**

The second feature film to be made with funding from the NZ Film Production Fund opens to the New Zealand public on Thursday 5th February.

Perfect Strangers, written and directed by Gaylene Preston, is released nationally by Twentieth Century Fox. It had its world premiere at the Melbourne Film Festival and has also premiered at the Montreal World Film Festival and London Film Festival.

The film, featuring Sam Neill and Rachel Blake, is a chilling romance about Melanie, a woman who finds herself the subject of a man’s romantic obsession. At first she’s captivated by his charm and attentiveness. But when he sails her away to his shack on a deserted island, she realizes that she has been kidnapped.

Exploring the fine line between love and pursuit, romance and danger, fear and obsession, Perfect Strangers was written and directed by Gaylene Preston and produced by Robin Laing, Gaylene Preston Productions and Huntaway Productions, in association with the New Zealand Film Commission, the New Zealand Film Production Fund, New Zealand on Air and Television New Zealand.

Perfect Strangers also features cinematography from Alun Bollinger (The Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings) and a soundtrack with new music by Neil Finn

Comments from reviews include: \*\*\*\** 5 stars (ABC Radio); “Don’t miss it… one of the most intriguing films to appear in a long time” (Peter Thompson, Sunday Show); “One of the best films of the year” (Evan Williams, The Australian); “Preston’s best work in film to date” (David Stratton, Variety); “… a dazzling collaboration” – Ruth Hessey, IF Magazine.

**NZ MUSIC LABELS TO MIDEM; OVERSEAS MUSIC EXPERTS TO NZ**

The NZ Music Industry Commission is supporting a New Zealand presence at a major overseas trade show, and helping to bring overseas music experts to New Zealand, in the early part of 2004.

**MIDEM 2004** – Midem is five days of music networking at its best and for the third year running a broad mix of New Zealand music, from contemporary to classical, as well as local record companies and distributors will be represented in Cannes, 25 – 29 January.

Guests will include Beggars Group chairman Martin Mills, top entertainment lawyer Sarah Waddington, respected writer and producer Colin Emmanuel, and return visits by music video producer Pete Chambers and video commissioner Liz Kessler.

In the weeks before Resonate 2004, Colin Emmanuel will work in the studio with two local bands while Pete Chambers and Liz Kessler will work on a music video with another local band.

“It’s fantastic to see such an impressive line up of talent secured for this year’s Resonate,” says Cath Andersen, NZMIC Executive Director.

“It was an amazing event to be involved with last year, and this year is going to be even better.”

More information about Resonate is on the [Resonate website](http://www.resonate.org.nz).

[New Zealand Film Commission](http://www.nzfilm.co.nz) is to receive a $10 million (incl GST) baseline funding increase in the 2004 Budget.

The increase comes close to doubling the commission’s existing baseline funding and is a significant increase in support for the local industry.

**SPOTLIGHT ON NEW ZEALAND AT PERFORMING ARTS MARKET**

Three performing arts companies - the Naked Samoans, Strike and Raewyn Hill's Soap Box Productions - will feature New Zealand work at the 6th Australian Performing Arts Market, the largest performing arts market in the  
southern hemisphere, with Creative New Zealand support.

To be held in Adelaide from 23 - 27 February 2004, the biennial market is a vital platform for New Zealand performing artists wanting to make their mark on the international stage.

More than 350 producers, festival directors and venue managers from Australia, New Zealand, Britain, Europe, North America, South America and Asia are expected to attend the five-day event. They'll be at the Arts Market to buy shows that catch their attention while performing arts companies from Australia, New Zealand and Singapore will be there to sell their shows through the spotlight performances and networking opportunities.

**AMENDMENT IN PERFORMERS’ RIGHTS PROPOSED FOR COPYRIGHT ACT**  
Existing performers’ rights will be technology-neutral, so that performers’ works will be protected irrespective of the various communications technologies, says Associate Commerce Minister Judith Tizard.

The announcement is the outcome of a review of how digital technology impacts on the rights of performers provided under the Copyright Act 1994 (“the Act”).

"I propose to amend the Act to ensure that the existing rights of performers are technology-neutral. It is important for performers to be able to use the protection currently available in the Act irrespective of the various communications technologies used,” said Judith Tizard.

**CALL FOR WWII VETERANS AS HISTORY PROJECTS CONTINUE**

World War Two veterans who served in the Pacific or were in uniform on the Home Front are invited to take part in two new oral history projects.

Prime Minister and Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Helen Clark said that the stories of these veterans are a very important part of New Zealand history. The aim is to record them in two books, one on the Pacific campaign and another on the Home Front.

“We are calling for veterans and their families and friends to contact us. In this way we can help preserve New Zealand’s wartime memories, which have resonance for so many of our families.”

**WORLD CLASS SCREEN PRODUCTION FACILITY FOR WELLINGTON**

A world-class screen production facility is to be built in the Wellington region with support from Positively Wellington Business and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise.

Positively Wellington Business, the region's economic development agency, is to receive $2 million dollars under New Zealand Trade and Enterprise's Regional Partnership Programme towards the development of a screen production facility, including a new purpose-built sound studio.

The facility is to be established at Miramar in partnership with Camperdown Studios. The studio is to be a soundproofed warehouse-style space in which filming can take place uninterrupted by weather and other noise.

**NZ PLANS TO RECOGNISE IMPORTANCE OF ANZAC COVE**

Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Helen Clark, says that the New Zealand Historic Places Trust was looking at ways to recognise the heritage importance to New Zealanders of Anzac Cove, Gallipoli.

Helen Clark said Gallipoli was a place of great significance in the history of New Zealand, Australia and a number of other countries.

“Given their place in New Zealand’s World War I history, the Gallipoli Peninsula and Anzac Cove have immense heritage importance for New Zealanders. The events at Gallipoli helped shape our sense of national identity.

“That is why the Historic Places Trust is exploring ways to recognise more formally the cultural and heritage significance of the Gallipoli campaign to New Zealanders.

“It is a project that many New Zealanders will welcome and I look forward to receiving further details as work progresses.”
