A new initiative to help rebuild key populations of New Zealand's giant carnivorous land snails was launched by Conservation Minister Chris Carter today.

The initiative seeks to co-ordinate ground-breaking efforts to preserve a full range of Powelliphanta snails, a genus which includes some of the largest snails in the world.

“Powelliphanta are not like ordinary garden snails,” Mr Carter said.

“These meat-eating giants are fascinating and beautiful with striking delicately-patterned shells in shades of red, brown, yellow and black. They are sumo wrestlers of the snail world growing up to 90mm across - the size of a man’s fist. A great many New Zealanders have never seen a Powelliphanta and don't even know they live in our nation's forests.

“Like many native species, Powelliphanta face threats that have reduced their numbers significantly in many areas and reduced the chances of people seeing them. Of the 21 Powelliphanta species and 51 sub species we know about, 40 of them are ranked as being of national conservation concern," Mr Carter said.

"Today over 40 recovery plans for the different Powelliphanta species and sub species are being launched. These plans have been developed by the Department of Conservation (DoC) after years of work by snail scientist Kath Walker.

"The plans seek to guide the actions needed over the next 10 years to restore key populations of Powelliphanta to an ecologically viable level within 20 years – a level at which there will be a greater chance of people seeing them," Mr Carter said.

"Implementation of the plans is to be overseen by a group of snail experts, involving people from inside and outside DoC.

"This kind of co-ordination is important when you are dealing with a genus which contains so many remarkable varieties of snail," Mr Carter said.

"It is in line with the Government's $187m strategy to save New Zealand's unique biodiversity and it builds on some fantastic programmes DoC already has underway. For instance, on Mt Arthur in the Kahurangi National Park, Powelliphanta numbers have increased five-fold thanks to a lengthy and intensive pest control programme.

"Powelliphanta are the culmination of at least 80 million years of evolution. They are a significant part of our heritage in the same way that kiwi and kakapo are. To enable these snails to recover, predator numbers in key areas need to be reduced to very low numbers in the immediate future, " Mr Carter said.

Key Facts

·Powelliphanta can live up to 20 years – in snail terms that is an incredibly long life span.

·They are carnivorous and eat earthworms and slugs. They suck their prey up through their mouths a little like we eat spaghetti. Although they are generally slow moving they can move quickly enough to pounce on their prey.

·There are least 21 Powelliphanta species and 51 sub-species found in both the North and South Islands. But North West Nelson and north Westland are strongholds for the snails. The greatest diversity of species is in the mountains of North West Nelson.

·The main threats to the snails today are introduced predators, particularly possums, pigs and rats, although weka, thrushes and hedgehogs also eat them. It has been observed that an individual possum can devour 60 adult Powelliphanta over one or two nights. In the past, but less frequently today, destruction of their forest and tussock grassland habitats has also had a catastrophic impact on numbers.
