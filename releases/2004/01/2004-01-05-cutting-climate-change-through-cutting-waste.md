Making simple changes around the home and garden can make a real contribution to helping to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change, Environment Minister Marian Hobbs said today.

“By changing the way we deal with our kitchen and garden waste, we can all help reduce one of the most potent greenhouse gases and the biggest New Zealand contributor to climate change – methane,” Marian Hobbs said.

Methane from landfills is created as organic matter breaks down.

“About 40 per cent of New Zealand’s landfill waste is organic, including food scraps and garden waste. By reducing the amount of organic waste we send to landfills, we can all help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect the New Zealand environment that we all love,” Marian Hobbs said.

"If your household puts out one bag of rubbish per week, you probably throw away enough kitchen scraps and garden waste in a year to make over seven bags of compost.

"By simply composting garden rubbish and food scraps, a typical household can reduce the contents of the average rubbish bag by nearly 50 per cent.”

The Climate Change Office is currently running a new public awareness campaign, aimed at raising awareness climate change issues and of helping New Zealanders reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which fuel climate change.

“All New Zealanders can get involved and play a part in protecting our environment from greenhouse gases. It is not only businesses and agriculture that can help reverse climate change trends - every household and individual can make a difference,” Marian Hobbs said.
