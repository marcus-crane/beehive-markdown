A new training programme launched by the Labour Progressive coalition government today will give Pacific businesses a boost by providing business skills support and assistance says Economic Development Minister, Jim Anderton and Associate Pacific Island Affairs Minister, Taito Philip Field.

"Pacific peoples have vibrant cultures that can provide opportunities to develop current businesses and to start new ventures. Pacific business people themselves have suggested that enterprise skills training is what they need to help them develop their potential," said Jim Anderton.

"The government is committed to seeing Pacific peoples participation in the economy expanded. Government has a role in providing education and training services for Pacific peoples, and addressing any barriers to access. It is important that Pacific peoples have access to the skills and knowledge and possess the confidence to attract investment for their marketable ideas," Taito Philip Field said.

Jim Anderton also commented that: "The Pacific unemployment rate is too high at 6.6% (Sept 2003). This rate, however, is greatly reduced from when Don Brash's ideological colleague Ruth Richardson was Minister of Finance. Then the Pacific Island unemployment rate never fell below 22.9%, and peaked above 30% during her years in office. This demonstrates how much difference the positive results of the constructive approach taken by this government have made."

"The pacific business training programme aims to lift employment, management skills, and business capability, all essential to assist Pacific communities reduce this unemployment rate and increase their levels of self employment," said Jim Anderton.

4.4% of Pacific people are self employed, just one third of the national rate (2001 figures).
