Associate Social Development and Employment Minister Rick Barker today congratulated all those involved in a Taranaki-based jobs programme aimed at helping young, long-term unemployed people into training and work.

“Today the first 14 graduates of Taranaki’s unique Career Start cadetship programme are graduating after an intense six-week training programme and 12 month placement with the New Plymouth District Council.”

Career Start is the brainchild of Taranaki Work and Income Regional Commissioner Gloria Campbell and was developed in response to a request by New Plymouth Mayor Peter Tennent for local youth employment solutions.

The cadetship programme commenced in February 2003 and involves the training and employment of 14 cadets per year over three years at the New Plymouth District Council.

Of the initial cadets, two will undertake further education at Victoria University, five have been offered positions at the New Plymouth District Council, one has found work in Australia, three have applied to enter the Navy and the remaining three are currently applying for positions in New Plymouth.

“I’m delighted to hear that all of the cadets have taken a major step forward and moved away from being on a benefit to something much more rewarding. Career Start is a fantastic asset to Taranaki and I congratulate everyone involved with the programme,” Mr Barker said.

Last year Mayor Tennent promoted Career Start at the New Zealand Local Government Annual Conference and the initiative attracted significant interest.

Other agencies involved with the programme include The Ministry of Social Development, Te Puni Kokiri, Community Employment Group and the Tertiary Education Commission.

A presentation by Career Start’s coach/co-coordinator was given to this year’s prospective cadets before Christmas and the new intake will commence training next week.

“I hope the next group of cadets find the programme equally rewarding and also make the transition to further training or sustainable employment.

“I am taking a personal interest in career opportunities for young people and I want them to get the best start possible.

“During the 1990s the training and employment needs of youth were ignored and Career Start is just the sort of initiative we need to turn that around,” Mr Barker said.
