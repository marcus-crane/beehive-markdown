Speaking to Maori Tourism Operators over the past two days in Rotorua, Associate Tourism Minister Dover Samuels urged the gathering to get behind its Maori Regional Tourism Groups (MRTG) - set up to advocate issues to government and the region’s tourism organisation. One of the main themes that came out of the conference was a challenge sent by Maori Tourism Operators to the government, to ensure that Maori Tourism is sustainable. Mr Samuels pledges that he would do his utmost to ensure the sustainability of these groups because the Maori Regional Tourism Groups (MRTG's) are a key component to the future of Maori tourism.Operators supported the need for Iwi and Maori to tell their own story and share the diverse reality for Maori in New Zealand today. Karen Waaka Chairperson of Maori in Tourism Rotorua commented that key obligations for government is to support Maori Tourism development, this includes;·Minimizing the constraints that prevent Maori from fully participating in the industry·To provide a sustainable infrastructureKaren also stated that, "maori are more readily valued and acknowledged internationally than in New Zealand and therein lies the opportunity and the challenge".Mr Samuels said "I will do my part to make sure that Maori tourism reaches its’ potential, however this must be complemented by Maori facing up to the challenges themselves that have arisen in developing the Maori tourism sector such as marketing and product development as well as access to regional tourism data.” He said these challenges could be progressed through regional partnerships between the MRTG's and the Regional Tourism Organisations. “An example of this can be found in Rotorua between Tourism Rotorua and The Maori in Tourism Rotorua Association (Rotorua's MRTG).” “As regional development is often about having the right people working with each other at the right time to combine their energies, these links are crucial. For regional tourism organisations these relationships are an avenue into Maori tourism products in their area which help define a regional point of difference.”Mr Samuels said that once the capability of Maori tourism had been strengthened at a regional level, work would begin to establish a National Maori Tourism Organisation.Mr Samuels recently represented New Zealand at the Australian Tourism Ministers Council meeting in Canberra. While there he held talks with Aboriginal tourism sector representatives. “I was able to see the type of cultural tourism product that is being developed through a collective effort and this is what I am urging Maori operators to do”.To date the Associate Minister of Tourism has completed a total of five regional tourism hui the responses to these gatherings has been fantastic said the Associate Minister and I now look forward to meeting Tourism Ngati Porou and Tourism Taranaki by the end of November Mr Samuels said Maori tourism operators have the opportunity to create niche, high value, low impact tourism products that can be utilised by regions such as Rotorua for successful participation in New Zealand’s tourism industry.”
