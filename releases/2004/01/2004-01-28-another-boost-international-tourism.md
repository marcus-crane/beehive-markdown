It’s official—[Tourism New Zealand](http://www.newzealand.com) is a world-class organisation.

Tourism Minister Mark Burton is today congratulating TNZ on winning two prestigious awards from the Hospitality Sales and Marketing Association International in New York last night.

TNZ’s 100% Pure international marketing campaign won the international public relations award for destination marketing. They were also awarded gold for The Royal Tour, a documentary made in association with the Discovery Channel and featuring Prime Minister Helen Clark.

“This is excellent news, and quite a feat for a nation that just a few years ago was all but unknown on the world stage,” said Mark Burton. “It is also a clear illustration of the value of this government’s continued investment in the long-running and successful 100% Pure campaign.

“Last year’s budget allocated $15 million over three years to fund a US-specific version of the campaign, aimed at maximising marketing opportunities provided by New Zealand’s high media profile in the United States and increasing New Zealand’s market share among our ideal visitors—high-value, interactive travellers.

“TNZ’s leverage off such high-profile projects as The Lord of the Rings and Whale Rider, as well as their successful partnership with the Discovery Channel, has already greatly increased New Zealand’s international status as a premiere destination.

“Winning these awards is yet another boost to our place in the highly competitive international tourism market.

“I cannot praise them highly enough for their outstanding work,” said Mark Burton.
