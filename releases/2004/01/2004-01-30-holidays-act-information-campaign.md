The [Holidays Act 2003](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=151552&hitsperheading=on&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7BB3F8574A%7D&softpage=DOC) comes into force on 1 April. To help businesses prepare, the [Employment Relations Service](http://www.ers.dol.govt.nz/) of the Department of Labour is mailing 150,000 information packs to employers and posting the relevant information on its website.

The information pack includes a checklist of the issues employers need to consider before 1 April.

Labour Minister Margaret Wilson urged employers to carefully review the information. The Act changes to the way holidays are managed and entitlements to annual holiday, public holiday, sick and bereavement leave.

"The Holidays Act was passed to improve and modernise provisions for employees and to make administration easier for employers," Margaret Wilson said.

"These changes continue the development of employment conditions designed to make the New Zealand workplace effective and attractive in a global marketplace."

The mail-out to employers is the first step in a $1 million information campaign that will also include employee information, print and radio advertising, and television advertising targetting young people.

"This legislation is important for all employees, but particularly for vulnerable employees who cannot get independent advice. We want to make certain these people know where to go for assistance," Margaret Wilson said.
