New police initiatives have resulted in a pleasing drop in crime in Manurewa, MP George Hawkins says.

"Over the last six months a series of novel approaches to targeting criminals in Manurewa have produced some startling results," Mr Hawkins said.

"Police are certainly to be congratulated," he said.

Total crime in Manurewa has dropped 23 per cent, burglary rates are down 18 per cent and violent crime is down by a quarter.

Mr Hawkins said Senior Sergeant Richard Middleton had been particularly pleased with a 50 per cent fall in family violence reported over the Christmas break.

"The message from police to local criminals has been clear. Either they give up criminal activity or they leave Manurewa. The other option is face jail."

Manurewa was a special area with a positive multicultural atmosphere. The majority of Manurewa's 70,000 population were law abiding people seeking a safe environment to live in and a better future for themselves and their families, Mr Hawkins said.

"They want a better life than what a life of crime can offer and they will be right behind what Manurewa police are achieving," he said.
