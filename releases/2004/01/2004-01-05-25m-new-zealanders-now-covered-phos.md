Health Minister Annette King says Primary Health Organisations (PHOs) are going from strength to strength, with about 2.5 million New Zealanders now covered nationwide.

Six new PHOs looking after the [primary health](http://www.moh.govt.nz/primaryhealthcare) needs of about 257,000 people began operating this month, bringing the national total to 59.

Ms King said she was very pleased to see that four of the six new PHOs are in the South Island, with two in Nelson-Marlborough, and one each in South Canterbury and Canterbury.

“In just 18 months, 59 PHOs have been [established](http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/30ad137c772c883e4c25665c002c4198/fb58f3293ca73445cc256cca0078230e?OpenDocument). I think that is an incredible success story. It takes us well down the road to providing fair, accessible and affordable public health services for all New Zealanders,’’ she said. “I am delighted with the way the PHO movement has developed around the country.

“PHOs have the very real potential to improve the overall health of all New Zealanders, giving us one of the best chances we've had in years of truly making a difference to the quality of life in this country."

Ms King said figures from the October 2003 quarter show that more than half of all Maori (56.4 percent) and almost all Pacific peoples (92 percent) in the country are now enrolled in a PHO. “The Government is committed to improving the health of high needs groups such as Maori, Pacific and people on low incomes.

“PHOs are not just about making primary health care more affordable. They have a public health focus, are intended to involve a whole team of health professionals offering a variety of services, and are charged with providing continuity of care for their enrolled populations.”

“Community participation in the governing process of PHOs is also important, because a strong primary health care system must give local people a voice in the planning and delivery of services in local communities,’’ she said.
