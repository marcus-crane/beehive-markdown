Environment Minister Marian Hobbs and Energy Minister Pete Hodgson will host a public meeting in Oamaru on Friday (January 23) to talk to local people about Waitaki River water allocation issues.

Marian Hobbs said she was keen to hear what local people had to say about the new process developed by the government for determining water allocation and resource consent applications for the river and catchment.

The new process is contained in the Resource Management (Waitaki Catchment) Amendment Bill, currently before the Parliament. The process is for deciding between the various applications rather than any particular application.

"My visit to the region with my colleague Pete Hodgson is a chance for us to have a closer look at some of the issues facing the local community at the moment," Marian Hobbs said. "I encourage anyone with an interest in this issue to try and come to the public meeting".

Public meeting details:

Where: Kingsgate Hotel Brydone – 115 Thames St Oamaru  
When: 2pm, Friday 23 January

Note to media:

Marian Hobbs and Pete Hodgson will be available for journalists and photographers at the close of the meeting, about 3.30pm.
