Children have rights and protections at work

Labour Minister Margaret Wilson says moves are underway to ensure children and young people are aware of their rights and legal protections at work.

"The recent survey of child employment by the Catholic charity Caritas has highlighted the ongoing need for vigilance. This country has a tradition of children working part-time, but our record for ensuring they are aware of their rights and the protections given to them under the law could be better."

The Caritas survey does not provide enough information for the Department of Labour to further investigate apparent breaches of child labour laws. The survey was anonymous and Caritas says the privacy of the children surveyed prevents it from identifying those who took part.

Margaret Wilson said a review of children's employment began in October. This project includes improving information available, coordinating enforcement between agencies and improving the collection of data about child employment. The Department of Labour is due to report on this in March. A two-year project assessing the implications of ratifying International Labour Organisation Convention 138 is also underway.

In the short-term, the Department of Labour today posted easy-to-follow guidelines on its website for children and their employers. Anyone requiring assistance or information is able to ring the Department of Labour's Employment Relations Service free information service on 0800 800 863.

Margaret Wilson said New Zealand has a tradition of children working - it is relatively common for children over the age of 11 to earn pocket money, to contribute to the family income and help with the family business or farm. "Mostly it is good experience for them. We also know there are, at least, isolated cases of unlawful exploitation. Rarity makes it no less distressing. "

"Knowledge is a safeguard. A basic list of child employment regulations is attached to this statement. I would be grateful if media would assist by publishing this, and I encourage schools, families and employers to use it as a resource."
