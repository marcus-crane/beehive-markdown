Health warnings on cigarette packets are set to increase in size, following the Government's ratification today of the World Health Organization-sponsored Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.  
Under the treaty, New Zealand will need to increase the size of health warnings on tobacco products within the next three years to cover at least 30 percent of the principal display areas of tobacco packets. Even larger warnings could be warranted and this matter will be part of consultations undertaken by the Ministry of Health.  
Associate Health Minister Damien O’Connor said New Zealand could take great pride in ratifying the convention.  
"Over 4.9 million people die worldwide each year from smoking-related illnesses and that figure is predicted to double in the next 20 years if current trends continue. The convention aims to put a stop to that trend; it is a major global public health agreement."  
The World Health Organization’s 192 member states unanimously adopted the treaty in May last year. So far 86 countries have signed the treaty and five have ratified it.  
Key provisions in the treaty include: a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship; protection from exposure to second-hand smoke; price and tax measures to reduce the demand for tobacco; promotion of public awareness on tobacco control issues; the regulation of tobacco products; health warnings; smoking cessation and tobacco smuggling.  
Mr O'Connor said New Zealand was right up there with world leaders in tobacco control, a position reinforced with the recent passing of the Smokefree Environments Amendment Act, which made all our bars, restaurants and work places smoke free.  
"The ratification of the treaty reflects our ongoing, strengthened commitment to reducing smoking-related death and disease."
