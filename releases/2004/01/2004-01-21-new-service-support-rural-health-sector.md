A new agency aimed at recruiting and retaining health professionals in rural areas is up and running, Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor announced today.

The Rural Primary Health Care Practitioner Recruitment Service kicked off in December with the signing of a contract between the Ministry of Health and the New Zealand Rural General Practice Network (RGPN).

The network was selected last year as the preferred provider of the service.

Mr O'Connor says the new service will recruit general practitioners, long-term locums, and nurse practitioners with prescribing capabilities, from both New Zealand urban centres and overseas.

"Establishing this service has answered the call from rural health providers to help ease the burden and reduce their costs in recruiting skilled practitioners to work in rural areas," says Mr O'Connor.

"Recruitment in rural primary health care settings can be difficult and expensive for rural providers. It is hoped that by providing a national recruitment service, the process will be more efficient and effective."

The new service will proactively seek out general practitioners, locums, and nurse practitioners with experience in rural settings, and will include a one-week orientation programme for new recruits, says Mr O'Connor.

"It will involve marketing rural New Zealand as an attractive destination for primary health care practitioners."

While providers must meet remuneration costs, the service will cover all essential infrastructure costs, such as marketing for, finding and vetting recruits, matching them with providers, and assisting them through the respective registration processes.

"Because the service is new, there is no historical data to suggest how many new recruits there will be. Also, the demand for nurse practitioners is yet to be tested. But we do expect the new service will have a positive impact on New Zealand's rural health workforce over time."

The contract for the new service is worth a total of $1.9 million (GST inclusive) over the contract term, which runs until the end of June 2006.

The new recruitment service is distinct from the rural locum support scheme, which is also provided by the RGPN and provides eligible rural general practitioners with short-term locum relief (two weeks a year).

RGPN chairman Tim Malloy says the network is looking forward to implementing the contract.

"We are very pleased to have got to this point and we are optimistic that with the hard work and energy of the network, we will be able to achieve the outcome of recruiting rural practitioners into primary care."

The service is just one of many recent rural health initiatives introduced by the government. Others include: a primary health care rural nurse practitioner scholarship package: a new recruitment scheme to support rural health care and roster relief for rural doctors and nurses.
