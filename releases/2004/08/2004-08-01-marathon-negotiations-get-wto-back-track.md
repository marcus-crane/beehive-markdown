The Doha Development Round is firmly back on track to success, Trade Negotiations and Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton said today.

Mr Sutton, speaking from Geneva where he is at the WTO meeting which approved “frameworks” for the next phase of multilateral negotiations after intensive debate, said that it had been a real marathon, but the WTO got there in the end.

“The Doha Round is firmly back on track to success. That’s good news for New Zealand.

“These frameworks, especially the one on agriculture, give a huge boost to the Doha Round. I’m delighted that after the disappointment of the Cancún Ministerial Conference last year, WTO Members have been able to find this common ground.”

Mr Sutton said it was not just a case of picking up where the WTO had left off last year. What we have now is significantly better than what was on the table at Cancún.

“This is a triumph for multilateralism. Rich and poor countries have reached agreement to open markets and advance the rule of law in international trade. That’s good for the world’s economy. It’s good for New Zealand. And it’s good for global development. The position on cotton agreed between African producers and the US was a key to clinching this deal. We welcome that.”

Mr Sutton said all WTO Members could be satisfied with the flexibility they’ve shown.

“We owe a vote of thanks to our dedicated negotiating Chairs, including Ambassador Shotaro Oshima of Japan, who managed the overall process, and the New Zealand Ambassador Tim Groser who took the lead on agriculture.”

A representative group of countries, including New Zealand, worked through the night in the so-called “green room” on the agriculture and industrial products package.

“Agriculture is at the heart of the Doha Round, so this is a major achievement. The EU and the US have agreed to eliminate all agricultural export subsidies. That’s a great outcome for New Zealand. It’s also a great result for the developing world, by signalling the end to rich countries dumping their surpluses onto global markets and collapsing prices for unsubsidised farmers.

“Other elements are also positive. We now have a sound basis to advance our agriculture market access objectives. And the framework targets the root cause of global agriculture distortions by requiring big cuts in government subsidies.”

Mr Sutton said that reaching agreement on agriculture has helped to unlock progress in the Round more broadly.

The package also covers the core issues of non-agriculture goods, services, and others which are likely to deliver benefits for developing countries, such as reform of the trading environment for cotton and new rules to facilitate the flow of trade.

Mr Sutton said agreeing the frameworks was a huge step forward.

“But we do have to remember that we’re not yet at the finish line. We still have a way to go before we conclude the Round,” he said.
