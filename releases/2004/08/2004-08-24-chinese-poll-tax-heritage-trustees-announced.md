Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter today announced the appointment of eight trustees to the newly formed Chinese Poll Tax Heritage Trust.

“I’m delighted to announce that Dr James Ng will chair the trust for its initial three-year term. The trustees joining Dr Ng will be Mr Peter Chin, Mr Ron Hoy Fong, Mrs Esther Fung, Ms Debbie Sew Hoy, Mr Kai Luey, Mr David Wong, and Mr Harvey Wu,” Chris Carter said.

The trustees were selected from the Poll Tax Advisory team that has been in consultation with the Government since 2002.

The appointment of the trustees follows February’s announcement by the Government of heritage initiatives aimed at raising awareness of New Zealand’s early Chinese community, which was subjected to discriminatory legislation. In February 2002, the Government apologised for that legislation which included the 'Poll Tax'.

From 1881, all Chinese migrants were required to pay a poll tax on entry to New Zealand. Other punitive initiatives also singled out Chinese people. Their right to naturalisation was withdrawn from 1908 to 1951 and they were compulsorily thumb printed upon returning to New Zealand from overseas.

"The Poll Tax and other unfair immigration practices had a terrible impact on early Chinese settlers. The Government sincerely hopes that the Trust will strengthen the unique identity of Chinese New Zealanders” Mr Carter said.

The trustees will administer a $5 million grant on behalf of their community. The trust will fund projects to boost the study and preservation of Chinese New Zealand history, culture and language.

"New Zealand has now been acknowledged as the first country in the world to apologise to its Chinese citizens for discriminatory legislation specifically aimed at them or their forebears. All New Zealanders can be proud of this announcement and I wish the newly appointed trustees all the very best" Chris Carter said.
