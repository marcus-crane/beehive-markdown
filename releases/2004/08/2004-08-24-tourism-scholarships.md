Tourism Minister, Mark Burton has announced the establishment of five tourism scholarships for post graduate students to conduct tourism related research.  
Announcing the scholarships at this year’s New Zealand Tourism Conference, Mark Burton said that it was intended that the scholarships will increase the amount of research targeted to the needs of the tourism sector, the profile and perceived value of tourism research in the tourism sector and build research capacity by supporting academic excellence.  
$15,000 will be made available for each of five successful applicants in their thesis year and the scholarship is intended to cover tuition fees and contribute to research costs (such as travel).

"The New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2010 highlighted a mismatch in some areas between available research and the needs of the sector, a relative level of under-funding for tourism research when compared to other sectors of the economy and a lack of a research and development culture in tourism.

"Quality research is key to building a truly sustainable tourism sector, and these scholarships will increase research available that is targeted to the needs of the tourism sector as well as building tourism research capacity by supporting academic excellence." Mr Burton said.  
The application, recruitment and selection process will utilise the expertise of existing academic committees and scholarship offices to shortlist applicants.

Final selection of applicants will be made by a tourism research scholarship panel of representatives of the Ministry of Tourism, the tourism industry and academics.
