Consultation with the building industry is vital to ensure the new building licensing system works, Associate Commerce Minister John Tamihere says.

Mr Tamihere today released a discussion document on building industry licensing. The licensing system for building practitioners is one of a package of measures set out in the Building Bill currently being considered by Parliament.

The Building Bill sets the framework for the licensing system but the detail of how it will work is still to be set out in regulations under the legislation.

"This consultation is the first phase of developing that detail and is crucial in getting it right," Mr Tamihere said.

Under the proposed model, from 2009 certain building work called "restricted work" will have to be carried out or supervised by a licensed building practitioner.

The discussion document focuses on two key issues:

·What work should be "restricted" to licensed people

·Who should be licensed.

Mr Tamihere urged people - particularly industry members - to read the discussion document and make a submission.

"This is a key chance for you to have your say. Your input is essential to making sure the licensing regime is sensible and workable and results in us all having buildings that are designed and built right first time."

Submissions close on November 30.
