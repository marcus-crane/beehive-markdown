New funding applications for contaminated site remediation and clean up works across the country will be invited from Friday, August 20, Environment Minister Marian Hobbs said today.

"Regional councils will be invited to submit applications for investigations and clean up programmes for priority contaminated sites," Marian Hobbs said.

"Councils will receive forms and guidelines on how to make an application.  
Applications will close on October 20, allowing regional councils plenty of time to prepare their applications.

"The ministry is already working closely with local communities and landowners on remediation partnerships with seven regional councils on 13 separate projects."

Marian Hobbs said the Contaminated Sites Remediation Fund launched in October 2003 has been very effective in stimulating action on the ground.

"One case in point is the Auckland Regional Council which received funding of more than $180,000 for site assessment of the former fertiliser plant in Onehunga; investigation of seabed contamination around Devonport naval base and investigation of contamination in the Western Reclamation," Marian Hobbs said.

Many of the projects funded over the last two financial years support site investigations to guide future clean-up activity.
