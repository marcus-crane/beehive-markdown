Fisheries minister David Benson-Pope has welcomed the introduction of scampi into New Zealand's world recognised Quota Management System.

The Fisheries Amendment Bill (No.4) passed its third reading in Parliament this afternoon with 107 votes in favour and just 10 votes opposed.

Mr Benson-Pope says that although scampi has become a controversial subject, introducing scampi into the QMS was about managing a valuable public resource in a sustainable way.

He acknowledged that negotiations were continuing with a small number of fishers identified by a Select Committee inquiry as deserving compensation and he hoped they would reach a satisfactory conclusion in the near future.
