“I’m up for it”.

Small Business Minister, John Tamihere, today took up the challenges put to him by the [Small Business Advisory Group](http://www.med.govt.nz/irdev/ind_dev/sbag/) in their [first annual report](http://www.med.govt.nz/irdev/ind_dev/sbag/ar/2004/index.html).

The Report sets out [performance measures](http://www.med.govt.nz/irdev/ind_dev/sbag/ar/2004/2004-11.html) for the Government, and for Mr Tamihere personally, to meet in dealing with issues affecting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

“The group has produced a well-reasoned and practical set of recommendations. Some, like the tax measures, are specific. Others, like removing barriers to trade with Australia and making enterprise education a core curriculum subject for all fourth formers (Year 10), show the Group has thought beyond the immediate and is looking forward strategically.”

“This clearly differentiates them from the old lobbying groups”, Mr Tamihere said.

“I will be proud to take this report to my Cabinet colleagues and to enlist their support for its recommendations”.

“I will endeavour to implement as many of the recommendations as possible, and I can assure the Group that all of them will be carefully considered and responded to by the government”.

The first annual report of the Small Business Advisory Group was presented to the Minister during a media launch in Auckland. The report includes nineteen recommendations to the government to enhance small business growth.

The report builds on information and feedback from businesses that attended the Small Business Day events, as well as the Advisory Group’s own knowledge and experience. The Small Business Day events were held from February to May in 24 locations throughout New Zealand.

“They’ve given me twelve months to respond to the recommendations. I hope to have an initial response, at least, to them within the next couple of months”, Mr Tamihere said.
