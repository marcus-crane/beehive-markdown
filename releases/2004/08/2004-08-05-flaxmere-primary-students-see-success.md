Flaxmere Primary School, one of the first schools in the country to pilot asTTle (Assessment Tools for Teaching and Learning), has now successfully raised students' skills in reading, writing and maths, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

Trevor Mallard was speaking (eds:1pm) at a demonstration of asTTle at Flaxmere Primary School in Hastings - a school which was part of the original pilot for asTTle before it was rolled out to all schools in 2002.

AsTTle gives teachers, parents and students important information about how students are performing and where they need more help to improve.

"Congratulations to Flaxmere Primary. It’s great to hear that students' skills in reading, writing and maths are improving and that use of tools such as asTTle, combined with quality teaching, has helped to make this possible," Trevor Mallard said.

"I'm told that Flaxmere Primary also credits its successes to high expectations by dedicated teachers and students and also excellent community involvement in the life of the school."

AsTTle is one of the tools that is used at the school to enable teachers to:

- establish where children are at in reading, writing and mathematics/numeracy;
- identify what the next learning needs may be, and change lessons accordingly; and
- accurately share children’s achievement data with parents.

"AsTTle is used in the school as a planning, teaching and assessment tool for teachers and children and is part of the school’s integrated approach to learning.  
This integrated approach requires children to select a particular study pathway and identify exactly where they are at, know where they want to go and how to get there.

"I would really encourage all parents to check asTTle out. This assessment tool is attracting international attention. It is unique in that it gives parents and caregivers a much more accurate picture of how their child is doing early on so that any problems can be picked up and worked on before it’s too late," Trevor Mallard said.
