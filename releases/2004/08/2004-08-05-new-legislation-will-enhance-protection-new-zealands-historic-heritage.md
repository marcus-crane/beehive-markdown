Proposed legislation to enhance the role of the Historic Places Trust in the management and protection of New Zealand's historic heritage was introduced to Parliament today.

Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Judith Tizard welcomed the introduction of the Historic Places Amendment Bill.

“The Historic Places Amendment Bill recognises and further enables the important role of the Trust in preserving and protecting New Zealand's heritage,” said Judith Tizard.

“The new legislation will strengthen the Historic Places Trust’s governance arrangements and categorise the Trust as a Crown entity. The Trust will have the same accountability requirements as other Crown entities in the cultural sector such as Te Papa and Creative New Zealand.

“The Bill introduces a process where the Trust will notify and invite submissions on all proposals to register historic places, historic areas and wahi tapu areas.

Judith Tizard said the Bill also clarifies and amends some provisions of the Act that have proven difficult to administer in practice.

“Amendments were passed last year to the Resource Management Act 1991 to assist local authorities with their management responsibilities for historic heritage. Amendments are now being made through this Bill to enhance the role of the Trust on a national level.

"Our government is committed to strengthening New Zealand's historic and cultural heritage. It is important for us and for future generations that government provides ongoing leadership in caring for important historic places."

Government funding for the Historic Places Trust has increased significantly from $4.5million in 2003/04 to $6.5 in 2003/2004, and rising to $7.5 million in 2005/06. The Trust is also responsible for the administration of the newly established National Preservation Incentive Fund. Each year the Trust distributes $563,000 from annual funding to private owners of heritage properties to encourage their preservation.
