**Minister and Commission Chair Met**

Minister of Maori Affairs, Parekura Horomia this morning met with Dr Patu Hohepa, the chair of Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Maori.

During this meeting the Minister once again voiced his concern regarding the submission made by the Chief Executive to the Select Committee in relation to the Foreshore and Seabed Bill.

"I re-iterated that such behaviour was unbecoming of someone who has a major role in implementing the government's Maori language strategy" Mr Horomia said.

The purpose of the strategy is to identify common language goals to ensure our resources are well used, and that the language revitalisation that is going on now is accelerated. To that end Mr Piripi has an important task to fulfill.

"Mr Piripi has voiced remorse. The Board is addressing the matter with Mr Piripi.

"I acknowledge that this matter is one of a contractual nature between the Board and their Chief Executive, as such, I do not intend to make any further comment.
