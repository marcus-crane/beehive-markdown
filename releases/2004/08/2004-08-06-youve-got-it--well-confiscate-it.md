The latest and largest seizure of Crystal Methamphetamine at the border with a street value of about $9 million, reinforces the government's decision to expand the Customs and Police budget to target drug dealers.

"I am impressed with the skill demonstrated by our Customs officers who found the crystal methamphetamine in Lava lamps. This is awesome work and should reconfirm for the public that this government is tough on crime and is determined to stamp out P dealers," Customs Minister Rick Barker said today.

Mr Barker says Customs is reporting increasing volumes of drug seizures in several areas.

"The fact is New Zealanders are being targeted by foreign drug syndicates.  
This increase in seizures reflects both more attempts to traffic illegal drugs to meet the market demand, and also greater capability in Customs to successfully intercept the traffickers as a result of increased Government investment.

" This is the largest amount of crystal methamphetamine we've stopped and the amount of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine tablets seized, in over 455 interceptions, is double that of the previous reporting year," he said.

In the previous financial year Customs have seized in excess of:

- 22 kilos of the Class A controlled drug cocaine
- 3 kilos of the Class A controlled drug crystal methamphetamine
- 1.2 kilos of the Class A controlled drug heroin
- 180,000 tablets of the Class B controlled drug MDMA (ecstasy)

Crystal methamphetamine is a highly potent variant of methamphetamine, and is imported ready to use. Mr Barker says Customs have also seized a staggering 1.2 million tablets of precursors believed destined for methamphetamine production.

"Methamphetamine abuse is the single biggest illicit drug problem facing New Zealand. This Government is determined to stop it at the border and to tackle the social problems caused by methamphetamine use and manufacture.

"We have implemented the Methamphetamine Action Plan and reclassified methamphetamine as a class A drug. The Increased meth analysis work by Environmental Science and Research (ESR), as a result of recent recruitment, will be matched by additional funding of $17 million over four years," said Rick Barker.
