A government prepared to put its money where its mouth is, combined with pro-active policing, has resulted in New Zealand posting its lowest crime rate since 1983.

Police Minister George Hawkins says [official crime statistics](http://www.police.govt.nz/service/statistics/) released by Police today show recorded offences per 10,000 head of population for the year to June 2004 numbered 1,053.7. This is the lowest rate since 1983.

"The figures also show a 4.7 percent drop in recorded crime, or an average of 403 fewer victims of recorded crime each week in New Zealand compared with the year before. This is simply a stunning result," Mr Hawkins said.

Recorded crime rates fell in 10 of the country's 12 police Districts, with the two remaining Districts showing a rise of only 1.4 percent each.

On a per 10,000 head of population basis crime fell in every Police District, with total crime falling 6.5 percent across the country for the year.

"Counties Manukau, Central and Auckland Police Districts led the way clocking spectacular falls of 16.5 percent, 12.8 percent and 11.8 percent respectively," Mr Hawkins said.

Around the country, overall recorded offences fell in five of the seven crime categories namely Violence, Sexual, Drugs and Anti-Social, Dishonesty, Property Damage, Property Abuses, and Administrative.

Total recorded crime for the year numbered 426,149 recorded offences, compared with 447,146 for the previous year.

"That means there were 20,997 less victims of crime nationally for the twelve months, or an average drop of 403 fewer victims of crime a week around the country in the period," Mr Hawkins said.

At the same time resolution rates rose 1.4 percent to 45.1 percent, placing New Zealand's rate of catching crooks among the highest in the world.

**Nationally**:

- recorded dishonesty offences fell 6.7 percent, including burglary down 0.3 percent, car conversion down 8.3 percent, fraud 19.8 percent, and theft 7.4 percent.
- recorded sexual offences dropped 4 per cent
- recorded property abuse fell 6 percent
- recorded administrative offences fell 24.7 percent
- recorded violence offences appeared to be levelling off falling 1 percent, including homicide down 7.4 percent and minor assaults down 6.8 percent
- recorded drugs and anti-social offences rose 2.9 percent, disorder and cannabis only offences fell 4.3 and 11.4 percent respectively, and drugs and anti-social resolution rates were 92.1 percent compared with 90.3 percent the year before.
- Recorded property damage rose 1.9 percent.

"Figures like these show Police deserve the community's thanks for a fine result and also dispel the myth they focus solely on traffic offences at the expense of other crime," Mr Hawkins said.

The results reflected a supportive government prepared to ensure staff had the resources to do their job, including a police budget at its highest ever at over $1b a year, police numbers at their highest ever at 9737, including 7450 sworn officers and 2287 non-sworn staff, a $70m building programme and a new vehicle purchasing programme that would see up to $29.2m spent on around 850 new vehicles in each of the next three financial years.
