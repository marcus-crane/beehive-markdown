A report released today by the Ministry of Economic Development, is evidence of thorough work going on to ensure the $1.52 billion Auckland Transport Package delivers long-term results for Auckland, says Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard.

"Government, local government, Transit and Transfund are to be congratulated on the huge programme of activities in Auckland, which will see Auckland and the rest of New Zealand with adequate infrastructure to go into the future," says Judith Tizard.

"The report released today demonstrates that good planning is underway to ensure that as new roading projects are ready for construction they can continue to proceed without delay."

Judith Tizard says Auckland is currently in the middle of its biggest ever transport-building boom with historic levels of investment in infrastructure, and this will inevitably put pressure on industry.

"While there are no constraints on current projects, we are aware that new projects will place additional demands on industry and the government is working to ensure any constraints are minimised.

"For example, potential skill shortages in several areas are well known, and are being addressed through support for industry training, the Modern Apprenticeship programme and increased engagement with industry.

"We are also working closely with the construction industry to address planning and procurement issues that may arise from the number of new large-scale construction projects. I welcome comments today from Roading New Zealand that they are confident of delivering on the demands of the Auckland Transport Package.

"The government's review of the Resource Management Act is similarly addressing any future constraints by looking at ways of providing greater certainty for applicants. Initiatives such as this will improve conditions for investment and planning for increased activity in the construction industry."
