Acting Prime Minister Michael Cullen said today that the vandalism of Jewish graves at Makara outside Wellington was “totally unacceptable.”

“The incident is particularly concerning as it follows an earlier attack on Jewish headstones in Wellington’s Bolton Street cemetery.

“Racism of any sort is ugly and unforgivable and has no place in New Zealand,” Dr Cullen said.
