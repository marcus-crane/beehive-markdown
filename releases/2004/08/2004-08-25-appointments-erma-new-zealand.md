Environment Minister Marian Hobbs today announced the appointment of three members to the Environmental Risk Management Authority, the decision-making body that regulates hazardous substances and new organisms.

Two of the appointments are new to the eight-member board. The third, Tony Haggerty, is reappointed for a further term.

Ms Helen Atkins, a partner with Phillips Fox law firm, has over 14 years experience in public, environmental, resource management and local government law. Ms Atkins also has general expertise in governance and decision-making.

Dr Kieran Elborough, a chief scientist at ViaLactia Biosciences (NZ) Ltd has expertise in biochemistry and gene technology. He has lectured at the University of Durham in human molecular genetics, cell signalling and cancer biology and has undertaken research in plant molecular biology.

"These new appointments provide a valuable balance to the existing capabilities of the authority while the reappointment of Tony Haggerty will maintain continuity," Marian Hobbs said.

"Mr Haggerty is a valued member of the authority and provides particular in-depth knowledge of chemistry and hazardous substances management. His reappointment to the Authority will maintain its level of expertise in hazardous substances."

Two authority members, Professor Colin Mantell and Dr Lin Roberts, completed their terms in March and June of this year, respectively.

"Their contribution is greatly appreciated and acknowledged, Professor Mantell for his management expertise and knowledge in relation to medicine and Mâori health, and Dr Roberts for her particular expertise in ecology and sustainable industry and business matters," Marian Hobbs said.
