One of the Government Ministers who attended the signing of documents by the Minister of Finance, Hon Dr Michael Cullen, and the Minister of Defence, Hon Mark Burton, Dover Samuels today welcomed the announcement that Whangarei would be the home to a new $NZ500 million construction project, Project Protector.

Mr Samuels said "this is a $NZ500 million project and that means good things for Whangarei and for Northland. This is a project that will strengthen the developing marine construction industry and create jobs in the region. This is a project that will put yet another feather in the cap of a region that is growing and has capability to deliver the goods."

There will be 7 vessels, which include a Multi Role Vessel (MRV), two Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) and four Inshore Patrol Vessels (IPVs), will enter service over the next three years.

It is expected that the vessels will fulfil a broad range of requirements that will include personnel and cargo sealift, emergency response, fisheries and customs patrols and at-sea training for the Royal New Zealand Naval forces.

"That we have an opportunity now to utilise state-of-the-art equipment for patrol of our shores and for the training of our naval defence forces will enable us to be at the cutting edge of defence technology and techniques" said Mr Samuels.

This is not just about defence though, it is about acknowledging that in Whangarei we have the infrastructure to support the development of a project of this scale, we have the skills to complete the project beyond the standard that is required and we have the relationships with business to make this the place to build. This speaks volumes for the sector in Northland and it rewards Northlanders with skills" said Mr Samuels.

"With our focus on improving the skill level of the labour force, we have been given an opportunity for Northlanders to develop a high standard of skills with a significant employment opportunity as the carrot. I welcome this opportunity and look forward to the positive impact it will make for Northland and Northlanders" said Mr Samuels.
