Research, Science and Technology Minister, Pete Hodgson, leaves this Sunday to join a twelve strong delegation of senior New Zealand scientists and science managers on a tour seeking collaborative research and investment opportunities in Asia.

The party will visit China, Korea and Japan over the coming week and includes eminent New Zealand scientist and Nobel Laureate, Professor Alan MacDiarmid.

"This government is committed to building science, technology and business links across Asia, says Pete Hodgson. "There is enormous potential for research and commercial collaboration in the region. New Zealand science already enjoys an enviable reputation across Asia and we can be optimistic about our prosects for building on this."

The trip follows contacts and initiatives flowing from APEC Science Ministers meetings and is designed to highlight New Zealand's research capabilities and identify opportunities for collaborations and investment.

The trip will focus on strengthening links at an intergovernmental level as well as directly with businesses.
