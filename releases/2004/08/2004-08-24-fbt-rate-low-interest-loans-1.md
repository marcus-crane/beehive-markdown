The prescribed rate used to calculate fringe benefit tax on low interest, employment-related loans will rise from 7.50 percent to 8.02 percent from 1 October 2004, Revenue Minister Michael Cullen announced today.

The rate is reviewed regularly in line with the results of the Reserve Bank’s survey of first mortgage rates. It was last changed with effect from 1 July 2004.

The change was approved by Order in Council today.
