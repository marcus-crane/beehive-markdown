The government recognises the invaluable contribution the charities sector makes to society, Commerce Minister Margaret Wilson said today.

"It is therefore important for New Zealanders to have a charitable sector which has the full confidence and trust of its benefactors.

"Many New Zealanders give money to charities in good faith and there are few checks and balances in place to ensure their expectations are met. My ongoing meetings with members of the sector have demonstrated that charities are aware of the importance of maintaining public confidence in their activities.

"I am aware of sector concerns about the bill and its potential compliance costs," Margaret Wilson said. "The bill is currently before the Social Services Select Committee, which is yet to deliberate on it. I am sure the committee can report back a bill that reflects and addresses the concerns of the sector while maintaining the public's faith in charities.

"I am open to changes in the bill. In light of submissions I have asked officials to work with the select committee to ensure that we get legislation that is workable and does not impose unnecessary costs on charities."
