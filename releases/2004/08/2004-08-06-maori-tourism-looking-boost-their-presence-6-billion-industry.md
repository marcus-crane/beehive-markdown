Puke Ariki museum in New Plymouth is playing host to one of the most important hui for the Mâori tourism industry today.

The 12 regional Mâori tourism organisations from around the country are meeting to launch the Mâori Tourism New Zealand, a new national body that will lay a solid foundation for Mâori involved in the industry.

Associate Tourism Minister Dover Samuels says Mâori Tourism New Zealand will allow Mâori operators to work collectively to improve industry standards and identify opportunities.

Maori tourism is a diverse and evolving industry says Dover Samuels, "it's no longer all about haka and hangi because there are many small business operators involved in boutique ventures like outdoor pursuits and craft making."

"Maori Tourism has been the sleeping giant, and the giant is about to be awaken," said Mr Samuels.

Mâori Tourism New Zealand as a brand will enhance the industry regionally nationally and internationally.

Tourism continues its positive growth track, with 20 per cent more international visitor figures visiting New Zealand in June 2004—134,800 in total. The year on year figures for June 2003-June 2004 increased 10 per cent 2.25 million.

"It is important that Mâori tourism take advantage of the increasing numbers of arrivals given that last year international visitors spent more than $6 billion on the local economy," said Dover Samuels.

"I look forward to establishing a proactive working relationship with Mâori Tourism New Zealand because it is certainly a sunrise industry that has huge potential for our people."
