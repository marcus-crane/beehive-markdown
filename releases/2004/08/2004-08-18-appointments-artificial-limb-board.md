Appointments were announced today to the New Zealand Artificial Limb Board.

The Board is a Crown entity responsible for meeting the rehabilitation needs of New Zealand amputees, as well as carrying out research and development. It has a budget of $6.5 million (in 2004/05) and provides free prosthetic and rehabilitative services to amputees and other clients so that they can achieve maximum quality of life, independence, and participate in their communities.

Board members are appointed on the nomination of organisations including the New Zealand War Amputees Association, New Zealand Orthopaedic Association, Amputees Federation of New Zealand, and the Minister of Health.

Steve Maharey said the Board provides an essential lifetime service to over four thousand New Zealanders.

“Once people become amputees services are provided for the remainder of their lifetime. At present the Board is providing services to 4,331 people.

“Appointments being made to the Board will ensure the organisation maintains its high standards:  
·Wellington chartered accountant Graeme Hall (chair) is being reappointed. He has been a member of the NZALB since 1990;  
·Auckland orthopaedic surgeon Dr Geoffrey Lamb, who was awarded ONZM in 2003 for services to orthopaedics and amputees;  
·National Secretary of the Amputees Federation, Lorraine Peacock;  
·Canterbury District Health Board Chief Medical Officer Dr Nigel Millar; and  
·Director of the Office for Senior Citizens, Natalie Lavery (ex officio), representing the Chief Executive of the Ministry of Social Development.

“I’d also like to thank outgoing board members for their significant contributions,” Steve Maharey said.
