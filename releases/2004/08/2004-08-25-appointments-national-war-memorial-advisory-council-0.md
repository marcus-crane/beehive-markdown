Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard today announced the appointment of John Campbell and the re-appointment of Denny Morris to the National War Memorial Advisory Council. Both of these appointees are nominated by the Royal New Zealand Returned Services Association (RNZRSA).

John Campbell has been appointed for a term expiring on 30 June 2005, in line with the NZRSA’s wish that their National President should always be one of their nominees to the Council. Mr Campbell was elected National President in June 2004 and has served on the National Executive Committee and as District President Otago/Southland of the NZRSA for some years.

Denny Morris has been re-appointed for a three-year term expiring on 31 July 2007. Mr Morris has served on the Association’s National Executive for 22 years (still serving) and has had several RSA-related governance positions.

Judith Tizard expressed her confidence in the new and re-appointed members. “I am delighted that these people have agreed to serve on the National War Memorial Advisory Council. They bring an impressive range of skills and experience to their positions and I am confident that the Council will be well served by them.”

The National War Memorial Advisory Council advises the Ministers for Arts, Culture and Heritage on all matters relevant to the control and maintenance of the National War Memorial.
