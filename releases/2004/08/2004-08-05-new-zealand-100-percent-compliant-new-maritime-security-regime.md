The Minister for Transport Safety Harry Duynhoven says that the International Maritime Organisation has now been advised that New Zealand is 100 percent compliant with strict new international maritime security requirements.

This follows the approval of the port facility security plan for Opua last week.

"This places New Zealand in a very enviable position internationally", Mr Duynhoven said.

Ships trading internationally which are not compliant with the new international security requirements, or have visited ports that are non-compliant, can face a number of possible sanctions. This creates a fear for shipping lines that they will face increased costs if they send their ships to pick up or drop off cargo at non-compliant ports. For a trading nation such as New Zealand this would be disastrous.

"The 100 percent compliance is the result of a lot of hard work and excellent co-operation between the government and industry. I would particularly like to acknowledge the collaborative approach of the maritime transport industry and the efforts of the Maritime Safety Authority, the Ministry of Transport, the port companies, and unions for their commitment to ensure New Zealand gained total compliance. This has enhanced our reputation as a country that can respond in a very pragmatic and effective manner to new international requirements", Mr Duynhoven said.
