The government has appointed investment and business consultant Jonathan Eriksen to conduct the initial independent review of the Guardians of New Zealand Superannuation.

The legislation establishing the Fund provides for periodic reviews every five years of the Board’s performance: a provision reflecting the importance of the Fund to the future viability of New Zealand Superannuation and to the security in retirement of New Zealanders.

Mr Eriksen tendered for the job. He will prepare a written report to be tabled in the House by the end of the year.

Announcing the appointment, Dr Cullen said Mr Eriksen had the necessary skills and competencies to do the work.

He has previously advised the Earthquake Commission on investment and corporate governance issues and the Russian government on pension fund reform.
