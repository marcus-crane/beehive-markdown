National leader Don Brash’s comments about New Zealand becoming “just another Pacific country” are demeaning to the Pacific community, says Acting Pacific Island Affairs Minister, Taito Phillip Field.

"Don Brash wants Australian businesses to believe that New Zealand is on the way to becoming an economic basket case, and he's using Pacific Island states as an example," said Taito Field.

"Quite honestly, I despair of that sort of bad judgement. Dr Brash is not just trying to stymie Australian investment in New Zealand, but is also demeaning all the states of the Pacific."

“Obviously there are some nations in the Pacific that face uphill struggles to lift the qualify of life for their people. But there are also some Pacific nations which have enjoyed growth rates that are, at times, ahead of those of New Zealand or Australia.

“And Dr Brash has to realise that New Zealand, a country of 4 million people with good fertile land cannot be compared to Pacific nations, most of which have small populations and do not enjoy abundant natural resources to help bolster their economies.

“For Dr Brash to make these statements about our Pacific neighbours, has the potential to undo the excellent relationship that New Zealand has with the Pacific,said Taito Field.
