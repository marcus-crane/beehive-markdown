The enabling legislation for June's Transport Sector Review, the Transport Legislation Bill, was tabled in Parliament on Monday.

The aim of the review is to promote the creation of an affordable, integrated, safe, responsive and sustainable transport system by 2010.

Specific changes included in the Bill include:

·The formation of a new agency, Land Transport New Zealand, comprising the operational responsibilities of the Land Transport Safety Authority and Transfund New Zealand following the transferral of policy functions from these two bodies to the Ministry of Transport

·Increasing the scope of the Maritime Safety Authority and the Civil Aviation Authority to take into account the objectives of the New Zealand Transport Strategy in their work. There is no change to the primary safety responsibilities of these authorities, and

·The integration of the current Safety Administration Programme into the national land transport programme.

The next stage of this Bill will be to move it to the Select Committee process where interested parties can make submissions.
