Seven entirely new species of lizard have been discovered in New Zealand in the past two and a half years.

The discoveries made in both the North and South Islands were announced today by Conservation Minister Chris Carter to kick off this year's Conservation Week (August 2-7).

"Few people realise that in addition to our unique native bird life, weta and giant snails, New Zealand is home to a wider variety of lizards than almost any other temperate country in the world. This is a consequence of our environment being isolated from other land masses for 85 million years," Mr Carter said.

"We have at least 80 species and subspecies of lizard that we know of and we are still finding more. In the past two and a half years, we believe four new species of skink and three new species of gecko have been discovered. Two of these species were spotted for the first time this year.

"The fact we continue to discover so many new species demonstrates how much we still have to learn about what lives around us, and our impact upon them," Mr Carter said.

The new species are:

Sinbad Valley Skink: Discovered in March in the mountains of Fiordland during a survey for geckos. Large, spectacularly coloured and unlike any other known species – black with green spots on the back and salmon-pink spots on the sides.  
Unusually long toes and tail.

Rangitata Skink: Discovered in Canterbury early this year during a DOC survey. Much larger relative of the long-toed skink. Chestnut brown with very prominent pale stripes. Indications are it is a distinct species that does not interbreed with the long-toed skink despite occupying same habitat.

Whirinaki Skink: Discovered last year in a forest clearing in Whirinaki and still known only from video footage. Appears to be different from all known species. It has a distinct colour pattern (brown with indistinct long stripes), head shape and scale count.

Te Kakahu Skink: Discovered in 2002 on an island in Fiordland. So far has only be found in one small area of low, open vegetation at the top of a cliff. Has distinct colour pattern differences to other species, and different scale counts.

Mount Benson Gecko/Split Rostral Gecko: These probable new species were found in the Kahurangi National Park, the first in 2002, and the other in 2003. They appear to be quite different from other species, and each other. The split rostral species differs from all other geckos in the world, not just New Zealand, because the scale at the tip of its nose is divided in two. Genetic studies are now being made of these species.

Moke Valley Gecko: Discovered in the South Island High Country during tenure review in 2002. A large robust gecko, which genetic tests have established is different from a similar gecko species discovered near Wanaka in 1997.
