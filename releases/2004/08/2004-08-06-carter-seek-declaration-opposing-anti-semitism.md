Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter is to seek a statement from New Zealand’s Parliament condemning anti-Semitism following a second attack on a Jewish cemetery in Wellington last night.

“Australia’s federal parliament and a number of its state parliaments have made significant resolutions condemning anti-Semitism this year. The shocking attacks on Jewish sites in Wellington in the past month suggest it is time our parliament did the same,” Mr Carter said.

“While such a statement is symbolic, discussions with the Jewish community suggest it would be an important public gesture that would be welcomed by them at this difficult time. It would also be a stake in the ground from New Zealand’s leaders that the despicable acts that occurred at Makara last night have no place in our peaceful country.”

Mr Carter said he would be seeking support from his parliamentary colleagues for a declaration next week.

“All people, regardless of their ethnicity or cultural background, can appreciate the deep hurt Wellington’s Jewish community is feeling right now. Respect for the dead, and the memory of loved ones, is fundamental to all of us.

“If New Zealanders want to pass on messages of support, sorrow and friendship to our Jewish community they can do so by emailing chris.carter@parliament.govt.nz, and I will pass them on.”
