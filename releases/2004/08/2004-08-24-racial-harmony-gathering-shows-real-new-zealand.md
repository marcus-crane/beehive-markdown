Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter today welcomed participants in the "Way forward for Racial Harmony" forum at Parliament.

"This gathering represents what New Zealand should be about. Support for our diverse and multi ethnic society is clearly alive and well in this country, and it's heartening to see this display of community support. This is also a stark contrast to the atmosphere brought on by the Destiny Church march yesterday." Mr Carter said.

The Forum was organised by James and Helen McNeish following the desecration of the Jewish graves at Makara and Bolton Street cemetaries several weeks ago.

Mr Carter publicly condemned the attacks and sought the support of his Cabinet colleagues to adopt a motion in Parliament deploring anti-Semitism. Today he will present the Jewish community with around 60 letters of support from members of the public. He will also present a petition with over 1000 signatures collected by the Wellington members of the Australasian Union of Jewish Students.

"I welcome today's stand for racial harmony. We live in a society that does not tolerate discrimination of any kind and it's excellent to see support coming from some very prominent New Zealanders." Mr Carter said.
