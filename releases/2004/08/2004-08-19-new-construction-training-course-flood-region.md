The Universal College of Learning launched a new [Certificate in Work Based Construction](http://www.ucol.ac.nz/courses/details.asp?progID=768) course today. The course was officially opened by Economic, Regional and Industry Development Minister, Jim Anderton.

"This course has been provided to address both the construction industry skills shortages and need for reconstruction in the flood damaged Wanganui and Manawatu regions. It's a great course, partly because it's free to the students and recognises the contribution they will make to their region.

"It's also a great course because it will help to rebuild a community and it will lead to long term careers. This is a great example of a tertiary institution working in partnership with government and the community to meet the needs of our regions, and I'm pleased to say that New Zealand Trade and Enterprise's Polytech Regional Development Fund has contributed $119,600 towards the programme.

"When I came to the region after the February floods I witnessed the incredible devastation of farms, land and livelihoods. The people I met impressed me with their determination to put things back on track and I was pleased to be able to assist.

"In some ways, this progressive government has been dealing with regional devastation from the policies of the 1990s for the last four years. The success we are having in increasing regional economic growth and reducing unemployment is a great example of how the determination of people in our regions can be boosted when the government is working with them, supporting economic growth.

"When communities, industry and government work together in partnership, we can all win. I am very pleased to open this construction course and look forward to seeing the positive educational, social and economic outcomes that I'm sure will be achieved," Jim Anderton said.
