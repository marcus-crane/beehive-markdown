Associate Immigration Minister Mr O'Connor today made the following comment regarding Iranian overstayer Saied Ghanbari:

"I have made my decision regarding Mr Ghanbari. That decision was not to intervene in his removal. The facts of that decision are in the public domain (see [release](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F20468) of 29 July), and the matter of Mr Ghanbari's removal is now in the hands of the Immigration Service."

Mr O'Connor said he would be making no further comment on the case.
