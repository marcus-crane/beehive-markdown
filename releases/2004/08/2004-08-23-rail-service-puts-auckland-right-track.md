A partnership between Auckland Regional Council and Connex to deliver Auckland's passenger rail service was welcomed today by Associate Transport Minister Judith Tizard.

Launching the operation at Britomart Transport Centre today, Judith Tizard said improving Auckland's rail network was essential to delivering the sustainable, reliable and safe transport system Auckland needs.

"Public transport needs to be part of the solution to Auckland's transport problems. The Auckland Regional Council and Connex are to be congratulated on their commitment to improving Auckland's rail service."

Judith Tizard says improvements to public transport will be a key focus of the government's $1.62 billion funding package for Auckland transport.

"While the government is making record investments in Auckland's transport infrastructure, we recognise we cannot simply build our way out of the problem. By improving rail services we can help make our existing transport networks work more efficiently and in a more environmentally sustainable way.

"I am delighted that rail patronage has grown by over a third in the last year and that the Britomart Transport continues to see increasing numbers of commuters."
