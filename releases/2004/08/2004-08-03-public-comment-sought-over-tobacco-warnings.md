A document discussing health warnings and other information on tobacco packaging has been released for public comment, Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor announced today.

“We're looking for information to help decide what size and types of warnings should go on tobacco packets,” said Mr O’Connor.

Other issues covered in the consultation would include the disclosure of the ingredients of tobacco products and tobacco smoke, as well as options for reducing tobacco harm, such as regulating harmful ingredients.

"The review will help ensure New Zealand regulations meet the requirements of the [World Health Organisation's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control](http://www.who.int/tobacco/areas/framework/en/), which we ratified last year," Mr O'Connor said.

That would mean increasing the size of warnings on tobacco products to 30 percent or more of the principal display areas, and could include pictorial health warnings showing smoking damage.

The consultation process was in place to ensure interested parties are aware of the review and have a fair chance to comment on the proposals.

"The government will not be making any decisions until after the consultation process is complete and submissions have been carefully considered," Mr O'Connor said.

The closing date for public submissions is Friday 8 October.
