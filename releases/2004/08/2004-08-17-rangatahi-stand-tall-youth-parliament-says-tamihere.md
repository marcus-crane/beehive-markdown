As Youth Parliament 2004 draws to a close Youth Affairs and Associate Mäori Affairs Minister John Tamihere congratulated the 20 Mäori Youth MPs from across the country who took part.

“It was exciting to see the next generation of Mäori leaders coming forward. I was impressed by the confidence and passion with which they put forward their views.”

Topics that the Mäori Youth MPs spoke on included making te reo compulsory in school, Mäori health and the foreshore and seabed.

The Youth Select committee reviewing Te Puni Kökiri questioned officials on a range of topics including Mäori education, Mäori succeeding as Mäori and the State Services Commission’s Treaty information programme.

“I was also impressed by the skill in te reo shown by a number of the Youth MPs.” said John Tamihere.

“Perhaps the most encouraging thing about seeing the next generation of leaders come together at the Youth Parliament was the maturity they brought to issues of race and culture. Regardless of their ethnicity, Youth MPs engaged sensibly and articulately on these issues without the kind of angst that we sometimes see from their elders.”

“It is great to see young kiwis from a range of different cultural backgrounds who have a very clear recognition and understanding of the place of matters Mäori in their lives.”

“They are setting the benchmark for a great nation that recognises, tolerates and respects the best from Mäori culture, without it ever being intolerant, or disrespectful to anybody else’s,” John Tamihere.
