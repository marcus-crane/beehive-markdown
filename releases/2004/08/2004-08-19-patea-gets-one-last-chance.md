The Patea community will be given one last chance to prove that they will support local schooling, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

Following a 28-day consultation period Trevor Mallard confirmed the decision to close Patea School, however Patea High School will remain open as a Year 1-13 composite school.

“During the consultation period I have taken on board the views of the community and the respective school boards, as well as the local MP, Jill Pettis, who has made strong representations to me on this issue. I am willing to give the Patea community one last chance to prove that they will get behind a local school and produce quality educational outcomes for their students,” Trevor Mallard said.

"This decision provides an opportunity to retain education provision in Patea. I look forward to hearing about the success of the community as it strives to ensure sustainable schooling in Patea is re-established.

“The onus is now on the people of Patea to get in behind their local school and prove that the roll and quality of education can be rebuilt. By 1 March 2006 the area school should have a roll of 170 students (excluding adult students)” Trevor Mallard said.

The decision to keep Patea High School open will be reviewed in May 2006. Trevor Mallard said he would ask the Education Review Office to consider conducting a review of the school in the first term of 2006.

"Students in Patea simply must not be prevented from accessing the same sort educational, cultural and recreational opportunities as students elsewhere in the country. If concerns remain I will have no choice but to re-consider my decision," Trevor Mallard said.

“However, if the review in 2006 produces good results and demand exists, I will also consider building a new early childhood centre following the review in 2006.

Trevor Mallard said the Patea schooling decisions were to:

- close Patea School with effect from 27 January 2005
- change the class of Patea High School from a Year 7-13 secondary school to a Year 1 – 13 composite school (area school), and
- retain Kakaramea School, Whenuakura School and Hurleyville School as contributing schools.

“I'd like to thank everyone who has been involved in the consultation process. As we move forward the community has an opportunity to retain and expand education provision in Patea.
