"Do nothing then throw in the towel," is the clear message given by National through its climate change policy says Convenor, Ministerial Group on Climate Change, Pete Hodgson.

"National's climate change policy makes no sense, is bad for business, bad for the environment and puts future decisions about what New Zealand does in the hands of the US Congress and Australian Parliament.

"National's policy is empty. If ever it were put into action it would ensure that New Zealand's international credibility would be gone by lunchtime."
