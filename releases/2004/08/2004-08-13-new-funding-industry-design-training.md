A $406,000 programme to boost product design skills in industry is announced today by Research, Science and Technology Minister, Pete Hodgson and Associate Minister for Tertiary Education, Steve Maharey.

Through the programme Otago Polytechnic and industry will work together to maximise the business benefits that improved product design can bring. The objective is to create new product design and development post graduate study options.

"This is an excellent example of government, the tertiary education sector and industry working together to foster innovation and enterprise. The quality of the design element of any new product development process can make the difference between success and failure. This collaboration is dedicated to improving business success," says Pete Hodgson.

The programme will be initiated through work-place internships so that the Polytechnic can really get to know the needs of business. Experience gained in this way will then be used in the design of future courses to ensure that they meet the needs of business in terms of both content and delivery.

Otago Polytechnic is already looking ahead to see how best direct contact with industry can be incorporated into post graduate degree courses. Options include work placements for students, industry participation in the provision of training (so-called practitioner-led learning) and collaborative new product development ventures between the Polytechnic, students and individual businesses.

"This design programme is yet another excellent example of how tertiary education organisations can work directly with industry to improve the provision of the training and skills needed to drive business success. It follows a similar partnership announced last month between Massey University in Palmerston North and the biotechnology sector," said Associate Minister for Tertiary Education, Steve Maharey.

The programme is funded through the Tertiary Education Commission's contestable Growth and Innovation Pilots Initiative.
