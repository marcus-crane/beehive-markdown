Parliament today unanimously adopted a motion condemning anti-Semitism and deploring the recent attacks on Jewish graves in Wellington.

"This motion was an important gesture for New Zealand's leaders to make in light of the shocking attacks on Jewish cemetaries in Wellington this month. I'm pleased other political parties felt the same, and I hope the Jewish community takes some comfort in Parliament's statement," Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter said.

"Can I also take this opportunity to extend my thanks to those New Zealanders who have sent letters of support for the Jewish community into my office. I have over 50 messages to pass on, and will do so shortly," Mr Carter said.

The text of the motion was:

"That this House deplores recent attacks on Jewish graves and a Jewish chapel in Wellington; recalls the terrible history of anti-Semitism stretching over many centuries, culminating in the holocaust under Nazi rule; and expresses its unequivocal condemnation of anti-Semitism, violence directed against Jews and Jewish religious and cultural institutions and all forms of racial and ethnic hatred, persecution, and discrimination."
