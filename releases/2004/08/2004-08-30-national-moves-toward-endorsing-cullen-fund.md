National continued its dithering on superannuation at a conference of superannuation professionals held in Auckland today.

National party finance spokesman John Key stated National is "unequivocally committed" to a 65 age of entitlement. This is in stark contrast to Don Brash's statements that the age of eligibility will have to rise.

Key also said in his address that the age of eligibility would have to rise in future.

"Kiwis are sick of uncertainty on superannuation. National's confusion and in-fighting is a perfect example of the confusing messages the opposition is sending on superannuation," said Associate Finance Minister David Cunliffe who also spoke at the conference.

Key also used figures in his address that seemed to take into account the projected return from the Cullen fund. This implies that he has won his internal battle against Dr Brash to keep the fund. Brash had previously described the fund as "financial smoke and mirrors" and had wanted to scrap it to pay for tax cuts.

"It is good to see common sense prevailing. National appear to be finally recognising the value of the Cullen fund for providing New Zealanders the certainty they need to plan and save for the future," said David Cunliffe.

David Cunliffe used his address to outline Labour's commitment to maintain the current superannuation rate and eligibility criteria, and the work the government is doing to promote retirement savings.
