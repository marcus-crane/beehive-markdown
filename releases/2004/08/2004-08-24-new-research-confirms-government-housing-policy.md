Research published today by the Centre for Housing Research Kainga Tipu on housing issues for older people confirms the direction of government policy.

The report, Accommodation Options for Older People in New Zealand, looks at housing issues for those aged 65 and over and identifies their current and likely future housing needs.

Housing Minister Steve Maharey said the report findings confirms that the Government is on track to meet the housing needs of older people.

“Housing is a fundamental issue for all New Zealanders, but it assumes much more importance as people age because the elderly are usually on fixed incomes and are much less able to move than the rest of the population.

“The report’s findings are in line with our plans to meet the housing challenge posed by New Zealand’s ageing population. It also raises a number of issues addressed in the development of the New Zealand Housing Strategy.

“Not all those aged over 65 need housing assistance – many don’t. For those who do, there is a shared response: about 12,000 older New Zealanders live in state houses, many others in about 14,000 local government tenancies.”

The government is working on a variety of fronts to ensure older people get to spend their final years in quality, affordable housing. Initiatives include:  
·the Housing New Zealand Corporation’s (HNZC) mainstream activities to make it easier for older tenants to stay on in the same home or community. For example, modernising homes to make them warmer and easier to maintain, and reconfiguring housing stock to offer smaller, more manageable homes to older tenants;  
·partnerships with local government and voluntary agencies to increase the amount of housing specifically designed to meet the needs of older people on low incomes. New housing projects for older people from Abbeyfield House, Hamilton; Lutheran Homes, Palmerston North and Pukeroa Oruawhata Trust, Rotorua were recently approved through the government’s Housing Innovation Fund;  
·acquisition by HNZC of homes that better meet older people’s needs. Of the 1,054 new homes to be acquired by HNZC this year, half will be one or two-bedroom properties and will be particularly suitable for older people on the waiting list.

“Older people of modest means can also access income-related rents, leaving more in the pocket each week for healthcare and other costs. The average weekly rent saving for those aged over 65 in a state house is $35 per week.

“As a significant number of state house tenants increase in frailty, the Corporation will continue to work with health and social services, to ensure older people will be able to access the home based support services they require to age in place.

“As for the longer term, the New Zealand Housing Strategy – to be released later this year – will discuss the future housing of older people to meet anticipated demand and diversity,” Steve Maharey said.

**Meeting the housing needs of older people**

***New housing*** – Many older people prefer to live in one or two-bedroom homes; of the 1,054 new homes to be acquired this year, half will be one or two-bedroom. This will help meet the housing needs of older people.

In March 2003 the Prime Minister opened a new 51-unit complex specifically designed for older tenants in Lynfield, Auckland. Furthermore, 1,660 Auckland City Council pensioner houses were bought by HNZC during 2003 and rents reduced for 1,200 tenants. About $75 million is budgeted to modernise and reconfigure the units over five years.

***Income related rents*** – This was reintroduced in 2000 to make state housing more affordable and responsive to individual household income and need. The subsidy ensures people on very low incomes pay no more than 25% of their total household income on rent. As at June 2004 there were 11,447 state house tenants over 65 years receiving IRR. They make up about 18% of the state housing portfolio. IRR is making an important contribution to the welfare of senior citizens by increasing their disposable income after meeting housing costs. It also provides tenure stability. Tenants over 65 years have an average tenancy in their current home of 14 years, compared to 7 for state housing tenants generally.

***Housing Innovation Fund*** – This $63 million fund, to be spent over four years, encourages third sector, iwi and local government to increase their involvement in providing rental housing and home ownership opportunities to low income people and those with special needs. In the first funding announcement, in July, three of the six community groups to receive funding were specifically for new housing for older people:  
\* Pukeroa Oruawhata Trust, Rotorua – building five two-bedroom units for Ngati Whakaue kaumatua;  
\* Abbeyfield New Zealand Incorporated, Hamilton – building a 10-unit complex for older people; and  
\* Lutheran Homes, Palmerston North – building five one-bedroom units for older people.

HNZC is currently working with more third sector groups on proposals to the Fund for new housing for older people.

The Fund will also encourage local government to increase their involvement in providing housing for low-income people. The Fund offers scope for local councils to increase their housing, or to modernise/reconfigure existing pensioner housing.

***Better utilisation*** – The Corporation currently provides tenants in under-occupied properties with opportunities and encouragement to move to homes that better meet their needs. Particularly for older tenants, this provides the chance to move to a smaller home that is more manageable. A number of older tenants who have moved to smaller homes have, for example, expressed relief at no longer having to climb staircases in their three or four bedroom homes.

In the past year, the Corporation transferred 330 tenancies to make better use of its housing stock. Of these, 85 were people aged over 65. Since late 2002 the better utilisation programme has seen 149 older people successfully moved to smaller homes.

In Hamilton, for example, 39 two-bedroom units are being built for older people. Nearly all tenants will be moving from larger HNZC properties, freeing these up for families.

***Energy Efficiency Programme*** – this aims to provide all pre-1977 HNZC houses, over a 10 to 12 year period, with energy efficient features such as insulation and damp proofing. The benefits include warmer, healthier homes resulting in lower power and medical bills.

Provisionally, in the 12 months to the end of June 2004, HNZC expects to have completed Energy Efficiency retrofits on about 3,038 properties. Since the Programme began in 2001/02, 8,250 properties have been retrofitted. HNZC also insulates properties as part of its Modernisation and Healthy Housing programmes and as part of the upgrade of ex-Auckland City Council housing.

**Modernisation** - HNZC is progressively upgrading its outdated stock to meet modern living requirements. Provisionally, in the 12 months to the end of June 2004, HNZC expects to have upgraded 580 properties nation-wide. Since the Programme began in 2001, about 1,470 properties have been upgraded.

***Healthy Housing*** – this programme is a joint initiative between HNZC and District Health Boards to address overcrowding and associated health issues in state housing in high-risk areas. The Programme began in 2001 as a pilot targeting households in Otara, Onehunga and Mangere in South Auckland. In 2002, it was extended to Glen Innes in Central Auckland and, in 2003, to Whangarei and Clendon in Manurewa.

Since the Programme began, HNZC has worked with public health nurses to assess 1616 Corporation properties. This resulted in 1931 interventions to reduce the health risks of 1060 households, such as extending existing homes for larger families and making design improvements; installing insulation; and introducing household management plans.

***Registered Master Builders House of the Year Awards*** – Three entries in this year’s Housing New Zealand Community Development Award were either retirement villages or housing for older people. The Award is for residential housing to meet a community or social need. One entry won Gold Reserve, another silver, and the third bronze.
