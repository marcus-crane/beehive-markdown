Tourism Minister, Mark Burton has announced funding of $82,000 to promote awareness and assist utilisation of the Tourism Planning Toolkit developed with Tourism Strategy 2010 implementation funding.

“The Tourism Planning Toolkit has been designed to assist local Councils to understand the economic impact of tourism in their region, measure visitor demand and visitor satisfaction. It also enables local authorities to profile the sector, gives models to help evaluate tourism projects and events proposals, and offers ideas on how to monitor progress”. Mark Burton said today.

The Tourism Toolkit has been prepared by Lincoln University, with input from Local Government New Zealand which has also contributed $45,000 towards the promotion of the Toolkit, and is being hosted on the Ministry of Tourism’s website.

The Ministry of Tourism in association with Local Government New Zealand will run a series of presentations on the Tourism Planning Toolkit for local councils beginning with presentations to Local Government New Zealand Zone meetings in September.

An additional 10 workshops will be held around New Zealand for local government staff and a specialist workshop will be held for consultants working on tourism planning issues with local government. CD Rom versions of the tourism toolkit will be provided to all workshop attendees and all local authorities.

"These workshops will mean more informed and integrated planning of local government tourism activities across the range of council functions and improved understanding of the roles and responsibilities of local government and tourism sector stakeholders.

“The sector will always have issues and challenges to face, both in the short and long term. But, by continuing to find new and better ways to understand, manage and benefit from the impacts of tourism, the industry is well positioned to keep strengthening its twin foundations of long-term sustainability and economic benefit.” Mark Burton said.
