Associate Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Taito Phillip Field has welcomed the announcement of changes to the Samoan and Pacific migration quota systems.

Immigration Minister Paul Swain today announced the changes that will enable migration quotas set for Pacific Island countries to be filled.

People applying under the quota need to have a job offer in New Zealand and meet minimum health, English language and character requirements.

The changes include speeding up the verification of job offers, the reduction of minimum income required for family applicants and the creation of relationship managers to focus on identifying and establishing employment opportunities for prospective quota migrants

Mr Field said the changes followed consultation between government ministers and Pacific Island community leaders in New Zealand and the Pacific.

"The changes are an effort to resolve problems with filling the annual quotas and in Samoa's case, acknowledging New Zealand's obligations under our protocol agreement and Treaty of Friendship."

Each year there are 1100 places under the Samoan quota and 650 under the Pacific Access Category (PAC), which includes Tonga, Fiji, Tuvalu and Kiribati.
