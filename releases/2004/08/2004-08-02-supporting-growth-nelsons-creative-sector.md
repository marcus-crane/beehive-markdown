"The creative sector in the Nelson region has been successful in gaining support from the Labour Progressive government to promote their artworks and develop export opportunities," the Economic, Industry and Regional Development Minister, Jim Anderton, said today.

A grant of $53,000 from the Ministry of Economic Development's Regional Initiatives Fund has been awarded to the Nelson Bays Arts Advocacy and Marketing Trust this week.

“The Nelson region has a well-deserved reputation as a centre of creativity, quality and innovation but it is not sitting on its laurels.

"The promotion of arts in the region will continue with the fifth edition of their regional arts guide book, and further develop their international reputation with a large-scale mobile exhibit to be displayed at the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar in Portsmouth, England. They are also developing a secure e-commerce facility that will enable customers to make purchases on-line.

"I am pleased to support the Nelson region as they innovatively maximise the economic potential of their creative and talented community. The work they are doing to expand their global connections and improve their export potential is a good example for other regions in New Zealand.

“This project can only enhance Nelson’s reputation as a centre of creativity and a home to some of New Zealand’s best artistic talent.”

Nelson Bays Arts Advocacy and Marketing Trust was established in 1993 to create opportunities for the arts to flourish in the Nelson region. The Trust has recently increased its focus on professional development, business and industry support as well as the development of export opportunities for Nelson/Tasman arts products.

The grant will contribute to a strategy to promote the region’s creative sector. A prime objective of the strategy is to raise the profile of the Nelson/Tasman region’s creative sector beyond the tourism market and to grow it as an industry in its own right.

**Editors Note:**

The Regional Initiatives Fund (RIF) is a discretionary fund administered by the Ministry of Economic Development. Each application is sent to the Minister for Economic, Industry and Regional Development for approval.

On average 20 projects through RIF are funded each year. RIF grants range in value between $28,000 to $200,000 with most between $50,000 and $70,000. The majority of RIF grants are paid to territorial local authorities. In some cases, the council holds the money on behalf of groups that are not legal entities.

Each application is based on partial funding on a case by case basis. A ‘local contribution’ is an essential part of any RIF application.

The purpose of the RIF is to provide support for regional projects that are consistent with economic, social and environmental objectives but cannot be funded through other Government assistance programmes. A region is defined as a geographical concentration of communities with similar economic, social and environmental characteristics and objectives.

The Regional Initiatives Fund was created to provide catalyst funding for regional projects that fall outside the criteria of existing Government assistance programmes, but have the potential to leverage economic growth as well as meet Government objectives for economic, social and environmental development.

Funding is only paid out on the completion of agreed milestones, and is monitored by the Ministry of Economic Development.
