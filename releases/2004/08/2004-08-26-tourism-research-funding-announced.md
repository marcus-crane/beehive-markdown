Tourism Minister, Mark Burton announced funding of $1.407 million, over three years, for a major new programme of tourism research to be led by Lincoln University, at the New Zealand Tourism Awards Gala event in Taupo tonight.

“The funding will be used to support a three year research programme to examine the areas that contribute to tourism yield.

“The knowledge gained will be significant and will result in the development of a set of tools to enable improved financial performance across the tourism sector,” Mark Burton said.

It is expected that the outcome will be seen in improved financial performance in the tourism industry and better strategic alignment of tourism investment.

Increasing yield relative to visitor numbers is one of the core objectives of the Tourism Strategy 2010 developed by the Government and wide tourism sector interests, and been a central priority of Tourism Minister, Mark Burton.

“Funding will come from funding voted for the implementation of the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2010 and the tourism industry,” He said.

The three year programme is a partnership between the Government and its agencies, the Tourism Industry Association and its members and Lincoln University.
