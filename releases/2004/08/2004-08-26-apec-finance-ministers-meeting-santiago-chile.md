Finance Minister Michael Cullen is to attend the 11th meeting of APEC Finance Ministers in Santiago from 1 to 3 September 2004.

The Finance Ministers meeting is one of the key forums of the APEC process providing a unique opportunity for the exchange of ideas and to build a momentum on past encounters.

This is the fifth APEC Finance Ministers meeting Dr Cullen has attended.

“We will meet in Chile as global economic growth strengthens, and with a continued favourable outlook for 2005. The APEC region is growing faster than the world economy

Dr Cullen will visit Buenos Aires en route to Santiago for meetings with the Secretary of Finance Guillermo Nielsen and will give a presentation to the Argentine Business Association.

In Santiago a series of bilateral meetings with APEC Finance Ministers has been scheduled.

These include Japanese Finance Minister Sadakazu Tanigaki, Chinese Minister of Finance Jim Renqing and Thailand’s Minister of Finance Dr Somkid Jatusripitak.
