Proposed legislation to remove fault from ACC’s medical misadventure provisions and to make the ACC scheme fairer and simpler, was introduced in Parliament today.

ACC Minister Ruth Dyson welcomed the introduction of the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Amendment Bill (No 3).

"The current medical misadventure provisions are confusing and are out of step with the no-fault principle that underpins the ACC scheme," Ruth Dyson said.

“The Bill also addresses other issues and enables operational improvements that will make ACC more responsive to the needs of claimants.

"The changes will allow ACC to have discretion it currently does not have in providing certain rehabilitation entitlements and a more equitable basis for calculating weekly compensation for the self-employed.

"We are replacing the current medical misadventure provisions governing ACC cover when a person is injured during medical treatment, with new rules under a new Treatment Injury category," Ruth Dyson said.

The new category removes the requirement to find fault (as is the case with some claims for medical misadventure), or prove that a medical injury is rare and severe (the majority of medical misadventure claims), before a patient is entitled to ACC cover.

"Under these changes, more people will be eligible for cover, and the claims process will be fairer, simpler and quicker,” she said.

The Bill also changes ACC’s reporting provisions under the new Treatment Injury category. ACC will assume a new patient safety role, reporting to the relevant statutory agency when there is a risk of harm to the public from a type of treatment, equipment, medical facility, drug, organisation or practitioner.

"This strengthens the partnership between ACC and the health sector and moves away from the punitive system of finding and reporting medical error. It encourages a climate of learning when things go wrong, while still protecting public safety,” Ruth Dyson said.

“This work follows a robust consultation process where government worked in partnership with key stakeholders and the public.

"There is a strong consensus supporting the changes, from those involved in the consultation process including claimants, health practitioners and medico-legal experts.

“Our government is committed to providing strong public services. Creating a fairer and simpler ACC scheme that reduces the incidence and impact of personal injury is part of this overall goal,” Ruth Dyson said.
