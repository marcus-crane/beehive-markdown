The number of New Zealanders who support giving international aid to poorer countries is growing, according to a new public opinion poll released today.

Some 76 per cent of New Zealanders support the government providing aid (up from 71 per cent in 1999).

NZAID, the government's aid agency and CID, the Council for International Development, commissioned the poll by UMR Research in February and March 2004 and follows a similar poll in 1999.

Being a good global citizen has emerged as the strongest reason for giving aid.

Nearly 60 per cent agree with a new argument in favour of giving aid that 'the case for New Zealand providing aid is becoming stronger as the world increasingly becomes a global community'.

Aid Minister Marian Hobbs says people want New Zealand to take some responsibility to help people suffering terrible poverty in other countries.

"They see it as our international duty," Marian Hobbs said. "We feel more connected to the world today. People understand that our investment in international development and aid is our long term insurance policy against the sorts of violence seen in recent years, and the spread of diseases like SARs."

New Zealand's aid budget supports such activities as promoting good governance and primary school education, for example in countries like Solomon Islands where less than 40 per cent of children complete primary school. It helps establish small business ventures in many Pacific countries, fight the spread of HIV/AIDS and has supported the reconstruction of schools and providing clean water in countries like East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan.

The poll also shows increased support for aid to the Pacific where people believe our aid can be most effective.

Given a choice of regions, 71 per cent selected the Pacific as the area that should get most government aid (up from 55 per cent in 1999).
