Corrections Minister Paul Swain today paid tribute to Department of Corrections chief executive Mark Byers, who has announced he is retiring in February.

Mr Swain said Mr Byers has had a distinguished 39-year career in the public service, including nine years as Corrections chief executive.

"He has achieved many things in his career. He was the first chief executive of Corrections when it was formed in 1995. He has overseen the development of the Corrections Act 2004. He was also responsible for the introduction of the much-acclaimed intergrated offender management programme and the development of four new prisons.

"Mr Byers can look back on his time at Corrections with much pride. I thank him for his contribution and wish him well for the future."
