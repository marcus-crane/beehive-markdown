Youth Affairs Minister John Tamihere said he was very impressed with the high standard of questions by Youth MPs at today's Youth Parliament question time.

"What a great start to proceedings. This was the best youth parliament question time to date. The standard of questions was as good as the official opposition on a good day.

"Fortunately Ministers were well disposed to dealing with challenging topics such as environmental protection, student debt, education, immigration and economic growth.

Youth Parliament 2004 celebrates New Zealand's young people and provides a real opportunity for youth participation said John Tamihere.

"Youth Parliament 2004 is the fourth Youth Parliament in New Zealand history, and was postponed a year to coincide with the 150th anniversary of the New Zealand Parliament, the 30th anniversary of lowering the voting age, and 10 years since the first Youth Parliament was held.

"I am proud to be able to host this historic event together with the Speaker of the House, Rt Hon Jonathan Hunt. Youth Parliament was started 10 years ago to help young people understand what goes on in government, and to give them the opportunity to express their views and opinions.

"Youth Parliament 2004 involves very talented young people voicing their opinion not only on the issues they face, but issues facing the country.

"This year Youth MPs will debate a mock piece of legislation - the Minimum Ages Bill. The Bill will propose that the age of majority be lowered from 20 to 18. It will also propose that the minimum legal age for purchasing alcohol be raised from 18 to 20 and that the minimum driving age be raised from 15 to 16.

"I particularly look forward to hearing the outcome of debate on this matter as well as other key issues under discussion. This information will be fed into the general policy process ensuring youth are heard and the event has lasting impact," John Tamihere said.

Youth Parliament 2004 has a comprehensive programme with the Governor-General officially opening proceedings. When legislative and general debates, select committees, ministerial reviews and press briefings are complete, Wellington-based band Rhombus will play at the closing celebration.
