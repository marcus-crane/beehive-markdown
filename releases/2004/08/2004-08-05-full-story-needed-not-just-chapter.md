National's Wayne Mapp has worked himself into a lather over some immigration figures but as usual he has not told the whole story, Immigration Minister Paul Swain said today.

Mr Swain said the majority of the dishonesty allegations made against Immigration Service staff are unfounded.

Of the 64 investigations completed, 67 per cent (43) were unsubstantiated while 33% resulted in disciplinary action or were referred to police. There are still 30 investigations from the last year being carried out. Another three have been started since June.

"The sad fact is that people who have missed out on getting into New Zealand sometimes make malicious allegations of corruption against staff, who are sitting targets for these sorts of accusations. All are investigated fully and acted upon if needed."

Mr Swain said that when allegations were proven, swift action was taken. Of the proven cases, around 70 per cent were referred to police for further action while the others were the subject of disciplinary action. There are nearly 900 immigration staff worldwide.

Mr Swain said the government had also taken steps to address the issue.

In 2003, the State Services Commission and the Department of Labour commissioned KPMG to review the Immigration Service’s processes for internal investigations. The majority of recommendations arising from the review were implemented by 27 February this year. These include a new integrity policy, improved investigation processes and guidelines, increased investigation capability, and code of conduct training for all staff.

Mr Swain reminded Mr Mapp to tell the whole story in future, not just a chapter.
