The pressures that low power wireless devices are placing on New Zealand’s radio spectrum is the subject of a [discussion paper](http://www.med.govt.nz/rsm/planning/srd/index.html) released today by the Ministry of Economic Development.

"The government's [digital strategy](http://www.med.govt.nz/pbt/infotech/digital-strategy/index.html) aims to encourage the use of new technologies to work smarter. We need to ensure that suitable [radio spectrum](http://www.med.govt.nz/rsm/index.html) is available for these new technologies." said Associate Communications Minister David Cunliffe.

"It is also important that our approaches are in line with our trading partners and that we keep up with international trends in such a fast moving arena." said David Cunliffe.

Low power radio products are known collectively as Short Range Devices (SRDs). The use of SRDs is growing fast as new technologies are applied to such applications as computer networks, Radio Frequency Identification Devices for monitoring parts and products in the distribution chain, and ways of connecting audio and video equipment such as cameras, recorders and displays without using cables.

As well as being of interest to suppliers and users of SRDs, the paper has implications for other radio spectrum users who may need to share spectrum with low power transmitters. Although the low power suggests that they are unlikely to cause interference to licensed users, the effect of large numbers operating in an area can be significant.

The MED is asking for comment from interested parties by 24 September before implementing any changes to the spectrum allocations. Copies of the paper are available electronically the [MED's Radio Spectrum Policy and Planning Group](http://www.med.govt.nz/rsm/planning/srd/index.html).
