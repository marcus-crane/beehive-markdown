New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to Fiji will be senior diplomat Michael Green, Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced today.

New Zealand’s relationship with Fiji, suspended following the 2000 coup, has been progressively restored and returned to normal last December.

“I am pleased that our traditionally strong ties to Fiji have been restored, and we look forward to strengthening them further,” Mr Goff said.

“Fiji is important to New Zealand as our largest trading partner in the Pacific. It is also a major political player in the Pacific region and home to regional organisations including the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat.”

Mr Green is currently Deputy Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, with responsibility for the Americas, North Asia, South and Southeast Asia and security policy. He has served as Ambassador in Jakarta and has also had postings in Beijing, New York (the United Nations) and Bangkok. He was Director of the External Assessments Bureau from 1988 to 1994.

Mr Green, who will also be accredited as High Commissioner to Tuvalu and Nauru, takes up his position in November, replacing Adrian Simcock.
