Minister for Small Business, John Tamihere, welcomed the 2004 Business New Zealand/KPMG Compliance Cost Survey as another useful addition to the compliance cost debate.

“Without robust studies, we can’t have a genuine debate on these issues.”

“This report forms part of a compendium of very good information we now have about business development and compliance costs. It very much adds to the great work that the [Small Business Advisory Group](http://www.med.govt.nz/irdev/ind_dev/sbag/) presented the government with earlier in the week” he said.

Although it was too early to make an informed comment on the findings, the Minister was pleased to see that the survey reported an overall reduction in the monetary costs of compliance since the 2003 study.

“It is heartening to see, given this government’s commitment to reducing compliance costs, that the monetary cost of compliance has come down between the studies”, the Minister said.

Although perceptions of compliance were up, the Minister noted that overall, this was a positive report.

“I acknowledge that the perception is that compliance has increased, but the numbers aren’t there to back that up. I am keen to investigate this further, and I will continue to commit to further reducing the compliance load for New Zealand businesses” he said.
