A new condensed guide to the Treaty of Waitangi claims settlement process will provide New Zealanders with a concise guide to settling treaty claims, Treaty Negotiations Minister Margaret Wilson said today.

The Office of Treaty Settlements will today launch a condensed edition of the guide to the Treaty of Waitangi claims settlement process, Healing the past, building a future, popularly known as the Red Book.

"The summary edition of this guide has been produced in response to increased interest in the treaty settlement process," Margaret Wilson said.

"Healing the past, building a future was originally published by the Office of Treaty settlements for those who work directly with Treaty settlement issues, such as officials, claimant negotiators and their advisers. The edition being launched today is designed with the general public in mind.

“It provides an overview of the historical background to grievances and settlement; explains the policy and process for settling claims; and gives an outline of what settlement redress might involve. It will be a useful resource for all New Zealanders interested in Treaty settlement issues.”

Margaret Wilson said the guide supplements the work of the Treaty of Waitangi Information Programme, and is designed to be included in information kits about the Treaty.

The summary edition of Healing the past, building a future is being launched at the Office of Treaty Settlements at 4pm today.

It is the first bilingual government publication about the settlement process since 1994.
