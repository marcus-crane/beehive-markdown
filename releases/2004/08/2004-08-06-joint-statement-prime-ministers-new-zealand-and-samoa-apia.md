The Prime Minister of New Zealand , Rt Hon Helen Clark, and the Prime Minister of Samoa, Hon Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, met in Apia today to discuss a range of bilateral and regional issues.

The Prime Ministers noted the importance of immigration issues in the bilateral relationship. A number of potential improvements in this area were discussed and final announcements on a set of reforms will be made in coming weeks.

The New Zealand Government’s response to the Select Committee Report on the Samoan Citizenship petition was also discussed. The discussions highlighted the importance of strengthening the 1962 Treaty of Friendship through practical consultative and cooperative mechanisms. The Prime Ministers agreed that annual high-level whole-of-government consultations at Ministerial level would constitute an important new development in their bilateral relationship, and would ensure that issues of mutual concern and interest were effectively addressed.

Samoan and New Zealand officials will meet in Apia in September to discuss the agenda for the initial round whole of government consultations which are likely to be held later in the year. The New Zealand Government would be updating the New Zealand Parliament on the progress made in this area when it reports back its response the Select Committee Report on the Citizenship Petition later this month.

The two Prime Ministers, who are the outgoing and incoming chairs of the Pacific Island Forum, underlined their strong commitment to the strengthening of the Forum to promote more effective regional cooperation. Along with other Pacific Island Leaders they will be participating in discussions in Apia over the next two days to make progress in this area, particularly through the implementation of the Pacific Plan.
