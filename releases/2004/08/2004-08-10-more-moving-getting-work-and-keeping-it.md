Work and Income have secured jobs for 30 per cent more people than aimed for during the 2003–04 financial year, Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment Rick Barker announced today.

Work and Income placed 52,000 people into jobs, 8000 above target for the last financial year. The biggest achievement was in the group unemployed for up to 26 weeks, where WINZ moved 29,388 people into work for 3 months or more.

" Imagine Eden Park Stadium full to overflowing and that's how many people have moved into jobs in a year – this helps raise a lot of families and children out of poverty. The kids can get their rugby boots or perhaps a bicycle and there's money to go around.

“This result is especially satisfying because there's a third less on Work and Income books to draw from and these great results mean employers understand that Work and Income can provide people keen to work with a good work ethic," Mr Barker said.

Mr Barker says he is also very pleased to see that people who have been out of work for a long time have found jobs.

"It's a great result for Work & Income to have found jobs for 22,870 people who've been out of work for 6 months or more, some of whom had been unemployed for over 2 years.

"These statistics show that several Government initiatives to get all kiwis working are paying off.

"The $104.5m Job Jolt package, kicked off by the 2003 Budget, helps skill up jobseekers by providing IT training, employment coaching, and gaining other work skills and the 2 year Pacific Wave Strategy, targeted to get work for Pacific peoples, is part of a wider government focus that aims to raise every waka or boat," said Rick Barker.

Work and Income exceeded targets for Maori, Maori youth and Pacific youth and achieved the expected target for Pacific youth. Client satisfaction for the level of service at contact centres was 91 percent.
