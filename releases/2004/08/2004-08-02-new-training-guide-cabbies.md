A new training module designed to help taxi drivers understand the unique and varied needs of passengers with disabilities, was launched at Parliament today.

The Totally Mobile training resource was welcomed by Transport Minister Pete Hodgson and Disability Issues Minister Ruth Dyson as an exciting tool for the taxi industry and for passengers with special needs.

“This is a great resource that will benefit both drivers and passengers. This module sets a high benchmark for best practice within the industry, and seeks national consistency in that standard,” Pete Hodgson said.

“This certainly shows that the taxi industry is serious about providing a professional service that all passengers can rely on wherever they are in New Zealand,” he said.

Ruth Dyson said the government’s Disability Strategy provides the framework for achieving an inclusive society where people are not disabled by lack of access to the things that others take for granted.

“This includes things like affordable, accessible, safe and appropriate transport. The Taxi Federation’s resource helps to achieve this for passengers with disabilities because it borrows from the experiences of both passengers and drivers,” Ruth Dyson said.

“I’m also impressed that while the training resource will only initially be available to Taxi Federation members, it will eventually be made available to all taxi drivers. This shows the Taxi Federation’s commitment to improving the standard of service provided by all drivers, regardless of membership,” she said.
