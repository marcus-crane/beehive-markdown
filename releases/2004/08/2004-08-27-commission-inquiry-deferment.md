Attorney General Margaret Wilson today received a report from the Commission of Inquiry into Police conduct, seeking deferment of the commission’s final report.

“The request for deferment came because of concerns about a possible conflict between the Commission of Inquiry and Police investigations into whether some police officers should be prosecuted,” Margaret Wilson said.

“While I am concerned about delays, I understand the need to balance the commission’s investigations into non-criminal issues and the Police investigation into those who may face criminal prosecution.

“I intend to meet with the Commission of Inquiry in late October to assess what progress the Police have made with their investigation and to discuss a way forward for the commission.

“In the meantime, I want to assure those who have laid complaints with the commission that they will be heard. By the end of October everyone should be in a better position to assess the path forward for the Commission of Inquiry.”
