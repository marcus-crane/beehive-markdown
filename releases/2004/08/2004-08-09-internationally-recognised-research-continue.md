The [Competent Children research](http://www.nzcer.org.nz/default.php?cPath=130_166&products_id=232) is to be [extended to 16 year-olds](www.minedu.govt.nz/go/cc12) to give an ongoing understanding of the importance of quality early childhood education and other factors on students' later success in education, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

"Additional funding of $545,000 will extend this research which was launched in 1993, and follows some 500 students from a random selection of early-childhood centres in the Wellington region," Trevor Mallard said.

"The study provides us with a rare picture of the effects of high quality early childhood education and of home and school experiences on a range of students' competencies.

"The latest Competent Children research that I have released today shows that the children at the age of 12 who have high quality early childhood education are better readers and mathematicians than those whose early childhood education was of a lower standard.

"This was true after discounting for family income or parental education levels.

"The research also finds that these gaps widen as the children get older, which provides further proof of the educational benefits of quality early childhood education.

"While similar studies are occurring overseas in Britain, the United States and Sweden, this New Zealand research is nationally and internationally regarded as a flagship study of early childhood education in New Zealand.

"Our government wants to ensure more families and children benefit from quality early childhood education. From 2007 we will provide 20 hours a week free education for all three and four year-olds at all community-based teacher-led early childhood education centres, while from next year we will also provide significant funding to help all centres pay for the costs of hiring qualified staff."

The extension of the research to 16 year-olds would also provide government with useful information and understanding in five areas:

- students’ engagement in senior secondary school;
- achievement at the senior secondary level;
- the long-term impact of transitions across school levels;
- student experiences of the National Certificate of Educational Achievement; and
- student development of, and basis for, post-school aspirations.
