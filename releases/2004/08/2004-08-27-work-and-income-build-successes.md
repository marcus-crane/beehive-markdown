Launching [Work and Income’s Regional Plans for 2004/2005](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/publications/regional-plans.html), Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment Rick Barker applauded the commitment and vision shown by the department.

“ [Work and Income](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz) placed 52,000 people into jobs last financial year, 8,000 above its target. This is due to a robust economy, the strong relationships being built between industry and Work and Income, and the upskilling of clients.

"Work and Income [Regional Commissioners](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/about-us/regions/index.html)’ relationships with their community and local employers means they understand local labour market needs, leading to improved training opportunities and greater success in matching people to jobs.”

“Work and Income is clearly in synch with each region’s needs.

“The [Jobs Jolt](http://www.msd.govt.nz/media-information/jobs-jolt-update-2004-fact-sheets/jobs-jolt-factsheets-index.html) package is providing excellent opportunities to upskill and retrain people, as well as linking them to employers who offer career paths and skills that will serve people well in the modern labour market for many years to come.

"People are far happier in work. I've met single mums recently who are very pleased with the extra help coming for childcare assistance and being able to retain some level of an accommodation benefit. They want to work to keep skills, have more money and also enjoy the social benefits of work.

“Since the [DPB reforms were introduced in March last year](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F16190), around 59 per cent are taking education, training and employment steps. And more sole parents are going off benefit into work. In March 1997, 19 percent of DPB sole parents left benefit for work, compared with 36 percent in March of this year.

"A [low unemployment figure of only 4 per cent](http://www.stats.govt.nz/domino/external/pasfull/pasfull.nsf/web/Hot+Off+The+Press+Household+Labour+Force+Survey+June+2004+quarter?open) shows that initiatives such as investment in industry training, modern apprenticeships and a focus on Maori and Pacific people's employment are already paying off ”, said Rick Barker.

**Background: Work and Income Regional Plans for 2004/05**

The Regional Plans focus on the following three key priority areas:

- Sustainable Employment - the aim is to enable people to achieve economic independence throughout their working life.
- Social Development - taking a ‘whole of life’ approach to address the underlying causes to social and economic inclusion in order to enable New Zealanders to participate in their communities.
- Service Excellence - services to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of Work and Income regions.

This year’s plans reinforce the Ministry’s position as a key player in the Government’s overall social development strategy. Each Work and Income region has developed strategies and initiatives to respond to the needs of its clients and local labour market.

Regional highlights include:

**Northland**: Northland Intersectoral Forum (NIF)  
The Forum plays a key role in leading and promoting cross-agency initiatives. Made up of regional managers with the ability to make decisions and allocate funds, NIF also leads cross-agency thinking and encourages managers to consider issues outside their own organisation’s remit.

**Auckland**: Papakura’s Youth Transitions Project  
This Project is a partnership between Work and Income, Papakura District Council, Papakura High School, the Tertiary Education Commission, training providers and employers.

In a three month period, 62 young people were assisted, with 27 taking up full-time work, 17 entering training, 11 in work experience or casual work, four returning to school and three starting part-time work.

**Waikato**: Te Ara Tika strategy  
This strategy has been operating in Huntly and Ngaruawahia since April 2004 and involves a team of specialists who work with Maori clients receiving an Unemployment Benefit. The team develops relationships with community organisations, training providers, employers and other stakeholders in order to create opportunities that will lead to sustainable employment for these clients.

**East Coast**: Social and Economic Wellbeing Report Card  
This region is developing an evaluative tool called ‘The Social and Economic Wellbeing Report Card’ which will enable them to measure and identify trends in social well-being on an annual basis. This will allow the East Coast community to measure the progress being made in the achievement of social development by measuring the progress and trends in social well-being.

**Bay of Plenty**: Industry Partnerships  
Continued and new partnerships with employers will be developed to enable recruitment, pre-employment training and on the job training to be identified and provided to clients. This will ensure that they have the very best opportunities to firstly obtain employment and then be well positioned to move into higher quality positions.

**Taranaki**: Taranaki Connections Youth Transitions Programme  
This programme supports young people as they leave college and transition into employment or further training. The programme is based around Waitara High School students and offers case management and mentoring support for up to five years after leaving school, with the expectation that they will either be employed or undertake further training or education.

**Central**: Industry Specific Training  
This region will provide training for job seekers that is tailored to meet the skill needs of both employers and job seekers, particularly in meat processing, retailing, hospitality, and a variety of trade related industries.

**Wellington**: Industry Specific Local Government Collaboration  
The Wellington region has aligned its strategic and operational activities with the goals of the region’s four councils’ Long Term Community and Council Plans (LTCCPs). This collaborative approach between agencies will ensure local needs are addressed in a co-ordinated and resource efficient way.

**Nelson**: Seasonal Employment  
Seasonal work is a major source of employment across the region. Specific strategies have been developed to respond to industry peaks and because of labour shortages; the region is investigating ways to make seasonal work more sustainable for both their clients and seasonal employers.

**Canterbury**: Collaborative Ngai Tahu  
The Canterbury region is working closely with Ngai Tahu who is a large employer with numerous employment and commercial opportunities. The region is also evaluating a joint approach with He Oranga Pounamu (iwi mandated Trust). Both relationships will be aligned to dedicated case management to support enhanced employment outcomes for Maori.

**Southern**: Youth Transitions Implementation Project (YTIP)  
Southern region’s YTIP is a co-ordinated strategic approach to ‘at risk’ youth that will aim to inform school leavers about career choices, assist with their personal and skill development, and create a continuum between their transition from school to work. The key objective of YTIP is to change the mindsets of youth so that they participate in the community through work - for life.

*Note that many of these initiatives have equivalents in other regions.*
