A media report about a pilot programme to develop government agency protocols dealing with released child sex offenders to reduce reoffending ignores the most important features of its findings and is misleading.

Corrections Minister Paul Swain said the Dunedin pilot was successful because it strengthened inter-agency information sharing about the offenders and improved relationships.

"The fact is that this better information sharing meant two offenders who were part of the trial were charged with breaching release conditions and were dealt with. These new protocols mean there is earlier identification of risk situations, which in turn means public safety is improved."

The pilot also identified differences of opinion surrounding what information could be shared among government agencies.

Because of this, the government changed the law to remove all doubt that government agencies can share information on sex offenders to reduce reoffending without breaching the Privacy Act.

"This pilot was a success because it found out what works and what doesn't. There is no doubt the pilot played its part in improving public safety in Dunedin."

The model used in this pilot will be the basis for similar regimes around the country.

All agencies fully participated in the trial when this was required to properly monitor the offenders. Claims that there was not full participation from the Ministry of Social Development and Housing New Zealand, Police, Child Youth and Family and Department of Corrections are plainly wrong, Paul Swain said.
