A $1.3 million project to improve bus services in and around Auckland Central was welcomed today by Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard.

Judith Tizard said Transfund had agreed to provide $690,000 towards the cost of the Auckland City Council project, which will see the creation of priority lanes for buses in key destinations around central Auckland.

"This project is a major boost for public transport in Auckland which will deliver better services, more buses and fewer delays. I am delighted that Transfund and the Auckland City Council have been able to work together to advance this important initiative."

The project will connect Britomart and Newmarket and increase the number of buses servicing the hospital and university from 240 to 1340 per day, benefiting about 29,000 people. To reduce travel times, access to Grafton Bridge will be limited to buses only between 7am and 7pm.

Judith Tizard said the government was committed to working with local government to deliver sustainable transport solutions for Auckland, including investments in public transport.

"The government is making record investments in Auckland transport, including over $91 million for public transport, traffic demand management, rail and barging over the next year.

"Public transport needs to be part of the solution to Auckland's transport problems. Giving greater priority to bus services is just one of the ways we can make our existing transport networks more efficient and environmentally friendly."
