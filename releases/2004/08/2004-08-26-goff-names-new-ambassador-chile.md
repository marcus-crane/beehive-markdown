New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Chile will be career diplomat Nigel Fyfe, Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced today.

“Chile is one of New Zealand's longest standing friends in Latin America. There are wide-ranging contacts between the two governments, between business, education and research institutes, and between our indigenous peoples," Mr Goff said.

“We work closely with Chile in a wide range of international forums, such as the environment, Antarctica, disarmament, UN issues and trade policy.

“To further deepen this relationship, both governments as well as Singapore are currently negotiating a closer economic partnership (CEP) – the Pacific Three or P3 agreement."

Mr Fyfe will also be accredited as Ambassador to Colombia and Peru. New Zealand has a longstanding relationship with Peru and works closely with it on a number of international issues.

Mr Fyfe was until recently Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s Legal Division, and was previous posted in New York (the United Nations) and Brussels. He takes up his appointment in December, replacing Richard Mann, who is returning to Wellington.
