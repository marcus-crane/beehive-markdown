Don Brash’s plan to cut the pension has received a boost with the leader of National’s support party, Rodney Hide, seeking a 10 per cent cut to national superannuation.

In a recent speech to the Australian Defence College and Centre for Defence and Strategic Studies Rodney Hide argued for a 10 per cent cut in welfare spending, including national superannuation, to generate additional revenue to spend on defence. National leader Don Brash has also floated cutting superannuation eligibility in the past and the party continues to dither over whether it would keep the New Zealand Superannuation Fund.

Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said it was clear pensions would be targeted by a National-Act government.

“Rodney Hide has destroyed National’s sordid attempt to keep a lid on their plans to cut the pension. His comments to an international audience cannot be miscontrued – Act would push for pensioners to live on the breadline so he and Don Brash could tee up photo opportunities with fighter pilots.

“The country has been wondering why National has dithered for so long on what they would do with the multi-billion dollar New Zealand Superannuation Fund. Rodney Hide has unwittingly smoked them out – despite National’s denials, they are planning pension cuts again.

“The Labour-led government believes that retired New Zealanders deserve the dignity afforded by a secure pension set at a liveable rate.

“Don Brash must pull Rodney Hide back in to line immediately and state once and for all what National’s superannuation policy actually is,” Steve Maharey said.
