More help from the Government is available for people affected by the recent floods, earthquakes, and landslides in the Bay of Plenty, Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton, Social Development Minister Steve Maharey, and Civil Defence Minister George Hawkins said today.

Ministers approved an additional package of measures today, including agricultural recovery, repairing schools, fixing roads and giving direct help to low income earners and people who had to be evacuated.

This brings the total Government support to an estimated $30 million.

Mr Hawkins said there will be further support added to this later, when other response costs and Council infrastructure repair costs are known.

“The Government has worked with Whakatane and Opotiki District Councils and voluntary, farming and business groups to identify what help is needed to support these areas in their recovery work.”

Mr Sutton said the floods had been a major disaster for the eastern Bay of Plenty region. They had dealt a serious blow to economic infrastructure and caused devastation to communities.

“The Government is under no illusion as to the severity of the event. The flooding caused widespread damage to roads, bridges and other infrastructure, devastated farms and other rural activities, ruined houses and threatened the livelihoods of many people."

Mr Maharey, visiting the Bay of Plenty today, said that at the peak of the flood approximately 12,000 hectares of land were flooded. There are approximately 3,200 evacuees, but none remain in evacuation centres. It is estimated that 210 homes have been flooded or affected by landslides in the Bay of Plenty and of these 188 are unsuitable for occupation, at least in the short term. A few are likely to be condemned.

For further information on available assistance, persons affected by the Bay of Plenty flood should contact the flood helpline on 0800 779997 or go to www.workandincome.govt.nz.

DETAILS OF THE INTEGRATED ASSISTANCE PACKAGE

·Caring for the Displaced - To help with the immediate cost of caring for people that needed to be evacuated, an advanced payment of $100,000 will be made to Whakatane District Council and $50,000 to Opotiki District Council.

·Re-establishment Grants for Low-income Earners - Government will be helping low-income households with the cost of re-establishing or re-locating on a case-by-case basis. This will help to either replace essential items like refrigerators, beds, and washing machines or to help relocate to new accommodation. This will be in the form of non-recoverable grants, from the Ministry of Social Development. Eligibility will be subject to an income and asset test and will take into account assistance available from other sources, such as public donations. For those eligible, the average payment is expected to be $2,000. The total cost of this initiative is expected to be $464,000 in 2004/05.

·Relief from Tax Interest and Penalties – Use-of-money interest, late payment penalties, and late filing penalties will be remitted for those severely affected by the flood. IRD will be able to accept late estimates of provisional tax. In addition to these measures, deductions will be allowed for tax losses on commercial buildings that have been destroyed and gifts of trading stock and consumables will not be income to the donor.

·Rates Remission – Central Government will enable rates remission by compensating Councils for the cost. This should help income-generating properties recover from damages caused by the floods.

·Rural/Farming -  
oAgricultural Recovery Programme - An Agricultural Recovery Programme will be established to assist the agricultural sector. This will include $6.3 million in 2004/05 and $480,000 in 2005/06 to cover 75% of cost to restore the integrity of uninsurable, damaged property. As a part of this programme, the threshold for damage will be set at 10% of total damage or $5,000, whichever is the greater. Assistance will be provided for the transport of stock back to farms. More detailed information will be provided to the affected farmers/orchardists. The programme includes:  
§Property Restoration – Government will provide farmers/orchardists with assistance to remove silt, re-grass, rebuild boundary fences, re-establish essential access, races, water supply, and drainage, remove debris, and restore lost crops.  
§New Start Grants – Government will be offering New Start Grants to farmers/orchardists who are forced off of their properties due to flood damage so they leave with $65,000 equity.  
§Rural Support Trust – Government will be providing dollar-for-dollar contributions for the creation of a Rural Support Trust, which will provide assistance to the affected communities.  
§Reimburse Federated Farmers – Reimbursement of 50% of public good activities (to a maximum of $11,125 (GST inclusive)  
oIncome Support – The Ministry of Social Development is providing income support to affected farmers/orchardists through rural assistance payments, for those who are eligible. These payments provide 75% of the applicable rate of unemployment benefit to help with essential living costs while the farm is producing little or no income. These payments will be available until 31 December 2004 with an estimated cost of $192,000. Prior to this date, ongoing need will be assessed.  
oAgricultural Recovery Facilitators - The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) are appointing four Agricultural Recovery Facilitators to assist the affected agricultural communities.  
oTechnology Transfer Programme – The Agricultural Recovery Facilitators will help to establish a programme that will allow farmers/orchardists affected by the floods to access and share technology and information through shared meetings, field days, and other group activities.  
oIncome Tax – Deductions will be allowed for tax losses on destroyed farming land improvements and legislation will be amended to support new start grants.

·A Conduit to Help for Maori Communities – Four community recovery workers will be appointed to work in coordination with the recovery office and will provide support to Maori communities throughout the Whakatane and Opotiki districts.

·Enhanced Task Force Green - To assist the affected communities, the Minister of Social Development has approved an enhanced version of Task Force Green, providing a source of income for many, as well as an excellent resource to the region’s agricultural sector. This is expected to provide employment in clean-up operations for approximately 200 people at an estimated cost of $2.1 million.

·Infrastructure - Repairs to roading remain a top priority. Districts have incurred an estimated $5.5 million of damage to roads. Transit NZ and Transfund are liaising with the Councils to develop a prioritised work programme for roading. Early estimates of Transit NZ costs place repairs of State Highways between $3.5 - 5 million and Transfund estimate a cost to the Crown of $4.4 million to help councils fund the repair of local roads within the Rotorua, Whakatane, and Opotiki Districts. Government may partially reimburse councils for their costs in repairing water, sewerage, storm water, and some river systems.

·Housing - Assessment of the homes damaged by the floods remains a priority. The affected District Councils are in the process of identifying the numbers of uninsured and/or under insured homes that have been affected. Prior to the flooding, earthquakes, and landslides in July 2004, the Rural Housing Programme monitored substandard housing in rural sections of the Bay of Plenty. This programme may provide some low-income owner-occupiers with assistance to cover the costs of repairing damages that pose an immediate health or safety risk.

·Reimbursement of Response Costs – In addition to the costs incurred in caring for the displaced, councils may be partially reimbursed for other response costs spent on reducing the immediate danger to human life during the emergency and costs for other activities needed to address the emergency response.

·Recovery Coordination – The Ministry of Social Development has established two one-stop-shop recovery information centres, which are being used by a wide variety of organisations to assist with recovery efforts. An 0800 floodline (0800-779-997) is providing integrated welfare services. A recovery facilitator (Peter Davies) has been appointed to coordinate recovery activities of all of the agencies involved in the event. An additional appointment of an operations/logistics coordinator has also been approved to the Edgecumbe centre.

·Mayoral Relief Fund - On 20 July 2004, a payment of $20,000 each was approved for the Whakatane and Opotiki Mayoral Relief Trust Funds to assist those affected. In addition to this initial payment, the Minister of Civil Defence, Hon George Hawkins, announced that the Government will match, dollar for dollar, any money collected from the public by the combined Whakatane and Opotiki Mayoral Relief Funds, up until 6 September 2004.

·Conservation Estate - The Department of Conservation will be undertaking emergency work to clear any danger to private homes at Ohope from overhanging rock, soil and trees in the Conservation Estate in Bay of Plenty.

·Civil Defence Payments - In addition to the normal levels of support offered, the Ministry of Social Development is making Civil Defence payments to help with essential living costs while evacuees are out of their homes. These cover immediate needs including alternative accommodation (including costs for people lodging evacuees), food and clothing and loss of livelihood for those who are unable to work due to the flooding. Eligibility for these payments is not subject to an income or asset test. As of 3 August 2,239 grants had been made representing expenditure of $385,979.
