High speed internet for isolated areas is a step closer with a preferred supplier chosen for the Project PROBE satellite option, Education Minister Trevor Mallard and Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton announced today.

Project PROBE (Provincial Broadband Extension) is a multi-million dollar government investment to boost education and economic development through the delivery of broadband technology to regional New Zealand.

ICONZ has been selected to provide the satellite service to supply high-speed broadband to some 60 remote New Zealand schools and their communities and a contract will be signed as soon as practical.

"Our government sees Project PROBE as a critical infrastructure investment, ensuring students and families, businesspeople and workers have the same opportunities in education and in economic development, regardless of where they live and work. It’s an important part of our strategy to grow a more innovative economy," Trevor Mallard said.

"This is a real plus for remote schools giving them access to digital resources, discussion forums and online classrooms that can link teachers and students across the country. This means there’s a wider curriculum choice and expansion of e-learning opportunities."

Jim Anderton said that as a new Project PROBE provider ICONZ was further expanding competition in the broadband market across the country.

"This is an attractive option for meeting the needs of communities around a number of remote schools and is suitable for use in Canterbury's Waiau Valley, Haast on the West Coast and the Chatham Islands," Jim Anderton said.

Information Technology Minister Paul Swain said broadband broke down the digital divide between metropolitan and rural communities and this was an important part of the Labour-Progressive government's strategy to produce a more innovative and successful economy for every community.

**ICONZ**  
ICONZ is proposing a community coverage option where a single satellite terminal becomes the basis of a community wireless coverage service.

ICONZ is offering a flexible bandwidth on demand service, which gives schools the ability to use video conferencing without the requirement for full time subscription to expensive satellite bandwidth.

**What is Project PROBE?**  
Project PROBE is a major government initiative. Project PROBE stands for Provincial Broadband Extension and has been developed jointly by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Economic Development.

Project PROBE will see broadband networks extended to some 900 schools throughout New Zealand; ensuring broadband is available to some 2700 schools and some 750,000 students nationwide.

Project PROBE is expected to extend broadband coverage to 95 per cent of households.

**What is broadband?**  
Broadband is the name given to two way high-speed, high-capacity, always connected form of telecommunications. It offers a unique opportunity to countries with low population densities such as New Zealand in addressing quality and timely healthcare access and equity issues across the spectrum of health information, health commerce and telemedicine applications.  
To illustrate the capabilities of broadband, the following table presents the time it takes to transfer a typical X-ray image from the internet to a personal computer using different telecommunication types.

**What are the benefits of having high-speed internet access?**  
Rural businesses will be able to tap into the same internet capability as businesses in the cities. Broadband is a major tool for businesses in terms of accessing information, opening up new international markets, and driving increased efficiency through e-commerce.

Broadband internet opens up huge opportunities for students and schools in isolated country regions – opportunities that students in urban areas already have. Through broadband students in Wairoa will have access to the same information as students in Wellington or New York. Broadband-enabled two-way video conferencing can allow school subjects like advanced sciences, mathematics and te Reo to be taught to learners in very remote schools.

The extension of broadband coverage will also bring enhanced benefits to rural communities in the form of improved access to health and social services and to a range of other public services and information already on the internet.

**How much is Project PROBE costing?**  
The tender process remains commercially sensitive and while it is still in progress no figures for the overall cost of the project will be released.

**How does Project PROBE work?**  
Fourteen geographical regions have been established throughout New Zealand, with a 15th region to provide national satellite coverage for those schools where a terrestrial solution would be impractical.

The 14 regions are: Northland, Auckland, Bay of Plenty, Waikato, Hawkes Bay/Gisborne, Taranaki, Manawatu/Wanganui, Wairarapa, Wellington/Kapiti/Horowhenua, Nelson/Tasman/Marlborough, West Coast, Canterbury (including Chatham Islands), Otago, and Southland.

Three regions – Southland, Wairarapa and Northland, elected to proceed with independent tendering processes with the understanding that, provided government objectives for Project PROBE were met, funding from the PROBE project would be available to meet at least some of their costs.

**When will the other contracts be signed?**  
Preferred suppliers have been selected for all the Project PROBE regions and the satellite option. Final contracts with the two independent regions Wairarapa and Northland and for the satellite option are expected to be signed as soon as practical.

**Is Project PROBE still on target to have broadband coverage throughout New Zealand by the end of 2004?**  
While contract negotiations have taken longer than originally anticipated it is expected that most schools and their communities will have access to broadband by the end of 2004.
