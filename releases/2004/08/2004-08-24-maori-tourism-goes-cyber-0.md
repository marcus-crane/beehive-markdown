Associate Tourism Minister, Dover Samuels will be launching the new Maori Tourism website in Taupo at the New Zealand Tourism Conference tonight and believes it will be an important tool for attracting more overseas visitors to our unique country.

Overseas tourists will be able to log on to the Maori tourism website which will provide them with instant up to date information on Maori tourism operators and opportunities.

"We know that tourists are constantly seeking authentic cultural experiences and this website will be one way of targeting the interactive traveller," says Dover Samuels.

It will offer a variety of web based services which will benefit all users including operators and tourists.

From a government point of view this site will be used as a key link to highlight future Maori tourism initiatives.

The Minister of Tourism, Mark Burton has also welcomed the news that the Maori Tourism website is up and running.

“For our overseas visitors who may have little or no understanding of New Zealand culture this is an exciting and positive means of them getting useful information,” he said.

“People will be able to use this as a tool to assist their trip planning as well as a means of understanding more of our country. And I expect that New Zealanders will also find much in it that is useful in planning their own trips around New Zealand.”

Tourism is a large part of New Zealand's economy and is expecting continued growth over the next decade. Last year the industry earned the country over $15.2 billion with $6.4 billion coming from international arrivals.

"After taking a sneak preview at the website I am impressed with its layout and design. Given its user-friendly plan I am confident that Maori tourism operators and visitors will utilise the website to benefit the industry and enhance our reputation as a leading overseas destination," said Mr Samuels.

“If you are a Maori tourism operator and your business is not currently listed on the site then I urge you to get on it, registration is free of charge.”
