Acting Maori Affairs Minister John Tamihere today applauded new figures showing Maori unemployment is now the lowest since current records began.

The Household Labour Force Survey out today shows Maori unemployment for the June quarter is at 8.8 per cent – the lowest since the HLFS started 18 years ago.

Maori unemployment fell from 9.4 per cent in the last quarter, and was down from  
10.4 per cent at the same time last year.

Mr Tamihere welcomed the figures, saying they confirmed the trend for more Maori to be participating in work, study and training.

"The key to the success of this generation and future generations of Maori is their participation in the economic success of this nation. This government is committed to policies that deliver jobs, skills and economic development for Maori, and these figures are the proof that these policies are working for Maori."
