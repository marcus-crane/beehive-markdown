The Pastoral Greenhouse Gas research Consortium (PGGRC) was today congratulated on the publication of its first annual report by Minister of Agriculture, Jim Sutton, and Convenor, Ministerial Group on Climate Change, Pete Hodgson.

The report details ten principal areas of work which together give significant impetus towards achieving the principle aims of the PGGRC; to reduce greenhouse gas emission and to increase productivity in the agriculture sector.

"It is pleasing to see this area of climate change policy now settled and preparing to deliver real environmental and economic benefits," says Pete Hodgson.
