Minister for Transport Safety, Hon Harry Duynhoven says the approval for the Aviation Security Service to establish an ICAO Sub-Regional Aviation Security Training Centre, is an acknowledgement of the professionalism of the Service.

The Aviation Security Service will offer specialist aviation security training to other ICAO member States in the Asia/Pacific region. The training centre will be based in Auckland.

ICAO, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, is a specialist agency of the United Nations. For almost sixty years it has been responsible for the development of standards and recommended practices for the operation of the world’s civil aviation system. New Zealand is one of 187 countries who are ICAO member States.

“This is a boost for New Zealand aviation security. It also dovetails with the Service's ongoing commitment to enhancing aviation security in the South Pacific, as expressed through many recent and longer-term Service-run projects funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade Pacific Security Fund.”

“I offer my congratulations to the Aviation Security Service. This announcement recognises the important international role the Service makes toward contributing to the safety and security of the world’s skies”, says Mr Duynhoven.
