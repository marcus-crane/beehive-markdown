A Water Conservation Order to preserve the natural state of the Motueka River has been approved by the government, Environment Minister Marian Hobbs said today.

"Parts of the Upper Motueka River and other tributaries are to be retained in their natural state for their wild and scenic features," Marian Hobbs said.

Among its many outstanding features are special parts of the Motueka River, Wangapeka River, the Rolling River and the Skeet River, which will be protected to retain the natural habitat for blue ducks and the brown trout fishery. The Order also protects specific streams in the Arthur Range because of the scientific and recreational values associated with the Karst geological formations.

"It is important that these characteristics are protected by the Order so that everyone, now and future generations, can enjoy the many natural features of the river," Marian Hobbs said.

The Order will be gazetted on Thursday 26 August 2004 and come into force on 24 September 2004.

The Order also restricts certain activities, including damming and altering river flows and quality, which would have a detrimental effect on the Motueka River.

But it will not prevent the exercise of current consents and water can still be taken for domestic needs, the needs of animals and fire fighting.

Marian Hobbs acknowledged the length of time the process had taken since the original application for an order in 1990 by the then Nelson Acclimatisation Society (now the Nelson Marlborough Fish and Game Council) and the Council of South Island Acclimatisation Societies (now the New Zealand Fish and Game Council).

The minister congratulated all the parties involved in the public process for their work in reaching agreement on the content of the order.
