Associate Social Development and Employment Minister Rick Barker today congratulated the first groups of modern public service cadets to graduate before they embarked on new careers as case managers with Work and Income.

“Of the 109 cadets nationwide in the initial intake, 41 have just graduated in Napier (3), Wellington (16 ), Nelson (3), Canterbury (9) and Southern (10) after an intensive five-week orientation and training programme. These cadets, and others to follow, will now take up employment as case mangers at Work and Income service centres.

“The new case managers will also study toward a Certificate in Client Management, a nationally recognised tertiary qualification. This will allow them to pursue a career in the public sector with quality training linked to the Modern Apprenticeship scheme.”

The Government launched the new public service cadetship programme for school leavers in conjunction with the Ministry of Social Development in November 2003. It reinstates a career path disestablished after the state sector reforms of the 1980s.

Mr Barker said the cadetship programme reinforced the Government’s commitment to provide a strong public service and help young people make a successful transition from school to work.

“Once, young people had a clear career path in the public sector but that was removed some time ago. The new cadetship programme re-establishes that path and once again the state and young people will benefit.”

Just over 50 percent of those chosen for the first cadetship intake were themselves previous Work and Income clients.

Mr Barker said the Ministry of Social Development had a central role in helping young people into employment and would therefore take on cadets each year.

“The challenge now is for other government agencies and local authorities to demonstrate their commitment to investing in the future of young people and do likewise.”
