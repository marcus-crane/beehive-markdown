Allegations about the undercover police programme will not be included in the Commission of Inquiry into the handling of complaints of sexual misconduct by police, says Attorney-General Margaret Wilson.

"The allegations that have been made relating to the undercover police programme are serious and need to be investigated.

"This is a matter for the police, however, and I understand that the Police Commissioner will be undertaking such an investigation."
