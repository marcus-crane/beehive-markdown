The launch of the [Maori Television Service](http://www.maoritv.co.nz) this Sunday (28th March)will be an historical event for all New Zealanders according to Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia.

"This is a wonderful achievement and it will ensure an important part of our culture and heritage is maintained and readily accessible to a large part of the nation," said Parekura Horomia.

"I know the Maori Television Service will more than demonstrate its value and significance to the maturing of this nation.

"The promotional material shows that the producers have set themselves an extremely high standard and after visiting the station I am left in no doubt that all of those involved in Maori television are determined to ensure it will succeed.

"Maori television will bring into our homes Maori perspectives, heritage, culture, language and information of significance to all New Zealanders. This will be a vital tool in progressing comprehensive whanau, hapu, iwi and Maori community development," he said.

"The development of a Maori television service has long been the dream of many who have been actively involved in and committed to Maori broadcasting and Maori development.

"I acknowledge the difficulties that MTS has faced but I am also confident it will provide the country with a professional, informative and entertainment platform from a Maori perspective.

"I will be at the dawn ceremony this weekend and look forward to meeting all of the people involved in the channel," said Parekura Horomia.
