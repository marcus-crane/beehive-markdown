An [interactive online community](http://www.tki.org.nz/e/community/nzcurriculum/) giving teachers and educators throughout New Zealand the opportunity to discuss, debate and update the school curriculum was launched today by Education Minister Trevor Mallard.

"Students need an up-to-date curriculum that reflects the knowledge they require for the future and takes into account the best teaching strategies and learning theories available," Trevor Mallard said.

"Through online conversations, debates and brainstorming sessions teachers will be able to work together to develop clear statements about what it is essential for students to know and do by the time they leave school.

"Making sure the curriculum is relevant and meeting our students' needs will help us deliver on our government's goal of lifting education standards and making sure every single child has the opportunity to access a quality education.

"Initially teachers and educators will be asked to contribute ideas that encapsulate the fundamentals of each learning area and clearly state the most important learning outcomes for students.

"As people contribute their ideas, the discussions will be summarised and used by expert groups in each area to write draft outcome statements."

Trevor Mallard said the draft statements would then be circulated to all schools for further feedback.

Regional meetings to engage students, teachers and parents in the development process were planned from the middle of the year. The first meetings will be in June in Auckland and Christchurch. A new draft curriculum which draws together and builds on the developments of the last decade will be published mid 2005. After a final round of consultation, the final curriculum will be published in 2006.

"The site is already attracting widespread interest with some 1700 registrations from participants in the early childhood, primary, secondary and tertiary sector," Trevor Mallard said at today's launch at E-Vision in Wellington.
