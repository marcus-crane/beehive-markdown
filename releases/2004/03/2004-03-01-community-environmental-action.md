New ways to encourage community environmental projects will form part of a review of environment centre funding, Environment Minister Marian Hobbs said today.

"The number of centres is growing and funding at $300,000 annually is limited, so it's important that the money provided helps encourage community action in line with the government’s strategic objectives to establish a clean, green and sustainable environment," Marian Hobbs said. "The review will help determine this.

"The Ministry for the Environment has been funding environment centres since 2000. This review presents a valuable opportunity for the centres to engage with the ministry about future partnerships. The focus will be encouraging good outcomes for the environment where it matters most – in the community."

There are currently 25 centres in operation with an average of 10 receiving funding from the ministry in any given year. Some are long established, while others were set up with the support of ministry funding.

"The number of centres has increased dramatically in the last few years," Marian Hobbs said. "The review will help give us an accurate picture of the activities undertaken by the various centres.”

The review will look at the role of the centres, the service they perform for the community, and their effectiveness. All centres will be asked to contribute their views on future direction.

The review is expected to be completed in June 2004 and results made available by July 2004.
