Environment Minister Marian Hobbs tomorrow \[27 March] calls for suggestions and expressions of interest from the public for possible members of the [Waitaki Catchment](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/water/waitaki-catchment-dec03/index.html) Water Allocation Board.

“I am interested in gathering names of suitably qualified individuals with the necessary skills and experience for the very important job the Water Allocation Board will be tasked with,” Marian Hobbs said.

The Resource Management (Waitaki Catchment) Amendment Bill, currently before Parliament, proposes to create the Board to develop a water allocation framework for the Waitaki catchment with extensive public consultation.

A Panel of Commissioners is also proposed, to decide the significant resource consent applications in light of the framework and under the normal criteria in the Resource Management Act.

“I am notifying this call for potential Board members in advance of the passing of the legislation, so that I can establish the Board after Parliament enacts the Bill,” Marian Hobbs said.

“I am seeking suggestions from the public as a means of casting the net widely, as I want to identify the best candidates available. The independence of the Board will be enshrined in the legislation.”

Under the legislation, as reported back to Parliament by select committee, the Environment Minister will appoint between three and seven members to the Board.

“I am interested in individuals with a range of general attributes including the ability to critically assess and objectively probe information, and specific skill sets including judicial experience,” Marian Hobbs said.

Public notices will run tomorrow in leading national and local newspapers. Full details of Board member requirements and forms are available from the Ministry for the Environment.
