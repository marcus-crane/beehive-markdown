Legislation has been introduced to Parliament clarifying that a person will be able to stand for both a mayoralty and councillor position on the same council at this year’s local authority elections.

Local Government Minister Chris Carter said he was aware of some confusion among local body politicians as to whether a 2002 amendment to the Local Electoral Act 2001 had imposed a prohibition on candidacy for both positions.

"I told mayors at the Local Government Forum last year that I would clear this matter up because I did not believe it was an intended consequence of the 2002 amendment. The new Local Government Law Reform (No 3) Bill removes any uncertainty.

"The new Bill will also clear up some other grammatical and technical drafting matters in local government legislation that have been raised by councils. Some of these matters date back to 1995," Mr Carter said.

He said the Bill would also correct some drafting errors in the new Dog Control Act.

"These are minor changes that do not alter the intent of the law in anyway or create any new obligations on dog owners. They will simply clarify some issues for dog control officers."
