Associate Minister of Communications David Cunliffe today announced licensing proposals for Crown-managed spectrum suitable for wireless broadband services.

"The spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band can be used as an alternative to existing cable-based networks for telephony and high speed Internet connections." Mr Cunliffe said.

"Widespread availability of broadband services is a key objective of the government. New Zealand’s topography and widely spread population suits the use of wireless services. New Zealand businesses are leading the world in the innovative use of wireless technologies to deliver of services to remote and rural consumers.”

“This government has actively supported the extension of broadband services beyond the main centres through Project PROBE. This spectrum will help meet Project PROBE requirements, as well as supporting many other regional and community-based broadband projects.”

The spectrum will be managed by the Ministry of Economic Development on behalf of the Crown. It consists of two blocks of spectrum retained by the Crown at the time nation-wide rights to similar spectrum were auctioned in late 2002. Licences will be available for specific geographic areas.

Access to licences will be on a commercial basis, and restrictions on use and eligibility are proposed to promote use of the spectrum in accordance with the Government’s objectives.

Details of the licensing proposals are available from the Ministry’s website (www.med.govt.nz/rsm/spp/). Comments are invited from interested persons by 30 April 2004 to radiospectrum@med.govt.nz
