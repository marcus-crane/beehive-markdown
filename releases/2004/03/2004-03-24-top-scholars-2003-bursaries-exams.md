Top Scholars from the 2003 University Bursaries examinations were announced today by Education Minister Trevor Mallard.

Awards are made to top overall candidates, male and female, the top Maori and Pacific Island scholars, and the top candidate in each bursaries subject.

The overall Top Scholars are Victoria Taylor from Columba College, Dunedin, and Richard Yu from King's College, Auckland. These candidates scored the highest total marks from five bursaries subjects.

"Congratulations to all Top Scholars for their outstanding results. These young people were New Zealand's leading school leavers last year. To emerge at the top of the rankings in an academic challenge of this nature takes more than sheer talent, it takes dedication, determination and good support from teachers and families," Trevor Mallard said.

Trevor Mallard said this year’s awards marked the end of an era.

"This time next year we will be announcing award winners for outstanding achievement in the new New Zealand Scholarship.

"Our best students this year will receive a much tougher academic challenge than bursaries.

"The new Scholarship will test how well our very best senior students can integrate ideas across a subject in a way the bursaries examinations have not really been able to do. The level will be close to about stage one university level, and therefore the most challenging that New Zealand schools have ever seen.

"I encourage schools and parents to think carefully about setting appropriate targets for students. Challenges need to be demanding but realistic. I’d be surprised if more than about five percent of this year’s level 3 students in any one subject enter for Scholarship."

The new awards, which Trevor Mallard announced last year, are:

- **Two Top Overall Scholars in New Zealand Scholarship**  
  1st award $15,000 per year for three years  
  2nd award $10,000 per year for three years
- **New Zealand Scholars (To all students gaining "outstanding performance" in 3 NZ Scholarship subjects)**  
  $5,000 per year for three years
- **Top Scholar in each subject in NZ Scholarship or in NCEA Level 3 where there is no Scholarship assessment**  
  $3,000 per year for three years
- **School Awards: For the top student in each school who achieves NZ Scholarship in 3 subjects**  
  $1,500 per year for three years

Background information on the 2003 awards follow.

The top scholars will receive their awards at a Government House ceremony on 23 April.

**BACKGROUND INFORMATION for 2003 TOP SCHOLARS**  
Each overall Top Scholar receives $8,000. The top candidate in each Bursaries subject receives $5,000 (apart from Latin and Chinese where there were fewer than 100 eligible candidates so the top candidates get $2,000). There is no award this year for Indonesian as no eligible candidate achieved the required standard.

Features of this year’s Top Scholar awards include:

- 16 of the 29 subject awards went to females.
- 19 of the 35 Top Scholars came from the Auckland region, 8 from Christchurch schools (one of these students resides in Blenheim), 2 from Dunedin, 2 from Hamilton and 1 each from Rotorua, Tauranga, Wellington and Nelson.
- Seven schools produced more than one Top Scholar: Epsom Girls’ Grammar School (5), Burnside High School (4), Rangitoto College (3), Auckland Grammar School (2), Hillcrest High School (2), Kings College (2), and St Andrew’s College (2).

To qualify for a Top Scholar award, candidates must enter for at least three Bursaries subjects and be a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident. In foreign languages, candidates identified by their schools as first language speakers are not eligible for Top Scholar awards.

In addition to the Top Scholar awards, students who achieved scholarship results in five or six subjects will receive monetary awards. Those with scholarships in six subjects receive $3,000, while five scholarships earn $2,500. Scholarship results are awarded to the very high achievers in each subject, generally the top three to four percent of candidates. These awards will be mailed to successful students in April, following the confirmation of final Bursaries results.
