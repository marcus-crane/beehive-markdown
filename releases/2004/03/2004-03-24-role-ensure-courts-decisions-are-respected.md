The Attorney-General's role is to ensure that the decisions of the court are respected, said Attorney-General Margaret Wilson today.

"I note the decision of court in the case of National MP Nick Smith.

"It's also been noted there will be a hearing on penalty and costs.

"It's important that that process be enabled to run its course."
