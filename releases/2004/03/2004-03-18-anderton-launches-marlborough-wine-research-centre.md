The Marlborough Wine Research Centre will be launched today by Minister of Economic Development, Jim Anderton and local dignitaries.

"The Marlborough wine industry is recognised around the world, and rightly so, because they are producing a high quality product. The Marlborough Wine Research Centre will now help the region, and the country, to reach even higher standards in wine making.

"The Wine Research Centre has gained funding support from across the Marlborough regional community in order to build on their huge wine production and marketing capability. This initiative is a good example of how collaboration between industry, research centres, business, national and local government can pay off for all New Zealanders.

"Quality research done at the centre will help us raise production levels, increase quality and export earnings. This is crucial for a region which produces 50 per cent of the value of New Zealand wine exports.

"I commend the region and the wine industry for working together to develop the Marlborough Wine Research Centre and I look forward to seeing the results of their work," said Jim Anderton.

In 2002, Marlborough chose to develop a wine research centre as their major regional development intiative under New Zealand Trade and Enterprise's Regional Partnership Programme.
