A school reorganisation for three Orewa Schools was announced by Education Minister Trevor Mallard today.

From the beginning of 2005 Orewa College will become a Year 7 to 13 (Form 1 to 7) school, and Orewa Primary and Orewa North Schools will no longer be able to accept Year 7 and 8 children for enrolment.

The decision arises from the Hibiscus Coast Schooling Strategy, a complex plan developed through extensive consultation with the community and schools since a working party was first established in 1998.

"I am pleased that the implementation of this important part of the strategy can be given the official go-ahead. It is important for the schools involved to know so that they can plan staffing and resourcing for 2005, and for parents to know which school will enrol their children."

The decision will affect those children who will be in Year 7 and 8 from 2005 onwards and who would have otherwise attended Orewa Primary or Orewa North Schools or who are resident in Red Beach. Their schooling will in future be provided at Orewa College.

"I’d like to thank all parents, boards of trustees and Hibiscus Coast residents who participated in the consultation process at various stages. I am confident that the board and staff of Orewa College will meet parents' expectations of care and schooling for children in year 7 and 8. Year 7 to 13 schools are well tried and proven in New Zealand and I know that Orewa College will be modelling on best practice elsewhere.

"I'm advised that due to delays in obtaining the necessary consents for earthworks at the new Orewa Primary site, the school will not be able to vacate its present site before the start of 2005.

"For the first two terms of 2005 Orewa College will need to accommodate year 7 and 8 students within existing space, and using temporary relocatable classrooms. There are clear advantages in adhering to the planned timetable for the reorganisation of the schools, as this provides certainty and fulfils the expectations of parents and staff.

"I have asked the Ministry of Education to discuss the situation immediately with the three schools so that they can plan for a smooth transition while ensuring all accommodation needs are provided for," Trevor Mallard said.
