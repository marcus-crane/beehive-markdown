Education Minister Trevor Mallard today opened a new $448,000 administration and classroom block at Wellington's Northland School.

Trevor Mallard commended the community on its support for the school, which has a strong tradition of parental involvement.

"Projects like this never succeed without a lot of hard work from a lot of people and it is clear that there is a strong commitment here to providing the best facilities for the students," Trevor Mallard said.

"Schools benefit greatly from strong community support and parental involvement. Those benefits are clearly demonstrated here, with Northland School providing a great learning environment for its students."

This project is the latest stage in the school's property development programme and sees an increase in administration space and an upgrade of the junior classroom block by creating three rooms from the previous two.

The school has had significant property development over the past five years, both to its buildings and environs, and the new facility is in keeping with this development.

This includes two community projects, which gave improved access and play areas and a third Ministry of Education initiated project to increase the school's grassed surface.

"I am delighted the new block is being opened in time for the schools' centenary celebrations planned for 2006. This project creates a new focal point for the entrance to the school and fittingly reflects the character of the older buildings on the site.

"Northland School is a busy active city school and this new facility will no doubt compliment the fine work being done by staff and students," Trevor Mallard said.
