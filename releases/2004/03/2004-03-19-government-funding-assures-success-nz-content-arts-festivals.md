The New Zealand shows in the [New Zealand International Arts Festival](http://www.nzfestival.telecom.co.nz) are a tangible demonstration of the success of the Labour Progressive Government’s Cultural Recovery Package and ongoing support for the arts, says Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard.

“The breadth and depth of New Zealand work in this festival has everyone talking. I’ve had a stream of overseas visitors and New Zealanders talking about the strength of our performing arts,” said Judith Tizard. “The festival provides an important platform to raise New Zealand’s profile overseas and garner export opportunities for our performing arts.”

Last week, Black Grace Dance Company presented the major new work *Surface* by Neil Ieremia, which the Dominion Post review concluded was the dedication of many years reaching its fruition.

“Black Grace was one of the companies to be made an annual client of [Creative New Zealand](http://www.creativenz.govt.nz) as a result of the government’s Cultural Recovery Package announcement in May 2000, which saw more money invested in Creative New Zealand.

“*Surface* is the largest-scale production that Black Grace has ever undertaken. The company tells me that the funding boost has given it a far more secure springboard from which to operate, and it has enabled Neil Ieremia to develop more substantial work.

“The work has attracted serious interest from visiting international arts practitioners and festival booking agents, and it featured at the Perth International Arts Festival last month. I’m hoping that it’s going to have a long life.”

Judith Tizard said Taki Rua Productions, which is presenting two shows in the Festival (*The Prophet, Untold Tales of Maui*), has also benefited from the Cultural Recovery Package which funded Creative New Zealand’s Future Strengths strategy. The strategy aims to stabilise and strengthen the professional arts infrastructure in New Zealand. Both of Taki Rua’s festival productions have also met critical acclaim in this festival.

Judith Tizard said performers and producers were also able to get their works in front of international media, overseas festival producers, booking agents and local festival producers through the festival’s ‘Show and Tell’ and Performing Arts Market.

“Several of the festival producers and booking agents who attended the Creative New Zealand-supported showcases and functions at the Australian Performing Arts Market in Adelaide last month continued on to the New Zealand festival.

“Additionally, Tourism New Zealand has brought international media to the festival, which has already resulted in excellent coverage for New Zealand in publications such as the Australian Financial Review.

“As many of these shows tour to other local festivals, more and more New Zealanders and people around the world are seeing the finest of our performing arts. These productions and exhibitions provide a vital local touchstone for New Zealand audiences and festival visitors.

“I’m delighted that the results of increased funding and support for our performing arts organisations are continuing to be realised on the festival stage. It’s an ideal opportunity to showcase our inspiring new works alongside the international programme.”

Judith Tizard warmly congratulated Carla Van Zon, David Inns, Fran Wilde and all at the New Zealand International Arts Festival on an outstanding 10th Anniversary programme.
