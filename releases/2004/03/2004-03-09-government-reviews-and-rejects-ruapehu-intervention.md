The government has reviewed ways in which it might intervene to try to prevent a lahar or mudslide from the Crater Lake on Mount Ruapehu, Conservation Minister Chris Carter announced today.

A lahar is expected to occur on Ruapehu early next year when an ash dam around the volcano's crater collapses releasing hundreds of millions of litres of water trapped inside it.

"Late last year the government decided to re-look at the options for intervention at Ruapehu's Crater Lake to prevent the impending lahar after a request from the Ruapehu District Council, and following a report from engineering consultants," Mr Carter said.

"After careful deliberation, the government has decided not to proceed with any of the Crater Lake intervention options and will instead continue to bolster the extensive safety measures already in place around Ruapehu. These measures have already reduced risks from the lahar to minimal levels.

"The options for attempting to prevent the lahar are either impractical, unsafe, or likely to make the problem of lahars on Ruapehu worse in the future," Mr Carter said.

"If we do not allow volcanic material to come off the mountain naturally, it will build up with subsequent eruptions creating a greater risk to public safety in the future."

He said the most practical intervention option at the Crater Lake that consultants could identify was the construction of a trench through the ash dam to drain the lahar.

"This would have left behind most of the existing ash dam, which would otherwise be swept away naturally in a lahar. Future volcanic activity could have added to the size of the dam making it higher and meaning that the body of water trapped behind it in future could have been much bigger. This could have resulted in a far larger lahar for the next generation to deal with."

Mr Carter said constructing a trench would also have required the transportation of bulldozers or snow groomers to the lip of an active, unpredictable volcano in a climatically severe alpine environment.

"Workers would have had to conduct an excavation at a higher altitude than has ever been attempted in New Zealand before, some 2542m. That is an altitude 1000m higher than a similar excavation carried out in a tropical climate near Manila to prevent a lahar from Mount Pinatubo.

"Excavation on Mount Ruapehu could have taken anywhere between a week and a month. Workers would have been using heavy equipment in the permanent snowline, surrounded by a steep terrain riddled by crevasses and subject to rock falls and avalanches. The trench would probably have required regular maintenance, meaning workers would have had to go back and forth from the volcano for an indefinite period," Mr Carter said.

"I think common sense would tell most New Zealanders that this kind of activity is far from simple and carries significant risks for those conducting it. Imagine if workers had been working at the Crater Lake this summer with the extraordinary weather we have had.

"The government believes the likelihood of people being harmed in attempting intervention is higher than allowing the lahar to occur naturally," Mr Carter said.

He said Cabinet had examined two other intervention options – sluicing the ash dam to trigger the lahar, and siphoning the lake.

"Sluicing was rejected because it was likely to be even more risky for workers than excavation, and a trial questioned whether it would even work. Our consultants did not favour the option.

"Siphoning is simply impractical because the reduced air pressure at that altitude restricts the ability to lift the water over the ash dam."

Mr Carter said an international expert had been asked to look at the government's safety measures that had already been put in place around Ruapehu to prevent loss of life from the lahar.

"The expert's report shows we have significantly reduced risk to life from the lahar occurring. It is down from up to 40 per cent to less than 4 per cent. In recent months we have bolstered our safety measures even further and Transit New Zealand has agreed to strengthen the Tangiwai Road Bridge, the point at which much of the remaining risk to life rests. Once this bridge is able to withstand lahars, the risk to the surrounding district will be minimal," Mr Carter said.

"The government is confident it has done everything sensible to prevent this lahar from causing harm, bearing in mind that Ruapehu is a live volcano. What is more, our safety measures will provide long-term protection against lahars from probably the most active lahar-producing crater lake volcano in the world."

Safety measures already in place include:

- A special electronic alert system as used on Mt St Helens and several other volcanoes around the world that will provide 90 minutes warning before the lahar reaches the Tangiwai Bridge;
- A 300m-long stop bank in the Whangaehu River to minimise the risk of a lahar spilling into the Taupo catchment;
- A response plan that will close all at-risk sites, bridges, roads and railway lines;
- Gates, lights and signs on State Highway 49 and 1;
- A Tranz Rail alarm and train stopping system;
- Electricity supply protection;
- Plans to strengthen the Tangiwai Road Bridge to enable it to withstand lahars.

**Lahar – Key Facts**

- A lahar is expected on Mount Ruapehu after the volcano's most recent eruption deposited an ash barrier around its Crater Lake. The lake has been slowly filling and once a sufficient volume of water forms behind the ash barrier it will give way, causing water and ash to flood down the mountain.
- There have been about 60 lahars down the Tangiwai-side of Ruapehu in the past 150 years, including one that caused the Tangiwai disaster 50 years ago.
- At present the Crater Lake has reached level 1 status. This is the lowest level of warning established among agencies involved in the civil defence planning for the lahar. There are five levels. Level 1 means that the Carter Lake has filled to 3m below the hard rock rim holding the water in. Above the hard rock rim is the ash barrier, which is the bit that could give way creating a lahar.
- A Tangiwai-sized lahar is not expected until the end of the year at the earliest.
