The Associate Transport Minister Harry Duynhoven says the passage of the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill through Parliament yesterday will improve aviation safety and encourage economic development by removing regulatory barriers to the development of the Australian and New Zealand single aviation market.

The new Civil Aviation Amendment Act 2004 will improve aircraft security and the safety of passengers and crews, by extending measures to deal with unruly passenger behaviour.

A comprehensive set of offences has been established whereby passengers committing an offence on board a New Zealand aircraft, or a foreign aircraft en route to New Zealand, can be prosecuted.

The new unruly passenger regime will come into force on 1 June 2004.

The legislation also implements mutual recognition obligations with Australia.

This is in line with earlier commitments to the continued development of a single aviation market between New Zealand and Australia.

“Removing the requirement for airlines to hold certificates from both New Zealand and Australian civil aviation authorities will make it easier for airlines to operate services in both countries.

This means there will be significant up-front and ongoing cost savings to airline operators taking up commercial opportunities to operate within and between each country”, says Mr Duynhoven.

The mutual recognition provisions in the Bill will come into force by Order in Council to ensure a consistent commencement date with Australia.

The Bill has also provided the opportunity to update the [Civil Aviation Act 1990](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=3034114547&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7BB009F13B%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC) to improve its workability and to align it with other international obligations.

This includes transferring the liability provisions for passenger delay from the Carriage by Air Act 1967, but in so doing clarifying that the bulk of air adventure operators are not liable for delay.

“I would particularly like to thank the Transport and Industrial Relations Select Committee for the priority it has given this Bill, and for the improvements it has made to the Bill as introduced” says Mr Duynhoven.
