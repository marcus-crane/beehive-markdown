The Government is discussing with Federated Farmers and local authorities what help can be offered flood-stricken rural communities, Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton said today.

Mr Sutton made public a briefing from the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry that gives a preliminary estimate of flood damage of up to $180 million, spread across dairy, sheep, beef and deer, crops, and forestry sectors.

“This estimate is a preliminary one. MAF estimates that about 2600 farmers were affected by the storm of 15-18 February, but not all affected farmers have been able to be contacted yet, and many are still trying to evaluate the enormity of the damage to their farms.”

It could be another four weeks before final information is available.

Mr Sutton said the flood had caused significant damage, washing away crops that were about to be harvested, covering dairy farms with silt, and seriously eroding hill country farms.

He said that MAF had estimated initial damage at up to $133 million. Medium term losses, covering production losses up to June 30 2004 for dairying and to June 30 2005 for sheep and beef, are estimated as another $47 million on top of that.

Dairying Immediate losses$32.7m  
Dairying medium term losses$8.7m  
Total Dairying$41.4m

Sheep beef and deer immediate losses$28.0m  
Sheep beef and deer medium term losses$38.0m  
Total Sheep and Beef$66.0m

Crop immediate losses$24m  
Crop no medium term losses

Forestry$28-49m

Total $ 159-180m

Mr Sutton said the Government was committed to helping one of the most productive horticultural and agricultural regions to re-build.

“MAF staff and the agricultural recovery co-ordinators are working hard with Federated Farmers and other groups to quantify the effects of the flood and to identify rural community needs.

“The Prime Minister has promised that help will be given to farmers, growers, and others in the affected areas, stretching from South Taranaki and across to central Hawkes Bay down to the Wairarapa, Hutt City, and Marlborough. Officials are working with community groups on how best to provide that help.”

So far, almost $900,000 has been provided to mayoral relief funds and local authorities to pay for upfront emergency costs.

Enhanced Taskforce Green programmes and Rural Sector Assistance funding has been allocated, and rural co-ordinators and agricultural recovery facilitators have been appointed.

Mr Sutton said he was impressed by the way so many people from all around New Zealand were responding to the plight of those in the flood-damaged area.

“It is at times like these that we know how lucky we are to be New Zealanders.”
