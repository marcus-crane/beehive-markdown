The government has begun discussions with the tertiary education sector organisations about future funding for community education courses, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Substantial growth has occurred in recent years in funding classification 5.1 community education courses. This classification covers courses for part-time students, often lasting only a few weeks, such as free computing courses. These courses are taught by public tertiary institutions, chiefly polytechnics. Evening classes in secondary schools are not funded via this mechanism and are not covered in the consultation exercise.

In the 2000 academic year funding of $16 million for 2,776 EFTS was allocated for classification 5.1 courses. Ministry of Education projections suggest over 20,000 EFTS in classification 5.1 courses this year, at an expected cost of $115 million.

Steve Maharey said the government wants to ensure that future growth in these courses is consistent with the Tertiary Education Strategy.

“The tertiary education reforms are designed both to ensure much stronger links between the world of work and the world of learning, and also that the tertiary education system also advances New Zealand’s social development agenda.

“There are concerns about whether untargeted growth in community education courses is meeting the objectives for tertiary education laid down in the Tertiary Education Strategy. The focus of the discussions with the tertiary education sector is on how to balance future growth with the government’s fiscal framework and New Zealand’s tertiary education goals.

“It is likely that some specific changes will be introduced to limit expenditure in classification 5.1”, Steve Maharey said.
