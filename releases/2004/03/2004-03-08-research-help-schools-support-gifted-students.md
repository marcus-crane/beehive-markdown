Education Minister Trevor Mallard today released the first comprehensive research study into gifted education in New Zealand, aimed at helping teachers and schools to better support their talented students in the classroom.

“This government is committed to ensuring that we meet the needs of every single student. We want to make sure all our students have the opportunity to reach their full potential. This new research is a practical tool for schools, which I am sure will help them meet the needs of their gifted and talented students," Trevor Mallard said.

"The research, commissioned by the government, shows that many New Zealand schools do have effective programmes for gifted and talented students in their classrooms, but more classroom planning needs to be done.

"We need to continue developing a range of educational tools and courses to meet these students' needs - both for them as individuals and as an investment in our future cultural, social and economic leaders.

"Schools will find the research particularly useful in developing policies and extending the curriculum to meet the needs of these gifted and talented learners.

"There is a wealth of information here on what works in gifted education."

Releasing the report on a visit to the Music in the Heartland programme, a Dunedin initiative for gifted children, Trevor Mallard said the research by Massey University showed schools had a variety of programmes, either within regular classes, within the wider school, and community-based.

The research, conducted last year, outlines that successful programmes for gifted and talented learners should:

- have strong leadership in identifying and providing for gifted and talented students;
- have co-ordinated, school-wide strategies, which are implemented and continuously evaluated to increase the likelihood of successful outcomes; and
- reflect the core principles outlined in the government's 2002 policy statement - *Initiatives for Gifted and Talented Learners.*

"I have also changed the National Administration Guidelines, so that from Term 1 2005, schools will be required to identify their gifted and talented learners, and develop and implement teaching and learning strategies to address their needs, as they are currently required to do for students who are not achieving, who are at risk of not achieving, and who have special needs.

"This change to the National Administration Guidelines recognises that we must address the diverse learning needs of all our students in New Zealand schools.

"Gifted and talented learners are found in every group within society, and in every school in New Zealand. This initiative explicitly recognises that schools are powerful catalysts for the development of talent."

The research provides teachers with information on the range of identification methods and ways of providing challenging programmes for gifted learners. The potential advantages and disadvantages of each identification method and type of programme are also detailed.

It also provides schools with the theory which underpins the different approaches to gifted education, together with examples of how some schools have translated the theory on what works into programmes that work in classrooms.

"A benefit of this research is that it considers each approach in the New Zealand context - where the focus is on meeting the needs of gifted learners in the regular classroom - this is different to many other countries," Trevor Mallard said.

A summary of the research report, undertaken by Dr Tracy Riley and her team at Massey University, will be sent to all schools in Term 2.

Support for schools is also available from advisors in gifted education, who are based at colleges of education around the country. There are also resources on Te Kete Ipurangi / The Online Learning Centre at: [www.tki.org.nz](http://www.tki.org.nz)
