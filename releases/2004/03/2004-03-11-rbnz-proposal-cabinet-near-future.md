Finance Minister Michael Cullen confirmed today that he would be taking to the Cabinet a recommendation from the Reserve Bank for a more active role in the foreign exchange market.

“As anyone who has been following my statements on monetary policy management over recent months will know, I am strongly supportive of the change and will be recommending it to my ministerial colleagues.

“The Cabinet paper incorporating the Bank’s advice is still being drafted. I would expect to be in a position to take it to the Cabinet in the near future.”

Dr Cullen will be consulting with other political parties to achieve a parliamentary majority for the change which will require a motion in Parliament.
