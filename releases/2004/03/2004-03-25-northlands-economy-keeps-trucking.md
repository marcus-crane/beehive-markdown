Pat yourself on the back Northland, says Te Tai Tokerau MP Dover Samuels with the latest National Bank Regional Trends survey showing the region’s economy grew by more than four percent last year.

Northland enjoyed growth of 4.2 per cent in the year to December 2003 – the country’s second highest. That included a final quarter growth spurt of 1.9 percent. Nationally, the economy grew 3.4 per cent.

Dover Samuels says what’s really pleasing is that local economic growth has bumped up employment and helped pull down Northland’s unemployment rate to a seven year low.

“People in regions like ours are now getting a fair share of the opportunities created by continuing growth of the economic cake.

“Much of that is due to people expanding and creating their businesses – but it also reflects the government’s determination to play a role in fostering growth and innovation.

“While economic growth may moderate a little from here on due to factors such as the high dollar, the signals are that Northland will continue to grow, says Dover Samuels.
