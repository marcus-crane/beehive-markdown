“Promises on New Zealand Superannuation are worth nothing from National as they have a history of bad faith on the issue,” Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

“New Zealanders won’t forget that National promised to remove the surcharge in 1990 but in fact extended it, froze the payment and increased the age of entitlement.”

He was commenting on a speech by the National Leader Don Brash calling for “honesty” in the superannuation debate and ruling out an early increase in the qualifying age.

“As always with National, it is important to read the fine print.

“Dr Brash is saying that under National anybody who is 49 or younger will see the goalposts moved again and have to work past the age of 65 in order to receive a full pension,” Dr Cullen said.
