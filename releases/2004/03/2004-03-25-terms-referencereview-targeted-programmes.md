Coordinating Minister, Race Relations Trevor Mallard today released the [Terms of Reference](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F19259) for the government’s review of targeted policy and programmes.

Trevor Mallard says the review will cover:

- Targeted *policy*: what was intended and the reasons for it; and
- Targeted *programmes* – how the policy is delivered and its impact.

"The review of targeted policy and programmes is a priority for the government. The objective of the review is to give ministers and the public assurance that policy is being developed on the basis of need, not on the basis of race," Trevor Mallard said.

"In addition, at some later date, a review of statutory references to the Treaty of Waitangi may be undertaken. But this will not be confirmed or otherwise until the government makes its final decision on the nature of an inquiry into the Treaty of Waitangi."

Trevor Mallard said the State Services Commission would coordinate, monitor and report on the Review activities.

"This is consistent with the State Services Commissioner’s statutory role of reviewing the performance of departments and chief executives.

"The first priorities for the Commission will be to appoint staff to the Review Unit and to develop a work plan for the Review programme. The work plan will be developed in consultation with relevant departments and will be sent to the government in mid-May 2004 for consideration," Trevor Mallard said.
