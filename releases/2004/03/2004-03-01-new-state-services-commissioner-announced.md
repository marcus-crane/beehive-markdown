State Services Minister Trevor Mallard today announced the appointment of Mark Prebble as the next State Services Commissioner.

Mark Prebble will replace the present State Services Commissioner, Michael Wintringham, who retires from public service in late May.

Trevor Mallard said Mark Prebble would bring to the post a broad range of experience at the most senior levels of the public service.

“This experience, together with his strong commitment to high standards in public management, will ensure the state sector continues to strengthen its response to the needs of the government and to all sectors of the community,” Trevor Mallard said.

“This government is working hard to further strengthen public services through a focus on building up the skills and capabilities of staff and public service leaders, and on encouraging more collaboration between public service organisations so ordinary New Zealanders are better off.

"I expect Mark Prebble will play an important role in this area as well as other areas of work, bringing energy, and a rigorous and principled leadership to the public service, to the state sector, and to the State Services Commission itself."

Mark Prebble is currently chief executive of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, a position he has held since 1998.

A career public servant, Mark Prebble has worked in a number of important policy and managerial roles, including as Deputy Secretary to the Treasury, and Acting Secretary to the Treasury.

Earlier in his career he worked in Treasury and the Department of Labour, in areas including Budget management, health and social assistance reform, employment policy and land use. He began his working life as an alpine guide and mountaineering instructor at Mt Cook, and as a tutor in economics in Auckland and Wellington.

Trevor Mallard paid tribute to Michael Wintringham’s achievements as State Services Commissioner since 1997.

“Michael Wintringham has led the state sector well, and has worked hard to meet several critical challenges in the public service, including leadership and management development, e-government, and the promotion of ethics and values. He has achieved real progress in all of these areas,” Trevor Mallard said.

The State Services Commissioner has a key management role in the public service, and in the wider state sector. The Commissioner is responsible for appointing departmental chief executives and for managing their performance, for advising the government about the shape and efficiency of the state sector, and for maintaining high standards of ethical conduct.

Mark Prebble is on leave from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet for the next three months and will take up his appointment as Commissioner on 28 May 2004.

State Services Commissioner Michael Wintringham is moving now to fill the position of chief executive in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet that will be vacant when Mark Prebble takes up his new position.
