Associate Rural Affairs Minister Damien O'Connor today welcomed the government's [Resource Management Act](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/laws/rma/) review on behalf of rural New Zealand.

The review, announced yesterday, aims to provide greater certainty to resource consent applications.

Rural New Zealand would welcome any improvements in the Act's application, Mr O'Connor said.

"Farmers have long been saying that government must reduce regulatory burdens, of which they feel the RMA is one.

"This gives us an opportunity to look at the issues raised often by farmers.

"While the Act works well in most cases, many farmers have complained that it increases compliance costs, delays projects, and that the current framework is likely to require consents for what are, in essence, normal farming activities.

"Agriculture, and farming in particular, are the backbone of New Zealand's economy, and innovation and enterprise within the sector must be fostered, not stymied."

Mr O'Connor said the review would cover not just big projects, but all those processed under the Act.

"I would hope that this review brings about positive change for all enterprising, innovative New Zealanders, without compromising what the Act stands for, which is protection of the environment and allowing the public to have its say."
