The government is putting on record its thanks to the retiring chairperson of the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC), Dr Andrew West, whose appointment as Chief Executive of Ag Research was announced today.

The TEC is responsible for allocating funding worth $2.2 billion annually and for tertiary education and research, industry training, training opportunities programmes and community education. It was established by the government to provide a clear strategic direction to the entire post-school education system and it ensure it fully contributes to New Zealand’s economic and social development.

Dr West was initially appointed to head up the Transition Tertiary Education Commission in 2001 and was later confirmed as chairperson of the inaugural Commission which was formally established on 1 January 2003. He completes work with the Commission on 16 April 2004.

Acting Minister Responsible for Tertiary Education Commission Margaret Wilson said Dr West had successfully managed the establishment phase of the Commission.

“Under Dr West’s leadership the TEC is achieving the government’s three tertiary education reform priorities of excellence, relevance and access. In its first full year of operation the TEC has:  
·completed New Zealand’s first ever assessment of the research carried out in the tertiary education system and it will now use these results to support and encourage greater levels of excellence in research;  
·negotiated new charters with more than 500 individual tertiary education organisations which help define their unique role and how they will become more closely connected to the needs of industry, the professions and wider society; and  
·overseen the very rapid growth in industry training numbers, which last year involved 126,870 workers in on-the-job training, a 19 per cent increase on the previous year.

“Dr West leaves the Commission in a sound place and I wish him well for the future.

“Deputy TEC Chairperson Kaye Turner will become Acting Chairperson as the Commission continues with its work to implement the government’s tertiary education reforms,” Margaret Wilson said.
