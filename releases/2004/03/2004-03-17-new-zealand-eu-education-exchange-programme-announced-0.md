An international education exchange programme between New Zealand and the European Union for postgraduate (Masters) students was announced today.

The three-year European Union-New Zealand Exchange Pilot Programme will see the development of a joint postgraduate study programme at New Zealand and European universities for their students. It will be modelled on existing EU-Australia and EU-United States projects, and has flowed from discussions between Trevor Mallard and European Commission officials last year. The programme will be jointly funded by the Tertiary Education Commission and the European Commission, with participating institutions also making a small contribution.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard said the exchange programme will promote greater understanding and interaction between the peoples of the European Union countries and New Zealand.

“We share close ties with the European Union in many areas such as science and technology, education, cultural links and people to people contacts. Our relationships is growing, with the European Commission opening an office in Wellington this year.

“The programme will enable at least 24 students each from New Zealand and Europe to study at participating institutions from 2005. Students studying abroad will pay tuition and fees that apply at their home institution,” Trevor Mallard said.

Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said students studying abroad would bring home to New Zealand valuable international knowledge.

“If New Zealand is to be a birthplace of world-changing people and ideas, we need to provide more opportunities for our emerging knowledge leaders to interact with other leading thinkers from around the world.

“Proposals are now being sought from New Zealand and European tertiary institutions to participate in the exchange programme. Proposals should be submitted by 16 June 2004. We expect to announce the successful proposal in July,” Steve Maharey said.
