Education Minister Trevor Mallard today expressed the government's support for the report of the Ministerial Taskforce on Secondary Teacher Remuneration.

Trevor Mallard said the report charted a positive direction for the secondary teaching profession.

"I believe the parties in the Taskforce have worked exceptionally well together to develop a useful framework to guide both professional and industrial engagements over the next decade," Trevor Mallard said.

"I support the staged implementation of the remuneration strategy, which is intended to recruit and retain a high quality secondary teaching profession and develop the capability of our teachers."

"I am particularly pleased that the report focuses on providing opportunities for and recognition of excellent teaching practice to improve learning opportunities for all students. It encourages life long learning and high quality professional practice.

"I believe the report provides the parties with an opportunity to create a more stable environment for future bargaining rounds and I am supportive of continuing a constructive approach by the parties to addressing the issues facing the sector," Trevor Mallard said.
