State Services Minister Trevor Mallard today presented two public service leaders with grants for international study in public management.

Trevor Mallard said the Leadership Development Centre Fellowship Awards are a great opportunity for talented senior public service managers to develop their leadership potential through exposure to cutting edge education programmes.

"This government is committed to strengthening the public service. I believe New Zealanders are best served by a strong and effective public service that is well led by capable and effective managers. These awards are part of this work," Trevor Mallard said.

"The award grant allows talented managers to study at leading international institutions where they can learn more about local and global issues in public management.

"Our goal of strengthening the public service requires leadership – both from government, chief executives and from the people who staff and manage the many departments and ministries."

Award recipients each receive a grant of up to $40,000 to attend an international programme of their choice to enhance their ability to bring about change and improvements in leadership and management practice in the New Zealand public service.

Kathy Spencer (Ministry of Health) will attend the ‘Senior Executive Fellows’ course at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University. She will also attend the Canadian Association for Health Services Policy and Research Conference.

Stephen Cunningham (Ministry of Social Development) has chosen to attend the High Performance Leadership course at Cranfield University and the Oxford Strategic Leadership Programme. He will also be undertaking research at the Working and Age Pensions Department while in England.

"I wish both Kathy and Stephen well on their international studies. The public service will benefit from their increased knowledge and new insights on their return to New Zealand," Trevor Mallard said.
