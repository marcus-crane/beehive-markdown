The government has expressed its deep sympathy on behalf of all New Zealanders to the families of those killed and injured as a result of the terrorist bombings in Madrid, Foreign Minister Phil Goff said today.

Prime Minister Helen Clark has sent an official letter of condolence to Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar expressing her shock at the bombings.

"These attacks represent an appalling and senseless act of brutality. They resulted in the arbitrary slaughter of innocent civilians, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity or religion," Mr Goff said.

"It clearly justifies the intensive efforts that New Zealand is making, including in Afghanistan and the Asia-Pacific region, against terrorism. It also once again emphasises the need for the entire international community to cooperate and to maximize efforts to defeat terrorist organisations."

Mr Goff said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not received reports of any New Zealanders killed or injured in the attacks.

The New Zealand Embassy in Madrid has made email or phone contact with most of the approximately 80 New Zealand families and individuals registered as being in the Madrid area, and so far all are safe and well.

The New Zealand men's hockey team, in Madrid for Olympic qualifying matches, is also safe.

Embassy staff have also been checking Spanish government casualty lists and, with the help of the British and United States embassies, hospital admission lists.

New Zealanders with concerns about friends or relatives in Madrid are welcome to call the Consular Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (04 439 8000). The Spanish Red Cross/Red Crescent has set up a 24-hour enquiries number: 0034 91 335 4682.
