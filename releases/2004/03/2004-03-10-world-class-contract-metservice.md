Minister for State Owned Enterprises Mark Burton is today congratulating MetService on securing a contract for their Weatherscape XT graphics package with the BBC. The British broadcaster will use the software for all its national and regional channels, as well as the BBC World Service and its internet site.

New Zealand audiences will be already be familiar with Weatherscape, which was originally developed in partnership with TVNZ and is currently seen on the One News weather segment.

Mark Burton is hailing the deal— possibly one of the largest weather graphics software contracts in the world—as a huge achievement for MetService.

“This is excellent news, and proof positive that New Zealand is a world leader in innovation, creativity, and technical prowess.

“MetService’s Weatherscape XT package is already used internationally, including Nine Network in Australia and CNBC stations in Europe, Dubai, Turkey, and Asia. It is also seen on television stations in Beirut and Saudi Arabia. Now it will be featured around the globe by the world’s largest broadcaster—a great achievement indeed.

“The BBC contract will also add considerable value to this successful State Owned Enterprise, and lead to greater dividends for its owners—the people of New Zealand.

“In the wake of the recent international acclaim for Peter Jackson, Richard Taylor, and the Lord of the Rings team, I am delighted to again see New Zealanders’ innovation, creativity, and expertise featured overseas.

“I wholeheartedly congratulate MetService on this outstanding accomplishment.”
