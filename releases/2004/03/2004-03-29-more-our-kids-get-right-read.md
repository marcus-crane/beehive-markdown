More than 1,900 pupils at two South Auckland schools are part of a further chapter in the government’s commitment to lift literacy standards.

Mangere MP Taito Phillip Field today visited, Papatoetoe Intermediate, which with De La Salle College, is among the first intake of 133 schools in a new professional development programme for teachers starting this month. The programme assists teachers to improve their pupils’ literacy skills.

The government is committing $43m annually to a range of literacy programmes. These include the New Zealand-developed world-leading AsTTle programme, which tests pupils on literacy and numeracy, then tracks their achievements against national standards.

“Every parent knows how crucial it is for their children to be able to read and write. These skills are also vital to our ambitions for growth and innovation in this country. Imagine if Peter Jackson hadn’t been able to read Lord of the Rings,” said Taito Phillip Field.

Whilst holding our own in literacy standards - a recent study shows our 15-year-olds had the third highest score of 32 advanced countries for reading literacy - there are still real gaps between our highest and lowest achievers.

“That’s why we’re boosting efforts to assist teachers to further develop their skills in assisting children to read and write, as part of a comprehensive project to lift literacy," says Taito Phillip Field.

"Being able to read is a fundamental right. Every New Zealand child deserves the fullest opportunity to write their own destiny.”
