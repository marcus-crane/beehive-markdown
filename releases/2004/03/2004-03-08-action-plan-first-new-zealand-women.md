A [new action plan](http://www.mwa.govt.nz/cont_pb.html#actionplan) addresses women’s issues across the whole of government for the first time, Women’s Affairs Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

[Launching the plan at Parliament](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F19122), Ms Dyson said it was the first time any government had committed itself to an integrated plan to improve women’s lives.

“The action plan identifies three key themes for women – having enough income to care for themselves and their dependants, work/life balance, and general well-being.

“It builds on achievements the government has already made. It gives us a vision for the future, and provides a framework for action across the whole of government. We now have clear priorities, milestones and ways to monitor overall progress.”

Ruth Dyson said, although a lot of progress had been made on women’s issues, many barriers still prevented women from participating fully and equally in society.

“Women are concentrated in low-paid jobs, and earn less than men even when they work in the same professions. They are more likely to have a post-school qualification, but take much longer to pay back student debt (and incur more interest) because of their lower earnings and childcare responsibilities. They still occupy fewer than one-third of all senior management positions in New Zealand companies.

“For Maori, Pacific, rural, ethnic, low-income, rural, older and disabled women, the barriers are frequently greater.”

Ms Dyson outlined a number of initiatives contained in the plan, including:

- promoting women’s success in enterprise;
- helping Mäori women gain governance, management and business skills;
- improving women’s participation in modern apprenticeships;
- increasing women’s access to financial planning advice and uptake of retirement savings schemes;
- reducing the impact of student loans on women;
- improving the level of family income assistance, which will benefit many women in lower-income groups;
- new policies to encourage work/life balance and address pay and employment equity;
- greater support for early childhood education and out of school care and recreation, to improve quality, access and affordability;
- a social statistics package, including plans for a second Time Use Survey and the development of satellite accounts to help understand the contribution of household and non-profit activity to the economy; and
- new policies to enhance opportunities for women with disabilities, particularly in employment.

Women’s Affairs Minister Ruth Dyson will launch the ‘Action Plan for New Zealand Women’ at a function in the Banquet Hall, Parliament Buildings, Wellington at 5.15pm, Monday, 8 March 2004.
