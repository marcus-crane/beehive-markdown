Economic development, using creativity and innovation is transforming New Zealand into a high wage, high skill economy said Jim Anderton today in a speech to the EDANZ (Economic Development Association of New Zealand) conference in Wellington.

"Edanz and economic development organisations from all over the country are integral to the transformation of our economy from a commodity-based economy to a job-rich, high-wage, high skill economy producing high value products.

"New Zealand is a small country that cannot grow or produce enough commodities to raise the living standards of all New Zealanders. What other countries can achieve economically by their scale, concentration and proximity to markets, New Zealand needs to achieve using innovation and creativity - such as was used in Lord of the Rings and the high value NZ pine furniture which will be made by Denmark's Zenia House.

"The time couldn’t be better to build on our creativity and use our links with the rest of the world to build on our innovative business ideas.

"Our challenge is to create a New Zealand whose economic and social future is based on our ability to think and to use our intellectual property to build both a growing economy and a fairer society.

"We must meet this challenge, not only for present and future generations of New Zealanders, but also for a world which desperately needs the ability and capacity to nurture and care for all of its citizens.

"These are objectives worthy of our time, effort and ingenuity. I am confident we can succeed," said Jim Anderton.
