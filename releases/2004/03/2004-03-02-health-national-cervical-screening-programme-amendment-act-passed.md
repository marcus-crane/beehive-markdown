Health Minister Annette King says the passing today of the Health (National Cervical Screening Programme) Amendment Act will help prevent New Zealand women dying from cervical cancer.

Ms King says the new legislation strengthens evaluation procedures to ensure the quality and safety of the NCSP, and signals implementation of several key recommendations from the Gisborne Cervical Screening Inquiry.

“A significant change relates to women's participation in the NCSP. Until now women have been able to choose to withdraw individual smear results from the NCSP register. This has meant that a full comprehensive evaluation could not take place as the register holds incomplete screening histories of women.

"Under the new Act women can choose either to participate fully in the NCSP or withdraw completely. This will enable improved evaluation of the programme, so ensuring its safety for all women."

Ms King says the Act also provides for establishing an independent review committee to conduct high-level reviews of the NCSP.

“The Act will allow screening programme evaluators to access information about individual women on the register, and about those who have developed cervical cancer (whether they are on the register or not), held by hospitals, laboratories, and health practitioners (such as GPs). This meets the recommendations of the Gisborne Inquiry, as full access to records of relevant women is considered essential for effective internal and external evaluations,” Ms King says.

"It's important, however, to emphasise there are safeguards in the Act to protect women's health information, and strict confidentiality and privacy requirements on evaluators. Evaluators can only access information for the purpose of evaluation, and to the extent that the information is necessary to the evaluation. Health practitioners, such as GPs, are able to oversee this access. It’s important to strike a balance between privacy values and the population health benefits that come from robust evaluation.”
