The Government has accepted the intent of all the recommendations of the Primary Production Committee's inquiry into the scampi fishery.

Fisheries Minister David Benson-Pope today tabled the Government's formal response to the committee's report, which was presented to Parliament on 2 December last year.

"My predecessor Pete Hodgson said before Christmas that the Government intended to implement the Select Committee’s key recommendation of introducing scampi into the Quota Management System by 1 October 2004," Mr Benson-Pope said. "Today’s response confirms this and I expect to introduce legislation to this effect in the near future."

The committee also recommended ex gratia payments from the Government to six named scampi fishers in recognition of the particular and individual consequences suffered by them. The Government has agreed and Mr Benson-Pope said the Ministry of Fisheries would shortly begin negotiations with the fishers concerned.

"The amounts payable to these fishers will be determined by negotiation," Mr Benson-Pope said. "The Government accepts the committee's finding that these fishers have a justified grievance with the treatment they received from the former Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and will approach the negotiations in good faith."

"The management of the scampi fishery has been the subject of extensive legal action and two public inquiries. The committee's recommendations offer a pragmatic way forward that will help ensure this valuable fishery is managed efficiently and sustainably."

Mr Benson-Pope said the steps being taken to address the issues in the scampi fishery reflected its unique history and did not set any precedents for dealing with issues in other fisheries.

The report of a State Services Commission inquiry into allegations made regarding the management and administration of the scampi fishery is still pending.
