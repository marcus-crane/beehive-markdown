Former Chief Executive Officer of Education New Zealand and education consultant Lester Taylor is to be the independent mediator for the school network review in Stokes Valley.

"Local MP Paul Swain, who has been leading the consultation on mediation, has contacted me to say Lester Taylor is the preferred choice of the schools, and I have agreed to their recommendation," Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

Lester Taylor is available to start on the mediation process immediately.

"I am confident that he will work through the process thoroughly, carefully and quickly so final decisions can be made to end the uncertainty," Trevor Mallard said.

"I am still keen to make my final decision on the Stokes Valley review in early April.

"The longer schools have to get on with the job, and prepare and plan for the implementation of any changes in time for the start of the 2005 school year, the better it will be for all concerned.

"But let me stress that I will not make any final decisions until I receive the mediator’s recommendations," Trevor Mallard said.
