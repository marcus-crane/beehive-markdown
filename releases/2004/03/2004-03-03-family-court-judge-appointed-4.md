Attorney-General Margaret Wilson today announced the appointment of Robert Murfitt of Christchurch as a Family Court Judge. He will be sworn in on 10 March and begin sitting in New Plymouth from 19 April.

Robert Murfitt, 55, gained an LLB (Hons) from the University of Canterbury in 1971 and was admitted to the bar the following year. Initially employed by Weston Ward & Lascelles, he then practised in partnerships until establishing a practice as a barrister sole in 1996.

Most of Robert Murfitt’s recent practice has been in family law. In early years he was also engaged in civil and criminal work, including Youth Court work.

He is a former Chair of the Family Courts Association and has been active in various committees of Canterbury District Law Society and on the organising committees of family law conferences.
