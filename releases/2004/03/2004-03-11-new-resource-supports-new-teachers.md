Beginning teachers will get more support in their new and important teaching careers with a resource launched by Education Minister Trevor Mallard today.

"The amount and kind of support beginning teachers receive is an important factor in their effectiveness in the classroom and their satisfaction with teaching," Trevor Mallard said.

*Towards Full Registration – A Support Kit for Schools* aims to provide clear direction and guidelines for the induction and professional development of beginning teachers.

"The enthusiasm and vitality beginning teachers bring to the school and classroom are particularly valuable and I want to ensure this momentum is sustained. The government is focussing on improving quality teaching to lift student achievement and this resource will support that goal," Trevor Mallard said.

"It will help the people who support and guide beginning teachers to work more effectively with them. I expect it will be used extensively by School Support Services and by colleges of education when working with students in their final year of teacher training.

"I am confident this resource will assist schools as they put into place robust and effective two-year advice and guidance programmes for beginning teachers."

*Towards Full Registration* is a joint publication between the Ministry of Education and the New Zealand Teachers Council, and cost around $120,000 to develop.

The resource, available from Learning Media Services, will be sent to all schools and teacher education providers this week.

Trevor Mallard launched *Towards Full Registration* at Otumoetai Intermediate School in Tauranga, which has six beginning teachers.
