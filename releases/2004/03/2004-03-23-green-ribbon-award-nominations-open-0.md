Environment Minister Marian Hobbs is calling for nominations for the 2004 Green Ribbon environment awards.

"In a nation that prides itself on being clean and green, certain people lead the way and inspire others through their actions. It's these heroes the Green Ribbon Awards recognise," Marian Hobbs said. "Last year was a record in terms of number and quality of the nominations received and I’m keen to encourage more this year.

"Every day I hear about people, organisations and businesses making a difference for the environment. The Green Ribbon awards are about celebrating these achievements and inspiring others to get involved.

"Last year as recognition of the International Year of Freshwater and the government's commitment to water in the Sustainable Development Programme of Action, I awarded two special awards in the, 'Caring for our Lakes, Rivers and Streams'. This category was so popular and so important that I have decided to feature this category again with a focus on freshwater and marine.

"The Green Ribbon Award winners show all of us how everyone can make a big difference through their commitment and hard work."

Categories for this year include:  
·caring for the urban environment  
·caring for the rural environment  
·caring for our biodiversity  
·raising awareness of environmental issues  
·sustainable business  
·young people making a difference  
·caring for our water – fresh and sea  
·excellence in community action for the environment

Nominations close on May 7 and the winners will be announced at the presentation ceremony on June 4. In the past 13 years, 58 individuals, businesses, voluntary organisations, schools and councils from all over New Zealand have been honoured with Green Ribbon Awards.

More information and Green Ribbon nomination forms can be obtained from the Ministry for the Environment’s website: www.mfe.govt.nz or by calling 04 917 7400.
