Prime Minister Helen Clark, Agricultural Minister Jim Sutton and Civil Defence Minister George Hawkins today announced details of a purpose-designed package for those affected by the February [floods](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/floods/home.cfm).

Helen Clark said the government response went well beyond existing standard policies for disaster recovery because of the magnitude and economic impact of the natural disaster.

“The government is already providing around $90 million support through its existing standard response policies and other measures agreed over the past few weeks,” Helen Clark said.

“These measures cover response activities of the emergency services, immediate welfare needs for people affected, labour through TaskForce Green to help with the clean-up, support and advisory services, repairing critical infrastructure such as roads and bridges, flexibility to the Income Tax Act, and matching of donations to flood relief appeals.

“The measures being announced today will cost up to a further $40 million.

“Today’s decisions mean that, in total, the government will be committing about $130 million to help the flood recovery exercise.

“The further aid package agreed today consists of two major elements. They are an agricultural package of about $25 million; and a broader community package of $15 million that includes more than $11 million in rates remission for those most affected, and additional assistance for road repairs.

Helen Clark said the floods had been a major disaster for the lower North Island. They had dealt a serious blow to the economic infrastructure of several regions, and caused devastation to communities.

“The government is under no illusion as to the severity of the events of mid-February. The flooding caused extensive damage to roads, bridges and other infrastructure, devastated farms and other rural activities, wrecked houses and put at risk the livelihoods of many.

“The government is convinced that it must act quickly and generously to prevent wider regional economic impacts."
