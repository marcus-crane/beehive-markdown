Education Minister Trevor Mallard is delighted that a Christchurch school is receiving $65,000 for an innovative new project to work with at risk students.

Trevor Mallard has approved a project at Hillmorton High School, from the Innovations Funding Pool.

Hillmorton High School hopes to improve the achievement outcomes of at risk students. The project will focus on developing their professional development programme into an 'action research project' by assessing current classroom situations and changing teaching practice based on the Best Evidence Synthesis research.

The innovations funding pool encourages innovative ways of working with students who are at risk of not achieving well at school. Each year the government provides $1 million to trial innovative projects.

Projects so far have focussed on areas such as mentoring, outdoor education, literacy and numeracy projects, health, well-being or self esteem, early intervention.

"The innovations funding pool has the potential to raise achievement for students who may otherwise fail at school. This government is committed to all inclusive education system that helps us, as a nation and as individuals, achieve to our full potential," Trevor Mallard said.

"The Best Evidence Synthesis research, released in July last year, focuses on the evidence about what actually makes a difference for children, and found that within the education system, the quality of teaching practices by educators is the largest influence on the achievement of children in schooling.

“Developing better professional practice from this kind of robust evidence base is crucial if we are to improve learning outcomes for all New Zealand children.

" It is an exciting opportunity to try new approaches and change the school environment to make it more supportive of at risk children."
