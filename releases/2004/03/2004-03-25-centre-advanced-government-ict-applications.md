The proposal to create a 'Centre for Advanced Government ICT Applications' by the Information and Technology Association of New Zealand (ITANZ) was today acknowledged by State Services Minister Trevor Mallard, and Associate Information Technology Minister David Cunliffe.

The ministers said the proposal raised a number of significant questions about both the purpose of the public sector usage of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and the future of the New Zealand ICT industry.

"While all suggestions for growing the ICT sector and its value to the New Zealand economy are welcomed, we need to consider them in the context of the Government’s Digital Strategy Review," Trevor Mallard and David Cunliffe said.

“Before the government can commit itself to any action we have asked that ITANZ discuss these issues with the State Services Commission, the Ministry of Economic Development, and other relevant agencies.

“Until this process is concluded, the government is not in a position to make any further comment on the proposal."
