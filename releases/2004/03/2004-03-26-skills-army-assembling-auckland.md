Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard says the Labour-Progressive government’s industry training programme continues to find success.

The march towards a more skilled workforce is taking major strides with figures showing over 19,000 workers in on-the-job training in Auckland last year.

Judith Tizard issued details of industry training for the Auckland area, including engineering and baking (3,139), road transport (2,352), hospitality (2,013), aviation, tourism and travel (1,423), and sport, fitness and recreation (1,369).

Nationwide, industry training numbers grew by almost 20,000 – or 19 per cent – last year, reaching a record high of 126,870 trainees. In the Auckland City Council area, a total of 19,060 workers participated in industry training last year.

In addition, a further 1,096 young people were learning on-the-job through Modern Apprenticeships in the greater Auckland region during 2003. This programme, initiated by the Labour-led government, is now producing its first graduates, with 215 Modern Apprentices graduating nationwide.

The government is investing $25.2 million in the Modern Apprenticeships Scheme this financial year.

“What's great about the modern apprenticeship programme is people are getting into work they actually enjoy and local industries gain the skilled workforce they desperately need," said Judith Tizard. “Nationwide, 14,181 National Certificates were completed last year – a 45 per cent increase on the 2002 numbers.

“The Labour-led government is aiming to get 150,000 workers into industry training by the end of 2005. Last year's budget invested $85 million over the next four years.

"I’m delighted that unemployment is reducing and more and more young people are getting better training and employment options.”
