A life sciences business delegation from Iowa led by state Governor Thomas Vilsack visits New Zealand next week to explore opportunities for new partnerships in science, biotechnology and other business ventures.

The Governor and his delegation will visit Auckland, Wellington and Dunedin, meeting Government ministers and representatives of the life sciences and agricultural research industry, including potential business partners.

“The Governor’s visit with a business delegation provides an opportunity to promote New Zealand’s research and innovation capabilities," says Minister of Research, Science and Technology Pete Hodgson.

“Governor Vilsack has embarked on an ambitious programme to transform Iowa’s economy and add greater value to its agricultural industry — so we obviously have a lot in common.

"Visits such as this help foster the international linkages that are so important for growth and innovation in New Zealand. I am delighted that someone of Governor Vilsack’s stature is able to visit us."

Governor Vilsack is the Chair of the Democratic Governors' Association and a member of the National Governors' Association Executive Committee. He has been Governor of Iowa since 1998 with an emphasis on making Iowa a national leader in life sciences and value-added agriculture.

Governor Vilsack’s delegation includes CEOs and managing directors of Iowa agri-tech and biotech companies, investment companies, an energy holding company, and Vice-Provosts for Research from Iowa’s two main universities.
