Research, Science and Technology Minister Pete Hodgson today welcomed the news that New Zealand company CMS Alphatech has won a $6 million contract to design and supply more than 200 giant magnets for an Australian Synchrotron under construction in Victoria.

The Synchrotron project is estimated to cost $206 million and is due for completion in 2007. The Premier of Victoria, John Brumby, describes it as "Australia’s most exciting scientific infrastructure project in decades".

“CMS Alphatech's success against stiff competition from Europe, Russia and China shows New Zealand is up there with the best in componentry for frontier research and development,” Mr Hodgson said.

The magnets for the Australian Synchrotron’s storage ring will be up to 1.7 metres long and weigh up to 7.5 tonnes. They will be used to force electrons into a circular path, creating the intense beams of synchrotron light which can be used to study the composition of matter.

Synchrotrons are invaluable tools for groundbreaking research in biological and life sciences, mining and geoscience, and for manufacturing pharmaceuticals, new age materials and micro machines.

CMS Alphatech has been supplying the research and medical physics communities in Australia for more than 15 years. The magnets will be built at Buckley Systems in Auckland, which has been manufacturing electromagnets for particle accelerators since the 1970s.

Together CMS Alphatech and Buckley Systems have designed and produced magnets for the Australian National University’s particle accelerator and other installations in the USA, Europe and Japan.
