The Communications Minister Paul Swain has today received the petition from the organisers of the Call for Change campaign.

Mr Swain thanked representatives of TelstraClear, Ihug, Slingshot and Compass who presented documents from an estimated 61,000 people, who took part in the campaign about competition in the domestic telecommunications market.

Mr Swain says local loop unbundling is perhaps the most critical issue facing the telecommunications sector for the next decade.

"Since I received the final report of the Telecommunications Commissioner in December, I have received submissions in favour of his recommendations, and submissions opposed to them."

Mr Swain told the Call for Change campaigners he would not comment on the detail of the Commissioner's report, or the submissions.

"However I am determined to make the right decision, and ensure all the submissions are properly analysed. The government is doing a lot of work behind the scenes at the moment on this issue. It is important we get certainty for the telecommunications market, and I will be announcing my decision in May."
