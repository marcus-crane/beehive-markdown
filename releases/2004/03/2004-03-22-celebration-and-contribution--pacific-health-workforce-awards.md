Kia orana, Fakaalofa lahi atu, Malo Ni, Halo Olaketa, Malo e lelei, Ni sa bula, Namaste, Talofa lava, Kia ora tatou katoa

I’d like to acknowledge the presence of Dr Bruce Scroggins CEO for the Health Research Council, Dr Debbie Ryan, Chief Advisor Pacific for the Ministry of Health and Chair of the Assessing Committee and Capital Coast Health, Faamatuainu Tino Pereira, Ministry of Health, Debbie Sorenson, CEO South Seas, other distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.

It is always an honour for me to address a gathering of Pacific peoples from our many different cultures that are achieving in their field of endeavour.

In particular, it is my pleasure to be here today at the second Pacific Health Workforce awards to celebrate their presentation to this year’s recipients.

At present there are comparatively small numbers of Pacific people working in the Health Sector particularly at management level.

I must congratulate the Ministry of Health, particularly the Pacific Branch of the Ministry of Health’s Public Health Directorate, for initiating today’s awards.

I must also congratulate the Health Council, which administers these awards.

But most of all I want to acknowledge today’s award winners for their commitment in answering the call to serve their communities and to help ease the health burdens facing Pacific peoples in New Zealand.

I understand that these awards are designed to encourage Pacific students to train in health or management areas to help address the lack of trained Pacific Health care workers and leaders.

New Zealand and Pacific communities need high calibre people working in the health field and in management leadership roles. I believe that they and New Zealand deserve nothing less than the best. You represent our journey, as a people, towards better outcomes in the Health sector.

However this easier said than done. Pacific peoples face economic barriers such as low income levels, which hinder their ability to enter, stay and complete their studies and achieve at higher levels of education.

These Awards are an investment, not only in each individual, but also in the future of our country, Aotearoa New Zealand.

I believe that the acknowledgement of Pacific cultures plays an important part in addressing Health issues for Pacific peoples. It is good to see that Pacific cultural aspects are being incorporated more into health support services.

We have seen its success, where Pacific providers, have provided the leadership, momentum in delivering appropriate, and effective support services for Pacific peoples.

Their approach and initiatives work because their health care workers have a better understanding of the cultural norms, values, language and pressures on their Pacific clients.

You will play an important part in sharing that understanding, with others wherever you work in the health field.

This approach, incorporating Pacific cultural values, is reflected in the Awards Pacific mentoring programme, which supports each recipient during their studies.

Increasingly mentoring is being adopted as an effective learning tool to provide better access to the expertise, experience and support for the student and ultimately higher standards of achievement.

Mentoring is not new to Pacific peoples. We have used it for generations. It is good to see this approach used as a key part of the Awards support programme.

I believe that the Pacific Health Workforce Awards are a forward thinking initiative, which will make the contribution of Pacific peoples to New Zealand stronger.

I am told that this year’s Award winners are of exceptionally high calibre. These awards recognise that you each, have the potential to feature among the best and to be leaders in the health sector.

It is up to you to fulfil that potential. I am confident that you will all do so. Today represents another landmark in achieving that vision.

However truly fulfilling that vision is, it requires courage, commitment and leadership. Just as you are continuing the journey started by those who have gone before, it is up to you to lead and inspire those who come after you.

I congratulate today’s Award winners, and wish you well for your studies.
