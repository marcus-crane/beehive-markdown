Education Minister Trevor Mallard today visited one of Auckland’s newest secondary schools, Botany Downs Secondary College, in Manukau City.

Trevor Mallard congratulated all those involved in the school's development, saying its recent New Zealand Award for Architecture was just one of the college's high points.

"The college's state-of-the-art facilities provide a great learning environment for its students and the establishment board has worked hard to make this happen," Trevor Mallard said.

"This government is committed to ensuring that we meet the needs of every single student. The college has flexible teaching spaces, special needs facility and ICT access throughout the school which will all give students the opportunity to meet their full potential.

"The government has invested more than $21 million in the college to date, in site works and buildings, furniture and equipment, ICT, learning and teaching resources, library resources, and professional development for the board of trustees and staff."

The Year 9-15 co-educational school opened its doors for the start of the school year. The college currently has around 300 Year 9 students and will grow one Year-group at a time to a planned roll of 1500.

The Ministry of Education purchased land for the college in 1998 and building started in 2002.

Botany Downs Secondary College was established to meet the population growth projected in the Auckland Regional Growth Strategy.
