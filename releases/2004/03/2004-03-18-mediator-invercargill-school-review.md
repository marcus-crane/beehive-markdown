Auckland University law lecturer and mediator Deborah Clapshaw is to be the independent mediator for the school network review in Invercargill, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

"The Community Trust of Southland and the Southland School Trustees Association, who have been leading the consultation on mediation, have contacted me to say that consensus has been reached by schools to have Deborah Clapshaw as the mediator.

"I have agreed to their recommendation."

Deborah Clapshaw is available to start on the mediation process immediately.

"I am confident that she will work through the process thoroughly, carefully and quickly so final decisions can be made to bring stability and certainty to the future of local education in the Invercargill area, for the sake of local students," Trevor Mallard said.

"I am still keen to make my final decision on the Invercargill review in April.

"The longer schools have to get on with the job, and prepare and plan for the implementation of any changes in time for the start of the 2005 school year, the better it will be for all concerned," Trevor Mallard said.
