High Court Judge Justice Eddie Durie has been appointed to the Law Commission, the Minister Responsible for the Law Commission David Benson-Pope announced today.

Justice Durie will replace Justice Patrick Keane, who left the Law Commission on being appointed to the High Court bench last year.

The six-member Law Commission is an independent government-funded advisory body which reviews areas of the law that need updating, reforming or developing.

Justice Durie has been a member of the judiciary since his appointment as a Judge of the Maori Land Court in 1974, the first such appointment for a person of Maori descent. He was subsequently appointed Chief Judge of the Maori Land Court, Chairman of the Waitangi Tribunal and, in 1998, a Judge of the High Court.

"The Law Commission provides high quality independent opinion and thus helps create informed debate on many public policy issues. I welcome the appointment of Justice Durie. He is highly respected as a specialist in the area of Maori land law, and has much to contribute to the work of the Commission," Mr Benson-Pope said.

Justice Durie will take up the position in July after a period of sabbatical leave.
