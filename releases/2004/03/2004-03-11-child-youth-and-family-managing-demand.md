Child, Youth and Family Minister Ruth Dyson said today she has confidence that the strategies and actions the department has put in place to better manage increased notification demand will result in all cases being dealt with in an appropriate time.

“In the December, January and February period, we have had a 40 per cent increase in notifications. That has put huge additional pressure on the department, but this pressure must receive a response which deals with the additional notifications to my satisfaction.”

Ms Dyson said several specific actions were already underway and more were almost completed.

“Seventy additional social workers have been employed since the beginning of the year. Administrative assistants are being employed so that social workers can concentrate on their professional tasks, instead of becoming bogged down with paper work. The department is working with community organisations so that the workload can be shared, in cases where the statutory role of Child, Youth and Family is not required.

“A demand management strategy is nearly completed and this will provide further actions for the department to follow. This was one of the recommendations of the baseline review.

“It is important that the public know that the term ‘unallocated’ does not mean that phone calls to Child, Youth and Family are being ignored. The cases are regularly monitored to ensure child safety, and I am confident that the actions now underway will give us this outcome.”

Ruth Dyson said it was also vital that the findings of the baseline review were not ignored.

“The issues of ‘quantity’ must not be at the expense of ‘quality’. The quality of care and support that we offer children and their families plays an important part in dealing with increased demand because it means we don’t keep seeing the same children time and time again.

“Ill-informed political pressure from the opposition will not distract me as minister, or the department, from ensuring that this quality is delivered.”
