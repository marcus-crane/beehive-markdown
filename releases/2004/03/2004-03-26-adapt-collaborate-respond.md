Opening speech to the E-Government 'Nothing but Net' conference, Ilot theatre, Wellington Town Hall

I stand here before you with two and a half hats on.

As Minister for State Services I want to ensure that government agencies best deliver New Zealanders with the services that they need.

As Minister of Education I want to ensure that our children are well served by our education system.

And as Associate Minister of Finance I want to make sure our country continues to prosper economically.

All of us here are committed to delivering the best quality of service in our own different areas.

The question we must ask is: what is the best way to do that?

- by continually improving and refining the process of delivering government services;
- by planning for the future; and
- by being adaptive, collaborative and responsive.

These three words - adaptive, collaborative and responsive - are the theme for this conference - and the theme for my speech today.

First, I will talk about the changing environment for the State sector. I will then change hats to Education, to illustrate what adaptive, collaborative and responsive means in the real world.

Recent reviews have found that we don’t need to change the foundations of our public management system.

We do need to rethink how we work together - how to get better performance, without jeopardising our high standards or jeopardising our reputation for cost efficiency.

Life for most New Zealanders has changed dramatically over the past 20 years. Therefore, the priorities for central and local government have also changed - sometimes slowly, but more often rapidly.

The electronic revolution is playing a large part in this change. I read in the media recently that 95 per cent of all college students own cell phones and, apparently, some children sleep with them turned on so they don’t miss text messages.

The world is changing. Our kids are more ICT savvy than we could ever be and the way we operate needs to reflect this.

We are seeing service delivery innovations across central and local government.

In local government the recent work undertaken by the City of Dunedin and Upper Hutt City Council stands out. In central government the initiatives undertaken by Land Information New Zealand, Inland Revenue, and the Land Transport Safety Authority have been groundbreaking.

Another excellent example was in the aftermath of the recent floods.  
Mobile teams from Work & Income and the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries were in the field, visiting properties and towns authorizing emergency benefits on the spot.

This is adaptive, responsive and collaborative government in practice.

These initiatives are a good foundation for the future - a first step.

However, the demands and drivers on our organisations will change as much or more over the next 5 – 10 years as they have in the past 20 – 25.

Now is the time to build upon our existing foundations. Now is the time to put systems in place for the future.

Why?

- because New Zealanders are diverse and we don’t have the same issues, problems and needs;
- because the way issues affect people doesn’t always fit neatly into the organisational structures of central and local government; and
- mostly because things can change, sometimes quite rapidly.

All of us can rise to this challenge by being:

- adaptive – to meet changing circumstances;
- collaborative – to deliver services people need, in the way they need them; and
- responsive – delivering when, where and how they are needed by all New Zealanders.

I believe that what is happening in the education sector is a model of what will increasingly happen right across central and local government over the next few years.

The concept is that of the “connected learner” and it is about:

- putting the learner at the centre;
- designing government services and interventions around the learner;
- recognising that those services and the schools and tertiary providers are increasing linked; and
- that linking is both necessary and essential to achieving good education outcomes.

New Zealand has one of the highest levels of average achievement for 15 year-olds but one of the largest gaps between its highest and lowest achievers?

To reduce this gap and improve overall education outcomes for all New Zealanders will require significant shifts in how we think about our education system.

Individual providers may be better concentrating on excellence in fewer areas and collaborating and networking with others to cover the range.

We are seeing a great example of this collaboration in action in schools in Otago where an effective e-learning network, OtagoNet, is developing around a number of schools.

I recently shared a video conferencing history lesson with a group of year 12 students where the teacher was based in East Otago and the students were in Palmerston, Wanaka and Ranfurly.

We expect upward of 70 classes per week across all curricular areas being provided through the government funded video-conferencing bridge this year.

These networks extend the reach and range of learning opportunities for students. They make better use of teachers and resources and make teaching certain subjects viable.

They also provide social benefits as students can meet and work with each other in a range of virtual environments.

This is real progress.

It emphasises shared responsibilities and the importance of getting the roles of different stakeholders better understood, aligned and connected.

It moves the centre of focus from 'the system' to the learner. It connects that learner to:

- the resources – libraries, web services, educators and community resources;
- the providers – whether early childhood, primary, secondary, tertiary or adult;
- their community – parents, iwi, employers, boards of trustees, others; and
- the government (the Ministry of Education, NZQA, Education Review Office, Tertiary Education Commission and others).

ICT resources - such as the Internet, telecommunications, CD ROM’s, and software - are already helping learning experiences.

ICT also supports informal contact between learners and teachers in both on-line and off-line environments.

ICT gives learners direct access to potentially vast arrays of knowledge and learning resources and enables learning to take place in a wide variety of settings.

The changes underway in the education sector to meet today and tomorrow’s education requirements are profound.

For these changes to result in successful education outcomes for New Zealanders then the way we deliver education services must also evolve.

Under the chairmanship of Howard Fancy from the Ministry of Education, representatives from several education agencies are working to improve education outcomes through collaborative development and use of ICT.

The group is called the Education Sector ICT Standing Committee.

Currently the agencies are working together on:

- an education internet portal providing a cost effective way of putting together a range of audiences with the resources they need;
- an education architectural framework of common ICT standards to enable interoperability and shared initiative – rather like e-GIF for the education sector; and
- common standards (and possibly infrastructure) for security – looking at authentication, access, and authorisation.

Working together is necessary for the education sector to adapt to changing education requirements. Working together will help them to respond to the needs of learners and providers. Working together will help New Zealand to achieve the education outcomes we need to remain economically competitive, and to remain a great place to live.

On an ongoing basis I expect to see high levels of collaboration in the education sector on systems that interact with providers, students and other stakeholders.

And I expect to see high levels of back-office collaboration in ICT infrastructure and in the use of data for policy analysis.

If what is happening in the Education sector sounds awfully like e-government in miniature that’s because that’s exactly what it is.

The work in the education sector is based on the tools of e-government. This includes the portal components, the e-GIF interoperability standards, and the design work by the authentication team. These basic tools are being customised for education sector needs.

And, when the time comes, the education sector agencies will feed their innovations back into e-government, which will benefit other parts of central and local government.

The E-government Unit is closely involved with education sector agencies. This includes supporting and advising chief executives and senior managers across a range of initiatives.

In doing so the EGU is drawing on policy, business and technology components and expertise developed over the past four years.

You will hear more about these components as the day progresses.

The E-government programme is now nearing its fourth year. The indications from international commentators are that - in typical low-key Kiwi fashion - we have been making good, sustainable progress, without shouting about it from the rooftops.

However, there is a long way to go and room for improvement.

Like the education sector, we are all going to have to get much better at collaborating across agencies and organisations and between central and local government to deliver effective and efficient services to our people and businesses.

Each of us has a responsibility to ensure that our organisation is well-positioned to contribute to e-government. Well positioned individually, as part of a cluster of related agencies, and as part of central and local government.

This will assist us to provide good services to New Zealanders from a public sector that adapts to change, collaborates to deliver, and responds to need.

A net*working* government is a government that is *working* for New Zealand.
