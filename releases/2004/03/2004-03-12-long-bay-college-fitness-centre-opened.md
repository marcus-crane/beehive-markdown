Education Minister Trevor Mallard today officially opened a new fitness centre at Long Bay College, Auckland, praising the school's goal of working closely with the Torbay community and primary schools in the area.

"This excellent $1.4 million fitness centre is a tribute to the fine work of the school board, staff, parents, and local community," Trevor Mallard said.

"Involving the community in this venture as an after hours facility is great and in keeping with the school's philosophy of having close ties with its neighbourhood through all its activities.

"I'm told that many former students are coming along to the fitness centre and the aerobics studio and climbing wall are proving extremely popular.

"Health and physical wellbeing is one of the essential learning areas of the school curriculum and the new fitness centre gives students excellent new opportunities to learn and develop.

"Facilities in the centre include a sprung wooden floor for dancing and computerised systems for measuring fitness and designing individual programmes for students to improve their fitness.

"With this new fitness centre, the school and students can set and achieve goals for fitness through good programmes and top facilities.

"The goal of life long fitness is one that must be supported at school. Long Bay College is providing its students with a special opportunity to support this goal. It's also linking in to primary schools in the area."

Trevor Mallard said funding for the new centre had come from the government's property funding, board of trustee's fundraising and a $217,000 grant from the ASB Charitable Trust.
