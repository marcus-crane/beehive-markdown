A research programme to strengthen the understanding of teaching and learning and what works in the classroom for students has had its annual funding doubled to $2 million, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

"This new funding will be available from the beginning of next year and ensures we can continue the important work we are doing in the early childhood, school and tertiary sectors to raise student achievement through quality teaching.

"Our government believes in opportunity and access to education for everyone, regardless of their background, and we want to see every single student reach their full potential in education.

"It is critical we build our knowledge base in this key area of research so we can better understand what works in the classroom, and apply this new knowledge to assist all our students."

Trevor Mallard said the Teaching and Learning Research Initiative was announced in the 2002. Doubling the funding from next year would support more research, but also build research capability and strengthen the links between researchers and practitioners.

The selection of the first research proposals to receive funding under the initiative was made last year. Initiatives included projects considering children's experiences and teachers' practices at kindergarten, and research to improve tertiary student outcomes in their first year of study.

"With over 180 applications received in the first round of funding, but only 13 projects able to receive funding, it is clear we have a significant opportunity to build the level of research activity further," Trevor Mallard said.

"The increase in funding effectively doubles the amount of research occurring through this initiative. I believe this will be a huge encouragement to researchers and practitioners currently looking at putting proposals forward."

The New Zealand Council of Educational Research has been contracted to manage the programme on behalf of the Ministry of Education. A team of specialists in key areas of educational research will manage the initiative and assist the researchers.

Researchers will be invited to apply for the new funding later in the year.  
A list of the research projects funded last year is attached.

**2003 funding recipients**  
**Teaching and Learning Research Initiative (TLRI)**

**One year contracts:**

**The Connect.ed action research project**  
Louise Starkey and Jedd Bartlett, The Correspondence School, Wellington.

Connect.ed is a programme developed by the Correspondence School to enable one hundred full-time year 9 and 10 students to learn through the internet. Connect.ed teachers will work with the researchers to seek to improve teaching practice, develop understandings about the elements of the Connect.ed programme, and improve student learning through e-learning and inquiry.

**Who, what, how and why? Profiles, practices, pedagogies, and self-perception of adult literacy practitioners.**  
Dr Robyn Chandler, Canterbury Adult Basic Education Research Network (CABERN), Christchurch.

The project team members are part of a larger local network of practitioners and researchers and will profile a variety of practitioners throughout Canterbury.

**Narrative of beginning Maori teachers: identifying forces that shape the first year of teaching**  
Paora Stucki, School of Education, Te Wananga o Aotearoa.

Many beginning teachers, particularly Maori, find the reality of "real" teaching overwhelming and this research aims to identify the forces that shape the ways beginning Maori teachers negotiate this first year, signalling ways to support beginning Maori teachers.

**The relationship between English language and mathematics learning for non-native speakers**  
Phillipa Neville-Barton, School of English and Applied Linguistics, UNITEC Institute of Technology, Auckland.

This study examines the language factors in secondary and tertiary mathematics learning for students who do not have English as their first language, in particular the characteristics of spoken and written language they find difficult.

**Two-year contracts:**

**Effective teaching in different cultural contexts: a comparative analysis of language, culture and pedagogy**  
Dr Leonie Pihama, Director International Research for Maori and Indigenous Education; Dr Tupeni Baba, Professor of Pacific Studies; Dr Trish Stoddart, Professor of Classrooms and Schools. International Research Institute for Maori and Indigenous Education (IRI), Centre for Pacific Studies, and School of Education at the University of Auckland.

A collaborative team of Maori, Pasifika and Pakeha researchers and practitioners will conduct a cross-cultural comparative study of instructional policies and practice and student outcomes in three intermediate year 7-8 school contexts where the degree of cultural engagement varies.

**Improving tertiary student outcomes in their first year of study**  
Nick Zepke, Linda Leach and Tom Prebble, School of Education, Massey University.

This research will explore what New Zealand tertiary education institutions and teachers can do to adapt their current processes and practices to improve retention, persistence and completion of diverse students in their first year.

**Whakawhanaungatanga - partnerships in bicultural development in early childhood care and education.**  
Dr Jenny Ritchie, University of Waikato.

This research focuses on building relationships with whanau Maori as a strategy for implementing bicultural development within early childhood settings.

**Enhanced teaching and learning of comprehension in years 5-8: a research/ practice collaboration for Mangere schools.**  
Professor Stuart McNaughton, Woolf Fisher Research Centre, University of Auckland.

A researcher / practitioner partnership to determine the extent of the challenges for effective teaching of comprehension and to create better teaching methods to meet those challenges.

**Making sense of learning at secondary school: an exploration *by* teachers *with* students.**  
Professor Ruth G Kane, College of Education, Massey University.

This project, using teachers as researchers and students as active respondents, examines ways in which students’ learning processes are shaped by what happens in secondary school classrooms.

**Great expectations: enhancing learning and strengthening teaching in primary schools with diverse student populations through action research.** Dr Mary Hill, School of Education, University of Waikato.

Teacher / researchers from six schools, ranging from decile 1-10 and located in Auckland, Hamilton and Taumarunui, plan to investigate how teaching and learning can be systematically improved, and how expectations are implicated in this.

**Under three-year olds in kindergarten: children's experiences and teachers' practices.**  
Dr Judith Duncan, Children's Issues Centre, University of Otago, in conjunction with Dr Carmen Dalli, School of Education, Victoria University.

This project aims to investigate the experiences of two-year olds in four kindergartens to assist teachers in their planning and assessment practices.  
**Mathematics enhancement project: professional development research.** Associate Professor Bill Barton and Dr Hannah Bartholomew, Department of Mathematics, University of Auckland.

As part of a major research and development project in Manukau secondary schools, this project focuses on the delivery of professional development to secondary mathematics teachers, and on the mathematics classroom as a learning environment.

**Numeracy and practices change.**  
Associate Professor Glenda Anthony and Dr Margaret Walshaw, Department of Technology, Science and Mathematics Education, Massey University.

This multi-faceted collaborative investigation draws upon diverse populations of teachers and students and addresses issues of equity, proficiency, and sustainable practice through the opportunities made available in recent numeracy reforms.

**BACKGROUND TO TEACHING & LEARNING RESEARCH INITIATIVE**

In May 2002 the government established the Teaching and Learning Research Initiative (TLRI) programme to build knowledge about teaching and learning which in turn will lead to significantly improved outcomes for learners. Research undertaken in all areas of the education sector, from early childhood centres to industry training organisations, kura and wananga, is eligible for funding under the Initiative.

To enhance the potential of the research findings to inform practice, the Initiative emphasises partnerships between researchers and practitioners, with this approach expected at all stages of the process from the research design to communicating the results to teachers and other educators.

The project priorities determine there must be demonstrable strategic, research and practice value based on six principles:

- the research will address themes of strategic importance to education in New Zealand;
- it will draw on related overseas work and build upon New Zealand-based research evidence;
- the research will address strategic themes and be forward looking;
- the project design will to enable substantive and robust findings;
- the research will recognise the central role of the teacher in learning; and
- the projects will be undertaken as a partnership between researchers and practitioners.

Three levels of funding were available under the scheme:

- A - large-scale projects (maximum $400,000) of up to three years with a $150,000 maximum for any project in the first year.
- B - medium-scale projects (maximum $180,000) of up to two years with a cap of $90,000 for any project in any one year.
- C - small-scale projects ($15,000–$30,000) often with an emphasis on practitioner-driven, researcher-supported projects.

The programme has annual funding for three years of $1 million, although funding for projects of more than one year is conditional upon continued government funding of the TLRI and on satisfactory performance during the first funding cycle.
