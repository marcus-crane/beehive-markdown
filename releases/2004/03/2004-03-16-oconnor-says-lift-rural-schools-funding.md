Associate Rural Affairs Minister Damien O'Connor says he supports a needs review of rural schools because it could well lead to increased funding.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced yesterday he would review rural schools' isolated funding, to see whether rural weighting was necessary in targeting need.

Today he said the review could lead to isolated schools receiving more money, a concept Mr O'Connor supported wholeheartedly.

"The rural sector has been asking for years that its schools' funding to be looked at, in the hope that a review would reveal how hopelessly under-funded rural schools are.

"I see this review as a opportunity to increase the level of funding to those schools, based on the additional needs they face."

It was clear that special funding for isolated schools was needed, Mr O'Connor said

"It goes without saying that there are additional costs involved in delivering quality education to pupils in rural schools, especially in poorer rural schools.

"These schools are affected by transport and resource costs not faced by more advantaged schools in urban areas and there needs to be recognition of this."

Mr O'Connor said he'd supported Mr Mallard's school network review because it's objective was better quality education and he'd back a school funding review if it was driven by the same objective.

"The school review process has been focussed on delivering better education, and in the case of rural reviews, providing more for schools by pooling resources and skills. A funding review could also improve rural schooling, but only if the rural pupils' best interests are at the heart of it."

Mr O'Connor said he'd be working closely with his colleagues who had an interest in rural education to ensure the review recognised the rural community's needs.
