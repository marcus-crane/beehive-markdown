Supergrans Aotearoa will receive a one-off grant of $10,500, Child, Youth and Family Minister Ruth Dyson announced today. The money will come from Child, Youth and Family’s Contingency and Innovation Fund.

Ms Dyson said Supergrans became a national organisation in November 2003, and needed the grant to cement the establishment of a national office and national coordinator role.

“Supergrans’ training, information and advocacy services make a vital difference to people struggling with the pressures of modern life. The one-off grant recognises that fieldworkers are dealing with increasingly complex and demanding cases, and that Supergrans’ work requires the support and coordination of a national office.

“The grant will provide interim support for the organisation while its new national coordinator establishes his role and explores other sources of funding.”

Last year, Supergrans’ 130 fieldworkers and support people made contact with 15,000 people. Some received practical help with managing their households, Some attended Supergrans courses on budget planning, vegetable gardening, cooking or sewing. Others improved their employment prospects by by attending Supergrans’ training courses in literacy and numeracy, computer and office skills, or hospitality and food service.
