The Immigration Minister Paul Swain says the Director of Security has confirmed that the Security Intelligence Service did have the opportunity to comment before the individuals in question were granted permanent residence.

"The SIS was not aware of security concerns at that stage and therefore did not object to them being granted permanent residence."

"The SIS became aware later that they were of security concern and therefore did recommend against them being granted citizenship and thus a New Zealand passport."

"The SIS has not recommended that the permanent residence of the three individuals be revoked."

"The Director had objected to them being granted citizenship, and thus a New Zealand passport, under the provisions of the Citizenship Act which require that a person be of good character to be granted citizenship. Under that heading security concerns are relevant."

"The provisions for revoking permanent residence under the Immigration Act are very specifically defined. The Director of Security has NOT made a recommendation for revoking permanent residence. I have received no information from the Director suggesting that those provisions might be met."

"The Director of Security assures me that for the time being he is satisfied with them not having obtained citizenship and thus a passport. He is NOT recommending that I take any further action."
