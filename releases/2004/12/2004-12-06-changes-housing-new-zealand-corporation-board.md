Housing Minister Steve Maharey today announced changes to the board of Housing New Zealand Corporation, including the appointment of Pat Snedden as the new board chair.

Pat Snedden replaces Roger Bonifant, who retired in September. Maryan Street has been appointed deputy chair.

Steve Maharey said Mr Bonifant steered Housing New Zealand through a substantial period of change, particularly leading up to and following its incorporation three years ago.

“Roger has done a great job and hands Pat the reins at a pivotal time. Housing New Zealand Corporation is broadening its scope and increasingly venturing into more innovative ways to provide homes to New Zealanders and support the wider housing sector.”

David Lange and David Pritchard have also retired from the Board and three new members have been appointed: Hanlin Johnstone, Christchurch; Tony Paine, Christchurch; and Ross Mulholland, Wellington.

Hanlin Johnstone is a non–executive director of Fulton Hogan Ltd. He has been a director of Genesis Energy since establishment in April 1999 and is a director of Jade Stadium Ltd, Dunedin Casinos Ltd and City Council Facilities Ltd.

Tony Paine is Director (CEO) of the Christchurch Arts Centre, having worked in a number of management and social services roles with ComCare Trust and Christchurch Methodist Mission.

Ross Mulholland is an experienced property lawyer, having worked as a partner and national chairman of Phillips Fox. He has recently been a director of the New Zealand Railways Corporation and a member of the Higher Salaries Commission.

The Housing New Zealand Corporation board now comprises: Pat Snedden, chair; Maryan Street, deputy chair; Lope Heath; Susan Huria; Hanlin Johnstone; Ross Mulholland; Tony Paine; and Paul White.
