The government has today tabled in Parliament its response to the Report of the Health Select Committee Inquiry into the exposure of New Zealand defence personnel to Agent Orange and other defoliant chemicals during the Vietnam War and any health effects of that exposure.

In its response the government has acknowledged that Vietnam veterans have waited a long time to have their experiences in Vietnam heard.

Welcoming the outcome Veterans Affairs Minister George Hawkins says the government recognises the importance of understanding these experiences.

"I am very happy that I'm the Minister in charge in a government which has seen the need for these issues to be investigated and addressed.

"In light of the information made available resulting from the detailed research undertaken by the NZ Defence Force the government offers a formal apology to Vietnam veterans for the failure of governments in the past to recognise that the veterans were exposed to a toxic environment during their service in Vietnam.

"We already have support in place for Vietnam veterans and their families. Vietnam veterans who have disabilities which may be attributable to their service in Vietnam can make application for a war pension. In fact, New Zealand’s war pension system is unique in that it is based on a reverse onus of proof where the presumption is that the disability arises from military service, unless it can be proven otherwise.

"Changes are being planned to streamline the war pensions process including a review of the process of referral to medical specialists. Any veterans who consider that their claims were not fairly considered in the past are able to request that their claims be reviewed.

"The children of New Zealand’s Vietnam veterans who suffer from spina bifida, cleft lip/palate, acute myeloid leukaemia or adrenal gland cancer are able to access fully funded care for those conditions. The children are also able to access genetic counselling and support for any mental health issues they might have. This package of support for the children maintains parity with that offered to the children of Vietnam veterans in Australia. Additionally, the government has reaffirmed its commitment to monitor international research and the programmes of entitlements that are made available by other governments to the children and grandchildren of Vietnam veterans.

"The announcement today recognises a very important phase in New Zealand's involvement in the Vietnam conflict.

"The decisions the government has taken will give veterans an opportunity to reflect on the positive outcome of having their experiences heard and considered.
