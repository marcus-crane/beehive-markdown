Prime Minister Helen Clark says a combined threat assessment group, CTAG, has been established to strengthen New Zealand’s threat assessment capabilities.

Helen Clark says the group comprises officials from Police, the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service, the New Zealand Defence Force, and the Government Communications Security Bureau.

“The group ensures that all available streams of intelligence and information are incorporated into assessing terrorist threats, crime in countries being visited by New Zealanders, and other potential threats to New Zealand and its interests,” Helen Clark said.

“It is hosted within the SIS and brings together assessors and intelligence staff from a range of government agencies with responsibilities for protecting New Zealand and its interests from a wide range of threats.

“CTAG mirrors recent developments in other nations, including Australia, Canada, the United States, and Britain, and has linkages with those countries’ assessment units.”

Helen Clark said the CTAG concept was approved by Cabinet in February this year.

“Since then officials have been putting in place the people, technology, and administrative systems. This is now complete, and CTAG is producing and delivering assessments which assist in planning and preparing for significant events, such as the ninetieth anniversary of Gallipoli next year.”

The group’s costs are being met from within current agency baselines, and its formation did not require any new funding. Staff assigned to CTAG remain part of their parent organisations.
