A boost to Auckland's film and television capability is expected to  
benefit the national screen production industry and help secure  
further investment in New Zealand production and post-production  
companies, Industry Development Minister Jim Anderton said today.

The Auckland Regional Economic Development Strategy and Film Auckland  
are to receive up to $2 million over the next three years from New  
Trade & Enterprise's regional partnership programme to help  
establish the Auckland Screen Production Major Regional Initiative,

The MRI development includes infrastructure development,  
international marketing and training and capability building  
components and includes significant investment sourced from private  
investors.

The Progressive leader said that the screen production industry  
provides a global showcase for New Zealand's talent, creativity and  
innovation.

"We can offer the world our diverse locations, skilled and  
experienced crews, innovative technological capacity, state of the  
art post-production facilities and regional resources. A boost to  
Auckland's film and television capability will benefit the national  
screen production industry and help secure further new investment in  
New Zealand production and post-production companies, Jim Anderton  
said.

"Securing continued international investment is vital for growth and  
the development of our domestic industry and skills. Like all global  
industries, the screen production industry is increasingly mobile and  
we have to offer a package of options and facilities to market New  
Zealand's attractiveness as an investment destination. This facility  
will complement existing national infrastructure and enable us to do  
just that," Jim Anderton said.

An economic impact report prepared for the Auckland Regional Economic  
Development Strategy, or AREDS, projects the MRI will help boost  
gross domestic product by between $32 and $34.7 million between 2005  
and 2010 and facilitate the creation of more than 250 jobs a year.

AREDS chief executive, Dr Susan Macken, says the MRI forms part of a  
major thrust for economic growth within the Auckland region and  
provides an integrated approach to growing New Zealand's screen  
production industry.

"The result will be a vibrant and growing industry leveraging  
existing film production success to attract greater foreign  
investment and earnings â€" substantially contributing to our aim of  
expanding the Auckland region's horizons, building its wealth and  
future community."

The MRI proposal was developed by AREDS in collaboration with the  
Auckland screen production industry (Film Auckland together with  
individual companies) and in consultation with national industry  
bodies such as Film New Zealand, which is New Zealand's national  
location office.
