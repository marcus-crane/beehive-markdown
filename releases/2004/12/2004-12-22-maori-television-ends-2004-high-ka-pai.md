Minister of Maori Affairs, Parekura Horomia is absolutely delighted with the latest ratings that show that more than 667,000 viewers tuned in to watch Maori Television, the channel many said would never rate, in the 12 weeks to 5 December.

"In the eight months that Maori Television has been on air, it has enriched the lives of its viewers through the broadcasting of entertaining, educational and informative programmes in both te reo and English.

"Whilst 45% of all Maori have watched Maori tv, more and more non-Maori are tuning in too. In fact 77% of Maori tv's total audience reach are non-Maori – such is the wide appeal of Maori tv's programming.

"So, as 2004 draws to an end I say ka pai to Maori Television, keep up the good work. I also say kia ora to Jim Mather and welcome to your new role as chief executive.

"I end this press release with an entertainment tip for those seeking something home grown to view on Christmas Night – tune into Maori tv between 7.30pm and 9.30pm and you might catch a glimpse of a Maori hanakoko surrounded by some awesome talent."
