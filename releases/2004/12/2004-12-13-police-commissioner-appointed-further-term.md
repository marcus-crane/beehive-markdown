Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that the Governor-General has approved the reappointment of the Commissioner of Police, Rob Robinson, for a further term of two years.

"The achievements of the New Zealand Police under the leadership of Rob Robinson and his team since 2000 have included marked improvements in operational, administrative, and financial management practices," said Helen Clark.

"Mr Robinson is a strong and principled Commissioner, who enjoys wide support and respect from others in the force.

“His reappointment ensures continuity and stability in the leadership of the New Zealand Police at this time, and will enable him to lead the police through any administrative implications flowing from the current Commission of Inquiry into Police Conduct," Helen Clark said.

Mr Robinson's reappointment takes effect from June 2005.

Helen Clark said the Commissioner had faced weighty administrative and leadership tasks since taking up appointment in 2000.

“Mr Robinson has led a strong institutional recovery from events preceding his appointment, and established a cohesive and effective senior management team from scratch.

“Police have responded effectively to new demands and challenges in the domestic, South Pacific and international law enforcement areas over the past few years.

Mr Robinson served as Acting Commissioner from January to June 2000, before his formal appointment as Commissioner. His police career started in 1975, and he has held a number of senior positions, including Hutt District Commander, Midland Regional Commander, and Assistant Commissioner.
