Queenstown tourists can now have their visitors' permits turned into work permits within 48 hours to help fill labour shortages, Acting Immigration Minister Damien O’Connor and Otago MP David Parker said today.

The Ministry of Social Development (MSD) has declared a seasonal labour shortage in the Queenstown area, meaning the New Zealand Immigration Service can now fast track work permits there.

“David Parker alerted Immigration to the local shortage, and we've worked quickly to respond to it," said Mr O'Connor. "Permits are already being fast tracked for the horticultural industry, but this is the first time the process has applied to all workplaces in an area. This will make it easier for visitors to enter the workforce on a temporary basis."

A MSD staff member in Queenstown has been trained to handle work permit applications from visitors. Applications will then be couriered to the Immigration Service's Dunedin branch, processed and couriered back within 48 hours.

Mr Parker said the announcement would assist local employers, many of whom were experiencing serious shortages during peak seasons. He emphasised that outside the peaks, normal rules would apply to avoid undermining the local labour market.

Mr O’Connor said government departments were doing all they could to help boost the workforce, but employers also had a responsibility to ensure staff were well looked after and had access to affordable accommodation.

“It's my expectation that work permits will only be issued when an employer demonstrates that they've made genuine attempts to address this issue, by either meeting or subsidising the cost of accommodation.”

He said the government recognised that overseas workers were needed to fill labour shortages, but only when it was proven there were no suitable New Zealanders available to fill the vacancies.

Fast tracking permits is one of government's short-term solutions to labour shortages. Last week it also announced an increase in the number of working holidaymakers from 31,000 to 40,000 within two years.

The government has also been meeting with seasonal industry representatives to develop a strategy to address labour issues so seasonal shortages don't occur.
