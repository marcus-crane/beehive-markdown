The CEP agreement completed with Thailand would open up real opportunities for exporters, Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton said today.

The Prime Ministers of New Zealand and Thailand announced in Vientiane  
that negotiations on a New Zealand/Thailand Closer Economic Partnership had been substantively concluded.

Mr Sutton said that an information bulletin containing the key points was [available on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade website](www.mfat.govt.nz/tradeagreements/thainzcep/overview.html) www.mfat.govt.nz and was also being circulated to those with a registered interest in the negotiations.

He said the CEP with Thailand will open up real opportunities for New Zealand exporters in the Thai market.

“Thailand currently has some of the highest trade barriers in the region. It is also actively negotiating free trade agreements with other countries. It is important that New Zealand has been able to get in early with an agreement providing preferential access.”

Mr Sutton said New Zealand saw this bilateral agreement as part of the Government’s wider trade policy strategy of enhancing market access though bilateral, regional and global mechanisms.

“The CEP will support New Zealand’s interest in securing a regional FTA with ASEAN members, in conjunction with Australia.”

The full text of the agreement and the tariff reduction schedules were to be released once finalised and approved.
