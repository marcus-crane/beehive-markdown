The Government today published the text of the Closer Economic Partnership Agreement between New Zealand and Thailand.

Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton said the full details of the Closer Economic Partnership Agreement between New Zealand and Thailand were now available to the New Zealand public, including the arrangements on labour, environment and customs cooperation negotiated in parallel with the CEP.

He said that exporters to the Thai market and other stakeholders with an interest in the agreement could access the complete text of the agreement along with the tariff reduction schedules for Thailand and New Zealand and the product-specific rules of origin on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade website: www.mfat.govt.nz/tradeagreements/thainzcep/overview.html.

“This material complements the information on key outcomes released on 1 December when the conclusion of these negotiations was announced by the Prime Ministers of New Zealand and Thailand.”

Mr Sutton said the agreement would be submitted to Parliament for consideration in the New Year, and would be referred to the foreign affairs, defence, and trade select committee.

It was anticipated that the select committee would seek submissions from the public. Once it had reported back to Parliament, the Agreement would be signed and implementing legislation passed.

Mr Sutton said the target for implementation of the Agreement remained 1 July next year.
