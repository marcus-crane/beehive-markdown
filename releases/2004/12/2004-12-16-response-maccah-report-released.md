The Government today released its response to the report of the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Complementary and Alternative Health (MACCAH).

Health Minister Annette King said the MACCAH’s recommendations were generally aimed at reducing barriers to safe and appropriate use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).

“MACCAH recommended that treatments proven to be safe, efficacious and cost effective should be publicly funded. While I support this recommendation in principle, I acknowledge that there is debate about what constitutes good evidence. In this context I am pleased to note the establishment in July this year of a New Zealand Centre for Evidence-Based Research into Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the University of Otago,” Ms King said.

Some of MACCAH’s recommendations have already been implemented, such as the establishment of a risk-based regulatory framework for health practitioners under the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003.

However, Ms King said some recommendations such as self-regulation of low-risk CAM practitioners and development of research methodologies that are appropriate for CAM treatments could only be implemented by health practitioners and researchers themselves.

Ms King said the Ministry of Health's complementary and alternative medicine website was a vital part of providing consumers with reliable information. Ongoing funding of the website was recommended by the Committee. The website summarises existing research on the safety of various CAM treatments and how well they work.

A CAM summit, organised by the National Health Committee, was held in November as an opportunity for mainstream and CAM sector representatives to discuss how the two sectors can work together in the future to improve the health of New Zealanders.

MINISTERIAL RESPONSE TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE MINISTERIAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE HEALTH

MACCAH recommendationMinisterial response  
1Practitioners of complementary and alternative health should be regulated according to the level of inherent risk involved in the modalities they practice.Support. Consistent with Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003.  
2The process of regulating practitioners of high-risk CAM modalities should continue under the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003.Note.  
3Practitioners of lower-risk CAM modalities should be encouraged to self-regulate through their professional body.Note. Responsibility lies with practitioners and their professional organisations.  
4Practitioners (either biomedical or CAM) who practise one or more CAM modality should undertaken training and monitoring that is appropriate to the risk of each CAM modalityNote. Training requirements and monitoring of these is the responsibility of the relevant statutory council or professional body.  
5Consumers should have ongoing access to evidence-based information on efficacy and safety of CAM therapies – funding for Complementary and Alternative Medicine Database should continue.Support. Ongoing funding for the CAM Website is planned.  
6The Ministry of Health should fund research on the needs of consumers for CAM information.Note. Research on consumer information needs commissioned by the Ministry of Health is currently being completed – briefing to be provided on completion.  
7The Ministry of Health should encourage research-funding bodies to facilitate further research on complementary and alternative medicine.Support improving the evidence base for CAM but note that research funding is prioritised based on ability to contribute to national strategies, such as the New Zealand Health Strategy.  
8The wide range of methodologies appropriate for researching the safety and efficacy of CAM should be used and recognised by CAM researchers and research funding bodies.Support in principle. This issue is best resolved by the research community.  
9Recognition should be given by research funding bodies, healthcare professional organisations and educational institutions, to the relevance and safety of research at different levels of evidence for efficacy and safety.Support in principle. This issue is best resolved by the research community.  
10Where there is evidence of safety, efficacy and cost effectiveness, specified CAM modalities should be considered for public funding.Support in principle, but note that decisions regarding public funding lie with a number of agencies, each of which determines its own criteria.  
11Health care education and training bodies should be encouraged to include elements of CAM and biomedicine in each other’s curriculum. A national curriculum committee should be established to develop policy on this.Note that joint work between the Ministry of Health and the Tertiary Education Committee is currently underway on the issue of health care education.  
12Research should be undertaken to establish best practice for the integration of the approved CAM modalities with biomedicine.Note. The Ministry of Health does not provide guidance about what treatments should be funded, but does:·fund organisations to provide evidence on treatments, such as the New Zealand Guidelines Group which includes evidence on CAM in its guidelines; and·provide a prioritisation framework for use by Ministry and DHBs in making resource allocation decisions, which supports evidence-based decision-making.  
13District Health Boards should be provided with guidance on the appropriateness of integration initiatives.As above.  
14The Ministry of Health should encourage the District Health Boards to establish pilot projects to identify the practicalities, costs, benefits and health outcomes that would accompany CAM and biomedical practitioners working together.As above.  
15Where there is evidence of safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness in contributing to the New Zealand Health Strategy, use of specific CAM modalities should be encouraged.Support. The Ministry of Health will include CAM treatments in “Toolkits” for the NZHS priority areas, where the treatments are backed by appropriate evidence.  
16Where evidence of safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness is inconclusive but has potential, research should be undertaken into the contribution that CAM may make to the New Zealand Health Strategy outcomesSupport CAM research bids being treated on their merits alongside conventional medicine research bids. New Zealand Health Strategy is one of the priority areas for research funding.  
17Further information about the contribution of CAM towards the New Zealand Health Strategy priorities should be developed and distributed for use by health care decisions makers, health professionals and consumers.Note that the Ministry of Health will include CAM treatments in “Toolkits” for the NZHS priority areas, where the treatments are backed by appropriate evidence.  
18The Minister of Health should develop a framework (or unit) to coordinate the existing expertise and build a CAM capacity to better evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAM in the interests of further integration of biomedicine and CAM.Note that a New Zealand Centre for Evidence-Based Research into Complementary and Alternative Medicine was established in July 2004 at the University of Otago to build CAM research expertise and coordinate and facilitate CAM research.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
What is the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Complementary and Alternative Health? The committee known as MACCAH was established in June 2001 to provide independent advice to the Minister of Health on complementary and alternative medicine. It was funded to run until June 2004.  
What did its work involve? MACCAH released a discussion document in 2003, which formed the basis for nationwide consultation. It received more than 300 written submissions on the document. Its final advice covers issues of regulation, research, consumer information and the potential for integration with the mainstream health system.  
Who were the MACCAH members? There were eight members --- Professor Peggy Koopman-Boyden (Chair), currently acting Deputy Vice-Chancellor at Waikato University; Mr David Holden, founder and managing director of the OSIRIS group of natural healing companies; Dr Rhys Jones, senior lecturer at Auckland University's Department of Maori and Pacific Health; Dr Maika Kinahoi Veikune, manager of the Public Health Unit and project manager of Pacific Integrated Care at Middlemore Hospital; Ms Melva Martin, director and CEO of the Naturopathic College of New Zealand Ltd; Mr James McNeill, acupuncturist and traditional Chinese medicine practitioner; Ms Janine Randle, a paediatric nurse in a Christchurch hospital with a home-based massage therapy practice; and Ms Marilyn Wright, a school guidance counsellor in Napier.

Where can the final MACCAH advice document be obtained? It is available on the MACCAH website: www.newhealth.govt.nz/maccah  
or on the Ministry of Health website: www.moh.govt.nz  
The Ministry of Health can also provide a hard copy of the report.

Is reliable information available about complementary and alternative treatments? The Ministry of Health recently established a website presenting the evidence behind complementary and alternative medicine treatments. There is a link to the site from the Ministry's website: www.moh.govt.nz
