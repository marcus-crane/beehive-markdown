Health Minister Annette King is calling for nominations for the newly announced Cancer Control Council.

The Council, charged with overseeing the implementation of the Cancer Control Strategy, will begin its work early next year.

Organisations and individuals are being invited to put forward the names of suitably experienced people who would like to be considered for appointment to the eight member Council. Applications close on 21 January 2005.

Nominees who can make a valuable contribution to the council should have strong governance and strategic planning skills, with some specific experience relating to cancer, and be able to work collaboratively.

The Council's key tasks will be to provide leadership in cancer control, to monitor and review implementation of the Cancer Control Strategy and to foster collaboration and co-ordination in cancer management. It will also provide an annual report to Parliament on progress in implementing the Cancer Control Strategy.

A Principal Advisor Cancer Control, who will help drive the implementation of the Cancer Control Strategy, will also be appointed by the Ministry of Health early next year. The position will be advertised before Christmas.

One of the Council's early tasks will be to set up a Cancer Control Collaborative, to foster links with groups around the country who are contributing in some way to cancer control.

"The Council will provide a sustainable focus on cancer control," Ms King says. "Cancer accounts for 29 per cent of deaths in New Zealand. Sadly, the rates are higher for Maori and Pacific peoples as well as those who are less well off. We are doing quite well in some areas of cancer, but in others we need to do better. The establishment of this Council will ensure we maintain our focus on reducing the cancer burden and in particular reducing health inequalities."
