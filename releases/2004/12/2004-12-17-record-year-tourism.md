Minister of Tourism Mark Burton today congratulated the tourism sector on another remarkable year.

The Tourism Research Council’s latest International Visitor Survey (IVS) shows that international visitors spent a record $6.6 billion in the year to September 2004 —six percent more than last year.

Australians visiting New Zealand spent $1.4 billion, up 28% from the previous year to September. "I am pleased to see that Australians are benefiting from cheaper airfares through competition on the Trans Tasman routes, and are spending more on their holidays in New Zealand," Mark Burton said.

Spending by visitors from the UK and Japan also increased by 7% and 3% respectively.

Nationally, the latest Tourism Satellite Account figures show a record-breaking number of visitor arrivals, coupled with an even higher level of spending. In 2003, international tourism’s contribution to total exports was close to 18 per cent, or $7.4 billion. Combined with our strong domestic market, total tourism spending represents approximately $16.5 billion, or nearly 10 per cent of GDP.

“Clearly, the tourism sector is heading in the right direction, and continues to be a strong contributor to the economic development of New Zealand. Everyone involved in tourism has reason to be proud of this achievement,” said Mark Burton.
