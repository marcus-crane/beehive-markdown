Building Issues Minister Margaret Wilson will today launch a website offering independent information and building advice to homeowners and do-it-yourself builders.

The ConsumerBuild website, developed by the Department of Building and Housing and the Consumers’ Institute, will be launched at Wellington Public Library.

“New Zealanders are passionate about building, renovating and maintaining their homes," Margaret Wilson said. "But many lack the independent advice and information needed before a project gets underway. This can mean the end result is not what consumers hoped for.

“ConsumerBuild was developed to increase consumer knowledge, and enable consumers to be more informed in the building process. The aim is to help give people the home they aspire for and to protect what is often a household's largest investment."

ConsumerBuild is being developed for New Zealand consumers with three specific target audiences:

- Consumers either planning to build or buy a new dwelling or add to or renovate an existing one;
- Consumers who may need to maintain an existing home; and
- consumers who may require information about building and building processes for other purposes.
