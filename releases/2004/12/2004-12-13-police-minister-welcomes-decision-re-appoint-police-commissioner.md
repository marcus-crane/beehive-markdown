Police Minister George Hawkins has welcomed the Government's decision to recommend to the Governor General that she re-appoint Police Commissioner Rob Robinson for a further two years from June 2005.

"Commissioner Robinson is the first Commissioner to have his appointment extended for more than 20 years – since Commissioner Walton in the 1980's. It is a testament to the superb job he's done since 2000 that the Government has recommended the Governor General re-appoint Commissioner Robinson.

"Commissioner Robinson has presided over a strong institutional recovery following the debilitating events which led up to his appointment in 2000. He has established a cohesive and effective senior management team and ensured the organization has demonstrated marked improvements in administrative and financial management performance.

"On the front line the Police have also achieved significant improvements in operational performance and I expect to see this ongoing trend to continue.

"Under Commissioner Robinson's stewardship the Police have responded effectively to new demands in domestic, South Pacific regional and international law enforcement.

"Mr Robinson is a strong and principled Commissioner who is the best person available to provide the stability and continuity of leadership required over the next two years. I look forward to working closely with him to ensure the Police mission is delivered effectively and the good progress we have made in the fight against crime is maintained," concluded Mr Hawkins.
