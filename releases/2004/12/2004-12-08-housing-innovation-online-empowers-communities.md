Information about the Housing Innovation Fund now available online will be a valuable resource for community groups and local councils, Housing Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Housing New Zealand Corporation has launched an online resource for community-based organisations, local government and other housing providers, to help them provide more housing for people on low incomes or with special needs.

Housing Innovation Online is available at www.hnzc.co.nz. It provides information, contact details and a step-by-step guide for community-based organisations and local government to access funding, grants and low interest loans to develop affordable rental or home ownership opportunities.

“The Housing Innovation Fund is one way we can foster creativity in working with community groups and councils to collaboratively increase the amount of available quality housing,” Steve Maharey said.

“Being online, the information is accessible to everyone, whether they’re a small housing trust in a remote part of the country, or a large city council.

“Housing Innovation Online clearly explains what government funding is available for new housing projects and how to apply for it, as well as highlighting innovative social housing projects that are happening here and overseas.

"The government is committed to providing community-based groups and local government with the tools they need to improve their communities. We're here to help them, but we realise that they are the people who know best the needs of local people and how to address them. That's why Housing Innovation Online is such an important step forward."

In addition to seven Housing Innovation Fund loans that have been approved for local groups, funding has also been provided to the Rotorua District Council, which plans to replace 24 bedsits with 30 new one-bedroom units for older people.
