Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today the shortlist of designers chosen to develop designs for the New Zealand Memorial at Hyde Park Corner in London.

"The panel of assessors has completed the difficult job of narrowing down the field to just 12 designers who now must complete their proposals for the Memorial by late January 2005," Helen Clark said.

"There has been a significant level of enthusiasm for this project with 68 expressions of interest received from people living in New Zealand as well as from New Zealanders overseas.

"This new and important memorial will commemorate the relationship between New Zealand and the United Kingdom and serve as a focus for remembrance of the contribution and sacrifice made by New Zealand during armed conflicts, especially World War One and Two.

"The designers shortlisted are:

- Anthony Hoete of WHAT\_architecture (UK)
- Evzen Novak of Studio of Pacific Architecture
- Guy Cleverley of Craig Craig Moller Architects
- Ian Athfield of Athfield Architects Ltd
- John Hardwick Smith of Athfield Architects Ltd
- Katrina Simon
- Kim Jarrett of Dawnfinder
- Neil Dawson
- Peter Nicholls
- Rhondda Grieg (UK
- Roy Wilson of Warren and Mahoney
- Virginia King

"The final designs for the Memorial are to be received by the Ministry for Culture and Heritage before 26 January 2005 and will then be considered by the panel of assessors to decide on the preferred design.

"Meanwhile discussions continue with English Heritage who are progressing a new landscape design for Hyde Park Corner which includes the New Zealand Memorial, and work is being done to obtain the necessary consent to proceed with the construction of the Memorial.

"As these are both lengthy processes the Memorial is unlikely to be able to be completed before mid 2006," Helen Clark said.
