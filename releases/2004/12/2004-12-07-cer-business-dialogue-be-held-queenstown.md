A CER business dialogue will be held in Queenstown on December 10 and 11, Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton said today.

The gathering would be held in parallel with the CER Trade Ministers’ meeting announced earlier today. An excellent turnout of business and industry leaders from both sides of the Tasman was expected, Mr Sutton said.

Sectoral discussion at the dialogue would focus on wood and paper products. Representatives from the New Zealand Forest Industries Council, the Australian Plantation Products and Paper Industry Council, and Carter Holt Harvey would attend.

Mr Sutton said sectoral approaches to the dialogue were introduced in 2002, and have proved to be a worthwhile innovation.

In addition, representatives from the Australia New Zealand Business Council would meet to discuss ways to improve trans-Tasman business.

Following their separate meetings, both the wood and paper products industry representatives and the ANZBC would have the opportunity to engage directly with the Ministers.

The government was committed to working with business and industry to make the Closer Economic Relationship between New Zealand and Australia even stronger, Mr Sutton said.
