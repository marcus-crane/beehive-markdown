A new Land Transport Rule aimed at achieving safer and more efficient use of New Zealand’s roads was today signed by Minister for Transport Safety, Harry Duynhoven.

The Road User Rule, which comes into effect on 27 February 2005, outlines the legal responsibilities of every type of road user, including drivers, pedestrians, cyclists or riders of anything on wheels, from large trucks to bikes, skateboards and mobility scooters.

Provisions which will affect most New Zealand road users include clarification of the rules governing use of pedestrian crossings and special vehicle lanes such as cycle, bus and transit lanes.

Under the Road User Rule motorists will be required to give way to pedestrians on both sides of all pedestrian crossings except for those divided by a raised traffic island. Currently drivers have to give way to pedestrians on both sides of crossings divided by a ‘broken’ centre-line marking - at crossings divided by a solid centre-line marking, drivers only have to give way to pedestrians on their side of the crossing.

The new rule also says drivers cannot enter a pedestrian crossing area if the way ahead is blocked by stationary traffic.

At the same time the rule reiterates the legal requirement for pedestrians not to step out onto a crossing unless approaching vehicles are far enough away to be able to stop safely.

Mr Duynhoven said that on average, three pedestrians are killed and 105 injured each year in collisions with vehicles on pedestrian crossings.

“Clarifying the responsibilities of motorists and pedestrians at pedestrian crossings will help to reduce injury crashes by ensuring more consistent and predictable behaviour,” Mr Duynhoven said.

The Rule also sets out nationally consistent rules for the use of special vehicle lanes such as cycle and bus lanes (previously the rules for these lanes were covered by local council bylaws).

Mr Duynhoven said that national rules for use of special vehicle lanes would create greater consistency in driver behaviour throughout New Zealand, improving traffic flow and reducing congestion.

“Nationally consistent rules for special vehicle lanes will also contribute to better safety for cyclists using those lanes,” he said.

Cyclists are a particularly vulnerable road user group - over the last five years 57 cyclists have been killed and another 3389 injured in collisions with motor vehicles.

Mr Duynhoven said improving safety for vulnerable road users such pedestrians and cyclists was key to encouraging more New Zealanders out of their cars.

To support implementation of the Road User Rule, the Land Transport Rule: Traffic Control Devices has been signed at the same time. Among other things, this requires road controlling authorities to make all pedestrian crossing and special vehicle lane signs and markings nationally consistent so that road users always know what to do in areas which aren’t familiar to them.

Land Transport New Zealand will undertake advertising and publicity to inform road users of their responsibilities under the Road User Rule before it comes into effect on 27 February 2005.

A summary of all the new provisions and clarifications contained within the Rule is available at http://www.landtransport.govt.nz/rules/about/road-user-2004.html. The rule will come into effect on 27 February 2005.
