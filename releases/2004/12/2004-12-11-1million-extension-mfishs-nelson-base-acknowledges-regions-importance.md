Nelson’s importance to New Zealand’s fishing industry will be reinforced by a $1million refurbishment and expansion of the Ministry of Fisheries’ seafront base there, says Fisheries Minister David Benson-Pope.

Mr Benson-Pope says the Ministry is extending its premises on Vickerman Street, Port Nelson, to accommodate the growing number of staff based there.

"With a new Seafood Innovation Hub being located nearby on Akersten Street, the expanded Ministry offices will consolidate Nelson’s position as a national seafood centre of excellence," said Mr Benson-Pope.

The Minister confirmed that the current site was struggling to cope with the 45 Fisheries staff based in Nelson. Given the growing importance of Nelson to the seafood industry, the Ministry’s office could expect some further growth in staff numbers over the next few years.

"The current buildings are bursting at the seams. This expansion is about creating a work space that will strengthen the ability of Ministry staff to achieve their goals of protecting and enhancing the marine environment."

The Ministry is planning to extend the upper level of a two-storey building, convert a storage area to office space and refurbish the existing work areas. The project, which is being managed by OPUS International Ltd, is expected to cost around $1 million, with tenders for the construction work to be called shortly.
