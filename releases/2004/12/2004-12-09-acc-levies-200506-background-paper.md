2005/2006 ACC LEVIES – BACKGROUND PAPER

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
The government has agreed that:  
·The average composite employer levy will remain at $1.21 for every $100 of payroll.  
·The non-work (earner) levy will remain at $1.07 for every $100 of earnings.  
·The average composite self-employed levy will increase by 3.9 per cent or 12 cents for every $100 of earnings.  
·The average composite motor vehicle levy (vehicle licence fee levy + petrol levy) will increase by 4.8 per cent from 1 July 2005.  
·For petrol-powered vehicles, the motor vehicle levy increase will be implemented by increasing the petrol levy rate from 5.08 to 5.78 cents per litre of petrol. The licence fees will remain at the 2004/05 levels.  
·There will be an increase in the vehicle licence fee levy for non-petrol-powered motor vehicles.  
·The new levies will take effect from 1 April 2005, with the exception of the motor vehicle account which will take effect from 1 July 2005, once regulations setting them have been promulgated.  
·All levy rates exclude GST.  
·The new levies can be found in the Products and Levies section of ACC’s website: www.acc.co.nz/productslevies

ACC accounts  
ACC is required to operate seven separate scheme accounts. Each account receives levies from a different source. Each source funds the cost of claims made under that account.

The accounts are:  
·Employers: funded by employers based on their employee payroll, to meet the costs of workplace injuries to employees that occur after 1 April 2000, and not covered by private insurance.  
·Self-Employed: funded by self-employed people based on their earnings, to meet the costs of workplace injuries to self-employed that occur after 1 July 1999, and not covered by private insurance.  
·Earners (non-work): collected from employees through the PAYE system by Inland Revenue and paid by self-employed people based on their earnings, to meet the costs of all non-work injuries to earners.  
·Motor Vehicle: collected as part of the motor vehicle licence fee and also as a petrol levy, to meet the costs of all injuries involving motor vehicles on public roads.  
·Residual Claims (also known as pre-1999 claims): funded by employers and self-employed to meet the costs of work injuries before 1 July 1999 and non-work injuries to earners before 1 July 1992.  
·Non-Earners: funded by the government to meet the costs of non-motor vehicle injuries to people not in paid work.  
·Medical Misadventure: funded from the earners’ and non-earners’ accounts to cover the costs of medical misadventure claims.

·All rates exclude GST.  
·If the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment Bill before Parliament is passed in its current form in time for changes to be included in the 2005/2006 levy round, the average composite self-employed levy would need to increase from $3.22 to $3.28 for every $100 of earnings, because of provisions that would increase weekly compensation entitlements.  
BACKGROUND  
New Zealanders fund ACC through levies set by the government. The levy rates are set each year by the government, following consultation.  
Levies are set to meet the total cost of rehabilitation and compensation entitlement for injured people, the cost of managing the ACC scheme, and running injury prevention and other programmes.  
The principles underlying the setting of levies are based on the Woodhouse principles and include: ensuring long-term levy stability to allow businesses to plan with certainty; combining community and individual responsibility; and maintaining strong injury prevention programmes and incentives for employers and individuals.

Pay-as-you-go v full funding  
Before 1 July 1999, ACC levies were collected on a ‘pay as you go’ basis. This meant that only enough funds were collected each year to meet the costs of managing claims in that year. No reserves were required to fund long-term liabilities for claims.

Since 1 July 1999, ACC levies have been collected on a ‘fully funded’ basis. This means that levies are set to cover both the immediate and future lifetime costs of injuries that happen in each levy year. ACC is required to achieve full funding of all claims by 30 June 2014, and is building reserves in the Residual Claims Account and the pre-1999 claim residual components of the Earners' Account and Motor Vehicle Account in order to do so.

ACC does not make a profit. Any surplus (where more levy income is collected than required) is added to reserves for future use. Any shortfall means that ACC has to dip into the reserves previously accumulated.  
Levy-setting process  
·ACC consults on proposed rates (the consultation period for the 2005/2006 levies was 5 August -16 September 2004).  
·ACC Board recommends rates to the government through the Minister for ACC.  
·Government considers ACC’s recommendations, taking additional advice from the Department of Labour, which provides strategic policy direction and process oversight of ACC.  
·Government decides on new rates for 2005/2006.  
·Regulations are promulgated to give effect to the new levy rates.

International comparisons  
·ACC levies are low compared with premium rates for injuries overseas.  
·Premium rates in 2001-2002 across the Australian schemes were on average $2.47 per $100 of payroll, compared with ACC's average composite employer levy of $NZ1.21 in 2005/2006. (See Comparative Performance Monitoring Fifth Report at http://www.workplace.gov.au/WP/Content/Files/WP/WR/Publications/ CPMReport1103FifthReport.pdf  
·ACC Employers’ Account administration costs are significantly lower than the Australian average. A recent comparison shows that administration costs, as a proportion of levy income, were 10 per cent in New Zealand compared with a 23 per cent Australian average.  
·Disputes as a proportion of new claims are seven times higher in Australia with legal costs much higher still.  
·Survey results show New Zealand durable ‘return to work’ rates for comparable claims at 84 per cent compared with the Australian average of 73 per cent.

CHANGES TO ACC LEVIES  
EMPLOYER LEVY  
Current employer work levy (average)$0.91  
ACC recommended levy for 2005/2006$0.88  
Department of Labour recommended levy for 2005/2006$0.88  
Approved employer work levy for 2005/2006 (average) for every $100 of payroll$0.88

The decision  
The average work levy for employers will decrease by 3 cents for every $100 of payroll for 2005/2006. This reflects the number and average cost of new work injuries that are higher than previous years but excellent investment returns have provided a higher level of reserves from which some expenditure can be met.  
The average pre-1999 claims levy will increase by 3 cents for every $100 of payroll for 2005/2006 (see pre-1999 claims section).  
The average composite employer levy will remain the same at $1.21 for every $100 of payroll.

Background  
·The employer work levy meets the cost of workplace injuries to employees that occur after 1 April 2000 and are not covered by private insurance.  
·The average composite employer levy has remained at the same rate for the last three years.  
·The levies are averages only. Each business activity is given an industry classification. There are 554 industry classification units, currently more broadly grouped into 129 risk groups.  
·An employer’s actual levy may differ from the average, depending on their industry classification, the risk rating and recent claims history of their risk group, and whether they are receiving discounts through the ACC Partnership Programme or ACC Workplace Safety Management Practices Programme (see below).  
·Some employers’ levies may decrease. This will reflect a reduction in the number and/or cost of injuries in their risk group. Movement between groups may also occur where risk ratings are re-aligned.

Other employer levy initiatives

·Workplace Safety Management Practices Programme: Employers can receive a levy discount of 10–20 per cent if they meet and maintain workplace safety standards under the Workplace Safety Management Practices Programme. The average discount is equivalent to $0.03 per $100 payroll.  
·ACC Partnership Programme: Employers wanting to self-manage their employees’ workplace injuries can apply to join the ACC Partnership Programme. If they meet the programme’s eligibility criteria, employers operate as agents of ACC. In return, their employer levy is significantly reduced to reflect the level of claim management undertaken by the employer.  
·Workplace Safety Evaluations: A new injury prevention initiative called Workplace Safety Evaluations was introduced in 2003/2004. ACC will work closely with employers with poor safety records to help them improve their workplace safety management practices. ACC is able to increase an employers’ levy by 50 per cent, as a last resort, where an employer refuses to work with ACC and their safety practices continually fail to protect employees from exposure to serious harm and injury.

SELF-EMPLOYED LEVY  
Current self-employed work levy (average)$1.73  
ACC recommended levy for 2005/2006 $1.82  
Department of Labour recommended levy for 2005/2006$1.82  
Approved self-employed work levy for 2005/2006 (average) for every $100 of earnings$1.82

The decision  
The average work levy for self-employed will increase by 9 cents for every $100 of earnings for 2005/2006. The increase is the net result of significantly lower earnings levels for self-employed, while the number and costs of injuries have remained constant with previous years.  
The average pre-1999 claims levy will increase by 3 cents for every $100 of earnings for 2005/2006 (see pre-1999 claims section).  
The non-work levy will remain at $1.07 for every $100 of earnings (see non-work levy section).  
The average composite self-employed levy will increase by 12 cents to $3.22 for every $100 of earnings.

Background  
·The self-employed work levy meets the cost of all workplace injuries to self-employed that occur after 1 July 1999, and are not covered by private insurance.  
·The standard level of income replacement cover (Cover Plus) for self-employed is 80 per cent of the previous year’s liable earnings.  
·The Cover Plus levy has two components:  
\- an income benefit portion to fund weekly compensation or income replacement; and  
\-a non-income benefit portion to fund other entitlements, for example lump sums, medical treatment costs, social rehabilitation, etc.  
·The levies are averages only. Each business activity is given an industry classification. There are 554 industry classification units, more broadly grouped into 129 risk groups.  
·A self-employed person’s actual levy may differ from the average, depending on their industry classification, and the risk rating and recent claims history of their risk group.  
·Some self-employed persons’ levies may decrease. This will reflect a reduction in the number and/or cost of injuries in their risk group. Movement between groups may also occur where risk ratings are re-aligned.

Other self-employed levy initiatives  
ACC CoverPlus Extra gives self-employed people some flexibility of cover for personal injuries. Under this option, self-employed people can, with ACC’s agreement, nominate and agree to purchase the level of income replacement or weekly compensation they wish to receive if they have an accident. This amount may be higher or lower than the standard weekly compensation. This option may suit those with fluctuating earnings (eg farmers or newly self-employed with no earnings record).  
CoverPlus Extra applies to both work injuries (under the Self-Employed Work Account) and non-work injuries (under the Earners’ Account and Motor Vehicle Account).

PRE-1999 CLAIMS LEVY  
Current pre-1999 claims levy (average)$0.30  
ACC recommended levy for 2005/2006$0.33  
Department of Labour recommended levy for 2005/2006$0.33  
Approved pre-1999 claims levy for 2005/2006 for every $100 of payroll or earnings $0.33

The decision  
The average pre-1999 claims levy will increase by 3 cents for every $100 of payroll or earnings. These pre-1999 claims are now taking a little longer to rehabilitate and as a result the cost per claim has risen slightly.  
Background  
·Pre-1999 claims levies are paid by employers and the self-employed to meet the costs of work injuries before 1 July 1999 and non-work injuries to earners before 1 July 1992.  
·In the past, ACC operated on a pay-as-you-go basis. As a result, ACC built up a long-term liability for pre-1999 claims. The pre-1999 claims levy meets the ongoing costs of these claims and, by 30 June 2014, will establish reserves to meet the cost of any claims still open after that date.  
·The Residual Claims Account meets the costs of pre-1999 claims and is closed off for new claims.  
·The levy is an average only. Each business activity is given an industry classification. There are 554 industry classification units, currently more broadly grouped into 41 risk groups.

NON-WORK (EARNERS) LEVY  
Current non-work levy $1.0667  
ACC recommended levy for 2005/2006$1.0667  
Department of Labour recommended levy for 2005/2006$1.0667  
Approved non-work levy for 2005/2006 for every $100 of earnings $1.0667

The decision  
The non-work levy will remain at its current rate for 2005/2006. A small expected increase in the number and costs of non-work injuries can be absorbed within existing margins.  
Background  
·The Earners’ Account meets the costs of all non-work injuries to employees and the self-employed.  
·The account is funded from the non-work levy collected from employees through the PAYE system by Inland Revenue and paid by self-employed people based on their earnings.  
·Levy rates are required to be in a multiple of 10 cents on a GST inclusive basis to be incorporated in PAYE tables. In the 2005/2006 financial year, the non-work levy was rounded up to $1.20 to achieve this requirement.

MOTOR VEHICLE ACOUNT  
Current average composite levy for all vehicles (includes licence fee levy + petrol levy)$197.50  
ACC recommended average composite levy $206.93  
Dept of Labour recommended average composite levy $206.93  
Approved average composite levy for 2005/2006 (includes licence fee levy + petrol levy) $206.93

Petrol levy  
Current rate 5.08 cents per litre($71.26 per year for average motorist)  
Approved rate for 2005/2006 per litre5.78 cents per litre($80.78 per year for average motorist)

The decision  
From 1 July 2005, the average Motor Vehicle Account levy (vehicle licence fee + petrol excise duty) will increase by 4.8 per cent, from $197.50 to $206.93. Continued growth in the number of road users injured on New Zealand roads and higher costs of care required to rehabilitate those road users who are severely injured has resulted in higher levies for vehicle owners.

The increase in the levies for vehicle owners will be collected through a higher petrol levy and higher annual licence fee levies for non-petrol driven vehicles. Increasing the petrol levy ensures that the increased cost of claims falls to those road users who travel further and are therefore at risk of injury for longer periods of time. The annual licence levy for non-petrol driven vehicles has been increased in line with the increased costs faced by petrol-driven vehicle owners.

Background  
·The Motor Vehicle Account levy is collected from two sources: a portion of the annual vehicle licence fee collected by the Land Transport Safety Authority and remitted to ACC; and a petrol levy.  
·The licence fee levy is divided into nine classification groups depending on the type of vehicle, usage and whether the vehicle is petrol or non-petrol powered. Certain vehicles, such as emergency vehicles, are exempt from the levy.  
·Non-petrol powered vehicles pay an additional amount in their licence fee levy because they do not pay the petrol levy.  
·The Motor Vehicle Account has a high proportion of seriously injured claimants. These claimants require extensive rehabilitation and treatment that can often extend for the rest of their life. For this reason, increased costs of treatment and rehabilitation affect this account more than ACC’s other accounts.
