Six further projects relating to drug education and research are to receive funding from the recently-established National Drug Policy Discretionary Fund, says Associate Health Minister Jim Anderton.

In Budget 2004, the Progressive Party secured the establishment of a new fund to advance the coalition government's anti-drugs campaign and last month the Progressive leader announced that Murupara's 'P free-campaign' was the first beneficiary of the new fund.

"I'm delighted to announce today that my colleagues and I on the Ministerial Committee on Drug Policy have now given the green-light to six further proposals which complement the government's ongoing anti-drugs education and research programmes," Jim Anderton said.

“Three of the projects deal with research into the health effects of cannabis, the most highly used illegal substance in New Zealand. These studies aim to gather information on the effects of cannabis on a person's lungs, how this compares with using tobacco, and the impact of cannabis expenditure on households," Jim Anderton said.

The other three projects to receive funding are concerned with drug education and focus on communities or schools.

"One of these proposals is expected to ensure that the recently released and updated handbook on effective drug education delivered to school principals is fully utilized as a working document.

“Drug education funding is also to be provided to the Ten-Foot Tall and Bullet Proof theatre production for schools in Northland, as part of other health promotion activity in the area.

The final new project to receive funding is the Phobic Trust, an organization that treats around 2,500 people a year. It will conduct a study relating to the prevalence of co-existing substance abuse and anxiety disorders.

BACKGROUND:

NATIONAL DRUG POLICY DISCRETIONARY FUND

The Fund was established in 2004 to provide Ministers involved with drug policy, access to a pool of funding for new initiatives or projects that fill gaps in drug policy work. The Interagency on Drugs (IACD) and the Ministerial Committee on Drug Policy (MCDP) jointly manage the fund.

The Fund’s objectives are:

·To allow the MDCP to fund projects/organisations that meet the funding criteria and that fill a gap that would otherwise remain unfilled due to not meeting a particular agency’s funding criteria;  
·To fund high quality cross-departmental projects, which will support the advancement of Government’s National Drug Policy;  
·To allow for forward planning and fast response, by Government agencies, to changes in current and emerging drug trends;

In the 2004-2005 financial year, up to $427,000 (GST excl.) is available for allocation rising to $871,000(GST excl.).
