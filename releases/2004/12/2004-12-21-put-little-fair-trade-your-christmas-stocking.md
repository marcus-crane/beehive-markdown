NZAID, the government's international aid and development agency, will be providing $700,000 over the next three years for the promotion of 'Fair Trade' in New Zealand, Aid Minister Marian Hobbs announced today.

"I would like to encourage all New Zealand shoppers to buy a 'Fair Trade' product this Christmas," Marian Hobbs said.

"It is a wonderful way we can support developing countries and I can thoroughly recommend the organic ground coffees, tasty chocolate, and fragrant tea as great gifts that anyone would be delighted to receive.

"Fair trade is all about giving poor people around the world a 'hand-up' rather than a 'hand-out'."

The promotional campaign will increase the visibility of 'Fair Trade' products, which are identifiable by an international 'Fair Trade' logo.

"The 'Fair Trade' logo is proof to you the shopper that the producers of that product - be it tea, coffee, chocolate, bananas, and many others - have been paid a fair price and are working in acceptable conditions," Marian Hobbs said.

NZAID will be working with Oxfam NZ, Trade Aid and the Fair Trade Association of Australia and New Zealand on this promotional programme.

"We are aiming to raise significantly consumer awareness about 'Fair Trade'. There will be some great events such as concerts involving music celebrities and NZ's biggest morning tea at Trade Aid shops. You can expect to see and hear a lot more about ‘Fair Trade’ in 2005," Marian Hobbs said.

NZAID will also be working with supermarkets, importers and distributors to ensure that 'Fair Trade' products are available in a variety of shops so that people can buy these products as part of their normal weekly shop.

"Do your bit this Christmas and buy a fair trade gift," the minister said. "And remember to watch out for 'Fair Trade' in 2005!"

'Fair Trade' products are available at Trade Aid shops around the country.
