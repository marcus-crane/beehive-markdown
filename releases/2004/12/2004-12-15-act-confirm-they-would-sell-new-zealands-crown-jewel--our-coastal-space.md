ACT has again demonstrated just how out of touch they are with ordinary New Zealanders by confirming they would privatise our pristine marine space.

During the third reading of the Aquaculture Reform Bill, ACT MP Gerrard Eckhoff called for marine farmers to be granted leases in perpetuity that would never have to be renewed.

"It is no wonder that ACT is so unpopular with the community when they now reveal they are prepared to give away our invaluable marine space," said Fisheries Minister David Benson-Pope.

"The Government has consistently stated that it will not privatise public space. The reason for our cautious approach with the aquaculture moratorium and extensive negotiation of marine farming management practices was to ensure good outcomes for the environment, communities, as well as marine farmers and the economy.

"The Government and indeed the overwhelming majority of Parliament confirmed today that it could not agree with ACT's line that aquaculture should be unregulated and uncontrolled. That would seem to even put ACT in conflict with those wishing to further develop our exciting aquaculture industry.

"Instead of advocating that New Zealand marine farmers should go to Australia and set up business, Mr Eckhoff could provide us all with the best Christmas present of all by heading there permanently himself."
