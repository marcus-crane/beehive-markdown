Changes to clarify the decision making process around access to road corridors for high capacity electricity lines are to be included in the Resource Management Amendment Bill.

The proposed changes extend the access regime in the Electricity Act to include high capacity electricity lines that cross or go under roads or level crossings.

If passed, the changes proposed would enable road and rail authorities to prescribe reasonable conditions over the construction and maintenance of high voltage, high capacity works in the same way they can now for low capacity electricity works.
