Christmas lights are great fun and a delightful addition to festive decorations; but, as with all electrical appliances, if they are not handled properly they can be dangerous. Most Christmas lights are safe, but a small number are potentially hazardous and could cause an electric shock or fire.

Associate Minister of Energy, Hon Harry Duynhoven, says that consumers need to be aware when using or buying Christmas tree lights.

“Consumers can make sure they buy a safe set of Christmas lights by avoiding lights with plugs that are not designed for use in New Zealand – in fact, this should be the case when buying any electronic goods,” says Mr Duynhoven.

Don’t buy lights (or other electrical products) that:  
·do not have the normal plug you would use at home  
·are supplied with an adaptor to fit the socket outlet  
·have a cord that extends up (rather than down) from the plug.

Lights installed outside should be connected to a residual current device (RCD) or an isolating transformer, as should lights installed inside where children might touch them.

An RCD will turn the power off when things go wrong, protecting you against an electric shock. If you don’t own a RCD already, they can be bought from any hardware or electronic store for $20 to $40.

“Check all lights – both old and new – for broken or cracked sockets, frayed or bare wires, or loose connections. If you are unsure about their safety, have them checked by a licensed electrical worker.”

If bulbs need replacing use ones with the same voltage and wattage. The wrong bulbs could cause overheating and start a fire. Always switch off and unplug light strings before replacing bulbs.

If you get a tingle from your lights or something touching them turn the lights off immediately and get them checked by a licensed electrical worker. A tingling sensation is usually a warning of danger.

“Finally always turn off all Christmas lights when you go to bed or leave the house. If the lights develop a fault, they could start a fire.”

“By following these Christmas electricity safety tips people should have a happy and safe holiday season,” says Mr Duynhoven.
