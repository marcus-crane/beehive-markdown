Blenheim's courthouse is on track for refurbishment and a spruce up following the just completed feasibility study. Design planning will swing into action in a few weeks.

Courts Minister Rick Barker says this is great news for the town as the local population continues to expand. He says initially the property improvements to be done were fairly modest, buts says following the feasibility study, the budget is going to stretch to include the more extensive developments needed.

"Redevelopment of the courthouse is planned for completion next year and will include improved security for Judges, an additional hearing room, new Judges' Chambers and staff facilities," he said.

" The courthouse was built in 1937 and is typical of the post depression Art Deco era, but it now needs some TLC and better design that has security for staff, judges and juries in mind.

"It's a bit of an icon in the town as are the staff. The staff turn over is really low, in fact I have just presented a 20 year service award to Stephanie McDonald. She has worked at several South Island courts but settled here for the last 12 years. Court staff are greatly valued and I congratulate them for their hard work throughout the year."

The Court is the largest satellite court in the South Island and is currently staffed by two Team Leaders, one part-time Victim Advisor, seven Court Registry Officers (some are part-time), one Court Attendant, one Court Reporter and a Court Services Officer who holds a bailiff warrant
