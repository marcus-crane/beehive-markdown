Energy Minister, Pete Hodgson, today released the Commerce Commission’s final report on the control of gas pipeline goods and services for comment.

The report was written following a significant consultation process carried out with stakeholders by the Commerce Commission. It considers whether gas pipeline goods and services should be controlled under Part 4 of the Commerce Act 1986. Such a regime would be comparable to the targeted control of electricity lines businesses under Part 4A of the Act.

Comments are welcomed on the report, and in particular on the application of such a regime, by noon on 15 February 2005.

"I am obliged to the Commerce Commission and the many stakeholders that took part in the consultation process for the production of a very thorough report. I will consider it, and comments from stakeholders, carefully before making my final recommendations in the middle of next year," says Pete Hodgson.

The Commerce Commission will hold a media briefing today at 10:30 am on Level 6, NGC House, 44-52 The Terrace, Wellington
