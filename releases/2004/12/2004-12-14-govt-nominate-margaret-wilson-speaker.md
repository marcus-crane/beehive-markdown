Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that the government’s nomination for the position of Speaker following the retirement of the Rt Hon Jonathan Hunt next year will be the Hon Margaret Wilson.

“Margaret Wilson is a senior politician who has held high office in the government for five years. She has held the prestigious position of Attorney-General during that time and a range of other Cabinet responsibilities,” Helen Clark said.

“Margaret Wilson’s very considerable legal abilities will enable her to make a substantial contribution to the position of Speaker.

“It is expected that Mr Hunt’s retirement will occur between late February and early March. The nomination will be formally voted on after Mr Hunt retires,” Helen Clark said.
