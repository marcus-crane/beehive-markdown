**Role of the Copyright Tribunal**

The Tribunal is a statutory body established under the Copyright Act 1994 ("the Act"). The role of the Tribunal is to resolve disputes between licensing bodies, or proposed licensing bodies, and those who hold or seek to hold licences.

Organisations or individuals who wish to use copyright works may apply to a licensing body, who establish licensing schemes on behalf of copyright authors, to grant a licence to use such copyright works. Where a dispute arises between these parties, usually with respect to royalties, the matter can be referred to the Copyright Tribunal. The Tribunal can choose whether to hear the case, and has the jurisdiction to confirm or vary the scheme as it sees fit.

**Appointment of Members to the Copyright Tribunal**

The Tribunal consists of a Chair and two members, who are appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Minister of Commerce. On 19 September 2002 the Minister of Commerce delegated to the Associate Minister of Commerce, Hon Judith Tizard, responsibility for intellectual property matters, including appointments. The Tribunal consists of a Chair and two members, who are appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Minister of Commerce. The Ministry of Justice provides secretariat services to the Tribunal.

All members must be able to deal with a diverse range of business and technological matters and are expected to have experience in, or the ability to, interpret legislation and an interest in copyright issues.
