The Crown is the most appropriate funder of most biosecurity services, Biosecurity Minister Jim Sutton said today.

However, a review of biosecurity funding suggests that further work is required on the future funding of some surveillance and incursion responses.

Mr Sutton today published a discussion document outlining the findings of a review into the funding of biosecurity agencies, and invited comment from interested parties.

The review does not recommend sweeping changes to existing biosecurity funding arrangements. It has found the Crown to remain the most appropriate funder of most biosecurity services, largely due to their public good nature. It has also found that most industry cost-recovery regimes already in place should continue.

Mr Sutton said that the review found, however, that there were a number of areas where greater industry involvement in decision-making and funding would seem appropriate.

“These include import health standard provision and a separate discussion document on the proposed changes to import health standard management and funding will be released in January 2005. There are also a number of areas where existing cost-recovery regimes need to be implemented more rigorously to avoid over- or under-recovery.”

Mr Sutton said officials would now consult with affected and interested parties – industry and other stakeholders – on the recommendations and proposed areas for change. Following consultation, officials will revise the proposed policy, for decisions by ministers.

The review of how the biosecurity services of the four main central government biosecurity agencies (the Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF), Fisheries and Health and the Department of Conservation) are funded has come out of the endorsement of the Biosecurity Strategy. The review excluded passenger and aircraft clearance services, which are being addressed separately.

The discussion document and other information on the funding review and consultation are available on MAF’s website at: www.biosecurity.govt.nz/biosecurity-funding-review.

MAF invites feedback on the review’s recommendations, particularly the proposed areas for change, by Thursday 10 February 2005.
