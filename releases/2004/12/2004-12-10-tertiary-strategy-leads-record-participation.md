A new report highlighting record tertiary participation and a significant jump in qualification completions shows that the government's Tertiary Education Strategy is paying dividends Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said today.

New Zealand’s Tertiary Education Sector: Profile & Trends 2003, released by the Ministry of Education, summarises the overall performance of the tertiary education sector in 2003.

“The report confirms that the New Zealand tertiary sector is growing and better serving the needs of the nation, the economy and society," Steve Maharey said.

"More Mâori are participating in tertiary education, more students are taking advantage of the wide choice now available at the tertiary level, and the sector is taking a stronger role in the nation’s move towards a vibrant knowledge economy."

Key points from the report include:  
·In 2003 more than 13 per cent of the population aged 15 years and over were enrolled in formal tertiary education, up from 10 percent in 1999, with a nearly 20% rise in industry training numbers.  
·Maori participation has surged in the last five years and at 20%, Maori now have the highest participation rate of any ethnic group.  
·University research is thriving with PhD enrolments and completions up by nearly one third each and university income from research contracts topping $260 million in 2003.  
·Qualification completions increased dramatically between 2000 and 2003 at a rate of 51%.

“The Tertiary Education Strategy signalled the government’s direction for building a strong and capable tertiary education system," Steve Maharey said.

"This report shows we are meeting our goals and transforming the tertiary education sector for the benefit of tertiary institutions, the New Zealand economy, and New Zealanders themselves."
