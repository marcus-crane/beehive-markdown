Figures released by Customs Minister Rick Barker show that seizures of crystal methamphetamine have increased 16 fold on last year to September 2004.  
Pseudoephedrine and Ephedrine (precursor ingredients for methamphetamine) have nearly doubled over the same period.

Last calendar year the total amount of crystal methamphetamine (ICE) seized was 862 grams and this year to September 13,907 grams was seized by Customs at the border.  
Methamphetamine precursors seized have gone from 830,320 to 1,369,588 tablets.

"The seizure of 13,907 grams of crystal methamphetamine so far this year is worrying. This is the purest form of methamphetamine, more concentrated than the version known as "P", and reinforces that international drug smuggling syndicates see an ongoing market here," said Rick Barker.

"While it is a job well done that Customs are stopping so many illicit drugs at the border, the increased demand is of great concern.

"The increased Customs and Police funding combined with the reclassification of methamphetamine as a Class A drug and amphetamine type substances as Class B1 drugs, is part of a joined-up fight against drugs.

"Next year the blitz on drug dealers and traffickers will continue with vigour.

"Methamphetamine abuse is the single biggest illicit drug problem facing New Zealand. This Government is determined to stop it at the border and to tackle the social problems caused by methamphetamine use and manufacture.

"Crimes related to methamphetamine are increasingly serious and the community wreckers who are dealing and using are doing great harm to families in this country," he said.

Mr Barker says Customs believes the increase in cocaine seizures is due to drug traffickers both targeting New Zealand directly and transiting through New Zealand on the way to other markets.

"The Government's Ministerial Committee on Drugs is continuing to look at how it can support Customs, the Police and other agencies involved in the ongoing fight against illegal drugs."
