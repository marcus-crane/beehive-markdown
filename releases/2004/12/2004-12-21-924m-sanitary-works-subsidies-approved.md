Associate Health Minister and Rural Affairs Minister Damien O’Connor today announced provisional approval for $9.24m worth of subsidies under the government's [Sanitary Works Subsidy Scheme](http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/0/079314757e3f625ecc256c90007f3967?OpenDocument) (SWSS).

Introduced in May 2002, the scheme's designed to help small to medium sized communities implement reticulated sewerage schemes and upgrade deficient treatment plants.

Funding of $15 million a year is available for 10 years from 1 July 2003.

Recent successful applicants are: Rangiriri and Taupiri in the Waikato; Church Bay and Tikao Bay on Banks Peninsula; Otematata in Waitaki; Tuatapere and Wallacetown in Southland, and Matata in Whakatane.

Failing septic tanks are causing public health problems in Rangiriri, Taupiri, Church Bay, Tuatapere and Wallacetown.

Otematata and Tikao Bay have sewerage reticulation and treatment, but are experiencing problems with disposal of treated effluent.

A conventional sewerage reticulation system is proposed in Matata, where streams flowing through the township are contaminated with effluent.

In addition to these provisional approvals, final subsidy approval has just been announced in Russell ($2.53m), Tirau ($700,000), Renwick ($5.69m), Fairlie ($203,000), Oban, Stewart Island ($3.1m), Waikiri ($83,000), Gorge Road, Southland ($199,500).

The total value of subsidies approved to date under the scheme now stands at more than $70m, spread across 41 communities.

Mr O'Connor said quality sanitation was vital in small communities. "People forget the link between effective sewerage systems and health, but they're very much connected. The SWSS shows this government's commitment to improving the health of all New Zealanders, not just those living in urban areas."
