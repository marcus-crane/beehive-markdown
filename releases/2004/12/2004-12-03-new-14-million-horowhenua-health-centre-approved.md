Health Minister Annette King today approved funding for a new Horowhenua Health Centre designed to bring all health services together in one area for the benefit of local people.

Ms King says the $14 million health centre in Levin will replace the existing Horowhenua Hospital while retaining most of the current services, including 24 inpatient beds, four primary maternity beds, laboratory and radiology services, outpatient clinics, mental health and public health services.

“This is a magnificent outcome to years of hard work by people in Horowhenua who have been determined to mount a sustainable case for a high-quality health centre in the district. They have succeeded.”

Ms King also paid tribute to Otaki MP Darren Hughes’ work with the local community. “Approvals for all projects of this sort now follow a very thorough process through the National Capital Committee. This Government has a policy of getting projects right from the start. No longer are approvals rushed through just to win votes. Long though the process may have seemed at times, Darren has helped ensure the community and health professionals have stayed focused on what they have needed to do.”

The Government is undertaking the largest public hospital upgrade programme ever in New Zealand, she says. “This year’s budget brought to $802m the amount of capital available over five years. Most has been allocated to Auckland, Capital and Coast, Waikato, Thames, Canterbury, Southland, Kaitaia, Dunstan and Wairarapa projects, but recently I’ve also been able to announce the Tauranga development and now Horowhenua. The Government is absolutely committed to providing first-class health services. We are not into closing hospitals down.”

Ms King says "the new facility aims to provide ease of access to health care for local people by bringing GPs and specialised hospital based services under one roof. Integrated health care improves the management of care for the whole community, but particularly for people suffering chronic illnesses. It is the way of the future."

The Minister has approved $9.7 million for the MidCentral District Health Board project, with the rest of the money to come from the DHB’s funds.
