Police Minister George Hawkins welcomed news today that the Police Association had finally made a submission to the independent review of police communications centres.

"The Association was offered an opportunity to submit a late submission after it became clear they would be unable to meet the original deadline," the Minister said today.

"I'm confident the quality of the Association's submission will be an improvement on the regurgitated and outdated allegations being carried by daily newspapers today.

"The Police Association has an important role to fulfil and its written input into the review should reflect the professional standards of evidence presentation which its members are required to demonstrate at all times.

"I have every confidence the independent review will deliver valuable outcomes for Police administration and staff," concluded Mr Hawkins
