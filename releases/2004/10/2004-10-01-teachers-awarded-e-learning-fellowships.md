Improving student learning by developing teachers' skills in information and communications technology (ICT) is the aim of ten new e-learning fellowships announced by Education Minister Trevor Mallard today.

"The appointment of the e-learning fellows for 2005 is another opportunity to enhance the professional capability of teachers in ICT and increase the use of effective e-learning strategies in schools," Trevor Mallard said.

"The ten teachers were selected from more than 40 applicants across New Zealand and include teachers from early childhood, special education, primary and secondary areas of education. They are representative of a growing group of educators committed to developing innovative e-learning practice focussed on lifting student achievement.

"The government is committed to ensuring every young person has the opportunity to reach their potential with the right skills for life and work in the 21st century. E-learning not only helps to develop technical skills, but it is also playing an increasingly important role in breaking down barriers to education," Trevor Mallard said at the Navcon "Learning for the Future" conference in Christchurch.

"Our government is intent on building an innovative and dynamic economy and is investing heavily in ICT in education. More than $4 million spread over four years has been targeted for funding the year-long e-learning fellowships."

Fellows will be released from their teaching duties for a year to undertake research to explore new and exciting ways of meeting students’ learning needs by combining teaching practice and cutting edge technology. Partnerships with an ICT company or enterprise and links with a tertiary institution provide an added dimension to their projects.

"Findings from their research will provide valuable information for the education sector, both nationally and internationally as new approaches to learning through ICT are developed and shared," Trevor Mallard said.

Christchurch-based company Ultralab South is co-ordinating the academic support and professional networks for the project. The research includes a broad range of projects.

This is the second group of teachers to be awarded e-learning fellowships. The inaugural recipients shared their findings at the Navcon conference.
