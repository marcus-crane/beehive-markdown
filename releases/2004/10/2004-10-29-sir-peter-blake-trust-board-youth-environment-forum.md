The Sir Peter Blake Trust will join the Ministry for the Environment to host the second national youth environment forum, Environment Minister Marian Hobbs announced today.

"The Sir Peter Blake Youth Environment Forum will bring together young people from all over New Zealand to get them inspired and motivated to take action on environmental issues and get involved in decision-making," Marian Hobbs said.

"Renaming the forum is a fitting tribute to the master mariner's commitment to environmental leadership and to building generations of future leaders."

Sir Peter Blake Trust Chairperson Ann Sherry said the trust was proud to be involved.

"Sir Peter was one of New Zealand’s great leaders – both in sailing and as a global champion for the environment. The trust wants to inspire young people to become involved in caring for our environment, and to encourage them to follow his footsteps in leadership. This is what the forum is all about," Ann Sherry said.

Marian Hobbs said regional councils around the country were now each nominating up to three young people aged 16 to 18 to represent their regions.

"We expect a very high calibre of delegate again this year," Marian Hobbs said. "We are looking for young people who will speak their minds and challenge us. I will also encourage the delegates to go back to their regions and share what they have learned."

The forum will build on the success of the inaugural Youth Environment Forum, held in Wellington in September last year.

This year’s forum will run from December 7 to 10 in Wellington, with three days of workshops, field visits and seminars. Delegates will present their findings directly to Marian Hobbs at the conclusion.

The Sir Peter Blake Trust was launched by Prime Minister Helen Clark in June this year, with seed funding from the government.

The trust's aims include enabling young New Zealanders to make a difference in the world by becoming more environmentally aware and developing leadership skills.
