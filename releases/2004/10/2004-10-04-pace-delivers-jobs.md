A recent report from the Ministry of Social Development shows the [Pathways to Arts and Cultural Employment (PACE)](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/find-a-job/pace.html) scheme is helping more people than ever find employment.

"PACE achieved over 2,500 placements into employment since it was launched in November 2001, over 1,000 of these occurred in the last 12 months," says Associate Arts Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard.

"The success of PACE confirms the ongoing strength and vitality of New Zealand’s creative industries as well as our healthy general labour market."

The PACE programme was set up by the government to ensure job seekers are able to take up employment opportunities in the growing creative sector or in general employment.

"PACE has had significant successes on both measures. The scheme operates in all 13 Work and Income regions and, as is to be expected, is most successful in those parts of New Zealand where there are strong creative sectors.

The PACE scheme was developed from a Labour party 1999 manifesto commitment to assist job seekers to develop a career in the arts and creative industries.

PACE enables job seekers registered with Work and Income to identify the creative industries as their first career choice and to include training and other programmes in personalised Job Seeker Agreements that support this career objective. The scheme builds partnerships with local arts organisations to support job seekers and to help case managers identify employment opportunities in the creative sector.
