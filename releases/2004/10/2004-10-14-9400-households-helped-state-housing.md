Over 9,400 households were helped into state housing last year and the number of state rental properties increased by 903 to 65,304.

Housing Minister Steve Maharey said almost 185,000 people now call a state house home – information contained in [Housing New Zealand Corporation’s](http://www.hnzc.co.nz/) 2003/04 [Annual Report](http://www.hnzc.co.nz/aboutus/publications/annualreport/index.htm) tabled in Parliament today.

“The Corporation’s main role is still providing services to state house tenants, but working with community groups, Maori and local government to increase the amount of affordable housing for people on low to moderate incomes is increasingly important.

“The [Housing Innovation Fund](http://www.hnzc.co.nz/aboutus/initiatives/Housing%20Innovation%20Fund.htm) got off to a [good start](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F18064) over the last year, contributing $3.7 million to six new community-based housing developments. The Corporation also worked with 14 local councils on proposals to the [Local Government Housing Fund](http://www.hnzc.co.nz/aboutus/initiatives/Local%20Government%20Housing%20Fund.htm).”

“Over the past year an important aspect of the Corporation’s policy work has been leading the formation of the [New Zealand Housing Strategy](http://www.hnzc.co.nz/nzhousingstrat/index.htm), which will help guide housing policy across the sector over the next 10-years.”

Other activities in 2003/04 included:

- Assisting 366 low income households into home ownership with [Kiwibank In Reach loans](http://www.kiwibank.co.nz/products/kiwibankinreach.stm)
