“New Zealand science has lost an inspirational role model,” says Minister of Research, Science and Technology, Pete Hodgson, on hearing of the death of Nobel Laureate Professor Maurice Wilkins in London yesterday.

“Professor Wilkins made a vital contribution to one of the greatest scientific achievements of the 20th Century, the discovery of the structure of DNA.

“We were lucky to have an opportunity to honour him last year when we celebrated the 50th anniversary of this discovery.

“Professor Wilkins was incredibly proud of his New Zealand heritage. He once commented that his early years in New Zealand gave him the values and inspiration he needed to be successful as a scientist.

“He was renowned for considering science in its broader context and wasn’t afraid of thinking beyond the confines of particular disciplines.

“I offer my sincere condolences to Professor Wilkins’ family and join with the rest of the science community in acknowledging his significant achievements.”
