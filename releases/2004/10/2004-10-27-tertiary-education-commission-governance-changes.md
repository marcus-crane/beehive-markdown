Changes being made to the governance of the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) reflect the good progress it has made in the reform of tertiary education, Steve Maharey, Minister responsible for the Tertiary Education Commission, said today.

The TEC was established on 1 January 2003 to bring the funding of all tertiary education into one agency and lead the shift towards a tertiary system that better matches the needs of New Zealand’s society and economy.

Steve Maharey said that when the TEC was set up, interim governance arrangements were established through to the end of 2005. This meant the initial Chair and Deputy Chair would be full-time appointments and the management team would be headed by a General Manager rather than a Chief Executive. This was reflected in Section 58 of the Education (Tertiary Reform) Amendment Act 2002.

“Given the progress made by the Commission and the departure of former TEC Chair Dr Andrew West earlier this year, we have brought forward the move to a more conventional governance structure to about March 2005.

“I intend to appoint a new part-time Chair for the Commission. Advertisements will be placed in major dailies this week and I intend to make an appointment early in the New Year. The appointment will be for three years.

“The TEC’s Deputy Chair Kaye Turner, who has been Acting Chair since Dr West’s departure in April, will remain in that role until an appointment is made about March. She will then resume her role as Deputy Chair, this time on a part-time basis and Acting Deputy Chair Shona Butterfield return to her commissioner role.

“Kaye Turner and Shona Butterfield have done an excellent job maintaining and strengthening the smooth functioning of the Commission board and overseeing a process of strategic discussions with tertiary education organisations as they develop their funding Profiles.

“In less than two years the Tertiary Education Commission has made major strides in the huge task of transforming our tertiary education system, which is a real credit to the commissioners and senior management team. Major achievements to date have included overseeing the approval of new organisational Charters, undertaking a performance based assessment of nearly 6,000 research staff in the move to a new approach to funding research, and managing the successful roll-out of Industry Training, Modern Apprenticeships and Gateway schools.”
