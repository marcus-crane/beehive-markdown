A comprehensive guide for motor home users to find the right spot to empty their toilet and wastewater is now available.

The new guide, produced by the Ministry for the Environment, directs motor home travellers to their nearest “dump station” (designated wastewater disposal point).

There are about 500 dump stations nationwide, many at holiday parks, service stations or sites provided by local councils.

Environment Minister Marian Hobbs said that with summer almost here and more campervans on the road over Labour weekend the guide is a must-have for local and international holidaymakers.

"My understanding is that motor home users are already doing the right thing for the environment by emptying their wastewater at designated dump stations," Marian Hobbs said. "We want to make it easy for them by providing good information on the many locations where they can get rid of their wastewater."

The guide will be widely available through rental companies, a crucial link to international visitors, and via the New Zealand Motor Caravan Association.

"Tourists want the freedom to discover New Zealand by motor home and we should support them to look after the very thing they have come to experience," Marian Hobbs said.

The guide has been made possible with support from the Rental Vehicle Association, the New Zealand Motor Caravan Association, and Local Government New Zealand.
