Co-operation is the way forward for power security, Environment Minister, Marian Hobbs said after attending a meeting of Mayors and CEO's of the 10 local authorities that might be affected by Transpowers' proposed new transmission line in the Upper North Island.

The Minister outlined to them how proposed amendments to the RMA might help them co-operate and make the tasks ahead more efficient through multi-council and central government co-operation and support.

Local Government New Zealand has organised several meetings of officials and local politicians to consider the way forward in managing Transpower's proposal to build a new transmission line.

LGNZ hosted a meeting of Transpower, central and local government in Hamilton yesterday to begin a co-operative process. Timetables, procedures and pressure points were discussed.

"That this was a big project was acknowledged," Marian Hobbs said. "All wanted to meet the statutory procedures to manage local assets and to represent their communities in the decisions that lie ahead.

"It was a positive meeting with the option of sharing the administrative load making the task ahead more manageable.

"This is what the RMA is being amended for– to achieve good local decision-making that is co-operative, rather than piecemeal and repetitive."
