Prime Minister Helen Clark is attending the 30th anniversary celebrations of Niuean self-government during a visit to Niue next weekend.

The visit will include talks with Niue’s Premier, Young Vivian, attending a historic fono, or gathering, on the preservation and enhancement of Niue’s culture, and official celebration events.

The Prime Minister will also sign a Memorandum of Arrangement which reaffirms the special relationship between Niue and New Zealand, and puts in place a strengthened cooperation programme with the aim of achieving economic viability for Niue.

Helen Clark said New Zealand and Niue share citizenship and close bonds forged over more than a hundred years of association.

“Niue became a dependent territory of New Zealand in 1901. In 1974, following an act of self-determination under United Nations’ auspices, Niue adopted self-government in free association with New Zealand.

“The closeness of the relationship is demonstrated by the fact that Niue’s population is currently approximately 1500 while the Niuean community in New Zealand numbers around 20,000.

“But while New Zealand’s Niuean community is large and active, the wellspring of Niuean culture and language is the home island. It is important that we assist the Niue government’s efforts to maintain Niue’s distinct culture and language.

“The fono is an exciting initiative on the part of the Niue government. It involve the participation of New Zealand Niuean community leaders who will attend as part of the New Zealand delegation to the anniversary celebrations.

“The discussions will look at initiatives to protect and enhance Niuean culture and language following the devastating effects which last January’s Cyclone Heta has had on the Niue community.

“Large efforts have been made towards rebuilding, but there is still a great deal to do. We will discuss ways in which New Zealand might be able to help. There are some private investment initiatives getting under way, and tourism, which was showing such promise just before Heta, is also starting to pick up again.”

“Private sector investment will be a key to sustainable economic growth. There is a significant opportunity now to work with Niue to ensure its viability for the long-term. The Memorandum of Arrangement will put in place new initiatives costing around $20 million over five years.”

Through NZAID, Niue currently receives $8.25 million in assistance annually. This is focused on budgetary support, education, supporting economic development and encouraging sustainable use of Niue’s natural resources.

Since Cyclone Heta, Niue and New Zealand have been working together on the Cyclone Recovery Plan which prioritises construction of a new hospital, establishment of a trust fund, residential housing, tourism development and reinforcing Niue’s cultural heritage.

Niue and New Zealand: questions and answers

Why is the PM visiting Niue?

The Prime Minister will visit Niue 29-31 Oct to take part in celebrations marking 30 years of self-government. It will be her first visit to Niue as PM (she visited Niue as Leader of the Opposition). While there she will sign a Memorandum of Arrangement with Niue and address a Fono, or community discussion, on the protection and enhancement of Niue’s culture and language.

The PM will be hosted during the visit by Premier Young Vivian. She will be accompanied by Ministers Parekura Horomia and Taito Phillip Field, and members of the Niuean community in New Zealand. The New Zealand Niuean community has an important part to play in the country’s culture and development, and participation by their representatives in the Fono was considered essential by both Governments.

What does the Arrangement commit New Zealand to?

The Arrangement reaffirms the special relationship between Niue and New Zealand, recognises the importance of retaining and strengthening Niue’s language and culture, and puts in place a strengthened co-operation programme with the aim of encouraging economic development and population growth.

Niue, with its small public service, is expected not only to ensure the delivery of essential government services but also to carry out work resulting from international agreements, just as bigger countries are. But it cannot keep up. Therefore under the Arrangement it will be able to access New Zealand government departments – for instance Crown Law, Immigration, Customs and Inland Revenue – for support.

Full details of the Arrangement will be released during the PM’s visit.

What is the nature of New Zealand’s relationship with Niue?

Since 1974 Niue has been self-governing in free association with New Zealand, a status distinct from full independence. New Zealand has a statutory obligation under the Niue Constitution Act 1974 “to provide necessary economic and administrative assistance to Niue” Niue manages its own affairs in all respects except foreign affairs and defence. All Niueans are New Zealand citizens.

Between 1901 and 1974 Niue was a dependent territory of New Zealand

New Zealand provides substantial budgetary support for Niue through the New Zealand Agency for International Development, NZAID (see below).

How does NZ support Niue?

NZAID, the Government’s international aid and development agency, provides assistance for Niue of $8.25 million per year. Most of this ($5.75 million) is in the form of budget support and enables Niue to provide essential services to the population.

The remainder is provided as development assistance and includes funds for economic development projects such as tourism and vanilla farming, and a project to improve primary and secondary education.

Since Cyclone Heta struck in January 2004, additional funding of $4.5 million has gone towards:

·funding for heavy equipment (diggers etc) to clear debris;  
·funds to build houses to replace government tenant houses damaged in cyclone. (These are needed for skilled professionals vital to Niue’s recovery and development);  
·asbestos clearing from old roofs;  
·repairs and re-roofing of damaged houses;  
·recovery project manager;  
·assistance for the private sector, to meet needs identified by the Niue Private Sector Taskforce.

Why does Niue need New Zealand’s help?  
The people of Niue are New Zealand citizens and this has contributed to a population exodus over the last 30 years. In 1974 the population of Niue was 4000 and now it is somewhere around 1500 – estimates vary. Niue’s progressive depopulation has created new development challenges and threatens sustainability.

Cyclone Heta, struck Niue on January 5 2004 with winds gusting 300km/h and enormous waves. The main village, Alofi, was destroyed and the rest of the island devastated. The storm destroyed much of the Niue’s infrastructure including roads, the hospital and main wharf.

Depopulation has magnified the impact of Cyclone Heta and rebuilding is proving an enormous task.

Why should New Zealand help Niue? And why now?  
New Zealand has a constitutional obligation to Niue, signed up to in the 1974 agreement, and a responsibility to assist with economic and administrative support. New Zealand is also the home to some 20,000 Niueans who retain a strong cultural connection with the island.  
Niue could fail as a viable community unless New Zealand continues to take an active role there. This would mean the loss forever of a unique culture and language. But in a sense a dependent state is not alive. Therefore it is important to focus on growth.

Right now there is a real opportunity to secure Niue’s future. Private sector investment is taking place in industries including fishing, tourism and crops such as vanilla and noni. Tourism development, particularly, has significant potential as Niue is an attractive visitor destination. Private investment plus Government support for growing commercial enterprise means a viable economic future is possible and realistic.

How can Niue increase its long-term viability?

The development of a strong private sector will be a vital precondition to maintaining Niue’s long-term viability.

New Zealand will continue to play a strong role in assisting Niue. Through NZAID, New Zealand is helping Niue to establish the Niue Trust Fund.

The Trust Fund is a key contributor to the long-term viability of Niue and will eventually provide a regular source of revenue to assist the Government of Niue in the management of the budget and achieve a greater degree of financial autonomy.

The Niue Trust Fund currently stands at more than $9 million, consisting of initial contributions of $5 million and AUS$4 million from New Zealand and Australia respectively.

The construction of a new hospital – one of the main priorities of Niue’s Cyclone Recovery Plan – is likely to be a factor in people remaining on Niue and so will assist with long-term viability.

How will New Zealand monitor what happens in Niue?

NZAID will be working closely with Niue to bring about:

·reduced reliance on aid money;  
·increased taxation revenue;  
·increased employment;  
·reduced vulnerability to cyclones;  
·increased population.  
These factors and associated targets will be the subject of joint monitoring by Niue and New Zealand. Niue’s accounts are audited on its behalf by Audit New Zealand.
