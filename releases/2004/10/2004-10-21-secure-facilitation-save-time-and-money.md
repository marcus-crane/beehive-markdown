Following extensive consultation with industry, Customs Minister Rick Barker has announced a positive outcome following cost recovery discussions for the new Supply Chain Security Strategy.

Rick Barker says he is pleased that the cost recovery measures are fair and set at the right levels across importers, exporters and transhippers. And he reconfirmed the Government's commitment of $22 million for purchasing new scanning equipment and the extra $8 million announced in Budget 2004 to support the strategy and traders.

"From December, screening of all export cargos to the US is required following the new security agreement we have with the US Customs and Border Protection Agency. We are expecting APEC members and the European Union to demand stricter goods checking including X-Ray examination of cargo in the near future," he said.

"The Government purchase of new screening technology means that importers and exporters alike minimize the risk of having their goods unpacked on the wharves, which is very costly, and they'll also get goods across borders more rapidly.

“Speedy transition of goods across borders is essential to give our traders the edge.

"At times of heightened security I have been informed that the US may well shut down ports and later allow only low risk security cleared goods in, therefore this NZ Supply Chain Security Strategy means our goods will be amongst the first to move while others may be stopped.

"The NZ Supply Chain Security Strategy means greater confidence over the low risk nature of New Zealand goods, providing greater facilitation and certainty for our shipments," said Mr Barker.

The fees come in 1 December and will be known as the Import and Export Entry Transaction Fees and the Inward and Outward Cargo Transaction Fees. The Import Entry Transaction Fee will incorporate and replace the present Import Transaction Fee (ITF).
