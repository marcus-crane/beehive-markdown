The first four projects funded by the Ministry of Education’s new Tertiary e-Learning Research Fund are now underway, Associate Education Minister (Tertiary Education) Steve Maharey announced today.

Speaking at the e-Fest 2004 conference hosted by the Open Polytechnic in Wellington, Steve Maharey said the projects focussed on learners, teaching, staff development and organisational issues.

“Researchers have been asked to identify and analyse major trends affecting e-learning and the broader factors that might impact on future tertiary e-learning in New Zealand. The Ministry of Education expects the projects will help to meet the tertiary sector’s need for robust, up-to-date research on e-learning in New Zealand.

“The four projects complement the research being supported by the Tertiary Education Commission’s e-Learning Collaborative Development Fund. The collaboration being demonstrated in some of these projects suggests a positive move towards active partnership and cooperation between tertiary institutions.”

The four research projects, with total funding of $300,000, will be completed by 30 April 2005. The Ministry of Education will soon be calling for proposals for the second round of funding.

The projects selected by the panel of tertiary sector e-learning experts are:
