Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that she will leave next week for Hungary, India, and Singapore.

Helen Clark will leave New Zealand on Wednesday 13 October to travel to this year's Progressive Governance Summit, to be held just outside Budapest, Hungary.

"The Summit is an opportunity for leaders and advisors to share current thinking on policy issues facing centre-left governments. These include demographic and workforce changes, the role of welfare and public services, fiscally responsible growth strategies, and notions of social justice and participation," said Helen Clark.

The Summit is also due to be attended by leaders from the UK, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Canada, Chile, Argentina, South Africa, Korea, and Ethiopia.

Helen Clark will host a function in Budapest on Friday 15 October which will include a screening of a film by a New Zealand producer and director Scott Alexander Young, who is presently based in Budapest.

"The visit to India will be the first by a New Zealand Prime Minister since 1985. India has changed dramatically since that time, and it is clear that New Zealand's relationship with India falls well short of its potential.

"The visit will incorporate the major economic centres of Bangalore and Mumbai, as well as official talks in Delhi with the President, Prime Minister, and Leader of the ruling Congress Party. The ICT, film, and biotech sectors will receive particular attention during the visit.

"A small delegation of New Zealand businesspeople from the ICT sector will accompany me, along with the Ombudsman Anand Satyanand, Families Commissioner Rajen Prasad, and MP Ashraf Choudhary.

"On the way home to New Zealand, I will make a short one-day visit to Singapore, which will provide a chance to renew contacts with the new Prime Minister, promote New Zealand's economic interests, and discuss objectives for the forthcoming ASEAN summit in Laos."

Helen Clark returns to New Zealand on Friday 22 October.
