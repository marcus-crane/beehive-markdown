7 October 2004Media Statement  
$23 million more for Wellington trains  
Finance Minister Michael Cullen today announced $10.6 million for rolling stock for Wairarapa train services. This will be added to $15.85 million to be provided by Transfund New Zealand for the project.

The new money for the Wairarapa service comes hot on the heels of the announcement of the jointly funded $5.4 million upgrade of the Wellington region's 36 English Electric passenger rail units and further refurbishment of Wellington's main railway station.

A tender process for the provision of the new trains is already underway. It is anticipated that the winning supplier, and the date from which new trains can be expected on the line, will be announced in the coming weeks.

"Enhancing the provision of viable public transport is good news for the regional economy, commuters and the environment alike. The government is working in partnership with Wellington regional and local authorities and Toll Holdings Limited, to improve public transport in Wellington,” says Dr Cullen.

“This package has been put together after discussions between local constituency MPs and councils. It is an example of the cooperative approach that is being taken on the issues facing transport in the region.”

Pete Hodgson, Minister of Transport, said that today's $26.45 million funding boost is great news for Wairarapa rail commuters.

“Today's announcement should be viewed as an advanced payment on further improvements to the region's transport infrastructure. Passenger rail helps to relieve road congestion and offers significant environmental benefits.

"Wellington’s rail network has been neglected for far too long. Now that it is back in public ownership, government is acting quickly to repair the situation. The Wellington Transport Project is now well under way and due to report in December on a full range of options for further improvements to be made across all modes of transport in the region,” said Pete Hodgson.
