Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that New Zealand will fully fund the new hospital on Niue, costing around $6 million, to replace the hospital destroyed by Cyclone Heta in January.

She made the announcement while in Niue attending the 30th anniversary celebrations of Niuean self-government.

Helen Clark said New Zealand is committed to assisting Niue rebuild from the devastation of the cyclone and a hospital is crucial to the country and its people.

“Since January, Niue’s medical facility has operated out of temporary premises. New Zealand, Australia, and other donors have provided some equipment and supplies.

“Niue has been able to undertake basic medical treatment, but many more patients have needed referring to New Zealand. This is costly for Niue, and a significant inconvenience for ill people needing treatment.

“New Zealand had already agreed to provide $1 million towards the new hospital from funding allocated for cyclone recovery. The government has now approved a further $5 million to fully fund the construction of the new hospital.

“Basic infrastructure, such as a hospital, is essential if Niue is to rebuild from the devastation of Cyclone Heta.

“Large efforts have been made towards rebuilding, but there is still a great deal to do. This commitment to building a new hospital will give many the confidence to continue the process of recovery,” Helen Clark said.
