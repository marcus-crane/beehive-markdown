The Crown will be appealing the Court of Appeal decision Attorney-General v Zaoui.  
It is important that the test to be applied by the Director of Security when issuing, and the Inspector-General when reviewing, a security risk certificate is clarified.  
The Court of Appeal issued declarations stating that the test of “threat to national security” is a very high one, on the basis of an assumption that if such a certificate was confirmed against Mr Zaoui he would be sent back to face persecution.  
It was never the intention of the Crown to return Mr Zaoui to a place of persecution, regardless of the outcome of the review by the Inspector-General. Any decision by the Minister of Immigration would take account of New Zealand’s international obligations, including its obligation not to deport people to places where they face torture.  
In light of this fact, it is important the test to be applied be clarified by the Supreme Court.
