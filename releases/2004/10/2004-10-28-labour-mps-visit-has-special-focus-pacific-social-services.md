On 28 October 2004, Labour’s Pacific Caucus Committee visited two local Pacific-focused social service providers in South Auckland. This was part of their ongoing effort to keep in touch with their local pacific communities.

The MPs – Taito Phillip Field (Mangere), Ross Robertson (Manukau East), and Mark Gosche (Maungakiekie) - spent the first part of the afternoon at Work and Income’s Pacific Wave Unit. Later they met with the dedicated staff of the youth mentoring programme, Affirming Women.

Taito Phillip Field, who is also the Associate Minister for Pacific Island Affairs, said Affirming Women and the Pacific Wave Unit both contribute towards positive social outcomes in our Pacific community. The Pacific Wave Unit, which was established in 2003 to reduce Auckland’s high Pacific unemployment rate, has already exceeded its own expectations.

“Work and Income staff have done an outstanding job in achieving a 35.8 per cent reduction in the first year. This exceeds the 25 per cent reduction they were aiming for," said Minister Field.

Initiatives to reduce the Pacific unemployment rate, and to support our Pacific youth are being assisted through a broad range of assistance measures introduced by the Labour-led Government. Pacific unemployment nationally has recently fallen to 7.4 per cent.

The MPs all agreed that initiatives like those run by Affirming Women are crucial to maintaining this downward trend in Pacific unemployment. Providing positive mentoring for youth is the key to the ongoing success of all communities.

The Pacific Caucus was please to have met with both the Pacific Wave Unit and Affirming Women to see for themselves the hard work being put in to build a prosperous Pacific community, and to take back to Wellington the message of local success.
