Associate Communications and Information Technology Minister David Cunliffe is backing Vodafone and Telecom's decision to establish a mobile phone safety code of practice.

"This is an important step for protecting children. The government will work with the Telecommunications Carriers Forum to ensure they have any legal backing they need." said David Cunliffe.

Safety concerns about mobile phone chat rooms were raised after a journalist posing as a thirteen year old girl received a number of sexually oriented approaches from older men.

David Cunliffe met with the leading mobile phone providers who agreed to approach the Telecommunications Carriers Forum to establish a code of practice to protect children while using services such as text chat rooms.

The government will consider whether current laws will need to be changed to allow authorities to investigate inappropriate behaviour.

"The willingness of the mobile phone providers to act quickly has been very pleasing. I am looking forward to seeing a draft code of practice before the end of the year." said David Cunliffe.
