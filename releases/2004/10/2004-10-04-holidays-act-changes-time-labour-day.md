The Transport and Industrial Relations Committee today reported back to Parliament on the [Holidays Amendment Bill](http://www.clerk.parliament.govt.nz/Content/SelectCommitteeReports/182BAR2.pdf).

“I thank the select committee for its efforts under considerable time pressure – only one month was allocated for the select committee's consideration of the Bill and they have done an excellent job," Labour Minister Paul Swain said.

The select committee has recommended only minor changes to the Bill, but Paul Swain said this was expected.

"The Bill was introduced to clarify some areas of uncertainty and was not a review of the government's core policies on holiday and leave entitlements. I was not expecting the select committee to recommend significant amendments to this Bill."

The government introduced the Holidays Amendment Bill in September following difficulties with the interpretation of some provisions of the Holidays Act.

The select committee's key recommendations clarify that:

- Penal rates do not include overtime
- Employees can choose their doctor if a medical certificate is requested
- Employers are only required to pay an employee's reasonable expenses, when requesting a medical certificate
- Employees who are asked for a medical certificate and do not provide it without good reason, may not be paid sick leave.

Paul Swain said the government intended to have the Bill in force by Labour Day, 25 October 2004.
