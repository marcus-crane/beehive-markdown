National leader Don Brash's comments on issues surrounding Tuwharetoa's property rights to Lake Taupo are hypocritical, Conservation Minister Chris Carter said today.

"What Don Brash isn't telling New Zealanders is that it was a National Government that drew up and signed a trust deed with Tuwharetoa that gave the tribe property rights in Lake Taupo in 1992," Mr Carter said.

"Unfortunately, the National Government failed to be explicit about what it was signing away, and because of this the current government is having to enter negotiations to resolve any uncertainties.

"Mr Brash should be demanding answers from National MPs Roger Sowry, Bill English, Murray McCully, Nick Smith, Tony Ryall, Lockwood Smith and Maurice Williamson. They were all part of the government that signed the deed. It is time National took responsibility for the uncertainty it created," Mr Carter said.
