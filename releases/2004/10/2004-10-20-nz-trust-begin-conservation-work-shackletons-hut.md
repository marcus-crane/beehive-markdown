New Zealand's Antarctic Heritage Trust will soon begin conservation work on Sir Ernest Shackleton’s historic Antarctic hut, thanks to a US$250,000 grant from the Getty Centre in Los Angeles.

The grant was welcomed today by Acting Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister, Judith Tizard, who says international support is essential to preserving the legacy of early Antarctic exploration.

“I am delighted the Getty has made such a generous commitment to this world-leading conservation project. The buildings and their contents are an extraordinary legacy of international significance and must be conserved for future generations."

Judith Tizard said the New Zealand government had provided seed funding of $400,000 for the project and was contributing $100,000 a year for the Trust’s operating costs.

Antarctic Heritage Trust Executive Director Nigel Watson said the Getty Grant would help secure the success of the Trust’s Antarctic project, which aims to conserve the wooden huts built by early Antarctic explorers, Shackleton, Scott and Borchgrevink.

“Without the support of the international community, we cannot hope to conserve these exceptional sites, which are remarkable symbols of humanity’s courage and determination and the only surviving examples of habitations built by the first humans to reach a continent.

“We hope the British Government will be inspired by the commitment of organisations like the Getty and the World Monuments Fund to also become a partner in this project, in support of our efforts to protect the legacy of two of Britain’s greatest heroes," Nigel Watson said.

Chris Cochran, conservation architect and editor of the conservation report for Shackleton’s hut said the grant will enable the Trust’s conservation experts to start detailed work on a long term project to conserve Shackleton’s hut at Cape Royds, in Antarctica’s Ross Sea region. The first major steps in the conservation of the fabric and structure of the building will begin in the summer of 2005-06, subject to final environmental permitting.

The Shackleton hut is the only building left on the continent by the famous explorer, and was listed last year as one of the world’s 100 most endangered sites by the World Monuments Fund.
