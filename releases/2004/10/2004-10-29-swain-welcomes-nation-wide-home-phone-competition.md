Communications Minister Paul Swain said today's launch of TelstraClear's new nation wide home phone service is further proof the Telecommunications Act is working.

"This is good news for residential customers who now have a choice of phone companies.

"The government has established a competitive telecommunications environment with a regulatory backstop to benefit New Zealanders."

Paul Swain said the Act, passed by the government in 2001, set up a framework for promoting competition and established a Telecommunications Commissioner to resolve disputes between competing companies when commercial negotiations fail.

"TelstraClear's new service is a result of the government's reforms in the telecommunications industry. Home phone users are the winners today."
