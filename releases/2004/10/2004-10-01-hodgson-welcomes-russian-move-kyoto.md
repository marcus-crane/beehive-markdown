Pete Hodgson today welcomed the latest step towards the Kyoto Protocol coming into force.

Russian Ministers approved a draft law overnight proposing ratification of the Protocol, which will be forwarded by President Putin to the Russian Parliaments' lower house, the Duma, for its endorsement.

"This is a very positive step," says Convenor, Ministerial Group on Climate change, Pete Hodgson. "I commend President Putin and his Ministers for the leadership they are showing in wanting to do something meaningful to tackle climate change. I look forward to hearing the decision of the Duma.

International Action on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol

United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change

International action to tackle climate change began at the 1992 Earth Summit, with the adoption of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This has the objective of preventing dangerous anthropogenic (man-made) interference with the climate system. This agreement was ratified by 185 nations, including New Zealand, Australia and the United States.

All developed countries that ratified the UNFCCC agreed to voluntarily reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.

By the mid-1990s the international community recognised that few countries were making progress toward meeting this voluntary target, and that more urgent action would be needed. This led to negotiation in 1997 of the binding commitments of the Kyoto Protocol.

The Kyoto Protocol

The Kyoto Protocol is a binding international agreement that aims to reduce developed country greenhouse gas emissions to five per cent below 1990 levels over the period 2008-2012. Commitments after 2012 are yet to be negotiated.

Countries that reduce net emissions below their target level are able to trade the excess to other countries that do not meet their targets, thereby establishing an international market for “emissions units”. Because of significant forestry planting in the mid-1990s, New Zealand will meet its obligations and have surplus units.

New Zealand is the 101st of 125 nations that have ratified the Protocol so far. Twenty nine of the 34 developed countries have ratified. Australia, Liechtenstein, Monaco, the Russian Federation, and the United States have not.

Kyoto Protocol commitments will become legally binding once countries responsible for 55 per cent of developed country emissions have ratified. Russia's ratification would see that threshold surpassed.

Beyond 2012

The Kyoto Protocol is the first small step toward tackling climate change. Future commitments for all countries will need to be more onerous, and global participation broader. United Nations scientific estimates are that global greenhouse gas emissions will need to be reduced by around 50 per cent by the end of this century to stabilise atmospheric concentrations at twice pre-industrial levels, a level that is still high enough to cause significant climate change.
