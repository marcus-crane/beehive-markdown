The transfer of 13 Rotorua lakebeds to the Te Arawa Mâori Trust Board will guarantee continued public access to the lakes, Treaty Negotiations Minister Margaret Wilson said today.

The Crown and Te Arawa Mâori Trust Board today initialled a Deed of Settlement relating to Te Arawa’s historical Treaty of Waitangi claims in relation to the 14 Rotorua lakes. The settlement also capitalises the trust board's annuity and settles any remaining annuity issues.

“This Deed of Settlement formalises the Agreement in Principle of December 2003," Margaret Wilson said. “Both parties have shown commitment to the settlement of Te Arawa’s lakes claims.”

The redress components in the offer include:  
·acknowledgements by the Crown of historical breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles;  
·a cultural redress package that reflects Te Arawa’s relationships with the lakes; and  
·financial redress of $10 million.

The financial redress element of the offer includes $2.7 million for historical claims. The remaining $7.3 million is to buy out the annuity paid to the Te Arawa Mâori Trust Board and resolves any outstanding annuity issues.

"A key aspect of the cultural redress is the vesting of title to 13 of the 14 lakebeds in Te Arawa," Margaret Wilson said. "Free public access for recreational purposes will be preserved, as will the existing rights of commercial users of the lakes."

The parties initialled the Deed of Settlement at Parliament this morning after months of intensive negotiation on the detail of the Agreement in Principle reached last December.

The Deed of Settlement is now subject to ratification by the people of Te Arawa. The settlement will be implemented through legislation after ratification. A governance entity will be established to receive the settlement redress.
