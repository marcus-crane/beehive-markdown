Embargoed to midnightLabour will maintain public health provision - Cullen

Finance Minister Michael Cullen today reassured middle and higher income New Zealanders that a Labour-led government would not move to a fully user-pays health system.

Dr Cullen was commenting on a research paper released today by the Health Funds Association on the long-term funding of New Zealand health care.

The report suggests a variety of mechanisms to transfer to employers the health care costs of their employees and to require people earning $38,000 plus to pay for all their own health services.

“The basic assumption behind the analysis is that health funding is out of control and that it is necessary to introduce stronger value-for money disciplines.

“As Finance Minister I am acutely interested in getting good value from the health dollar, improving health productivity and containing health spending within affordable limits.

“But although there are real cost pressures on the health budget, the projections used in the report are significantly larger that Treasury estimates. For example: the report projects health spending to rise to 63 per cent of GDP by 2050 but Treasury projections are for a much smaller increase to 10.8 per cent.

“Similarly, the report’s author assumes a health inflation factor of 8 per cent a year compared to Treasury’s figure of 1.5 per cent. The basis for this contention is highly dubious.

“The report’s attempt to argue that everybody would be better off if middle income New Zealanders paid for the full cost of health care is little more than snake oil medicine.

“But, of course, it does serve the interests of those who funded the research,” Dr Cullen said.

Treasury Report:Ministerial Briefing - Long Term Funding of NZ Health Care – HFANZ Report  
Executive Summary  
1.The report “The Long Term Funding of New Zealand Healthcare” will be released by the Health Funds Association of New Zealand (HFANZ) on 14 October 2004. The report was written by Kim von Lanthen, a former Chief Analyst in the health section at The Treasury. Officials were briefed on the report and supplied with copies on 11 October 2004.

2.The basic premises of the report are that :

athe rate of increase in public health expenditure is unsustainable in the medium-term, and  
bsubstantial productivity improvements are possible within the health sector, through increasing the number of private purchasers within the system (e.g. insurance companies and individuals).

3.These points are likely to generate significant media interest. Treasury officials are currently engaged in work in these areas.

4.The report proposes that public health inflation is at record levels and the rate of increase is unsustainable. The report projects health expenditure to be 63% of GDP by 2050. This differs from the most recent Treasury projection (see Treasury report T2003/1960) of 10.8% of GDP by 2050.

5.The HFANZ projections are based on the Treasury approach, but use significantly different key assumptions. The main driver of the differences in projections is an inflation factor of 8%, compared to Treasury’s figure of 1.5%.

6.There are a number of statements about the quantum of health inflation; for example, the paper states that public health inflation is 8% compared to the private sector’s figure of 4%. The report uses the term inflation, but the term is used ambiguously. In some contexts it appears to refer to price inflation; in others to growth in expenditure or output unit cost inflation.

7.We have been unable to determine how the 8% figure for inflation has been derived. The estimate of 8% inflation appears to be derived from figures in the report which suggest a 7.5% cost increase in hospital funding between 2002/03 and 03/04, and a decline in outputs of 1%. HFANZ have offered share the model with Treasury officials, but we have yet to go through it.

8.Treasury officials’ experience is that output data is generally unavailable or of poor quality. Recent work on productivity (in progress), carried out by Treasury officials, indicates that hospital services may have experienced output unit cost inflation in the region of 5% per annum over the last three years. However, output data is only available for some 40-50% of hospital activity, so this figure may be overstated by not accounting for any increase in other activity. We conclude, therefore, that the public health inflation figure, as stated in the HFANZ report, is more descriptive of increases in public funding.

9.Private health inflation as part of the Consumers Price Index includes household expenditure on health items, such as GP and dental services, optometry and prescription charges, as well as health insurance. Inflation of this indicator would be reduced by recent changes in publicly-funded services such as increases in payments to PHOs, which reduce the co-payment paid by households. This measure of private health inflation does not provide a straightforward picture of inflation in private health services or health insurance premiums. It does not seem comparable to the 8% public inflation measure.

10.Several suggestions with the aim of improving the value-for-money focus are included in the report. These are itemised below with Treasury comments in italics:  
aHealth sector inflation be calculated on an on-going basis,  
We think that the author is talking about an input unit cost index. The health sector is the sole generator of health inflation, and there are risks that availability of a separate indicator would increase pressure for the Government to meet a certain level of growth. Calculation is also open to manipulation.  
On the other hand, officials think that an output unit cost index would be useful as a basis for monitoring and improving efficiency.  
bDHBs, the Ministry of Health and central agencies clarify their respective roles in controlling public health inflation. The report recommends that contestable funding be introduced into the DHB system as a way of controlling cost. Key elements of the approach are that:

1.Earners with incomes in excess of $38,000 be required to purchase their own health care, with concomitant tax refunds, and  
2.DHBs provide service to these people, charging the true cost of service.

Given that the relatively new system of District Health Boards has now had time to bed down, officials agree it would useful and timely for DHBs, the Ministry of Health and central agencies to clarify their respective roles in controlling public health expenditure.  
The points raised in the report suggest contestability in the funding of population health services. The brevity of the proposal means that many salient issues are not covered. Such a radical change would impact on many aspects of the public system, and the proposal lacks sufficient detail to assess it adequately. The effectiveness of insurance models in holding down costs is also questionable .

cFBT on health insurance be removed to encourage employer purchase,  
Removal of FBT from a potentially significant benefit would create precedents that may be difficult to manage. For example, it would be difficult to define what, and who, might be covered by health insurance. Treasury estimates that the net cost to Government would be in the region of $37 million.

dHealth insurers extend coverage to include all services required by working age people,  
note that officials are not aware of any impediments to this extension; other than that there are currently no private providers for many services. The Private Involvement Protocols agreed by Cabinet (CAB (00) M 32/2A(2) ) require that before DHBs can provide services to private patients they must demonstrate benefits to publicly funded patients, that they have spare capacity and that private involvement does not detract from public services. This protocol has effectively prevented DHBs from developing services for private patients.

11.We understand that HFANZ have requested to meet with you regarding this document.
