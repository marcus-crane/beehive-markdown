Analysis of the Sustainable Farming Fund’s impact shows that it has funded work potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars to rural New Zealand and the country as a whole, Rural Affairs Minister Jim Sutton said today.

Mr Sutton said the analysis, carried out by BERL and commissioned by the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry, estimated that that the potential economic developments from the funded projects could eventually result in an increase of GDP (or farmgate production) of between $350 million to $530 million a year, if all potential developments proceed.

On top of that, the process and approach of the fund, which requires substantial community and stakeholder involvement, has often resulted in social cohesion and capability that increase the likelihood that these developments will proceed, the report says.

BERL reviewed 106 projects part-funded by the Sustainable Farming Fund and its report says there is a strong portfolio of projects.

Mr Sutton said the Sustainable Farming Fund was contributing to some excellent projects across New Zealand, covering everything from alpacas to walnuts and everything in between: areas such as arable; beekeeping; decision, management, and learning; forestry; horticulture; land development opportunities; organics; pastoral farming; and water resources and irrigation.

“I am delighted by the calibre of projects the fund has seen to fruition. The quality of applications is consistently high, and the fund over-subscribed.

“The fund is another demonstrable commitment by this Government to rural communities.”

Mr Sutton said the fund was established by the Labour-led Government in 2000, in fulfillment of an election promise.

“I said at the time it was the most important measure announced for farming and rural communities in that year's Budget. The results have borne that out.”

He said this year’s Budget contained an allocation of $10.6 million a year for the next three years to continue the important work the Sustainable Farming Fund was doing, supporting growth and innovation in rural communities.  
The Sustainable Farming Fund contributes to community-driven projects that enhance the economic, social, and environmental sustainability of rural communities.
