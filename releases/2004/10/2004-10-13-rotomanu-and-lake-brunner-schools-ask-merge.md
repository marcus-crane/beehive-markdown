Education Minister Trevor Mallard has approved a request to merge Rotomanu School and Lake Brunner School in Moana, in the South Island.

Rotomanu School requested a merger with Lake Brunner School, following concerns that Rotomanu would drop from its current two teacher status due to a natural decline in the school aged population in the area.

Following consultation with the community and other schools whose rolls may be affected by the change, the two boards of trustees felt it was in the best interests of the children's education to merge the two schools.

Trevor Mallard said the schools had taken a proactive approach to ensure sustainable quality education for their students.

The merger will take effect from 28 January 2005 and Lake Brunner will be the continuing school.

The merger means an additional $464,000 will be invested into property at Lake Brunner School and $201,500 in Educational Development Initiative funding will be available to enhance teaching and learning at the new school.

The Lake Brunner School Board of Trustees will co-opt a member of the Rotomanu School Board to help them plan for the setting up of the new school for the start of the 2005 teaching year.
