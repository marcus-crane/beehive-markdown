New Zealand has just been named the number-one holiday destination for readers of UK newspaper The Daily Telegraph—knocking Italy out of the top spot it has held for four years running.

This is the first time New Zealand has won the Telegraph Travel Award. The honour comes hot on the heels of other prestigious UK awards, including winning the Guardian & Observer’s People’s Choice award for best long-haul travel destination for the fourth time, and taking gold the first-ever New Zealand entry in the Chelsea Flower Show.

Tourism Minister Mark Burton says that he’s thrilled, but not at all surprised.

“The Telegraph awards are based on readers’ actual holiday experiences, not just their perceptions of an ideal destination. And the fact of the matter is New Zealand is no ordinary destination. Guests can enjoy adventure tourism, world-class food and wine, a wide range of quality accommodation, spas, wildlife, skiing, and unique cultural events—all set against the backdrop of the world’s most beautiful and diverse landscapes.

“Our tourism sector has put quality at the heart of the industry. Our focus is on sustainability—balancing the care, protection, and enhancement of our natural and cultural environments with tourism’s obvious financial benefits. As a result, guests to our country come away with experiences that simply can’t be found anywhere else.

“Clearly, this message is getting through to our target market overseas. People in the United Kingdom have been talking about us all year. And if New Zealand is top of mind for the general public, they will be more likely to translate those thoughts into visits.

“I congratulate the entire tourism sector for a very good year indeed.”

The awards were based on a survey sent to over 26,000 readers, and were presented last night at a London ceremony.
