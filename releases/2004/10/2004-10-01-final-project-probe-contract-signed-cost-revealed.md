Education Minister Trevor Mallard today announced the final cost of Project Probe - the government's rollout of high speed internet access to regions around New Zealand - following the signing of the final PROBE contract.

"Today the final contract was signed meaning high speed internet is on its way to 63 remote schools and their communities. ICONZ is the provider of broadband for this satellite region which includes the Chatham Islands," Trevor Mallard told the Navcon Learning for the Future conference in Christchurch today.

“Project PROBE (Provincial Broadband Extension) signifies our government’s commitment to investing in critical infrastructure, with a total investment of $48.3 million. Details of the investment have not been able to be released previously because of commercial sensitivity during negotiations.

"Under the contract with ICONZ , schools will be provided with a 64kbps service which is burstable to higher speeds, and capable of supporting additional bandwidth to support a 512 kbps video conferencing service. Schools will pay a monthly rental of $150 for this, with the government providing a subsidy of $300 per month.

"This investment demonstrates our commitment to ensuring our very isolated and rural communities do not miss out on services that are taken for granted in urban areas.

"We will also be using the ICONZ combined satellite and wireless solution to solve some other particularly difficult-to-serve areas around the country including Canterbury’s Waiau Valley and Haast on the West Coast.

"This is an investment that will boost education and economic development across New Zealand and it is an important part of our strategy to grow a more innovative economy.

“Broadband means students and their families, business people and communities will have opportunities in education and economic development regardless of where they live and work. High-speed internet means our industries can take world-class ideas to the international arena and our students can share teachers and resources with students elsewhere in New Zealand and overseas.

“We are set to see broadband coverage to most schools by the end of this year. The 63 schools and communities on the satellite option can expect to receive service progressively from now through to the middle of next year.

**Questions and Answers**

**What is Project PROBE?**  
Project PROBE is a major government initiative. Project PROBE stands for Provincial Broadband Extension and has been developed jointly by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Economic Development.

**What is Broadband?**  
Broadband is the name given to two way high speed, high capacity, always connected form of telecommunications. It offers a unique opportunity to countries with low population densities such as New Zealand in addressing quality and timely healthcare access and equity issues across the spectrum of Health Information, Health Commerce and Telemedicine applications.  
To illustrate the capabilities of Broadband, the following table presents the time it takes to transfer a typical X-ray image from the Internet to a personal computer using different telecommunication types.

**What are the benefits of having high speed internet access?**  
Broadband internet opens up huge opportunities for students and schools in remote and isolated country regions – opportunities that students in urban areas already have. Through broadband students in Wairoa will have access to the same information as students in Wellington or New York. Broadband-enabled two-way video conferencing can allow school subjects like advanced sciences and mathematics and te Reo to be taught to learners in very remote schools.

Rural businesses will be able to tap into the same internet capability as businesses in the cities. Broadband is a major tool for businesses in terms of accessing information, opening up new markets, enabling access to world markets, and driving increased efficiency through e-commerce.

The extension of broadband coverage will also bring enhanced benefits to rural communities in the form of improved access to health and social services and to a range of other public services and information already on the internet.

**How much is Project PROBE costing?**  
Government has committed $48.3 million in funding to Project PROBE.

**How does Project PROBE work?**  
Fourteen geographical regions have been established throughout New Zealand, with a 15th region to provide national satellite coverage for those schools where a terrestrial solution would be impractical.

The 14 regions are: Northland, Auckland, Bay of Plenty, Waikato, Hawkes Bay/Gisborne, Taranaki, Manawatu/Wanganui, Wairarapa, Wellington/Kapiti/Horowhenua, Nelson/Tasman/Marlborough, West Coast, Canterbury (including Chatham Islands), Otago, and Southland.

Three regions – Southland, Wairarapa and Northland, elected to proceed with independent tendering processes with the understanding that, provided government objectives for Project PROBE were met, funding from the PROBE project would be available to meet at least some of their costs.

**When will the contracts be signed?**  
With the signing of the satellite option all the Project PROBE contracts have now been signed.

**What is ICONZ?**  
Founded in 1996 as The Internet Company of New Zealand, ICONZ, has built a reputation for delivering reliable and cost-efficient networking solutions to New Zealand business.  
The company will be using IPSTAR to provide satellite-based broadband Internet services throughout New Zealand.

**Is Project PROBE still on target to have broadband coverage throughout New Zealand by the end of 2004?**  
Most schools and their communities will have access to broadband by the end of 2004. The rollout to the 63 schools in the satellite region will be completed by June next year; coverage to 22 of these schools is expected by the end of 2004. A timetable is available on the Project PROBE website.

**How can I find out more about broadband access in my region?**  
The latest Update Newsletter, No 4 August 2004, on the Project PROBE website gives contact details of the regional Project PROBE coordinators.
