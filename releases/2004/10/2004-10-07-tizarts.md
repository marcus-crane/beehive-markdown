  [**PM's Literary Awards announced**]()
  
  Three of New Zealand's most distinguished writers – Kevin Ireland, Anne Salmond and Maurice Gee – have been honoured in the 2004 Prime Minister’s Awards for Literary Achievement.
  
  The annual awards recognise New Zealand writers who have made an outstanding contribution to New Zealand literature. The three $60,000 awards were presented to Kevin Ireland of Auckland for poetry; Anne Salmond of Auckland for non-fiction; and Maurice Gee of Wellington for fiction.
  
  Announcing the Awards, Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark said that Kevin Ireland, Anne Salmond and Maurice Gee have made life-long contributions to New Zealand’s literary canon.
  
  “Anne Salmond has a remarkable reputation as a scholar and a storyteller. Her contribution to enhancing Päkeha knowledge of Mäori is immense. Maurice Gee is simply the doyen of living New Zealand novelists and his record is second to none. Kevin Ireland is one of our finest poets with numerous awards for his writing and is also a leader within New Zealand’s writing community.
  
  “The quality and contribution of these three literary figures give this award its status.”
  
  This is the second year that the Prime Minister’s Awards for Literary Achievement have been presented. [In 2003](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F18038), the inaugural recipients were Janet Frame (fiction), Hone Tuwhare (poetry) and Michael King (non-fiction).
  
  New Zealanders were invited to nominate their choice of an outstanding New Zealand writer who has made a significant contribution to New Zealand literature, in the genres of poetry, fiction and non-fiction. The nominations were assessed by an expert literary panel and recommendations were forwarded to the Council of Creative New Zealand for approval.
  
  [Pathways to Arts and Cultural Employment (PACE)](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/find-a-job/pace.html) scheme is helping more people than ever find employment in the arts.
  
  PACE achieved over 2,500 placements into employment since it was launched in November 2001 with over 1,000 of these occurring in the last 12 months.
  
  "The success of PACE confirms the ongoing strength and vitality of New Zealand’s creative industries as well as our healthy general labour market," said Associate Arts Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard.
  
  According to reports by the [New Zealand Institute of Economic Research](http://www.nzier.org.nz), employment in the creative sector is continuing to enjoy strong growth. A 2002 report put job growth in the sector at 3.5 percent year on year. Overall, the creative industries contribute around 3.1 % of total GDP.
  
  Social Development Minister Steve Maharey said the PACE programme was set up to ensure job seekers are able to take up employment opportunities in the growing creative sector or in general employment.
  
  "The programme has had significant successes on both measures. The scheme operates in all 13 Work and Income regions and, as is to be expected, is most successful in those parts of New Zealand where there are strong creative sectors."
  
  The PACE scheme was developed from a Labour party 1999 manifesto commitment to assist job seekers to develop a career in the arts and creative industries. It enables job seekers registered with Work and Income to identify the creative industries as their first career choice and to include training and other programmes in personalised Job Seeker Agreements that support this career objective. The scheme builds partnerships with local arts organisations to support job seekers and to help case managers identify employment opportunities in the creative sector.
  
  [NZ Music Awards](http://www.nzmusicawards.co.nz/awards2004/home.asp) was a night to remember - a tribute to our rising stars and a celebration of a newfound confidence in local music.
  
  Live performances from Scribe and Hayley Westenra were highlights of the evening, as well as a tribute to the late Shaun Joyce, awarded a lifetime achievement award for his contribution to NZ music.
  
  From the moment the musicians, VIPs and industry icons arrived to a red-carpet welcome at Auckland's Aotea Centre (complete with screaming fans and a swarm of local paparazzi) it was obvious that local music was enjoying a newfound confidence among its New Zealand audiences.
  
  Among the big winners on the night were hip-hop sensation Scribe, pop Diva Hayley Westenra and newcomer Brooke Fraser.
  
  Scribe scooped seven major awards for his lyrical and slick brand of NZ-hip-hop, including album of the year, single of the year and best male solo artist.
  
  Former StraightJacket Fits frontman Shayne Carter's band Dimmer won Best Group on the back of their latest album 'You've got to hear the music', a smouldering eclectic collection of contemporary rock tunes.
  
  The awards also paid homage to some longstanding and well-loved names in the music industry. The Rodger Fox Big Band, won best jazz album for 'A Rare Connection', Salmonella Dub took home Best Dance / Electronica Album for One Drop East.
  
  The newfound strength of NZ music was evident across a range of genres. John Psathas, the Wellington composer behind the opening music for the Athens Olympics, won the best classical album for his stunning 'Psathas: Fragments'. Best Maori album went to Ruia Aperahama (of 'What's the Time Mr Wolf' fame) for Hawaiki, a pop-jazz album fused with traditional Maori sounds.
  
  This year's winners demonstrated the quality and talent inherent in local music as well as the current strength of our music industry. I came away from the evening with an impression of a music industry that was confident, upbeat, and optimistic about its future.
  
  And the industry has good reason to feel confident.
  
  Local music is stronger than ever with Kiwi singles recently accounting for 6 of the top 10, a new record for New Zealand music. New Zealand music now has 20 percent of radio airplay – 10 times more than a decade ago.
  
  The industry has come a long way from the days where NZ artist's often had to win acclaim overseas before they could enjoy chart success in NZ.
  
  We’ve learned New Zealand music can dominate sales in New Zealand. Our next step has to be to build an industry capable of achieving domination of music sales globally.
  
  Artists like The Datsuns, Hayley Westenra and Steriogram are paving the way and reaching global audiences. We want more of them.
  
  In September last year the government set up the [Music Industry Export Development Group](http://www.nzte.govt.nz/section/13382.aspx) to provide government with an agreed plan for the music export industry and government, in partnership.
  
  The government is currently considering its response to the group’s report [Creating Heat - Tumata kia whita!](http://www.nzte.govt.nz/section/13673/10931.aspx)
  
  The report includes a strategy for improving the export potential of our music industry across the board using opportunities from professional development to niche marketing and distribution.
  
  The government is committed to working closely with the industry and we're currently developing a formal response to its recommendations.
  
  With the current stock of local talent, and a collective industry approach, I'm confident the New Zealand music industry has what it takes to propel more of our artists to the forefront of global music.
  
  I look forward to watching the progress of this year's music award winners as they continue to build on their success and take on the challenges of the international music scene.

  [Toronto Film Festival](http://www.e.bell.ca/filmfest/2004/mediacentre/release.asp?id=101), evidence that the New Zealand film industry is continuing to build on the huge success of Whale Rider.
  
  [In My Father’s Den](http://www.inmyfathersden.com) was awarded the prestigious International Film Critics’ Prize at the Toronto Film Festival in Canada for its "emotional maturity, striking performances and visual grace". Whale Rider won the people's choice award at the same festival two years ago.
  
  The film has also been awarded the Mercedes Benz Youth Jury Prize at the 52nd [San Sebastian Film Festival](http://www.sansebastianfestival.com/) in Spain.
  
  Written and directed by New Zealander Brad McGann, the film is based on the acclaimed novel by Maurice Gee.
  
  Associate Arts Culture and Heritage Minister, Judith Tizard said this latest success was a reminder that New Zealand films can compete with the best in the world.
  
  "It is wonderful to see another great New Zealand novel so eloquently translated to the screen. The film's acclaim among overseas critics and audiences once again demonstrates the ability of New Zealanders to compete and succeed in one of the most challenging and creatively demanding of art forms."
  
  In My Father's Den is a New Zealand-UK co-production, financed by the New Zealand Film Commission, NZ On Air, Visionview and the UK Film Council.
  
  The film will be released in New Zealand by Hoyts/Icon on 7 October 2004 and in Australia through Icon Films on October 28.
  
  Critical acclaim for In my Father's Den:
  
  “*Artfully played and depicted with acute sensitivity*” Russell Edwards, Variety
  
  “*A packed house was gripped by NZ director-writer Brad McGann’s assured debut feature*” Frank Hatherley, Screen International
  
  “*A triumph*” Garry Maddox, Sydney Morning Herald.
  
  “*Not only is it one of the best films to hail from this part of the world, but it is also one of the best films I have ever seen*” Lawrie Zion, The Australian.
  
  “*This moody strongly atmospheric drama reinforces the strength of contemporary New Zealand film making*" Co-Director of the Toronto Festival, Noah Cowan
