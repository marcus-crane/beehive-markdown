Defence Minister Mark Burton today reported to Cabinet on progress to date on the independent assessment of the responses and comments raised relating to alleged abuses at the Waiouru Regular Force Cadet School.

“Further work needs to be undertaken to finalise the appropriate form and terms of reference for this assessment process. I expect to make an announcement later this week.

“I reiterate that these are complex, historical claims, many of which date back 25-45 years. We must take all necessary steps to set up an appropriate, thorough process to scope and assess these allegations in a serious, professional, credible, and independent manner.”

Results of the assessment will include:

·a full report of the facts  
·identifying any further action required  
·separating issues of mistreatment from more serious allegations that, even in the context of the time, may amount to criminal offences.

“Once the assessment is complete, a report will be presented to me. I will consult the Attorney General about the findings, and present the report to Cabinet for consideration of any recommendations for further action,” said Mark Burton.
