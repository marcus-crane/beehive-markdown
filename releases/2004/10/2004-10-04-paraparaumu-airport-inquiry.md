Cabinet has today decided that the Auditor-General be invited to undertake an inquiry into matters related to the sale of Paraparaumu airport.

This is in line with one of the recommendations made by the Transport and Industrial Relations Committee after it had considered matters arising from a petition by Ross Sutherland. The Committee published its report in May 2004.
