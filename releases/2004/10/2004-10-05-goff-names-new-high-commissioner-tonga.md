New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to Tonga will be career diplomat Michael McBryde, Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced today.

“New Zealand and Tonga share a close and long-standing relationship," Mr Goff said.

"Many New Zealanders are of Tongan descent; we have strong cultural and economic ties as Pacific neighbours, and developments in Tonga continue to be of close interest to New Zealand.

“Mr McBryde's extensive experience in the Pacific – he has previously been posted in Rarotonga and Apia – will equip him well to engage actively with the government and people of Tonga,“ Mr Goff said.

Mr McBryde is currently deputy director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade's environment division. As well as his previous Pacific postings, he has also served in Bonn and Canberra. He will take up his position in December, replacing Warwick Hawker.
