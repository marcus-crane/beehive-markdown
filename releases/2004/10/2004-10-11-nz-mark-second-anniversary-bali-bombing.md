New Zealand’s ambassador to Indonesia will represent the government at a ceremony in Bali tomorrow marking the second anniversary of the Kuta bombings, Foreign Minister Phil Goff said today.

“Chris Elder will participate in a wreath-laying at the site of the bomb attack that claimed 202 lives, three of them New Zealanders, and injured many more,” Mr Goff said.

“This will be a quiet but dignified service, organised by Australia and dedicated to all those who lost their lives in the bombing.

“Two years on, the attack on innocent holidaymakers remains a painful memory for all of us and it is important that we mark the occasion at both a personal and a national level.

“The Bali bombing was a significant event for all New Zealanders. It brought global terrorism close to home and reminded us that no-one is immune from threat."

Mr Goff said New Zealand had responded to the bombings and the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York with a series of measures aimed at increasing the security of New Zealanders both at home and aboard.

These included strengthened aviation security and border protection measures; increased intelligence capacity; the establishment of a police intelligence unit, and the passing of the Terrorism Suppression Act.

“Terrorism will not be overcome quickly or easily. However New Zealand is firmly opposed to terrorism in all its forms, and we will continue to make a strong contribution to international campaign against it,” Mr Goff said.

Note: In the wake of the 9 September bombing in Jakarta, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade is advising New Zealanders to defer non-essential travel to Indonesia. People there should maintain a high level of security awareness and avoid places where westerners are likely to gather.
