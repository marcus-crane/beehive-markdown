Education Minister Trevor Mallard today welcomed primary and area school teachers’ and principals’ acceptance of the settlement of their new collective agreements.

"The new agreement addresses key claims put forward by the NZEI and the PPTA including pay, workload and qualifications issues," Trevor Mallard said.

"Today’s ratification means that the six state sector teachers’ and principals’ collective agreements have now been settled. This sets the scene for a positive start to the 2005 school year."

These agreements include:

- The Secondary Teachers’ Collective Agreement
- The Secondary Principals’ Collective Agreement;
- The Primary Teachers’ Collective Agreement;
- The Primary Principals’ Collective Agreement;
- The Area School Teachers’ Collective Agreement; and
- The Area School Principals’ Collective Agreement.

The three-year term of all the new agreements allows sufficient time to work constructively on issues that will make a difference to student learning and teacher effectiveness.

"For teachers, these will include high quality professional development and recognition of learning and career pathways for professional and educational leadership," Trevor Mallard said.

The positive approach to the bargaining this year by all parties was set within a strategic framework with a strong focus on supporting and promoting teaching effectiveness. It demonstrates that when the parties work in an environment of shared objectives and good faith, very positive outcomes can be produced. This is good news for the students in our schools.

All teachers bound by the collective agreements should receive their new pay before Christmas.

"I want to express my personal thanks to the negotiating teams involved with the bargaining; the Ministry of Education (with the NZ School Trustees Association), the PPTA and the NZEI Te Riu Roa, for their commitment to the process and the outcomes," Trevor Mallard said.
