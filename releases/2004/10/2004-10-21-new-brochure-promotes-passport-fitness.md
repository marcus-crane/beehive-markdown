'Your passport is a valuable document, look after it', that's the message behind a new brochure released today by the Department of Internal Affairs.

‘Making Sure Your Passport is Travel Fit’ is a pocket sized fold out brochure containing information and tips about keeping passports secure and in good condition. It also contains key contact details for the Passport Office in New Zealand and overseas and outlines what to do if they experience passport problems.

Internal Affairs Minister George Hawkins says New Zealanders are a nation of travellers. Our passport gave us visa free arrangements with many countries and was one of the most respected passports in the world.

Many kiwis get caught out on the eve of travelling when they can’t find their passport or realise it has expired or is damaged. The new brochure is designed to facilitate greater ease of travelling by reducing passport problems, Mr Hawkins said.

The brochures are available by contacting Freephone number 0800 22 50 50, e-mailing passports@dia.govt.nz or through offices in New Zealand, Sydney and London. The Department of Internal Affairs is currently also distributing the brochure to travel agents.
