The launch of a new national organisation that aims to strengthen and expand community-based housing marks a new direction for the provision of housing in New Zealand, Housing Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Housing Aotearoa aims to link, support and represent community-based groups throughout New Zealand that provide housing to people on low incomes or with special needs.

“We are no longer simply looking at the future of ‘state’ housing in New Zealand, but increasingly at the future of community-based housing in which the state plays a supportive and enabling role,” Steve Maharey said.

“To back this shift the government is making $64 million available through the Housing Innovation Fund. Over 70 applications for potential partnership arrangements have already been received.

“For many years community-based organisations that provide housing – such as church groups, iwi, and housing associations of various sizes – have been crying out for practical support and advocacy.

“Housing Aotearoa will provide leadership to the sector, networking opportunities to help those involved in providing housing learn from each other, and practical help such as model documents, best practice guidelines and assistance with legal matters.

“The independent organisation is receiving funding for its first three years from the Housing Innovation Fund.

“Housing Aotearoa has developed from consultation among over 500 groups and individuals involved in community-based housing, as well as years of work by Housing New Zealand and a number of committed people within the community housing sector.”
