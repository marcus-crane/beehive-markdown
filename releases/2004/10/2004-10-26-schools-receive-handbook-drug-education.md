All schools with Year Seven to Year Thirteen pupils have today been posted a resource kit to strengthen drug education in schools, including a handbook on drug education developed by the Ministry of Youth Development called [Strengthening Drug Education in School Communities](http://www.myd.govt.nz/pag.cfm?i=430).

"The kit aims to provide schools with the most up-to-date information to help ensure that their drug education programmes are as effective as possible," says Associate Health Minister Jim Anderton.

Current international evidence indicates that the most effective drug education is taught in schools as part of the curriculum and today's materials are directed at principals and health education teachers.

The handbook will also be useful to those schools that choose to supplement their drug education with the assistance of external providers.

The handbook follows last year's global literature review of effective drug education for young people conducted by the ministry, the Progressive leader said.

"The handbook was produced after extensive consultation with schools, drug education providers and interested members of the public.

"That suggests it will be useful to those that are at the coalface and charged with the big responsibility of educating our young against danger," Jim Anderton said.

Jim Anderton reiterated that the harm minimisation approach that underpins the coalition government's [National Drug Strategy](http://www.ndp.govt.nz/policy.html) recognises that different strategies are appropriate for different drugs, individuals and situations.

"That is why the booklet endorses abstinence as a valid strategy, along with strategies to deal with the reality of drug use among some and how to safely help those affected back on to a drug-free track," Jim Anderton said.
