Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor today met with five overseas doctors here to provide locum support in rural communities.

The five were recruited by the [New Zealand Rural General Practice Network's](http://www.rgpn.org.nz/) recruitment arm, NZLocums, which is government funded.

The doctors - from Cambridge, Nottingham, Oxford, Canada and Belgium - were in Wellington this week for induction training before heading to rural areas to practice over the next few months.

They'll put their skills to use in such areas as Waihi, Winton, Kaipara, Fiordland and Gore.

Mr O'Connor said their arrival was great news.

"It's common knowledge that many rural areas are facing serious GP shortages, with the demand for locums often outstripping the local supply. The Network has done a brilliant job scouting and recruiting these five, who are all highly qualified, experienced doctors."

The recruitments are part of NZLocum's short-term service; four of the doctors are here just for a few months, with one, Dr Nick Cartmell, here for a year. NZLocums also facilitates long term and permanent placements.

Rural GP Network CEO Adrienne Harris said the doctors would be providing much-needed relief.

"All five doctors are providing desperately needed short-term cover and they're going to be of huge benefit to the communities. Also, we find that GPs coming out here for short terms really enjoy their time here and a number return. Even better, some remain permanently."

Meanwhile, the Network continued to work on long-term solutions to GP shortages, Ms Harris said.
