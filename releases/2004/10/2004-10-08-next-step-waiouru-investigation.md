Defence Minister Mark Burton is considering options for an appropriate independent process to respond to issues raised by former cadets of the Regular Force Cadet School at Waiouru.

“I have consulted at length with Attorney General Margaret Wilson on this matter, and am now bringing together advice from appropriate agencies such as Crown Law and the State Services Commission.

“These are complex issues, most of which date back 25-45 years. They must be dealt with in a serious, professional, credible manner. It is vital that we take the necessary time to determine an appropriate, robust process to investigate them thoroughly.

“We want to ensure that everyone who has concerns can air them and be listened to. My office continues to liase with former cadet Ian Fraser, as well as building up a database of those who have made contact, as we define the scope of these issues.

“I urge anyone with concerns to contact my office.”
