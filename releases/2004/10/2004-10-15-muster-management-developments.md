Corrections Minister Paul Swain has announced three developments in the management of higher than expected prisoner numbers.

- The Corrections Department had reached agreement with prison officer unions to increase capacity at several prisons through additional double-bunking of inmates. This will add 77 beds to the prison system's capacity immediately, meaning less prisoners will have to be held in police and court cells. Negotiations at other prisons are continuing. "This is a significant breakthrough and will help the Corrections Department to manage the prison muster. This was always our preferred option and I thank PSA and CANZ members for their cooperation," Paul Swain said.
- The Corrections Department is relaunching its recruitment campaign this weekend to address staff shortages.
- The Corrections Department is ensuring no female inmates will be held in police and court cells due to muster issues. A 40-bed modular unit at Mt Eden prison, that had been holding male inmates, will now house female inmates. The male inmates will be moved to other parts of the prison system.

"All our efforts have been focused on increasing the capacity of the prisons to cope with the rising muster. We have added more than 500 beds through using the operational buffer, increased double-bunking and re-opening the 60-bed Larch unit at Rangipo prison. In addition, a 40-bed unit at Wanganui will reopen next month after refurbishment," Paul Swain said.

Justice sector officials had been asked to draw up an initial list of all other potential avenues that could be investigated for the ongoing management of the muster.

"In considering the list, Justice Minister Phil Goff and myself ruled that no work be done on inappropriate options such as early parole and temporary release. We are adamant inmates will serve their sentences, as determined by the courts and Parole Board."

The muster peaked more than a month ago at 6969 inmates and is now hovering around 6900.
