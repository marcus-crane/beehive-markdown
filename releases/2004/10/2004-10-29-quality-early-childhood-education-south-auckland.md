Education Minister Trevor Mallard opened a new Maori bi-lingual early childhood centre Te Hononga Puna Reo in south Auckland today.

Trevor Mallard said he was delighted to approve $475,000 for this purpose built early childhood centre with places for 30 children from the Pukekohe North community to attend.

"I have been concerned for some time that children in certain parts of the Auckland region have been unable to access early childhood education because there are not enough services," Trevor Mallard said.

"This community identified they would support a service that provided education in English and Maori.

"The Labour-led government is committed to ensuring all our students have the opportunity to reach their full potential. Current research tells us that children who attend quality early childhood education are more likely to succeed when they get to school.

"This new service will ensure that more children will get that chance to have new educational experiences outside their home."

The building is the result of the government’s Promoting Participation Project to get more young children involved in early childhood education.

The building is part of the Ministry of Education's Design and Build Scheme, which has been developed to ensure ‘best practice’ design for a quality learning environment.
