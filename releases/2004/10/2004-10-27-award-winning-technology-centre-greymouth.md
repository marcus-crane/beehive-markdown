A new $2.5 million technology centre at Greymouth High School was officially opened today by Education Minister Trevor Mallard.

Trevor Mallard said the new building was a hands-on centre where students can learn useful skills to help them in everyday life.

"Our government is committed to ensuring all students, both in rural and urban schools, have the opportunity to reach their full potential. Providing modern, up-to-date, enjoyable learning environments is an essential element in achieving this," Trevor Mallard said.

"This building illustrates the best in educational design and recently won a New Zealand Institute of Architects award in the education category.

"A focus on the students has been at the forefront of the design with a student café and an 'internal street' where students can socialise informally."

The new centre will provide students with skills in eight different disciplines from food technology through to biotechnology, and will also cater for community education night classes.

Trevor Mallard said the technology centre project had been a catalyst for the school in developing industry partnerships with local companies, such as Westland Dairy Products and Solid Energy.

"The school also has curriculum alignment with the local polytechnic, Tai Potini, and a working relationship with Work and Income New Zealand and the Tertiary Education Commission," Trevor Mallard said.

"It is great to see Greymouth High School offers these links for senior students to ensure that courses are relevant for future employment opportunities on the West Coast."
