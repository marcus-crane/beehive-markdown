New Zealand is keen to make the most of its presence at the Aichi expo next year, Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton said today.

Six projects have been initiated by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise in conjunction with other agencies to ensure that maximum benefit is obtained from the investment in the Aichi expo in March next year.

Elizabeth Gollan, who has previously been a trade commissioner in Tokyo and senior trade commissioner for North Asia, has been appointed to lead this leverage effort by NZT&E. She will work with other agencies, such as the Research Science and Technology Ministry, Tourism NZ, and others to maximize New Zealand’s impact.

Mr Sutton said about $1 million has been allocated for the projects now.

“Aichi is a huge event – more than 15 million people from around the world are expected to attend.

“The overarching theme for the expo is “Nature’s Wisdom" – described as human wisdom which seeks to advance the progress of mankind in harmony with nature. There are to be three sub-themes, essentially exploring ways in which technology – and the wisdom of the past - can be harnessed to allow humanity to live in harmony with the natural world.

“This works extremely well with how New Zealanders view ourselves and the Government sees a lot of potential around the Aichi expo event.”

The six projects are:  
·promoting perceptions of New Zealand as a smart, innovative, high tech nation, as well as clean and green;  
·boosting exporter involvement in Japan;  
·a feasibility study on a biotechnology presence in Kansai;  
·a sister cities proposal;  
·collaborative greenhouse gas research;  
·a pilot project to develop sustainable expertise in manufacturing.
