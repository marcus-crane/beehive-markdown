All but two District Health Boards will see no change in board chair when the new boards take office in December 2004, Health Minister Annette King says.

“I am generally pleased with the way DHBs are performing, and re-appointing almost all the board chairs will provide continuity and stability,” she says.

Ms King says she intends to reappoint seventeen current chairs for another three-year term, and to reappoint Canterbury DHB chair Syd Bradley for one year. She also intends confirming Patrick O’Connor, acting chair of Whanganui DHB since the resignation of former chair Gavin Doyle, as chair for the next three years.

The two new chairs-designate are Alex Grooby, who steps up from deputy chair to become chair of Nelson Marlborough DHB, and Pat Snedden, currently an elected member at Auckland DHB, who succeeds Ross Keenan at Counties Manukau DHB. Mr Keenan will become joint deputy chair of all three Auckland region DHBs – Counties Manukau, Auckland and Waitemata – to promote greater collaboration across the region at board level.

“I want to thank all the current chairs for their vital contributions, with particular thanks to Nigel McFadden, who is retiring as chair at Nelson Marlborough DHB.”

Ms King said the fact that full results of DHB elections were not yet known, and that five of the current DHB chairs stood in the elections, was not a factor in the process of appointing chairs.

“The DHB chair role is complex and demanding, and governance experience in the DHB environment was a key consideration in re-appointing so many chairs. Chairpersons need to be highly competent, and able to manage and draw together a team of people with a wide range of experience and abilities.”

DHB boards consist of seven elected members, and up to four members appointed by the Minister. The Minister appoints the chair from among either elected or appointed members.

Ms King says she is frustrated by delays in counting election results, but the selection process for the remaining DHB appointments will begin once the results are available. Existing boards remain in place until December 5.
