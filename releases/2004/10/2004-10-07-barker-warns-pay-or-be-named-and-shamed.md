Courts Minister Rick Barker today warned fines and reparation defaulters throughout New Zealand may have their names published in daily and local papers unless they deal with their overdue fines.“Letters arriving in mailboxes this week and radio advertising from Monday will inform people who have unpaid fines they have until Friday 22 October to contact the Ministry of Justice to sort them out. If they don't make contact, their names, age and last known address is published in newspapers for everyone to see”, said Mr Barker."This time I have asked to have the names of people who owe reparations to have their names published too because not enough people are taking responsibility and paying people they owe - it’s time to pull heads out of the sand. Large advertisements will be published in daily papers on Saturday 23 October and the week commencing 30 October. Community papers start publishing names in the subsequent weeks.Section 87A of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957 provides the Court with the authority to publish the names of fines defaulters owing $500 or more in overdue fines, who have made no contact re their fines for three or more months and who cannot be located at their last given address."People don't like being humiliated and having their names out there, but those owed money are fed up. Last year's campaign was like a firecracker to many and over $2 million came flooding in. The radio ads will sound a beep instead of a name, but in the papers they'll be no beep but a name in bold for all to see. "Last year’s campaign saw a total of 2013 names published nationally, with new information provided on around a quarter that enabled enforcement. Many others paid up or made arrangements.Enforcement and advertising campaigns such as this one, along with steady ongoing work by Collections district units and contact centres, enabled the best ever fines collection total of $192 million in the 2003/04 year and a 20 per cent increase on the amount under arrangement to pay for reparations owed’, Mr Barker said.Anyone can check to see if they have a fine either by calling a toll free number 0800 4 FINES (0800 4 34637) or using the Fines Check service at www.fines.govt.nz.
