Minister for Regional Development Jim Anderton says he is mystified by a news report in Friday's edition of 'Trans Tasman' that speculates on the future of Whenuapai airbase.

"In the twenty years I have been a Member of Parliament, I don't believe that I have ever been interviewed by Trans Tasman.

"It has been brought to my attention, however, that the latest edition of the newsletter alleges that I have a strong view on the future use of the land upon which the Whenuapai air base currently sits and that the Cabinet is about to make an announcement.

"In reality, I have never expressed any view in support of, or in opposition to, a commercial operation at the Whenuapai air base. Any suggestion to the contrary is totally erroneous," the Progressive leader said.

"For the record, I have received a report prepared by the Ministry of Economic Development on the potential future use of the Whenuapai air base which I am considering with an open mind.

"In due course, I expect to discuss the issues raised in the report with my ministerial colleagues," Jim Anderton said.
