Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey has announced the appointments of Bryan Gould and June McCabe as new members of the Board of Television New Zealand Limited.

They begin three-year terms, replacing Sarah Reeves and Paul Smith who retired as directors this year.

Bryan Gould is currently Vice Chancellor of the University of Waikato. He has had a varied career including an extended period as a Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom and four years as a journalist on a weekly UK current affairs television programme.

"TVNZ will benefit from Bryan Gould's present role running a large organisation with competing commercial and non-commercial goals. He also has specific understanding of public broadcasting," said Steve Maharey.

June McCabe is an executive with WestpacTrust, responsible primarily for the government, university and Maori portfolio businesses. She has worked extensively in the public sector and has held a number of Crown governance roles across a variety of sectors.

"This experience, combined with Ms McCabe's awareness of Maori stakeholder perspectives and financial expertise, will be of significant advantage to the TVNZ Board," said Mr Maharey.

The Minister has also announced the reappointment of the Honourable Dame Ann Hercus DCMG, for a second term. A former Cabinet Minister, Dame Ann is a Christchurch-based international advisor and consultant. The reappointment will ensure the Board continues to benefit from her strong commercial, political and governance skills.
