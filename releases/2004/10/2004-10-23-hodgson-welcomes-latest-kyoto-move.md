The latest steps by the Russian government towards ratification of the Kyoto Protocol were today welcomed by Convenor, Ministerial Group on Climate Change, Pete Hodgson.

"This latest step makes the Protocol's coming into force a near certainty," says Pete Hodgson. "Uncertainty for New Zealand business has now evaporated. They can be sure that energy efficiency investments will now generate a greater return. They can also be sure that the significant business opportunities that the Kyoto Protocol brings will now come to pass. In particular, New Zealand businesses will have opportunities that are unavailable to companies from non-ratifying nations."
