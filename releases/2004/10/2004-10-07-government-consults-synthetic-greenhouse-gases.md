Government is to consult on ways to reduce synthetic greenhouse gas emissions with the launch of a discussion paper today.

The discussion paper covers a wide range of policy options for reducing synthetic greenhouse gases from voluntary controls to regulation.

Synthetic greenhouse gases currently account for less than one percent of New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions, but their use is growing as they are used to replace ozone depleting substances.

"Many of these gasses are used in sealed systems and the focus of is on preventing leaks of them into the atmosphere," says Convenor of the Ministerial Group on Climate Change Hon Pete Hodgson.

Responses to the document are invited to be made to the Ministry for the Environment’s Climate Change Office by 26 November 2004. The responses will be used to develop a more detailed set of policy options for presentation to the Government in early 2005.

Options discussed in the paper reflect feedback to date from New Zealand industry expressing a desire for certainty about future controls.

Q&A on Synthetic Greenhouse Gases

What options are considered in the discussion paper?

·accreditation of those handling synthetic greenhouse gases  
·development of a Code of Practice  
·prohibition on the sale of disposable cylinders of refrigerant  
·ban on emissions of synthetic greenhouse gases during handling  
·levy to pay for destruction of synthetic greenhouse gases  
·‘product stewardship’ scheme to pay for destruction of synthetic greenhouse gases in finished products  
·licences to import synthetic greenhouse gases in bulk  
·licences to import products containing synthetic greenhouse gases  
·manufacture and import prohibitions of products made with or containing synthetic greenhouse gases  
·no controls on synthetic greenhouse gases in plastic foam manufacture at this time  
·possible legislative options to reduce synthetic greenhouse gas emissions.

The options are informed by experience with phasing out ozone-depleting substances.

What are synthetic greenhouse gases?

·Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), used primarily as an insulator for high voltage electrical equipment

·Perfluorocarbons (PFCs), mainly emitted from aluminium smelters, but also found is some refrigerant gases and can be used for specialised industrial processes including as a solvent

·Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), used to replace ozone-depleting substances in many applications in the refrigeration and air-conditioning sector and other related industrial processes such as the manufacture of plastic foams. HFC-134a is the most common HFC.

Why are they called synthetic greenhouse gases?  
Synthetic greenhouse gases (SGGs) are so-called because they have little or no natural sources. In Europe the SGGs are also referred to as F-gases as they all contain fluorine.

Why are SGGs important?  
SGGs are of particular concern because of their extremely high global warming potentials (GWPs) relative to carbon dioxide (CO2). Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) has the highest GWP of any substance known.

Even relatively small absolute increases in their emissions would lead to a relatively large increase in CO2 equivalent greenhouse gas emissions.

What quantity of SGGs are emitted in New Zealand and how has this changed in recent years?  
According to the New Zealand’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory 2004, SGGs contributed 484 Gg CO2-e (Gg CO2 equivalent), or 0.65% of total emissions.

·SF6 emissions have increased 4.7% from 12.33 Gg CO2-e per annum to 12.91 Gg CO2-e per annum due to increased use in electric switchgear

·emissions of PFCs have decreased 83.8% from 515.6 Gg CO2-e to 83.5 Gg CO2-e due to improvements in the aluminium smelting process

·HFC emissions have increased from 0 to 387.59 Gg because of the use of HFCs as a substitute for the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) that are being phased out under the Montreal Protocol.

If the emissions of SGGs are currently very low, why is the Government looking at them?  
Because HFCs are being used to replace ozone depleting substances (ODS), their emissions are expected to continue to increase for at least the next 20 years. This is because the gases are only released when equipment has a fault or is disposed of.

If the Government is to introduce policies to reduce emissions, then it is less disruptive to introduce them now, when the use is relatively small, than later when their use, and therefore their emissions, are much greater.

The Government is also exploring this issue because the New Zealand refrigeration and air-conditioning industry has expressed a desire for certainty about controls on SGGs. After their experience with phasing out ODS, representatives have expressed a desire for light handed regulation now, rather than face more strict controls in the future.

Does the discussion paper propose banning SGGs?  
The discussion paper does not propose banning SGGs. When used as a refrigerant, SGGs can provide very high energy efficiencies for some applications, such as in heat pumps. The benefits in reduced CO2 emissions from energy savings usually outweigh their direct contributions from release.

Are there alternatives to SGGs?  
For many applications there are alternatives to SGGs. However, these usually have other disadvantages, such as being toxic, flammable, less energy efficient or significantly more expensive.

Work is underway in many countries to use so-called ‘natural refrigerants’ such as hydrocarbons, ammonia and CO2.

What are other countries doing to control emissions of SGGs?  
The Australian government has recently completed a lengthy process to decide how to control the use of SGGs. After widespread consultation, the Australian government has decided to incorporate SGG controls into their Ozone Act through an amendment. The new controls on SGGs largely replicate those applying to ODS, such as bans on emissions and requirements for licences to both import and use SGGs.

The European Union has also been considering policies on SGGs and already has many controls on their use. They have also been considering a prohibition on the use of HFCs as the refrigerant in car air-conditioning, although this has not come into effect.

What can the public do now to minimise emissions of SGGs  
Among the largest use of SGGs in New Zealand is vehicle air-conditioning. Virtually all vehicles sold in New Zealand today have air-conditioning fitted. Because vehicles are subject to so much vibration, their air-conditioning systems are inherently leaky.

Contrary to popular opinion, if people want to maintain their car air-conditioning unit, they should use it all year round and for at least ten minutes a week, every week. This circulates the lubricants and refrigerants in the unit, preventing the seals and joints from drying out. If they dry out, they crack, letting the refrigerants escape.

In addition people should:

·have car air-conditioning units checked and serviced regularly by qualified service staff.  
·have the servicing done in the off peak season.  
·have it removed by someone who will collect the refrigerant if they don't want to use their air-conditioning system.  
·make sure that it goes to a dismantler or car wrecker who will have the gas recovered when the air-conditioning system, or car, reaches the end of its life

For all types of refrigeration and air-conditioning, whether containing ozone depleting substances or SGGs, people should make sure:  
·the technician belongs to a reputable industry group, such as the Institute of Refrigeration, Heating and Air Conditioning Engineers (IRHACE - email admin@irhace.org.nz), the Motor Trade Association (MTA - email com.tech@motor-trade.co.nz) or the Vehicle Air Conditioning Specialists of Australasia (VASA - www.vasa.org.au)  
·the technician has the appropriate qualification and uses the Code of Practice for their particular industry  
·the technician has equipment to recover refrigerants
