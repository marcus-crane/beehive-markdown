Runanga School will receive $12,000 for a new study support centre, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today during a visit to the West Coast.

Trevor Mallard has approved funding for the homework centre which will attract about 25 students each session. The centre will focus on literacy and numeracy, homework and IT and library skills.

There are now about 150 study support or homework centres being supported around New Zealand, making use of $7.5 million allocated in the 2000 budget for development of the initiative over four years.

Most of the homework centres, like this one, are within schools. Some are supervised centres within community facilities, while a few are virtual centres making use of 0800 numbers and the internet to link students who need study assistance.

"Study Support Centres are a simple idea and one that I have found particularly satisfying. They provide a quiet place, resources, a registered teacher, information technology and all the basics necessary to develop good study habits among children at risk of education under-achievement," Trevor Mallard said.

"The Labour government is committed to ensuring all our kids have the opportunity to reach their full potential. These centres can help to raise the educational achievements of thousands of students.

"It's really important that children gain good study skills and habits before they reach secondary school. Many children's home circumstances do not support this for a range of reasons.

"The centres are aimed at helping senior primary school students (year 5 to year 8) in some of our lower decile schools. The initiative particularly targets decile 1-3 schools or community groups who will draw in many students from these schools to attend the homework centres.

"Centres of this type used to operate on an ad hoc basis. There have been some wonderful success stories and we are now helping to establish more as well as supporting existing centres, which often run under greater uncertainty.

"These study support centres are an exciting initiative which I hope communities throughout the country get behind and enjoy," Trevor Mallard said.
