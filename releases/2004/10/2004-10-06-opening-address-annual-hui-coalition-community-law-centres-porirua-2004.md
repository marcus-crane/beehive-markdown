It is a pleasure to have an opportunity to participate in this gathering, even if only for a short while, because I come wearing two – no three – Ministerial hats, all of which are relevant to the business of this hui.

First, of course, I come in my guise as Associate Minister of Justice – and in that role I bring greetings from my colleague, Hon Phil Goff, the Minister for Justice.  
Over the years, law centres in New Zealand have become an essential element in the work being done to increase access to justice for all members of the New Zealand community.

I know it has not been an easy road for you, particularly as you struggle for the funding you need to continue your work. Nevertheless, I am heartened to see the increase in the number of law centres and their spread throughout the country. I realise that there were times when the law centre movement must have felt it was taking one step forward and two steps back, particularly in relation to funding.

I cannot, of course, promise that you are now on the Yellow Brick Road to certainty, but my colleague, Tim Barnett, will be bringing you up to date with the initiatives being undertaken by the government, particularly the reforms under the Lawyers and Conveyancers Bill, that will, I hope, be another step forward.

More recently, I have acquired a new hat – that of Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector. Community Law Centres come under that hat, too. The community law centre movement, as I understand it, had its genesis in the community over 40 years ago.

Today, community law centres remain a part of the community, governed by the community, accountable to the community and responsive to the access to justice needs of their individual communities.  
The third hat I wear is as Minister for Courts. Courts are, of course, part of the formal, state sponsored, legal system. Often access to justice is articulated in terms of access to the courts.

Personally, I think that this formulation is narrow; I think justice, in its broadest sense, is about ensuring equitable outcomes for all people living in New Zealand rather than simply ensuring equitable access to the legal institutions. Nevertheless, ensuring there is an efficient, effective court system, accessible to all those who need its services, is of utmost importance me as Minister.

Increasing accessibility to courts lessens and overcomes the economic, psychological, informational and physical barriers faced by women, indigenous populations, new settlers, the young and the other individuals who need the services of the legal system. As Minister, I am working with officials to explore innovative ways of improving the Court system, of ensuring that the Courts provide timely, expeditious services that meet the needs of all their users. On a recent visit to Australia, for example, I came away with some very thought provoking ideas on improving Court processes using modern electronic technology. Technology also permits the dissemination of legal information to a wider audience than has been possible in the past.

Recently I shared with Judge Boshier the pleasure of launching the new Family Court website. Currently my officials are exploring ways in which information about the courts and the legal system can be captured on an interactive website. This will be primarily for use in the primary and secondary education system, but may also, I hope, be of assistance to law centres and others involved in law-related education.As Minister for Courts, I enjoy the opportunity of working with judges who are also conscious of the need to safeguard and extend people's access to justice. Judge Andrew Becroft, Principal Youth Court Judge, is one such judge – and, I understand, one of your own. Judge Becroft, I am sure, brings to his work a deep understanding of the needs of Youth Court users as a result of his long-time involvement with Youth Law.

The Labour government is committed to achieving a fairer, more credible and more effective justice system. This means we are working to create a system in which people, and their needs, are considered and managed with as much care as we take in managing the process, essential to a justice system.  
As one who is newish to the sector, I have sometime got the impression that the process is more important than the people.

Public participation in the law-making process strengthens the rule of law. Parliamentary hearings to solicit public views on legislation are a recognised part of the New Zealand legislative system. Until recently, a significant portion of my time was spent sitting on Select Committees. Select Committees, of course, are not without their frustrations, but I did not begrudge any of the time spent listening to submissions on legislation from individuals and community groups. In fact, I was conscious of how privileged I was to be a Member of Parliament in a country that valued and encouraged its citizens to make their voices heard. Consultation on draft legislation with those affected or involved in its implementation is also recognised as important in a robust legislative process.

One of the government's commitments in The Statement of Government Intentions for an Improved Community - Government Relationship, signed by the Prime Minister, and the then Minister responsible for the Community and Voluntary Sector in 2001 was:  
"Improving the way government engages communities in policy and decision-making so the knowledge, wisdom and practical experience of the community sector contributes fully to policy decisions."

Personally, I am in full accord with that statement. Public participation in decision-making fosters understanding and ownership of proposed laws, ensures that they are suitable for the particular economic, social and legal climate of New Zealand, and, in the long run, facilitates compliance.  
I understand that the focus of this hui is on the role of community law centres in law reform. That is an important focus. Law and justice reform should not been seen as just for policy wonks, pointy-heads and highly qualified lawyers. The process must include the voices of ordinary people.

I see community law centres as providing a voice for communities who may otherwise remain voiceless and unheard.

Enhancing access to justice, particularly for disadvantaged groups and individuals, is a key goal for governments in developed and developing countries alike. Like other governments, this government is well aware that improving, facilitating and expanding individual and collective access to law and justice supports economic and social development. Access to justice is, therefore, not only a matter of human rights but also an economic imperative. It continues to be part of the War on Poverty, just as it was in the 1960s. The challenge continues!  
Partnerships

New legislation, subsidized legal services, alternative dispute resolution, citizen education programmes, court fee waivers and information technology, are all means to improve access. All these methods are currently part of the Labour government's commitment to enhancing access to justice for all people living in New Zealand.

Access to justice empowers people and enables them to enforce or protect the rights that are safeguarded to them under law.  
Access to justice is about equity and inclusiveness. Access to justice is fundamental to citizenship and a democratic society. Any government should work to ensure that state institutions and processes diminish the barriers to justice. But a government cannot work alone. Governments need partners outside the state sector, and the Labour government holds its partnership with the community sector very dear.

Partnership is not, as I know you understand, the exclusive domain of government and community. Partnerships between community organisations themselves is essential, and I note that one of the topics for discussion in the workshops tomorrow is the relationships between community law centres and Citizens' Advice Bureaux.

Each of your organisations has, I think, their own roles in the community. Nevertheless, there must be a huge benefit from two groups developing ways for working together and, through collaboration, increasing the potential for different communities to be able to access vital information and assistance.  
In the area of access to justice, because of their long experience, community law centres are very important parts of the government/community partnership. Being realistic, partnerships are not always easy. Sometimes there is robust, even heated debate, between the partners.  
But that debate is part of the partnership, particularly when it is undertaken in recognition that both partners are working to a common goal; to ensuring that otherwise disadvantaged groups and individuals in the community are able to participate fully in the social, political and legal environment in which they live.

Again, I thank you for the opportunity to open this Hui. I have looked at the programme for the rest of the proceedings and see a number of discussions I would like to participate in – if only I did not have to return to my duties in the House! But I am pleased to hand you over now to my colleague, Tim Barnett, and to wish you well, not only for the remainder of the Hui but also for your on-going work with the communities who benefit from your services.

Tena koto, tena koto, tena koto katoa
