"Infrastructure Ministers have discussed Whenuapai this morning and sought further clarification from officials on a number of issues.

"When this further advice is received a full report will be made to Cabinet.

"This is likely to take place around the end of November, or early December.

"The decision making process will not be hurried as a number of important issues need to be carefully considered.

"It should be noted that there is approximately a 5 year time frame for the exit of the NZ Air Force from Whenuapai so there is no need to rush the judgements which need to be made over this matter," Jim Anderton, Minister of Economic Development said.
