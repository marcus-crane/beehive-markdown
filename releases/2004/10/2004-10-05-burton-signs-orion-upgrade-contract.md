With final negotiations completed and the contract signed, work can begin next year on a major upgrade of New Zealand’s P-3 Orion aircraft fleet.

At the signing ceremony today with US firm L-3/IS Communications Integrated Systems, Defence Minister Mark Burton said that this $352 million project was another significant step in re-equipping all three services of the NZDF.

“Since the 2002 release of the Defence Long-Term Development Plan, 22 major re-equipment projects have been advanced. They include investments in seven new purpose-built naval vessels, a 15-year life extending upgrade of our C-130 Hercules aircraft, the purchase of two 757-200 jet aircraft to replace our ageing 727s, and the recent acquisition of a new fleet of Light Operational Vehicles.

“Our Orion fleet is critical for surveillance of New Zealand’s Exclusive Economic Zone and surrounding waters, as well as meeting our South Pacific obligations. The Orions are also used for search and rescue operations, and were recently deployed to the Arabian Sea area in support of the international campaign against terrorism.”

Mark Burton noted that the upgrades had been developed from a whole-of-government approach, involving extensive consultation with a range of government agencies to ensure that the planes will meet both military and civilian agency requirements.

The mission systems and communication and navigation equipment will both be upgraded together, with the two projects running in parallel to maximise efficiency and cost effectiveness.

The mission systems upgrade involves the installation of new imaging radar electronic sensor equipment (video and infrared camera), and mission management systems. The upgrade of the communications and navigation will ensure the aircraft are able to comply with pending mandatory global air traffic regulations. The upgrades also include ground-based support and training facilities.

“This government has been committed from day one to building a modern, sustainable, well-equipped Defence Force, and this investment in our P-3 fleet is another clear example of that commitment. This upgrade will ensure interoperability with our security partners, allow New Zealand to participate in a range of operations, and provide support to the Defence Force’s other maritime and land force elements,” said Mark Burton.
