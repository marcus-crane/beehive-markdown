Associate Health Minister Jim Anderton has invited all Members of  
Parliament to a concert to promote an optimistic, free-of-drugs  
message by Joe Walsh of 'The Eagles' at Parliament tomorrow.

"I have written to Members of Parliament from all eight political  
parties represented to invite them to the concert. I believe that  
having the concert at Parliament enables us, as politicians, to show  
leadership in the campaign for drug-free, safer communities," the  
Progressive leader said.

"In my letters to my colleagues, I said that by attending the concert  
we can demonstrate that we stand in solidarity alongside our  
communities against the use of methamphetamine and other harmful  
substances," Jim Anderton said.

During his time as a high-profile entertainer with the 'The Eagles,'  
Joe Walsh developed drug and alcohol addictions, but he started the  
path to recovery following the friendship and support he received  
when in New Zealand on tour with The Herbs in the 1990s. He is taking  
time out of his world tour to come to our country at his own expense  
to help encourage other people to build a better future for  
themselves and their families.

"Joe Walsh is an inspiration for many people. His is a story we all  
want to see repeated hundreds of times over by others who find  
themselves with drug and alcohol addictions and looking for a  
positive way forward," Jim Anderton, who chairs the Ministerial  
Committee on Drugs, said.

Joe Walsh's visit is being arranged by Mokai Whanau Ora, one of the  
15 Community Action on Youth & Drugs or CAYADs that Progressive  
secured funding for in the coalition government's budget process.
