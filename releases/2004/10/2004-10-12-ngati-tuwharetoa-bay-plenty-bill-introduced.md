The Ngäti Tüwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) Bill was introduced to Parliament today. The Bill gives effect to the Deed of Settlement, signed in June 2003, to settle all the historical claims of Ngäti Tüwharetoa (Bay of Plenty).  
Ngäti Tüwharetoa (Bay of Plenty), also known as Tuwharetoa ki Kawerau, are from the Kawerau and Matatä area and have about 3000 members. Their core Treaty grievances relate to the Crown’s confiscation of land (87,000 acres) in the Bay of Plenty.  
The settlement package contains a formal Crown apology, cultural redress including the return of five sites of significance, and a total quantum of $10.5 million. Part of the quantum will be used to purchase licensed Crown forest land in the Rotoehu Forest. Accumulated rentals of more than $1 million from this land will also be transferred to Ngati Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty). The Crown Forestry Rental Trust currently holds these accumulated funds.

This is the sixth settlement bill for this government, and the second this year, following the recently introduced Ngäti Awa Claims Settlement Bill.
