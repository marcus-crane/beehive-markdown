“As Minister responsible for recommending these appointments, I am required to ensure that the Environment Court encompasses a mix of knowledge and experience in the range of matters that come before the Court.

"These matters are very wide in their scope and, accordingly, call for a variety of expertise. The appointees announced today have been selected from a large number of highly qualified and experienced candidates, who applied in response to advertisements earlier this year.
