Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced funding of more than $1 million for new buildings at Clutha Valley School and Early Childhood Centre, in Clydevale, South Otago.

"These new classrooms and facilities will provide for the long-term future of this rural school, replacing buildings from over 70 years ago when Clutha Valley was a District High School," Trevor Mallard said.

"Our government is committed to ensuring all students, both in rural and urban schools, have the opportunity to reach their full potential. Providing modern, up-to-date, enjoyable learning environments is an essential element in achieving this.

"I am particularly pleased that the new buildings will also include modern facilities for the Early Childhood Centre.

"The cost of maintaining and refurbishing the old buildings was no longer economical. Spending $1.2 million now to replace them is more cost effective than to carry on patching up buildings that are well past their ‘use-by’ date."
