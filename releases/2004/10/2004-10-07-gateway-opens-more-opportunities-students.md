The government’s Gateway programme to help students move into the workforce or further education is being extended to 55 more secondary schools next year, Associate Education Minister Steve Maharey announced today.

Gateway enables senior secondary school students (Years 11-13) to get involved in work-based learning as part of their school studies and gain credits on the National Qualifications Framework.

The expansion brings the total number of Gateway schools to 180, with Gateway opportunities available to around 6,000 senior school students in 2005.

“Gateway has proven its value in giving young people the opportunity to explore careers and gain new skills, and now a lot more students will be able to benefit,” Steve Maharey said.

“Improving achievement in education and employment is vital to building New Zealand’s productivity, addressing skill shortages and improving economic growth.

“Gateway is an important part of the government’s work on Successful Youth Transitions, and contributes to achieving our 2007 target of having all 15-19 year olds engaged in education, training, employment or other options which will lead to long term economic independence and well-being.

“The government committed additional funding to Gateway in Budget 2004 to increase the number of decile 1-5 schools participating in the programme and to expand Gateway to decile 6 schools. Gateway opportunities will be available to all decile 1-6 schools in 2008.”

The Tertiary Education Commission will be working with schools to ensure they have the necessary structures and employer networks in place to participate in Gateway in 2005 and beyond.
