A schooling strategy aimed at improving educational achievement for all students has moved into its next phase, with the release of a second consultation document by Education Minister Trevor Mallard.

The publication - *Making a Bigger Difference for all Students: Directions for a Schooling Strategy* - is an analysis of feedback on an initial discussion document released earlier this year.

"It tells us that we are on the right track to improving education standards for all students by focusing on effective teaching and on helping families to support their children’s learning," Trevor Mallard said.

"This government believes in quality education and access for everyone, regardless of their background. We want an education system that is focused on lifting achievement so every single student has the chance to reach their full potential and contribute to New Zealand's success, socially and economically.

"The Schooling Strategy, once developed, will focus on how to further improve student achievement, especially for those who are currently not doing so well.

"Existing and emerging evidence tells us that improving the interactions, relationships, and practices in classrooms and improving the ways we support learning in homes will make the biggest difference for all students.

"*Directions for a Schooling Strategy* provides a focused discussion on the key objectives the government is proposing to achieve the overall goal of excellence and equity of outcomes for all students.

"It also gives a clearer picture of the work the government is already doing. The aim of the final strategy will be to tell us where the gaps are and how these might be addressed.

"We are consulting on this document from now until next March because we want people’s views on whether or not we have these objectives and priorities right and what it will mean in practice to deliver them. It's important that all parts of the system work together with a clear sense of purpose and direction," Trevor Mallard said.

The document is on [www.schoolingstrategy.govt.nz](http://www.schoolingstrategy.govt.nz) and will be sent to schools and stakeholders.
