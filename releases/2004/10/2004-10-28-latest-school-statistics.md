More students than ever before are attending early childhood education immediately prior to starting school, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

"Ministry of Education statistics show that the upward trend for early childhood education attendance continues. This year 94 per cent of Year 1 students regularly attended early childhood education before starting school," Trevor Mallard.

"Another positive sign is that retention in the senior secondary school appears to be increasing. In 2004 the retention for 17 year-olds has increased by 3 per cent from 2003 and 4 percent from 2002."

The Ministry’s statistics also show that the number of students participating in Maori medium education has increased, and that three new Maori immersion schools were opened in 2004.

Trevor Mallard said despite the many positive aspects of this year’s school statistics, there was a notable decrease in the number of foreign fee paying students.

"I wrote to school boards and principals in June last year to advise them of these emerging trends and to encourage them to exercise prudence in their planning and budgeting in relation to any activities partly or wholly funded from foreign student fee revenue.

"The ministry is continuing to monitor schools' revenue from this source and will shortly be advising of best practice methods for accounting for this revenue."

There was a 17 per cent decrease in the overall number of foreign fee paying students, and 38 per cent decrease in foreign fee paying students from China. There were, however, still 14,477 foreign fee paying students in New Zealand schools this year.

In 2002 there were 15,250 foreign fee paying students and 5530 of these came from China.
