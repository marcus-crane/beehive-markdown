Senior Citizens Minister Ruth Dyson today welcomed a review of older driver licensing to be led by the Ministry of Transport.

“Maintaining independence is critical to the quality of life for older people,” Ruth Dyson said.

“Research indicates that having access to private transport - and this generally means maintaining a driving licence - is a strong factor in older people maintaining that independence.”

The current policy requires people aged 80 and over to renew their licences every two years.

The review, announced today by Transport Safety Minister Harry Duynhoven, is due to be completed by June 2005, and will make policy recommendations. It will include consultation with Grey Power and the NZ Returned Services Association, as well as medical associations and transport organisations.

“This is an excellent opportunity for the views of older people to be carefully considered in the review of a policy which has a direct effect on their lives,” Ruth Dyson said.

“The review also sits well with the New Zealand Positive Ageing Strategy, which sets out the government’s commitment to positive ageing and reaffirms the value of older people to society.

“The Positive Ageing Strategy has 10 goals, one of which aims to ensure there is ‘affordable and accessible transport options for older people’ in New Zealand. Reviewing the driver re-licensing provisions for older drivers to ensure they are based on ability, not age, fits under this goal.”

Next month Ruth Dyson will release the findings of a study of 71 older people throughout New Zealand who had been without access to private transport for at least six months. The purpose of this research is to find out how older people cope when they no longer have access to private transport of their own.
