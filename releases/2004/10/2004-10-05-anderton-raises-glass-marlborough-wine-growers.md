Marlborough winegrowers celebrated their latest vintage with Jim Anderton, Minister for Regional Development, in the Beehive today. Mr Anderton raised his glass to them for their successes at home and in the international arena.

"These are vintage years for the New Zealand wine industry. It is experiencing strong growth and receiving stunning international accolades. In the year to June, national wine exports went past $300 million for the first time and Marlborough alone achieved a 128 per cent increase over its production last year.

"Marlborough is at the forefront of this success with its world renowned sauvignon blanc in particular, but other varietals also: riesling, pinot noir, chardonnay, gewürztraminer, pinot gris and some fine sparkling wines are being produced.

"I am pleased to be part of the Labour Progressive government that proactively supports this economic growth. I particularly look forward to the results of the work you do with the Marlborough Wine Centre of Excellence, which is supported by our Major Regional Initiative funding.

"The government doesn't make wine, but it can help to grow the industry with research and appropriate support. We can also provide advice and assistance to help to commercialise your wine and compete in global markets.

"I raise my glass to congratulate you and celebrate our continued productive partnership," Jim Anderton said.
