Prime Minister Helen Clark says a Memorandum of Arrangement between New Zealand and Niue marks a new chapter in the partnership between the two countries.

Helen Clark is attending the 30th anniversary celebrations of Niuean self-government during a visit to Niue. She and Niue Premier Young Vivian today signed the Memorandum of Arrangement which reaffirms the special relationship between Niue and New Zealand, and puts in place a strengthened cooperation programme with the aim of providing a secure future for Niue.

Helen Clark said the Arrangement is a landmark for Niue.

“It signals New Zealand's commitment to a partnership to build economic sustainability, a living community, and a vibrant culture on Niue.

“It reaffirms the constitutional relationship between New Zealand and Niue, including New Zealand citizenship and New Zealand's obligation to provide necessary economic and administrative assistance to Niue.

“The arrangement provides for a series of initiatives, estimated as costing around $20 million over five years, to provide for a sustainable, secure future for Niue. The initiatives include:  
§An initial five year programme of budgetary support for Niue.  
§Strengthened links between our respective government agencies and personnel, in sectors including taxation, legal and legislative support, education, and law enforcement and border control.  
§The development of practical initiatives to support enterprise growth and social development with priority given to tourism, fisheries, agriculture and land use issues.  
§New Zealand’s support for retaining and strengthening Niue’s language and culture through enhanced support, including the first Taoga Niue Fono.  
§New Zealand support for infrastructure and capital asset management.  
§A programme of environmental recovery projects aimed at completing the clean-up after Cyclone Heta and sustaining Niue's unique ecological and environmental status.

“New Zealand and Niuean government ministers will meet, annually, on Niue, to review progress on the commitments set out in this Arrangement, and the effectiveness of our work together in support of Niue's economic and social development.

“Niue’s population is currently no more than 1500 while the Niuean community in New Zealand numbers around 20,000. Assisting the Niue government’s efforts to maintain Niue’s distinct culture and language is not only important for Niue but also for the large New Zealand Niuean community,” Helen Clark said.
