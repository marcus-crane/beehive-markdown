Key changes to the government's employment relations framework completed their final stages in Parliament this week.

Labour Minister Paul Swain said the [Holidays Amendment Act](http://www.workinfo.govt.nz/article.aspx?ArticleID=194) comes into force today while the Employment Relations Amendment Bill (No. 2) is scheduled to come into force on 1 December.

"Economic growth has averaged around 3.5% since 2000, and was 4.4% to the year end June 2004, while unemployment is at a 20-year low of 4%. These figures are the envy of our trading partners and the changes to the Holidays and Employment Relations Acts will only build on our success.

"I [said that I would address the unintended consequences of the Holidays Act 2003](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/PrintDocument.cfm?DocumentID=20952) by Labour Weekend and am pleased to deliver on that promise. The Holidays Amendment Act clears up concerns that were raised with me around payment for work on public holidays and the rules relating to medical certificates," Paul Swain said.

Employers and employees wanting information about holiday entitlements and obligations can call the Labour Department's Infoline on 0800 20 90 20 or visit [www.workinfo.govt.nz](http://www.workinfo.govt.nz)

The Employment Relations Amendment Bill (No. 2) builds on the success of the [Employment Relations Act 2000](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=962001&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7B41BC4DFF%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC) by strengthening the Act's key [objectives](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=962112&hitsperheading=on&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&jump=a2000-024%2Fs.3&softpage=DOC#JUMPDEST_a2000-024/s.3) to promote good faith, collective bargaining and the effective resolution of employment relationship problems. I would like to acknowledge the contribution of my colleague the Hon Margaret Wilson in this process," Paul Swain said.

"We have re-established a [decent employment relations' framework](http://www.ers.govt.nz/relationships/index.html), which was [completely eroded by the previous National government](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F8045). We will now build on this framework by focusing on workplace productivity and making sure New Zealanders have the skills and training needed for the country's continued growth."
