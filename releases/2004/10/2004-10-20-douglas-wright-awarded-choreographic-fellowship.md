Internationally acclaimed New Zealand choreographer Douglas Wright has been awarded the Creative New Zealand Choreographic Fellowship to research and develop new work.

Acting Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard said the award recognised Douglas Wright's "enormous talent and commitment to creating outstanding contemporary dance."

Judith Tizard said Douglas Wright had been one of the leading lights of New Zealand dance for more than 25 years.

"Douglas has established himself as one of the most innovative, bold and talented choreographers New Zealand has known.

"It is wonderful that he has been chosen for this fellowship at this point in his career. As well as recognising his astonishing portfolio of work to date, it will allow him to focus his considerable talents on creating a major new work of dance," Judith Tizard said.

The [Creative New Zealand](http://www.creativenz.govt.nz) Choreographic Fellowship was established in 2003. The inaugural 2003 recipient was Auckland choreographer Shona McCullagh. Worth $65,000, it is the largest choreographic award available in New Zealand.

**Douglas Wright : biographical information**

Douglas Wright grew up in South Auckland and began his dance career with Limbs Dance Company in 1980. In 1983, he joined the Paul Taylor Dance Company of New York where he remained until 1987.

In 1988, he returned to New Zealand and created his first full-length work for Limbs, called Now is the Hour, and a year later formed the New Zealand-based Douglas Wright Dance Company. Since then, he has created many works of dance theatre, including How on Earth (1989), Gloria (1990), As It Is (1991), Forever (1993) and Buried Venus (1996). When Forever had its European premiere in Switzerland, it was hailed as “an overwhelming contemporary contribution to the history of our life and times”.

In 2002, he choreographed Inland, which premiered at the New Zealand International Festival of the Arts and then toured New Zealand. Evening Post reviewer Jennifer Shennan wrote of the work: “Douglas Wright’s choreographic imagination, fed with superphosphate from down on the farm, has yielded a profound work of dark humour and breathtakingly brilliant dancing ... It’s a work of genius. What else do you want to know?”

The Douglas Wright Dance Company has toured throughout New Zealand, and to Australia and Europe. His work has been performed by other dance companies, including The Australia Dance Theatre, Sydney Dance Company and the Royal New Zealand Ballet.

Wright has also made several dance films in collaboration with Chris Graves and Grant Lahood.
