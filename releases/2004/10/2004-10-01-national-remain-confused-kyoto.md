National remain confused on Kyoto and have once again failed to tell the truth about this government's responsible approach to tackling climate change, says Pete Hodgson.

Contrary to Nick Smith's statement, this government:

·Will protect the international competitiveness of businesses that might otherwise be at risk, by exempting them from any carbon charge through Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements, and not charge farmers for agricultural emissions of methane and nitrous oxide. National advocates charging all emitters and makes no mention of protecting farmers or any other business.

·Recycle all money raised through a carbon charge back into the economy, meaning there will be no net fiscal benefit to the Crown.

·Will not place limits on the emissions of individuals, but set targets for their overall reduction; ensuring New Zealand plays its part in the global effort to reduce the impact of climate change.

This government is already working to effect a reduction in emissions against business as usual through the promotion of renewable energy, energy efficiency and through its transport policies. New Zealand is on target to be a net seller of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of emissions units between 2008 and 2012; a massive boost for the economy.

"New Zealand will stand by the other 124 nations that have ratified the Protocol to date and will not risk international censure and the damage that would cause to international trade by talk of pulling out of Kyoto, says Convenor, Ministerial Group on Climate Change, Pete Hodgson. As the number of signatories shows, the world economy is changing. This government will not see New Zealand left behind by following the 'do nothing' approach favoured by National."
