A comprehensive security arrangement between New Zealand and United States Customs authorities has been announced today by the Prime Minister Helen Clark and the Customs Minister Rick Barker.

This will see security issues reconciled prior to loading, so New Zealand exporters can be confident they are on the front foot when it comes to clearance at overseas borders.

"The New Zealand Customs Service and the US Customs and Border Protection Agency have agreed on a series of measures that will see high-risk containers identified and intercepted as early in the supply chain as possible," said Helen Clark.

"From 1 December the two agencies will work closely together using joint intelligence information to screen all trader and shipper declarations. Consignments identified for more detailed scrutiny will be inspected, using non-invasive technology or physical examination, prior to loading for export from New Zealand."

The US is New Zealand's second-largest individual export market, taking almost 15% of exports.

"This arrangement is possible because of co-operation between the government and industry, including air and sea ports, in enhancing the security of New Zealand's supply chain. The government's commitment includes spending an extra $22 million this year on new non-invasive technology," said Helen Clark.

Rick Barker says the implementation of the Supply Chain Security arrangement means greater confidence over the low risk nature of New Zealand goods, providing greater facilitation and certainty for our shipments.

"When I met the US Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Robert Bonner last year, he told me of his trust and confidence in the New Zealand Customs Service. Commissioner Bonner has described New Zealand's initiatives in this area as some of the world’s best practice.

"New X-ray technology to scrutinise exports to meet trading partner expectations is part of a comprehensive push to put New Zealand ahead of our competitors, and to be sure we are doing everything we can to move our goods expeditiously across borders.

"At the same time, we are improving our assurance over the security of goods arriving in New Zealand and being trans-shipped through our ports and airports. This helps ensure New Zealand is kept secure.

"The Customs Service is also in discussion with other trading partners, and is working through the World Customs Organisation to develop international standards," said Mr Barker.
