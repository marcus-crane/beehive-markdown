·Senior Sergeant's Office  
·General duties, CIB, Youth Aid, and Community Constable work areas

·Meal Room or Community meeting space  
·Locker and storage areas.

Mr Hawkins said this week he will also open a new station in Morrinsville, with Oamaru's a new station due to be opened in mid-December.

”Eleven other new stations are currently being built or in the planning stages and a further eight are in the pipeline," Mr Hawkins said.
