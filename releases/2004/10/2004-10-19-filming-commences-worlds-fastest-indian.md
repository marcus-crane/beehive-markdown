Filming is underway for what promises to be another exciting NZ film, says Acting Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard.

Written and directed by New Zealander Roger Donaldson, The World's Fastest Indian will star Academy Award-winner, Anthony Hopkins as New Zealand motorcycle legend Burt Munro.

The film is being financed by the New Zealand Film Production Fund, the New Zealand Film Commission and Tokyo-based OLC/ Rights Entertainment.

Filming has begun at the site of Munro’s record-breaking motorcycle feat in Utah, and will soon move to New Zealand to complete an 11-week shoot. Burt Munro came from Invercargill and in the 1960s set world speed records on an Indian motorbike.

Judith Tizard says the commencement of filming is yet another boost for an already buoyant New Zealand film industry.

"Film has become an increasingly important industry for New Zealand. As well as delivering important economic benefits, it provides a great forum for sharing our stories and heritage with the world."

Judith Tizard says Whale Rider and In My Father's Den are recent examples of films that have won international acclaim and which demonstrate the strength of New Zealand storytelling.

"The success of these films shows that we're finally getting over our cultural cringe and recognising we have something important and compelling to say to the world."

Judith Tizard said The World's Fastest Indian was an inspirational story of an iconic New Zealander, which promised to be compelling viewing.

The film is Roger Donaldson’s first in New Zealand since embarking on a successful 20-year career in Hollywood.

**Roger Donaldson**  
Donaldson established his filmmaking career in New Zealand with SLEEPING DOGS (1977) followed by SMASH PALACE, a critically acclaimed drama where he first collaborated with Hannam who served as executive producer. THE BOUNTY was Donaldson’s U.S. film debut followed by such films as NO WAY OUT, a suspense thriller starring Kevin Costner; WHITE SANDS starring Willem Dafoe and Samuel L. Jackson; CADILLAC MAN starring Robin Williams and Tim Robbins; sci-fi thriller SPECIES starring Ben Kingsley, Forest Whittaker and Natasha Henstridge; DANTE’S PEAK starring Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton; the critically acclaimed THIRTEEN DAYS starring Kevin Costner as Kenny O’Donnell, Special Assistant to President John F. Kennedy during the two-week Cuban missile crisis, and most recently THE RECRUIT, a political thriller starring Colin Farrell which shot to number one at the U.S. box office upon its release in 2003.

**Gary Hannam**  
A key figure on the New Zealand film scene, producer Gary Hannam first made his mark with SMASH PALACE where he served as executive producer with Donaldson directing. Hannam also collaborated with New Zealand director Vincent Ward as co-producer on two of Ward’s films which both screened In Competition at the Cannes Film Festival: the critically acclaimed, haunting coming-of-age drama VIGIL and the award-winning fantasy NAVIGATOR: A MEDIAEVAL ODYSSEY. In 1981 Hannam started the Film Investment Corporation group (FIC) which produced or executive produced a number of New Zealand films in the 1980’s including STRATA, LOST TRIBE, KINGPIN and WILD HORSES. To mark 21 years of business for FIC, Hannam founded the Film Investment Corporation Foundation in 2002 to assist young New Zealanders to obtain international experience. Having moved to Europe he most recently co-founded Swiss-based EuroAsset Partners GmbH with Australian entertainment financier Justin Pearce, and in 2001/2002 they jointly established with Commerzbank AG a €300 million film fund.
