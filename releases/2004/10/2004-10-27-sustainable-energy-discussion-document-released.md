A comprehensive discussion document is released today on the future of sustainable energy in New Zealand.

Released by Energy Minister, Pete Hodgson, the document is designed as the focal point for six months of consultation. The outcome of this process will be the starting point for formal sustainable energy policy development.

"New Zealand, like the rest of the world, faces a significant challenge in how to meet its future energy needs," says Energy Minister, Pete Hodgson. "Climate change and the forthcoming peak in global oil production mean today's ways of producing and consuming energy will not be sustainable in the future. Our challenge is to find a way to continue to meet our needs for energy in a way that enables us to protect our way of life, economy and the environment over the coming decades."

The document explores what a sustainable energy system might look like, and how we might achieve it.

"Energy must be developed with regard to economic, social and environmental impacts. That is why a sustainable approach that encompasses all of these is needed. This document is an excellent starting point from which to develop a truly sustainable energy future for New Zealand," said coordinating Minister for Sustainable Development, Marian Hobbs.

In addition to discussions with stakeholders, interested parties can email their comments on the document to: [sustainableenergy@med.govt.nz](mailto:sustainableenergy@med.govt.nz)
