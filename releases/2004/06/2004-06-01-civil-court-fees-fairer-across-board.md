The government has largely adopted the recommendations of an independent working party report on civil court fees says Courts Minister Rick Barker.

The report says operating costs should be shared more fairly between taxpayers and direct users. This recognises the private gain that comes from being able to use the civil courts as a framework for dealing with disputes.

Changes to court fees applying to the High Court and District Court will come into effect on 1 July 2004. Fees were last changed following stage one of the review process in October 2001 when it was determined that the contribution of litigants should be no more than 50 per cent. The aim of the Review has been to ensure that fees are charged according to a principled and consistent framework. The Environment Court is to have fees applied on a basis consistent with other civil Courts.

New fees in Family Courts, the Environment Court, the Land Valuation Tribunal and the Taxation Review Authority will come into effect once the waiver provisions have been extended.

Rick Barker says because the Family Court increasingly deals with property cases that are for private benefit, there will be new fees directly comparable to the District Court. However the Family Court remains free of other charges except for dissolution of marriage.

"The government is ensuring access to justice for people who cannot afford to pay by widening waiver provisions. Also those receiving legal aid can apply to have their court fees waived.

"The fee for a counter claim in the High Court will be set at the same level as fees to commence proceedings. This is reflective of the actual cost to the court. However concession rate fees in the High Court will also apply to a wider range of proceedings, he said.

The initial filing fee in the High Court covers the cost of all substantial steps in court proceedings prior to hearing, including case conferences, which can result in claims being settled or withdrawn.

" A positive result of court mediation services means about 85 per cent of cases brought to the High Court are settled without proceeding to hearing," said Rick Barker.

The new fees reflect recommendations of an independent working party on civil court fees, comprising representatives of the community, legal profession, business and consumers.

The new fees, questions and answers about the new fees, and the working party’s report can be found at the Ministry of Justice’s website: www.justice.govt.nz. – news.
