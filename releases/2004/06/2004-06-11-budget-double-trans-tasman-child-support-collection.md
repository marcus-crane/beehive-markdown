The number of cases to be exchanged under New Zealand's reciprocal agreement with Australia is set to double in the coming year due to increased budget funding.

"This is an excellent step towards the government's goal of seamless child support collection with Australia." said Associate Revenue Minister David Cunliffe.

"We want to send the message that parents cannot avoid their responsibilities by moving to Australia." said Mr Cunliffe.

Increased money for trans-Tasman enforcement was part of a $17 million over three year budget package to enhance the administration of child support.

The increased funding will work in tandem with proposed changes to the Child Support Act that will increase incentives for liable parents to pay their child support debts. The proposed package include the ability for some penalties to be written off for those who make arrangements to pay their core debt.

"The increased funding and the changes I am working on are all about getting parents to honour their responsibilities to their children," said Mr Cunliffe.
