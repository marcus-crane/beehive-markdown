The [Civil Union Bill](http://www.knowledge-basket.co.nz/gpprint/docs/bills/20041491.txt) is appropriate to the times, recognising the reality of relationships instead of attempting to deny their existence, says Associate Justice Minister David Benson-Pope.

The bill he introduced in Parliament this week for civil union was supported on a conscience vote by 66-50.

It provides for different sex couples who want formal recognition of their relationship but do not wish to marry and for same sex couples who cannot currently receive legal recognition of a loving and committed relationship.

The Civil Union Bill will not amend the [Marriage Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=1867848576&hitsperheading=on&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7BA2F20516%7D&softpage=DOC) and the religious, social and traditional values associated with marriage will remain, says David Benson-Pope.

The bill has been referred to the Justice and Electoral select committee.
