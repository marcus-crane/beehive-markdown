Pupils at 109 primary schools across central Auckland will get an important boost to their education, thanks to new government funding that sees laptops rolled out to primary teachers nationwide.

Extra government funding of $12 million announced today sees some 7000 primary school teachers nationally benefit from further extensions to the Laptops for Teachers scheme.

Any permanent, full-time primary teacher of Year 4 to 6 students is now eligible for a laptop as a result of this funding. This extends to teachers at the 109 schools in Auckland Central, Mt Roskill, Mt Albert, Epsom, Maungakiekie, Pakuranga, and Tamaki electorates.

Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard says she has no doubt that Auckland teachers will take up their entitlement, with the government providing two thirds of the cost and the balance met by either the teacher or the school.

"This helps teachers to become more familiar with information technology. They are then better able to guide and encourage our kids," says Ms Tizard.

"To get a head start in a job or play a role in the community these days, students need to grow up knowing about Information and Communication Technology. It also helps them learn other subjects."

In a recent report, 'ICT in Schools', two thirds of school principals report that ICT makes a major difference to quality teaching and learning for students.

Judith Tizard says the Labour-led government wants to see all teachers using information technology as a professional tool. More than 17,000 principals and intermediate and secondary teachers have already received laptops through the scheme.

"Teachers who’ve got laptops are finding they have much better skills in using this technology when they teach. Laptops also ease their teaching workloads," says Judith Tizard.

Teachers can register for the laptops through their school on the Ministry of Education website: [www.minedu.govt.nz/goto/tela](www.minedu.govt.nz/goto/tela).
