The Attorney-General is not involved in deciding matters of a criminal nature, said Attorney-General, Margaret Wilson. This is because it is important there should not be any element of political interference with the justice system.

In the instance of Tanjas Darke, Crown Law, after considering all the facts, decided this was a matter that should be determined in a transparent way in an open court. Ms Coddington was advised last week of the fact that the Attorney-General had no role in this decision, and that her powers in cases like this are formally delegated to the Solicitor-General to avoid any political interference, or appearance of political interference, in the criminal justice system.
