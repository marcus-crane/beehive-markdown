Transport Minister Pete Hodgson today welcomed transport funding agency, Transfund's, announcement of its $18.7 billion, ten year forecast for integrated transport. This includes $2.8 billion in regional spending.

"This is the biggest state transport spending programme ever and underlines this government's commitment to transport infrastructure and sustained economic growth," said Mr Hodgson.

Administered by Transfund through the [National Land Transport Programme](http://www.transfund.govt.nz/nat.html) (NLTP), $1.42 billion of government money will be spent on integrated transport over the next year. This allocation represents an increase of 20 per cent over the previous year, and is over 50 per cent more than actual NLTP spending by the last National government in the year 1999/00.

"Not only is it the largest sum ever invested in New Zealand's transport infrastructure, it includes the largest ever spending on public transport, cycling and walking facilities, state highways, local roads and maintenance. Looking forward there will record amounts of regional money available from April next year. More than ever before will also be spent managing demand for roads and to get more people using alternatives to their cars.

"This government started to address years of neglect of the transport sector with the [New Zealand Transport Strategy](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/nzts/home.cfm) (NZTS) in December 2002 and through the [Land Transport Management Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=2471821121&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7BEFD2341F%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC) last year. Earlier this month, changes were [announced](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F20021) to the government transport sector to focus it towards delivering on the vision of the NZTS to give New Zealand the affordable, integrated, safe, responsive and sustainable transport system it deserves by 2010. Having got the policy and the structure right, we've backed this with cash. Today Transfund releases its blueprint for turning this into actual infrastructure."

Both [Transfund](http://www.transfund.govt.nz/intro.html) and [Transit](http://www.transit.govt.nz/) are laying out their plans and forecasts for the next ten years today. Both are working with the transport sector to phase projects to ensure that the sector's capacity is fully utilised. Having ten year plans also gives the contracting sector the certainty it needs to make investment, recruitment and training decisions so that it is able to deliver on the programme.

"The challenge now is for regional and local government to work with Transit, contractors and Transfund to ensure that they are fully capable of taking up all of the allocation."
