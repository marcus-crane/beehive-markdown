Following a 28-day consultation period, Education Minister Trevor Mallard confirmed today the decision to close four Okato schools and establish a new Year 1-13 composite school in the region.

The schools to close are Okato College, Okato Primary School, Newall School and Warea School, with a new composite school to be established on the Okato College site from the beginning of 2005.

“The Ministry of Education has consulted affected boards on my behalf and I have carefully considered the information that has been presented to me.

"I am pleased that the schools have largely accepted my decision – it has not been taken lightly. I have decided to close the schools, and establish a new composite school, because I want to achieve a sustainable network of high quality schooling for the next 10 to 15 years in the Okato area,” Trevor Mallard said.

The closures will be gazetted shortly to take effect on 28 January 2005.

"The process of developing the establishment board for the new composite school is underway and I hope to announce the members of this board in the near future.

"I want to thank the current and previous boards and staff for the service they have given to their schools and students. I wish the community well in the development of the new school,” Trevor Mallard said.

The Ministry of Education will work closely with schools to make sure their requirements for a smooth changeover are met.

A project manager will be in touch with schools as soon as possible to discuss the implementation of the reorganisation. A resource for schools outlining the process and the next steps is available on the network review section of [www.minedu.govt.nz]()
