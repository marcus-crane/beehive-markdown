New Zealand's first India-born police woman, plus three male constables of Indian-descent, were among 78 police graduating today from Wing 217 at the Porirua Police College.

Police Minister George Hawkins said Police needed to reflect New Zealand's increasingly multi-cultural community.

"Police welcome applications from members of all ethnic groups wanting to train as police, and it is pleasing to increasing numbers coming forward," Mr Hawkins said.

All four of the Indian descent constables were bound for Counties Manukau police district and would significantly boost police links with the area, he said.

Wing 217 also saw the graduation of John Moody, who represented New Zealand several times at the World Judo Championships and at the 1986 Commonwealth Games.

From the Wing, Kaitaia and Auckland Central would receive one graduate each, Howick five, Avondale four, Manurewa six, Newmarket two, Otahuhu 14, Takapuna four, Pukekohe five, Rotorua three, Tokoroa one, Tauranga three, Taupo four, Masterton five, Nelson, Greymouth, Queenstown, Invercargill, Timaru and Dunedin one each, and Christchurch 14.

Wing 217 included 25 women and 53 men aged between 21 and 43 years.
