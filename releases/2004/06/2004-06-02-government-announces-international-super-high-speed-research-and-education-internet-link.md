Research, Science and Technology Minister Pete Hodgson today announced the next phase in the development of a super high speed internet link between universities and research organisations in New Zealand and overseas.

The link, which will be known as the Advanced Network for Research and Education, will mean users can share information at speeds around 20,000 times faster than dial-up and 400 times faster than domestically available high speed internet. This will enable much greater collaboration between researchers and the multiplication of computing power through the linking of computers across New Zealand and around the globe.

The new link will help New Zealand participate at the cutting edge of research, development and education in areas such as biotechnology, eLearning, health and creative media such as film.

"This network will strengthen New Zealand's research and educational capabilities," said Mr Hodgson. "It will help keep the sector at the forefront of what is truly a global field. Such a link should also have valuable commercial spin offs."

Next Generation Internet New Zealand (NGI-NZ) Chair, Neil James of Otago University said: "This initiative will turbo-charge the communication infrastructure of New Zealand's research and education community, putting it on an equal footing with other world leaders in this technology."

An Implementation Manager is expected to be appointed shortly to oversee the link's establishment under a crown-owned and funded entity. This will involve both telecommunications network and hardware providers in a competitive tendering process to establish and develop the link and ensure it stays at the forefront of technology.

New Zealand Universities, Polytechnics, Wananga and Crown Research Institutes will be the first to benefit from the link.
