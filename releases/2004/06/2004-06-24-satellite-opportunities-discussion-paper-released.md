"It is time to look at whether New Zealand needs access to more satellite infrastructure." said Associate Minister of Communications David Cunliffe, who today released a public discussion paper on satellite communications.

“Satellites have become very much a part of our daily lives. They bring us news and entertainment from across the globe, they carry our public broadcasting services, they provide accurate navigation markers for ships and aircraft, and they guide search-and-rescue operations by sea and land." said David Cunliffe.

"Most important of all, perhaps, they help us to pick up a phone or press a key to be in instant touch with the rest of the world.”

“There is potential for commercial entities to work with the Government to further develop satellite infrastructure.” David Cunliffe said, “This discussion paper will assist development of policies for working with these entities and help gauge the level of demand for new satellite capacity for New Zealand.”
