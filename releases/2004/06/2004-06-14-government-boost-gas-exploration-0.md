Exploration for new gas reserves will be encouraged through a suite of proposed measures announced today.

Energy Minister Pete Hodgson said with the depletion of Maui gas reserves, new fields were critical to meet future energy needs.

The proposals include:  
·reducing the ad valorem royalty \[AVR] rate from 5 per cent to 1 per cent for gas (oil will remain at 5 per cent) for discoveries made within the period;  
·allowing a deduction in relation to the accounting profit royalty \[APR] on production from discoveries, within the period, of exploration and prospecting costs incurred in New Zealand and allowing such costs to be carried forward with interest;  
·reducing the accounting profit royalty (APR) from 20 per cent to 15 per cent on the first $750 million \[cumulative] gross sales of petroleum offshore and the first $250 million \[cumulative] onshore on discoveries within the period.

Associate Energy Minister Harry Duynhoven will lead consultations with industry on these proposals prior to their introduction through the Minerals Programme for Petroleum to have effect from next year. Any changes arising from the consultation will apply to production from fields discovered within the 30 June 2004 and 31 December 2009.

Revenue Minister Michael Cullen said the government was keen to ensure the tax treatment of oil and gas exploration did not create unnecessary barriers and would review the tax rules applying to non-resident drilling rig operators; aspects of the capital treatment of development expenditure; and the application of certain GST rules to the oil and gas industry.

In addition, the package proposes $15 million over three years for seismic mapping and increased resources to Crown Minerals to promote New Zealand overseas as a petroleum prospecting destination.
