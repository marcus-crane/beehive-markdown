Legislation setting up a single business-like organisation to address Auckland’s traffic congestion was passed in Parliament today with a solid majority.

"The Local Government (Auckland) Amendment Bill establishes a package of measures to untangle and simplify the confused and inefficient lines of responsibility that have inhibited Auckland's transport development for so long," Local Government Minister Chris Carter said today.

"The majority which this Bill achieved in Parliament demonstrates the strength of the government's solution to Auckland's transport problems. A total of 83 MPs voted for the Bill in its final reading over 36 that voted against," Mr Carter said.

The legislation establishes the Auckland Regional Transport Authority (ARTA) as a single, business-like entity responsible for planning, funding and developing the Auckland regional transport system, including setting land transport priorities in the region.

"In addition to reforming the governance of Auckland's transport, the government is to spend an extra $1.62 billion on Auckland transport over the next 10 years," Mr Carter said.

"I am confident the initiatives in the new legislation and the additional funding will make real inroads into the frustrating issues Aucklanders face in getting around their city."
