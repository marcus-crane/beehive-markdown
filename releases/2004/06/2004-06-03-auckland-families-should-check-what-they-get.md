Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard is urging people to check what they will get from the budget’s moves to give big increases in support to working families.

Judith Tizard says what was announced last week would do more for people raising a family than anything she has seen in her adult lifetime.

“I’m very proud to be part of a government that will deliver up to $150 a week in extra support for people on low-moderate incomes with families.”

“Beyond the Working for Families package, we’re doing a lot more to assist families with extra childhood funding, more access to early childhood education and more help with housing costs.”

Judith Tizard says wider central Auckland includes many low and modest income families who stand to do well from the budget.

“But even with an extensive advertising campaign underway, there will be children who remain in poverty simply because their parents or caregivers won’t actually realise what is available to assist them as a result of this budget.”

Judith Tizard is urging everyone on a low-modest income who has children to phone the 0800 number that has been set up to calculate what each family is entitled to receive.

“If people phone the line – 0800 774 004 – they will be told exactly what the budget will do for them and their family and how to apply.”

While the whole package of assistance for low-moderate income families will take three years to become fully implemented, Judith Tizard says some measures come in from October.

“People should check their entitlements now and start planning what they can do for their families from the improvements in their income.”
