Education Minister Trevor Mallard today opened Mangere Central Primary School’s new library and information centre - a modern environment for young children to get excited about books and learning.

"I congratulate the school on its wonderful new facility. Not only does the library provide exciting experiences and adventures through books but it also provides the technology to explore and access information from around the world," Trevor Mallard said.

"As a government we are very committed to raising education standards for all our young children, regardless of their background.

"This modern new library and information centre will play an important role in getting kids enthused about books and reading, and enthused about learning."

The new library was built with funds from the government’s 5-year property programme for schools, with community grants for furnishing and resourcing.

The 5-year property programme, begun in July 2000, has been progressively rolled out to all New Zealand state non-integrated schools and provides them with the necessary capital to undertake property upgrades on all their existing property.

"I also want to applaud Mangere Central’s focus in its strategic plan on learning and raising achievement in both literacy and numeracy - another key priority area for our government.

"I understand that teachers are currently involved in professional development in these areas and that in general the school is working hard to equip its students with excellent knowledge and skills so they are well prepared for secondary school," Trevor Mallard said.
