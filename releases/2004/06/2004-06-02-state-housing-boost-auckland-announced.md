New funding provided in Budget 2004 will enable Housing New Zealand Corporation (HNZC) to further increase the number of homes it is acquiring in the Auckland region, Housing Minister Steve Maharey announced today.

The Budget provided $128.9 million (including $126 million in capital funding) for acquisition of a further 500 new homes in the Auckland region. When combined with funding committed to date for 2004/05 to 2006/07 it will enable HNZC to add 2,406 homes in Auckland through its build, buy or lease programmes through to 2007.

Steve Maharey said the 500 extra homes will help reduce the priority waiting list in Auckland which is running ahead of other regions across New Zealand.

“The Auckland region is facing a significant housing shortage due to its rapid population growth and the availability of land. The HNZC currently has 5,057 applicants (April 30) on its priority waiting list – including 3,150 applicants in Auckland.

“The extra housing we will now be able to provide enables HNZC to better meet this demand. It also clearly demonstrates the different approach of the Labour-led government to its National predecessor who had plans to sell 19,000 houses this year.

“Housing is being acquired across the Auckland region so we can house people as near as possible to where they work, to where their children go to school and close to family and friends.

“Auckland will remain the priority area for new home acquisition because it is where the need is greatest. Nearly 80 per cent (2,406 homes) of the 3,000 homes we plan to acquire over the next three years will be in Auckland, with the remainder being spread through other priority communities.

“The government’s commitment to acquiring quality housing has moved many families above the poverty line where they had been languishing under the previous government. We intend to continue boosting and refurbishing our housing stock to see many more families benefit,” Steve Maharey said.
