A new marine reserve is to be created in Paterson Inlet on Stewart Island and will protect a crucial habitat for one of the oldest known shellfish on earth.

Conservation Minister Chris Carter announced today that Ulva Island Marine Reserve, the first along Stewart Island's coast, had received the necessary ministerial approvals.

The reserve will be centred on Ulva Island and will stretch 1075 ha along 12 km of coastline in the heart of Paterson Inlet, much of which is bordered by national park land. The remaining 9,000 hectares of the inlet is to form part of a new mataitai also announced today by Fisheries Minister David Benson-Pope. The mataitai will ensure sustainable fishing around the reserve.

"This is a very exciting development in marine conservation because Paterson Inlet's crystal clear waters are a treasure chest of marine life," Mr Carter said.

"More than 270 seaweed species have been found there. Five species of marine mammals visit the inlet, including rare leopard seals and southern right whales, as do 57 species of fish, and 50 species of bird.

"Most importantly, Paterson Inlet is one of only a few sites in the world where four species of primitive shellfish, called brachiopods or lamp shells, live on the seabed at depths which visitors to the area can dive to," Mr Carter said.

"Lamp shells are quite literally, living fossils. They date back 600 million years and have hardly changed in that time. That such a substantial population of these shellfish remains in our waters is just one example of the remarkable marine bounty New Zealand is fortunate enough to have.

"It is estimated 80 per cent of all our native species actually live in our seas," Mr Carter said.

"Unfortunately, our efforts in marine conservation have lagged well behind our efforts to permanently protect land-based species. If we added together all the marine reserves we have around mainland New Zealand, they cover an area smaller than the smallest of our 14 national parks, even though our marine area is 15 times larger than our land area.

"New Zealand has a lot of work to do in marine conservation, and the Paterson Inlet initiative is an important step forward. I congratulate the local Stewart Island community for their role in achieving it," Mr Carter said.
