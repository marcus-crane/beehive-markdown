Confident, demanding consumers are a critical part of a thriving, innovative and sustainable economy.

Budget 2004 provided more funding so consumers can continue to transact with confidence in the New Zealand economy.

“Consumers’ access to reliable information is vital in ensuring that they are able to make good choices and decisions about the goods and services they purchase,” says Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard.

“In 2000 the [Powerswitch website](http://www.consumer.org.nz/powerswitch/Default.asp?bhcp=1) was established to provide consumers with independent, comparative information on electricity prices and suppliers.”

Budget 2004 provides $1.1 million over the next four years for the continuation of Powerswitch.

“This will ensure that consumers can continue to access this important information,” says Judith Tizard.

Government has approved funding the development of a pilot internet based data capture project. This will help the Ministry of Consumer Affairs better understand consumer behaviour and the way consumers and markets interact.

Over the next four years $660,000 has been provided to undertake this pilot project.

“This project will see the Ministry of Consumer Affairs and the Citizens Advice Bureau working together to improve the Ministry’s access to key information. This will strengthen the Ministry’s understanding and knowledge of consumer issues,” says Judith Tizard.

The information will be used to enhance the policy advice, research and monitoring capability of the Ministry. The information will also build capability within the CAB to deal with consumer inquiries and give them access to a nationwide database of statistical information.
