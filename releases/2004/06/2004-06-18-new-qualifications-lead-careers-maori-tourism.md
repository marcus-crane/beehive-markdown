Associate Minister for Tourism, Hon Dover Samuels will launch three new qualifications for those wishing to pursue a career specialising in Maori Tourism in Auckland today.

“These new qualifications are going to give momentum to what is an exciting and burgeoning industry for Maori,” Mr Samuels says.

The two National Certificates in Tourism Maori, one at level 3 and one at level 4 have been registered on the National Qualifications Framework and recognise the unique skill set required to pursue a business career in Maori Tourism. The National Diploma in Tourism (level 5) is undergoing the quality assurance process within the Authority.

“We expect these qualifications to become widely offered by both mainstream and Maori providers,” Mr Samuels said.

The Manukau Institute of Technology (MIT) will be the first provider in Aotearoa to deliver the level three certificates with a semester two-commencement date.

Executive Director of Academic Development at MIT, Grace Sylvester says the new qualification is an exciting step towards increasing participation by Maori in the New Zealand economy.

“MIT is enthusiastic about being able to offer a qualification that is tailored to meet a growing demand for Maori tourism products and professional services,” she says.

The three qualifications are part of the Field Maori group of qualifications on the Framework and were developed by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority in consultation with a panel of experts in the business of Maori tourism.

Field Maori has grown from a base of tikanga, reo Maori, whakairo and raranga, to include a diverse range of unit standards and qualifications. It now covers almost 500 unit standards, nine National Certificates and five National Diplomas in a diverse range of areas specific to Maori.

“Maori studying at this level are getting qualifications directly related to helping them get jobs, set up their own businesses and be involved in all facets of the economy, particularly in those industries that have a strong Maori presence,” Mr Samuels says.

“This is another example of this Government’s commitment to the development of Maori. A commitment that is clearly not on any agenda held by Don Brash and his National Party colleagues,” Mr Samuels said.

Through our investment in education we are seeing better statistics. Participation by Maori in tertiary education increased from slightly more than 10% in 1999 to over 16% last year.

This government will continue, where it sees opportunity, to assist Maori in achieving their educational and economic aspirations.

“This is an investment, not just in Maori, but in the future of New Zealand as a diverse and culturally unique society,” he said.
