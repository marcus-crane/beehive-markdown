The Ministry for the Environment has granted $250,000 to community groups throughout New Zealand to improve public involvement in resource management processes, Environment Minister Marian Hobbs announced today.

Projects include regional community workshops on the Resource Management Act (RMA), funding for community advisers and educators, and the development of guides on landscape management and coastal development under the RMA.

"The Ministry's Education and Advisory Services Fund is designed to assist community services and projects to better educate and involve people in resource management processes," Marian Hobbs said.

"Ensuring people understand the processes help reduce delays, frustration and misunderstandings."

Ten projects have been allocated funding this year. Sixteen applicants applied for a total of $611,364, meaning the fund was 2.4 times over-subscribed.

"It is great to see so many community groups interested in furthering public understanding of resource management processes," Marian Hobbs said.

The groups approved for funding to carry out local projects are Community Law Canterbury, Community Legal Advice Wanganui, Nelson Environment Centre, Ngatiwai Trust Board in Whangarei, Tairawhiti Community Law Centre in Gisborne and Tauranga Environment Centre.

Groups funded to carry out national projects with a community focus are Environmental Defence Society and Royal Forest & Bird Protection Society of NZ.
