Associate Justice Minister David Benson-Pope has welcomed the first reading of the new Relationships (Statutory References) Bill in Parliament yesterday as it is this legislation that provides effect to the Civil Union Bill.

Mr Benson-Pope says the two pieces of legislation are inextricably linked with the Civil Union Bill providing people who choose not to marry or who cannot marry the opportunity to have their relationship recognised by the state as a civil union.

"Like the institution of marriage, civil unions only gain legal effect from the rest of the law," said Mr Benson-Pope.

He says it is the Relationships Bill that ensures people are not discriminated against in over 1000 different areas of the law because of the nature of their relationship.

"I think it is a crazy situation that in this day and age we are actually coming up against opposition to legislation that removes such a significant area of discrimination," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"I think New Zealanders' innate sense of fairness lead them to the conclusion that both the Civil Union and the Relationships Bill are about a fairer society for everyone.

"I was delighted to see that such a large number voted in favour of the Relationships Bill yesterday. Indeed, that support crossed party lines, religious backgrounds, age and gender.

"Maybe we are seeing the lightbulb going on in the heads of some MPs who can see that removing discrimination is actually something worth supporting."
