Defence Minister Mark Burton today announced Cabinet approval for the purchase of 133 [Pinzgauer Light Operational Vehicles](http://www.army.mil.nz/?CHANNEL=LOV&PAGE=LOV), 60 of which will be armoured. These vehicles are the second tranche of a fleet to replace the Army’s ageing Landrovers, and will significantly upgrade and enhance Army’s mobility and support capability.

The announcement follows on from government’s purchase in March of 188 Pinzgauer vehicles, the first of which are due for arrival in New Zealand in August. Total cost of the 321 vehicles is $93 million (excl GST), well under the original $110 million [Defence Long-Term Development Plan](http://www.defence.govt.nz/public_docs/longtrmdevplan/contents.shtml) (LTDP) cap for the project.

Mark Burton said that government had taken another significant step towards achieving the goal of a modernised, well equipped, and sustainable Defence Force across all three services—something that was neglected throughout the 1990s.

“When this government took office in late 1999, we inherited a force suffering from nine years of neglect and an ad-hoc approach to funding and acquisitions. I’m pleased to say that we have brought an end to that era with the LTDP—a planning tool that enables the government to make acquisition decisions in the context of defence policy, priority of projects, and affordability over the next decade.

“Purchasing these new vehicles reinforces once again the positive progress we are making in re-equipping all three services of the NZDF. Along with new field communications systems, Light Armoured Vehicles, weaponry, and technology upgrades, this government has already invested close to $1 billion in the Army alone.

“We have also completed the upgrade of the runway at Ohakea Air Base, replaced the Air Force’s aging 727s with 757-200 jet aircraft, and invited proposals for the replacement of Air Force utility and training helicopters. We have announced a C130 Hercules 15-year Structural Life Extension Project, C-130 and P-3 Communication And Navigation Systems Upgrade, and the P-3 Mission Systems Upgrade—all of which are currently in the tender evaluation phase. Together, these projects represent another $1 billion investment.

“Final contract negotiations are underway for Project Protector, the $500 million project which will see the Navy replace the aging frigate Canterbury with a new multi-role vessel, off-shore and in-shore patrol vessels.

“We have achieved all this since the LTDP’s release in 2002, as well as four budget-funded pay rises in as many years.

“This Labour-led government has done more for our Defence Force in the past two years than National did in nine. It’s high time our world-class personnel got the equipment to match their world-class skills, and I am proud to be part of a government that does more than pay lip service to investing in their future,” said Mark Burton.
