Amid job growth, Northland’s number of unemployment beneficiaries fell by almost 11 per cent in the year to September 2003.

The figures contained in the Department of Labour’s latest six-monthly regional report, have been welcomed as a win-win for taxpayers and beneficiaries by Te Tai Tokerau MP Dover Samuels.

“Every person coming off a benefit reduces the cost to taxpayers and at the same time they start paying tax. That means a double hit of money becomes available for our schools, hospitals and other needs,” said Dover Samuels.

The number of unemployment beneficiaries in Northland fell 10.8 per cent to 5,900 in September. Job growth in Northland is 3rd highest in the country.

Job growth in Northland was 5.1 per cent in the year to September 2003. Northland's trade and hospitality sectors drove much of this growth, along with the primary sector. The construction industry has also started to post job gains.

“Beyond the financial gains, much more flows from having lower unemployment, says Dover Samuels, " people who come off a benefit enjoy a real lift in their spirits. A better sense of fairness and security ripples across every family and community.

"The government wants more people in jobs rather than moving to parts of the country where there is little chance of work.

“As part of this we are committed to having every 16-19-year old in work, training or education by 2007. As at September there were 3,850, mostly young people in industry training in Northland said Dover Samuels.

The department of Labour report says economic and job growth in Northland will be moderate this year, but unemployment is expected to remain relatively low. Regional economies are strong and consumer confidence remains high.
