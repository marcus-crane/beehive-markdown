A noted historian, Dr Robyn Anderson, has been appointed to the Waitangi Tribunal for a three-year term.

Dr Anderson is the former Director of History and Pacific Cultures at Te Papa Tongarewa Museum.

Announcing the appointment today, Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said Dr Anderson brought to the Tribunal a wealth of knowledge and experience in historical research and writing.

Dr Anderson's most recent publication is Nga Taonga: Treasures of Te Papa (co-author)” published in March this year by Te Papa.

Over the last 10 years she has written a number reports for both the Tribunal and the Crown Forestry Rental Trust. They include an historical overview of the Wellington region and studies of the Wellington district (Port Nicholson, Hutt Valley, Porirua, Rangitikei and Manawatu) and “Gold Legislation, Mâori and the Crown” for the Tribunal’s Rangahaua Whanui Series.
