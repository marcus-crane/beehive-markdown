The importance of corporate sponsorship to the ongoing viability of cultural sector organisations is highlighted in a recently released report from the Ministry for Culture and Heritage. The survey of corporate sponsors and cultural organisations, undertaken in November 2003, showed that almost one third of cultural organisations derive more than one fifth of their budgets from sponsorship.

‘The support of corporate sponsors is vital to the ongoing viability of many of our arts and cultural organisations,’ said Judith Tizard, Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage.

‘Corporate sponsors are increasingly aware that their involvement in cultural activities presents them with exciting opportunities’ said Judith Tizard. ‘Cultural organisations offer them opportunities to reach their target markets in new ways, as well as an association with innovation and excellence.’

‘Corporate sponsors, on the other hand, bring expertise and financial investment to cultural organisations,’ she said.

Despite the hard headed business decisions that lie behind sponsorship, sponsors also see their support as an opportunity to show they value and appreciate the energy that cultural activities and events contribute to our communities.

However, to successfully leverage the benefits for both parties, it is essential that corporate sponsors and cultural organisations establish a good working relationship.

‘The sponsorship environment is very competitive and, I am heartened that the report indicates that the level of sponsorship support for culture is likely to remain constant for the foreseeable future. I believe that cultural sponsorship is value for money, and would encourage businesses to actively seek out such opportunities in their communities.’
