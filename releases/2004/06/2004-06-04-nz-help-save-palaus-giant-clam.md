New Zealand is putting $30,000 towards ensuring the survival of one of Palau's national treasures, the giant clam, says Foreign Minister Phil Goff.

The huge shellfish, which weigh up to 230 kilograms and are the world's biggest bivalve molluscs, are threatened mainly by poachers. Often those who catch the clams take only the adductor muscle, which is considered an aphrodisiac in Asia, and leave the rest of the shellfish to rot.

"New Zealand's financial support will pay for young clam stock and the fencing of nursery areas in which they can be grown," said Mr Goff, who is currently in Palau with a New Zealand delegation.

"We are confident this project will increase the survival rate of baby clams and bring this iconic species back from its present endangered state.

"It will also help cover the cost of distributing the young shellfish to clam farms throughout Palau. Ultimately, the expansion of the clam industry will mean more income for the people of Palau, and provide another source of economic development," Mr Goff said.

The funding is being provided by the government's international development agency, NZAID, and will be administered by the New Zealand High Commission in Tarawa through its Small Projects Fund.
