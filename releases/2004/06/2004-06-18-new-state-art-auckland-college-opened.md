Prime Minister Helen Clark today officially opened the new state-of-the-art Alfriston College, in Manukau City, one of several new innovative state secondary schools being built to accommodate projected roll growth in Auckland.

“Our government is committed to high education standards across the board for young New Zealanders. Providing modern, up-to-date, enjoyable learning environments for students is an essential element in achieving this," Helen Clark said.

The government has invested more than $28 million in the school to date, in site works and buildings, furniture and equipment, Information Communication Technology, learning and teaching resources and professional development for the board and staff.

“Features include flexible teaching/learning spaces, a special needs facility for up to 15 students with high needs, energy efficiency measures, and easy access to computers for all students," Helen Clark said.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard said Alfriston College opened its doors on 27 January 2004 with year 9 (Form 3) students only. Other year levels for the college will be introduced progressively with year 10 students coming on board in 2005.

Botany Downs Secondary College; Manukau City; Oteha Valley Primary School, North Shore City; and Sancta Maria College, a new Catholic integrated school in Manukau City, also opened at the beginning of the year to help meet Auckland’s school roll growth.

A further twenty new state schools may be required over the next 10 years to meet the population growth projected in the Auckland Regional Growth Strategy. The type and location of the new schools will be determined by the rate of school-age population growth and where it occurs.

“Nationally the government is investing an extra $347 million in school and early childhood education property this coming financial year, bringing the total amount of funding for property to $1 billion,” Trevor Mallard said.

"This investment is vital for the creation of high quality and modern learning environments for our students.

“It is essential that our schools, which are important community assets, meet health and safety standards. It is also critical that schools are attractive and encouraging places in which to learn,” Trevor Mallard said.
