The Australian and New Zealand governments have taken another step towards achieving the long term goal of a single economic market in the two countries, this time with a focus on competition and consumer protection law.

Australian Treasurer Peter Costello and New Zealand Commerce Minster Margaret Wilson today announced details of a Productivity Commission research study examining the potential for greater cooperation, coordination and integration of the general competition and consumer protection regimes in Australia and New Zealand.

The research study will look at the core restrictive trade practices and consumer protection provisions of Australia's Trade Practices Act 1974, New Zealand's Commerce Act 1986 and Fair Trading Act 1986, and the associated institutions on both sides of the Tasman. It does not include industry-specific regimes such as telecommunications or electricity.

"This is a forward looking research study to inform both governments on possible future arrangements to better align our respective legislation and practices to remove barriers to trans-Tasman business. All options are on the table, including having common laws and a single trans-Tasman enforcement agency," Peter Costello and Margaret Wilson said in a joint statement today.

The Productivity Commission has been asked to consult widely with interested parties on both sides of the Tasman and to report to both Governments within six months.

Peter Costello and Margaret Wilson said the outcomes of the study will not bind either government to a policy approach.

"Any subsequent changes to policy following the study will require a separate process in each country, which would include a further round of consultation with interested parties in each country." A copy of the terms of reference is attached.

For more information about the study or lodging submissions, see the Productivity Commission's website at [www.pc.gov.au](http://www.pc.gov.au) or directly on (00612) 6240 3239.

PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION ACT 1998

The Productivity Commission is requested to undertake a study examining the potential for greater cooperation, coordination and integration of the general competition and consumer protection regimes in Australia and New Zealand, and to furnish a report to the Treasurer within six months of receiving this reference. The context of this study is the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic

Relations Trade Agreement (ANZCERTA) and associated agreements, in particular the Memorandum of Understanding on Business Law Co-ordination. These have fostered an increasingly integrated business community and, through the progressive removal of barriers to economic activity, have set the scene for a single economic market. The two governments regard deeper co-ordination of the regulatory environments for business as an essential element of a single economic market.

For the purpose of this study, competition and consumer protection law for Australia is defined to include the core restrictive trade practices and consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 - restrictive trade practices (Part IV), unconscionable conduct (Part IVA), consumer protection (Part V) (with the exception of Division 1AA (country of origin representations)), product liability (Part VA), authorisations and notifications (Part VII), resale price maintenance (Part VIII) and any associated provisions. The Commission should recognise and take into account the mirror consumer protection provisions applying to financial services in the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 and the Corporations Act 2001.

For New Zealand, competition and consumer protection law is defined to include the core restrictive trade practices, business acquisitions, and consumer protection provisions of the New Zealand Commerce Act 1986 , and the New Zealand Fair Trading Act 1986. The Commission should recognise and take into account the mirror consumer protection provisions applying in New Zealand to consumer rights and redress in the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 and the differing treatment of product liability.

The study should:

> Assess how the operation, administration and enforcement of Australian and New Zealand competition and consumer protection law affects, impedes or fosters an integrated trans-Tasman business environment.
> 
> Identify options for achieving greater cooperation, coordination and integration of Australian and New Zealand competition and consumer protection policy and law, its administration and enforcement, for the purpose of fostering and enhancing a trans-Tasman business environment. Options identified should be practically achievable and should encompass, but not be limited to:
> 
> > further harmonization of competition and consumer protection laws;
> > 
> > greater coordination of authorisation, administrative and enforcement processes;
> > 
> > joint decision making on trans-Tasman issues by competition authorities; and
> > 
> > combined or coordinated institutional frameworks.

> Examine each option to identify whether the expected benefits (including any public benefit) will outweigh the costs (including any public cost) for Australia and for New Zealand.

The study should consider the potential implications of each option in regard to existing cooperation, coordination and integration of competition and consumer protection policy and law between the Commonwealth, the States and Territories.

The study should take account of best practice and draw on international experience in achieving greater cooperation, coordination and integration in the area of competition and consumer protection policy and law. The Commission should take account of any recent substantive studies undertaken elsewhere. The Commission should take into account any other current trans-Tasman initiatives toward further co-ordination of the regulatory environment.

The Commission should have regard to current international agreements, or other international obligations, of Australia and/or New Zealand relating to competition and consumer protection policy and law, and the established economic, social and regional development objectives of the Australian and New Zealand Governments.

The study should not seek to duplicate the 2003 Review of the Competition Provisions of the Trade Practices Act (the Dawson Review). The study should take into account such policy and legislative changes in Australia as the Government's response to the Dawson Review and the forthcoming Government response to the Senate Economic References Committee Report on 'The effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act 1974 in protecting small business'. The study should not seek to duplicate the work undertaken in the 2001 review of the New Zealand Commerce Act.

The Commission should consult widely with Australian and New Zealand business (including small business), interest groups and affected parties and receive submissions.

The Commission shall present the Treasurer and the New Zealand Minister of Commerce with a final report within six months of the date of commissioning. The final report will be published.
