*Opinion Article by David Benson-Pope*

When Stephen drowned, swept out to sea one day while gathering shellfish from a rugged New Zealand beach, his partner Nigel's life was suddenly thrown into chaos.

As devastating as that news was though, nothing had prepared Nigel for the crushing blows that were still to come.

Desperate to grieve, Nigel travelled to the hospital mortuary to see the body of his companion and friend, to try and understand what had happened and find a way forward.

The reception staff at the hospital were cordial and helpful, as were the coroner’s police. All were informed of Nigel's relationship with Stephen. However, no one he spoke to would allow him to see Stephen – Nigel was not a family member.

“I had no legal right to see my dead partner, have his body moved to a more suitable place, or initiate funeral proceedings," Nigel explains.

Being locked out of such a fundamental moment was the result of language written into the Coroners Act 1988, which did not recognise their relationship.

People in stable and long-term de facto relationships would generally be surprised to learn of the limits on their ability to make decisions for each other. The Coroners Act 1988 is just one of a thousand-odd provisions across more than 100 separate statutes that discriminate on the grounds of relationship.

The Relationships (Statutory References) Bill, which I have introduced to Parliament, seeks to remedy this, ensuring neutral laws on relationships so people are treated the same by the law in areas as diverse as commerce, education, health, taxation and social assistance.

Introduced in tandem was the Civil Union Bill, which enables people in committed, exclusive, stable relationships to register that relationship as a civil union.

The Government motivation is not to undermine marriage. Far from it, marriage will be protected and continue to be solely available to a man and a woman. The Civil Union Bill does not alter the Marriage Act 1955.

But we believe it is important to provide legal recognition to other forms of relationships – the vast majority of whom are different sex de facto couples, not gay couples, as groups critical of these Bills would have you believe.

These new laws remove discrimination that potentially exposed the government to risks of complaint to the Human Rights Commission (HRC), cases before the Human Rights Review Tribunal and litigation. It also means that Parliament, rather than the judiciary, determines relationship law for New Zealand.

However, the risk of litigation aside, I do not believe New Zealanders would consider it fair to deny legal rights to people simply because they have chosen not to marry, or in the case of same-sex couples are unable to marry.

Some people have asked why de facto partners don't simply make contracts and write wills to protect their relationships? The reality is however, that not all statutory provisions can be overridden by a contract. Like the desperate situation Nigel found himself in, a contract would have had no effect on his right to plan the funeral of his partner. Private arrangements are also open to dispute, which creates uncertainty for the parties and also work for the courts as these disputes are litigated.

The Civil Union Bill also removes significant discrimination. It follows similar initiatives in overseas jurisdictions, though I believe it is more moderate and conservative in approach than law changes in many other countries, especially Europe.

Again detractors have tried to create a number of myths around Civil Unions.

The largest group of people affected by these changes are the some 335,000 New Zealanders who have chosen, for whatever reason, to live in a relationship outside of marriage. According to the Census just 0.6 per cent (just over 10,000) of these people are same sex couples. Civil union will be a new legal entity, providing greater choice to these people.

Likewise, there is no truth that the Civil Union Bill will lead to the state recognising multiple partners. The Bill makes it clear that someone may be in a marriage or a civil union, but not both at the same time. It provides that two people cannot enter a civil union if either is already married or in a civil union with another person and amends the bigamy provisions of the Crimes Act to enforce this.

The Government is committed to promoting respect for the human rights of all individuals in New Zealand society. We wish to support the choices of the one in five New Zealanders currently living in a relationship who have chosen not to marry, and who may now choose to commit to each other in a civil union.

We are also committed to removing the type of discrimination that Nigel faced when he was denied the chance to grieve for his partner in a way I think we would all agree was right, proper and necessary:

“I feel quite bitter that beyond the small circle of my own friends and family my relationship with Stephen was recognised in neither life nor death," says Nigel. "Although many officials wanted to let me see Stephen, they could not legally do so."
