Realising New Zealand's economic, social and cultural goals is the focus of the Government's draft Digital Strategy, released today by Associate Information Technology Minister David Cunliffe.

"We live in a time of rapid and unparalleled technological change. This strategy is about enabling all New Zealanders to realise the benefits this change offers." said David Cunliffe.

"The strategy proposes bold new directions for the Government's ICT investments. This Government sees ICT as an important tool for empowering New Zealanders to participate fully in society. We also want to make sure it is being used to make government more accessible and that communities and businesses are using it to help them grow" said David Cunliffe.

Key areas of emphasis in the strategy include:

- Improving access to New Zealand content, such as national heritage collections and government information
- Developing the digital confidence and capability of all New Zealanders and ensuring the ICT environment is trusted, secure and reliable
- Supporting grassroots developments to build the ICT capability of communities
- Increasing the potential of ICT to create value for businesses in all sectors; and
- Using ICT to improve the delivery of government services to citizens, particularly in health and education.

Public feedback is sought. A number of fora for the industry, community and cultural sectors will be held over the next two months.

The draft Digital Strategy is available for download at the top of this page.
