People of Hamilton are going to see their historical courthouse brought back to life says Courts Minister Rick Barker.

Planning will start next year to strengthen and refurbish the 1931 courthouse and link it to the new courthouse, to provide an extra two courtrooms and other facilities for the Hamilton.

" She'll be grand and beautiful again to retain the status she deserves in the community. Hamiltonians have had a courthouse on this site since the 1860's, it's great that the thread of history is being preserved here.

“The old courthouse built in 1931 has been vacant for over ten years, and there has been a lot of local interest in its future. I’m pleased to announce that it will return to its former glory as a working courthouse.

“We are at the very early stages of the refurbishment project. Planning and consultation will start in 2005 and we hope to see work underway in 2006 and completed in 2007, " said Rick Barker.

When the courthouse was opened in February 1931, at a cost of 29,000 pounds, its arched windows and a Corinthian potico gave it the status of 'the most modern and equipped courthouse in New Zealand'. It suffered major fire damage in 1974 with the main Magistrates court being wrecked and the adjoining Supreme court badly damaged. The building was refurbished following the fire.
