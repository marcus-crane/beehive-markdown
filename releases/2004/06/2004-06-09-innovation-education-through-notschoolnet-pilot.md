An innovative on-line learning pilot programme to assist teenage students back into education was launched today by Education Minister Trevor Mallard.

"Notschool.net is an exciting approach to learning with a track record of improving outcomes for significantly disadvantaged students," Trevor Mallard said.

"From July, 100 students in Auckland and Wellington who are not engaging or achieving well in mainstream education will be involved in a $2.5 million two-year Notschool.net pilot programme.

"Notschool.net, a secure on-line learning programme available to 13 to 16 year-olds in their own homes 24 hours a day and seven days a week, has been running successfully in the United Kingdom for four years.

"Students involved are provided with a range of Information Communication Technology (ICT) equipment and a fast internet connection in their homes to assist their learning.

"They are encouraged and guided by mentors and subject experts; this mentoring and accompanying assessment and learning resources is available to them at any time of the day or night. They can also talk on-line to other students involved in the programme in a secure environment."

Trevor Mallard said Notschool.net was developed by Ultralab, a leading learning and research centre based in the UK, and since its beginning the UK programme has successfully involved more than 900 students.

The rate of dropout is low with latest figures showing 99 per cent of Notschool.net UK students achieving formal accreditation at nationally recognised levels by the time they reached the statutory leaving age.

"Through this New Zealand pilot we want to extend new learning opportunities for our most at-risk students and take stock of what works best for them via associated research," Trevor Mallard said.

"Ultimately we want to extend the range of alternative education options currently available, and further develop knowledge around the use of ICT in delivering effective distance learning."

The programme will be delivered by Christchurch-based Ultralab South.
