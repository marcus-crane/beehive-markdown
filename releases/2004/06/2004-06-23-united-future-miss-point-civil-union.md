Associate Justice Minister David Benson-Pope says the new civil union legislation offers more choice to people in committed relationships.

Responding to the criticisms of the United Future party, Mr Benson-Pope says it was sad that some people seemed unable to accept the life choices of hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders.

Mr Benson-Pope says Census figures showed some 330,000 New Zealanders had chosen to live in a relationship other than marriage. There were also roughly 10,000 people in same-sex relationships who cannot marry.

"The intention is that civil union will be a new legal entity, designed for the needs of couples in the 21st century," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"The Civil Union Bill provides a mechanism for couples who cannot marry, or do not wish to marry, to publicly declare commitment to each other, and have this commitment legally and socially recognised

"It is simply an issue of choice. The Government is not forcing anybody to do anything, but people will be able to put their own value on their relationship and decide how they want to present that to the world.

"The greatest critics of this legislation appear to be people who have exercised their choice to get married. I wonder why they feel so threatened by other people making the choice to formalise their relationships?"
