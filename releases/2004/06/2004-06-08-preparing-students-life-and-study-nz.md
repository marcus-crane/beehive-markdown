A Chinese language version of the *Guide to Living and Studying in New Zealand for International Students*, aimed at better preparing Chinese students for living and study in New Zealand, was released by Education Minister Trevor Mallard today.

"For many international students, studying and living in New Zealand is likely to be their first time living away from home. They face the additional challenge of living and studying in a language and culture which is foreign to them," Trevor Mallard said.

Research relating to international students in New Zealand, carried out for the Ministry of Education in 2003, highlighted the need to ensure a quality experience for international students, not only educationally but also in terms of day-to-day living.

"Since that research was done, the government has put in place a range of measures to improve the experiences of our international students. The code of practice for pastoral care of students has been strengthened, the Education Review Office will quality check homestays, and professional development programmes and resources for teachers, support staff and accommodation providers have been produced," Trevor Mallard said.

"[This new guide](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/index.cfm?layout=document&documentid=9468&indexid=6671&indexparentid=6663) will also play an important role in helping students settle in to life in New Zealand. It advises students of some of the challenges they may face as international students, and outlines avenues for accessing support to assist in dealing with them."

The guide was produced in consultation with a wide range of agencies, non-government organisations, providers and current and former Chinese international students.

It is organised in five main sections: Before You Leave (preparing to come to NZ), Arriving in New Zealand (eg customs, changing money), Living in New Zealand (eg accommodation, safety, managing money, health), Studying in New Zealand (Code of Practice, course withdrawals etc.), and an Appendix including a map of New Zealand, information on public holidays, kiwi slang, Mäori vocabulary.

It provides comprehensive information on living in New Zealand including accessing important services, with phone numbers and links to web sites for further information on particular topics.

Chinese students who have made the decision to study in New Zealand will receive the guide before they leave China. It will be distributed with approved student visas by New Zealand Immigration Service (NZIS) offices in China.

Both the English and Chinese versions of the publication are available online at [www.minedu.govt.nz/goto/international](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/goto/international) under ‘Publications’. The research on international students is also available on this link.

Orders for printed copies (Chinese language only) can be placed with Learning Media Customer Services: freephone 0800 800 565 or email [orders@learningmedia.co.nz](mailto:orders@learningmedia.co.nz)

The Ministry of Education is planning to publish versions of the guide for international students of other nationalities in the future.
