Dr Gary Bold, a physics lecturer at Auckland University, was tonight awarded the supreme prize by the Prime Minister at the 2004 Tertiary Teaching Excellence Awards ceremony at Parliament this evening.

Dr Bold, a physics lecturer for 43 years, was awarded $30,000 in prize money. He was one of twelve academics from nine tertiary institutions presented with awards.

The awards celebrate excellence in tertiary teaching, promote good teaching practice, and enhance career development for tertiary teachers.

Awards worth $20,000 each were presented to tertiary teachers showing sustained excellence and excellence in innovation. Award winners can use the prize money to enhance their teaching career and promote best practice amongst their colleagues.

In total $210,000 in award money was presented at the ceremony.

Helen Clark said the awards are an important element of the government’s aim to enhance the quality of tertiary education.

“These awards recognise excellence in tertiary teachers. These teachers make an important contribution to New Zealand, and inspire others to lift their own teaching practice.

“Great teachers attract students to tertiary education. Today New Zealanders must be life-long learners if we are to adapt and embrace the challenges and changes the 21st century brings.

“The group of award winners selected this year are of a very high calibre and highlight the strength of the staff of New Zealand’s tertiary institutions,” Helen Clark said.

Acting Associate Minister Education (Tertiary Education) Margaret Wilson, said winners were required to report back to Government on what they had spent the award money on. She said it was common for recipients to spend money on new equipment, and research, and on attending conferences so that they could enhance their knowledge and find new ways to share it with students.

“As was the case last year, a booklet detailing the teaching approaches, experiences and methodologies of tonight’s recipients will be published later this year and distributed widely throughout the tertiary education sector.

“I congratulate the winners and encourage all tertiary staff to emulate their example. These annual awards have become a prestigious addition to the tertiary education calendar and reflect well on both the award winners and their institutions,” Margaret Wilson said.
