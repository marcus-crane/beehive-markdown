The Department of Conservation (DOC) is to embark on its largest ever possum trapping operation on the Chatham Islands in an effort to protect one of the biggest pigeons in the world, Conservation Minister Chris Carter announced today.

"The parea pigeon is found only on the Chathams and is a third larger than the kereru or woodpigeon that flies around the forests of mainland New Zealand," Mr Carter said.

"Unfortunately, the parea is critically endangered. In the 1980s the surviving population of the species got as low as 30 birds. We now have about 200 to 300 parea but the species remains under siege by possums, which raid parea nests, and eat its food.

"We are taking no chances with this bird so a new three-year possum operation is to be funded by the government through the New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy. It will cover 2500ha of South Chatham forest, a vital habitat for the parea," Mr Carter said.

"Previous predator control to revive parea numbers has focused only on 130 hectares. We hope that by significantly expanding the area of protection for the parea, we will give the species a major shot in the arm."

Mr Carter said DOC expected the operation to also provide protection for the threatened seabird taiko, another native of the Chathams.

"With the support of local Chatham landowners, DOC plans to include covenanted land adjoining the Tuku Nature Reserve, where taiko breeding burrows are located, in the operation.

"The Chathams are home to some 20 birds that occur no where else in the world. Thanks to operations like this one, we have successfully bought eight of them back from the brink of extinction, including the black robin," Mr Carter said.

To celebrate this fact, a book about the unique birdlife of the Chathams is to be published by DOC, and a copy given free to each Chatham Island household.
