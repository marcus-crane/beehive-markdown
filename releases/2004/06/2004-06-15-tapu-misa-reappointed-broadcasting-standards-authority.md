Notable columnist and journalist Tapu Misa has been reappointed to the Broadcasting Standards Authority for three years, Acting Broadcasting Minister David Benson-Pope announced today.

The Authority is an independent statutory body established under the Broadcasting Act 1989. It hears complaints after determination by broadcasters, issues advisory opinions on broadcasting standards to broadcasters, encourages the development and observance of codes of broadcasting practice, and conducts research on matters relating to broadcasting standards.

David Benson-Pope said Tapu Misa was a valued member of the Authority and the government was pleased she had agreed to serve a further term.

“Tapu Misa has a solid background in the New Zealand media. She is currently a freelance journalist and publishes regular columns in the New Zealand Herald and Mana magazine. She has previously worked for Pacific media, radio and magazines.

“Her reappointment will ensure the Board continues to have the appropriate mix of skills and experience,” David Benson-Pope said.

Tapu Misa was first appointed to the Authority in February 2003 to serve out the remainder of a former member’s term.
