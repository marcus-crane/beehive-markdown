Acting Immigration Minister Damien O'Connor today disputed National Party figures relating to the government's Skilled Migrant policy.

National Party Immigration spokesperson, Dr Wayne Mapp, claims there's been a dramatic reduction in the number of skilled migrants looking to come to New Zealand, quoting a figure of only 1,198 who'd shown interest in migrating here between March and May.

Mr O'Connor said Dr Mapp's figure was quite simply inaccurate. "Dr Mapp has neglected to mention that the figure he's referring to only represents the principal applicants who've shown an interest. But expressions of interest encompass an average of 2.27 people.

"Most include family members, many of whom have skills of their own. So once they're included, the total who've shown interest between March and May is actually 7,823 people. This figure bears no resemblance to Dr Mapp's figure of 1,198."

There was ongoing interest from people wishing to come to New Zealand, Mr O'Connor said, with people registering in the pool all the time.

Mr O'Connor also took exception to Dr Mapp's claim that the Skilled Migrant Category (SMC) wasn't working.

"The system is working effectively in terms of attracting quality not quantity. New Zealand wants people who can contribute and settle effectively. This government is conscious of the skills shortages left by the previous National Government; the SMC is designed to address these.

"The policy enables New Zealand to choose the people it needs, rather than passively accepting applications from anyone interested in residing here. That approach has been proven to lead to backlogs of people with little to offer New Zealand."

To date, the majority of people invited to apply for residence under the SMC were already in New Zealand working in skilled employment, Mr O'Connor said. "I'd say the system's working very well."
