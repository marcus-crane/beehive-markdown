State Services Minister Trevor Mallard today launched the Human Resources Framework – a new, shared approach to human resource management for the public service.

Trevor Mallard said the initiatives contained under the Human Resources Framework will help create a sense of ‘one’ public service, rather than a lot of different organisations.

"The Human Resources Framework will improve government departments’ abilities to work together and to attract and develop good people. At present each department has its own system of human resource management. This means, for example, that length of service in one organisation may not be recognised in another," Trevor Mallard said.

"Instead of 35 departments each developing their own systems in areas such as professional development, remuneration systems and leave entitlements, the framework identifies where it makes sense to have shared policies and where it makes sense for departments to design their own."

The work in the Human Resources Framework so far involves:

- Developing the 'people capability' of the public service including secondments, induction, and development and training.
- Addressing employment environments and conditions, including work/life balance.

The State Services Commission, working with departments and the Public Service Association, is responsible for the policy and design stages of these projects, but departments have primary responsibility for implementation.

"This government is committed to rebuilding a strong public sector and the framework will help by developing a public service that is modern and practical, and has the ability to meet the needs of the government, the community, and its staff, both now and well into the future," Trevor Mallard said.

The framework concept was suggested in the 2001 *Review of the Centre* report, a review process that promoted a whole-of-government approach to public management.
