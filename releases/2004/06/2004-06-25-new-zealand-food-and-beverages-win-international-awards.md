World class innovations in food and beverages produced in New Zealand have just been awarded SIAL d'Or gold awards in Paris. "Congratulations are in order," says Jim Anderton, Minister of Economic Development.

New Zealand companies have won gold medals in 3 of the 12 categories in the highly regarded SIAL d'Or food and beverage contest in Paris this week. The awards are given for the best new products developed in the past 2 years from around the world. Tegel won the meat and poulty delicatessen category with its new smoked chicken rashers; Sealord won the seafood category with Greenshell Mussels in White Wine and Garlic Sauce; and 42 Below won the alcoholic beverages category with Manuka Honey Vodka.

"I congratulate these New Zealand companies on their success. Not only have they won gold medals, but they have boosted the export potential for the whole food and beverage sector by showing the world that our products are highly desirable, creative, innovative and of an excellent quality. New Zealand has won more medals than any other country.

"Our ability to compete in the world economy is reliant upon maximising our abilities as a creative, diverse and technologically advanced country, which is in touch with market trends. These companies have shown that with fresh new ideas, primary produce can be made into high value, high quality export goods.

"Global connections are the key to extending our markets, and success in this prestigious international food and beverage competition showcases New Zealand to the world," Jim Anderton said.

SIAL is the world's biggest gathering of food industry professionals and meets every 2 years attracting 165,000 visitors from 188 countries to see over 5,000 exhibitors. The exhibition period starts in October when the grand prize for overall best product is awarded.
