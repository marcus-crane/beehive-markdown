Associate Minister for the Environment David Benson-Pope has named a five-member reference group to provide independent advice on the recently announced review of the Resource Management Act (RMA).

The members of the group are Graham Pinnell (Waikato sheep and cattle farmer), Shane Jones (Chairman of Sealord Group Ltd), Kate Mitcalfe (environmental lawyer with the Forest and Bird Protection Society), Basil Chamberlain (Chief Executive of the Taranaki Regional Council), and David Hill (Director of Hill Young Cooper Ltd consultancy).

“The group members all have extensive experience with the RMA that will be invaluable and will bring a practical ‘real world’ perspective to the process,” said David Benson-Pope. “The review – which works across several government agencies – is about putting in place an improvement programme for the RMA.

"The reference group will act as a sounding board to make sure the ideas proposed are both workable and desirable.”

The improvement programme, announced last month, focuses on five key areas: balancing local and national interests; local resource management planning; resource consent processing; natural resource allocation; and capacity and practice in local government.

“During the past 18 months, the Ministry for the Environment has met and talked with business people, environmental and community groups, practitioners and local government representatives. The areas we are focusing on were consistently raised as areas that need attention,” said David Benson-Pope.

"I also urge people from the broader community with an interest in resource management to feed their ideas and suggestions to the Ministry for the Environment.

“We welcome comments on how the RMA can be improved, through the Ministry for the Environment’s RMA website at [www.rma.govt.nz](http://www.rma.govt.nz). Interested parties will also have an opportunity to take part in public meetings planned for the main centres in July.”
