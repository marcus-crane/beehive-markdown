"Spam is offensive and a drain on the economy. I am committed to a stand alone piece of legislation that has the teeth to put local spammers out of business." said Associate Information Technology Minister, David Cunliffe at an Internet NZ workshop for discussing anti-spam measures.

Protecting families from the offensive content of spam and reducing the costs that spam inflicts on individuals and businesses are the Government's key aims in drafting anti-spam legislation

"Legislation is part of a multi-pronged attack on spam. Partnership with industry and the community on education and codes of practice also has a valuable role to play." said David Cunliffe.

Mr Cunliffe also emphasised the importance of legislation for allowing international cooperation to fight spam.

The Government is currently consulting on legislative options for dealing with spam. The Minister intends to have a bill introduces to Parliament before the end of the year. The discussion document can be found at [Spam Discussion Document](http://www.med.govt.nz/pbt/infotech/spam/index.html).
