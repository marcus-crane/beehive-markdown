The Associate Transport Minister Harry Duynhoven says a considerable amount of hard work has seen New Zealand meet tomorrow’s deadline to implement strict new international [maritime security requirements](http://www.transport.govt.nz/business/maritime/maritime-security.php).

“The deadline was always going to be challenging, but excellent co-operation between the government and industry ensured New Zealand has gained a near 100% compliance”, said Mr Duynhoven.

The 1 July 2004 deadline was imposed by the [International Maritime Organisation](http://www.imo.org/home.asp) (IMO), who in December 2002 made amendments to the [International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea](http://www.imo.org/Conventions/contents.asp?topic_id=257&doc_id=647) (SOLAS) to put in place a new framework for international maritime security covering ports and ships. New Zealand as a contracting party to SOLAS is required to have the new security framework in place by tomorrow.

“I would particularly like to thank the [Maritime Safety Authority](http://www.msa.govt.nz) and the [Ministry of Transport](http://www.transport.govt.nz) for their commitment over the past 18 months to ensure the 1 July 2004 deadline was met,” he added.

All three New Zealand registered ships who undertake international voyages and 19 port facilities are compliant. Opua is the only remaining port facility to gain approval by the MSA. It is not a trading port and is expected to gain compliance by the end of July, well ahead of the next cruise vessel visit.

By way of comparison, as of 25 June 2004, less than 50% of port facilities and ships around the world were compliant.

“Although I expect this number to have increased over the past few days, the fact that we are so well placed, especially compared to some other countries, is a reflection of a high level of co-operation within the maritime transport sector here in New Zealand. It has also enhanced our reputation as a country that can respond in a very pragmatic and effective manner to new international requirements.”
