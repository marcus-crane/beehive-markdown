25 June 2004 Media Statement  
$11m for rates remissions after February floods

Local Government Minister Chris Carter has approved more than $11 million to be paid to local authorities in flood affected areas of the central North Island.

The funds will be paid as part of a reimbursement scheme to 20 councils to enable them to grant rates remissions to income-generating properties affected by the February 2004 storms.

"This initiative is part of government's assistance for storm affected areas that totals up to $130m. Rates remissions means that business owners struggling to rebuild after the horrendous events of February will have one less bill to worry about," Mr Carter said.

The rates remission payments will be made in three instalments. The first payment was made to councils last week, and the second is expected during July.

The government is also helping flood affected communities with state highway and local road repair, and assistance for agriculture and forestry.

**RATES REMISSIONS REIMBURSEMENT: FEBRUARY 2004 STORMS**  
(Summary)

Background  
The Government has budgeted for $11.25 million (inclusive of GST) to be spent on reimbursing those councils that grant rates remissions in respect of income-generating properties affected by the February 2004 storms.

The $11.25 million is to be split into two payments - 40% will be allocated to councils for this financial year (2003/04), and the remaining 60% will be allocated for the next financial year (2004/05).

The split is in recognition of the fact that not everyone who receives a remission for 2003/04 rates will need one for 2004/05 rates.

Apportioning the funding between councils  
Earlier, councils were asked to identify, as best they could, those commercial properties that were affected by the storms, and to provide the total rates that were assessed on those properties for the 2003/04 financial year. Those assessment figures were used to divide up the $11.25 million between the affected councils proportionally.

For example, if a council's assessment figure represented 10% of the total assessment figures for all affected councils, then that council would be allocated 10% of the $11.25 million.

Allocations  
**Column (A)**:shows the maximum allocated to each council.  
**Column (B)**:shows the amount that will be paid immediately to councils for the year ending June 2004 (40% of column (A), payment 1).  
**Column (C)**: shows the amount allocated for the year ending June 2005. This is the balance (60%) of column (A). It may be eventually that in some cases this allocation is not paid out in full.  
**Column (D)**:represents half of column (C). This is the amount that will be automatically paid to councils at the beginning of the 2004/05 year (payment 2).

Councils have been allocated funding to reimburse remissions as follows:

Each council will receive all of its allocation for the current financial year (40% of the total) by way of direct credit before the end of June 2004. For the next financial year, however, each council will receive half of the remaining 60% automatically in July 2004, and the remainder of its allocation (or any portion of it) only if and when the council identifies that it is needed.

The reason for holding back some of the 2004/05 allocation is again to recognise that councils are not yet in a position to accurately identify all ratepayers who will be receiving a remission. If a council needs its full 2004/05 allocation, it will receive it.

Nothing, of course, prevents a council granting remissions in excess of the reimbursement amount allocated to it. In such cases, however, the cost of remissions in excess of the Government's reimbursement level would be borne entirely by the council.

It will be up to the councils to identify the individual properties that will receive a remission, and to contact owners.

Any money allocated to a council for the current financial year that is unspent by 30 June 2004 will be able to be carried forward into the next year. Any money allocated to a council by the Government that is not used to remit rates in the next financial year must be returned to the Department of Internal Affairs.
