132,700 international visitors arrived in New Zealand in May 2004—29 per cent up on May 2003, and 12 per cent up on May 2002. The year on year figures for May 2003-May 2004 increased 8 per cent to an all-time record 2.2 million arrivals.

Tourism Minister Mark Burton says that the results illustrate a strong sector recovery in the wake of last year’s SARS outbreak, particularly in the Asian market.

“Today’s [figures](http://www.stats.govt.nz/domino/external/pasfull/pasfull.nsf/web/Hot+Off+The+Press+External+Migration+May+2004?open) show outstanding growth in key markets, with Asia up 82 per cent, Australia up 23 per cent, and the United States up 12 per cent.

“We continue to see incredible growth in both in our international profile and visitor numbers. Even more important is our growth in visitor expenditure. Last year, international visitors spent a total of $6,383 million in New Zealand—an impressive 3.9 per cent increase on 2002’s record figures.

“2003 also saw the inbound market from Australia reach $1 billion in export earnings for the first time ever—a real milestone in our relationship with our closest neighbour and biggest market.

“But international guests are only part of the picture. At over $8 billion, domestic spend on tourism still accounts for more than 50 per cent of the total sector value.

“Accommodation figures for April 2004 show a four per cent increase over the previous year, with seven out of 12 regions showing an increase. Clearly, travellers, be they domestic or international, are getting out into the regions of New Zealand, driving economic activity and employment opportunities.

“Tourism is, without a doubt, New Zealand’s most exciting and opportunity rich industry.

“The sector certainly has a lot to celebrate, but we can never afford to become complacent about our success. [None of it has happened by accident](http://www.tourism.govt.nz/strategy/index.html). New Zealand’s tourism industry is underpinned by strong government/sector partnerships that have over the last four and a half years survived and strengthened through prosperity and challenges alike.

“Initiatives such as the $11 million infrastructure for small communities funding in Budget 2004 clearly illustrate our continued commitment to playing our part alongside the industry. We will keep working with the sector to build a truly sustainable tourism sector for New Zealand—one that balances tourism’s economic benefits with the care, protection, and enhancement of our natural and made environments.”
