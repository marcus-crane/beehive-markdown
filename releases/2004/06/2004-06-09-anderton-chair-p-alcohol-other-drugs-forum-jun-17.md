Jim Anderton, chair of the Ministerial Committee on Drug Policy, will chair a pilot “P, alcohol and other drugs” forum in Tauranga on June 17.

“I believe that the public needs to be informed of what this Labour Progressive government is doing to combat the problem of drugs and I will be leading a panel consisting of agency representatives to show how our “whole of government” approach works in the drug and alcohol area,” he said

“There has been a lot of concern around the problem of P, but alcohol abuse is New Zealand’s number one drug problem and there will no doubt be many questions from the floor on these issues,” Jim Anderton said.

The aim is to inform the public on what is being done to secure our borders, how police are working to enforce the law in the drugs and alcohol area, what prevention strategies can be used in communities particularly focusing on the Community Action Youth and Drugs programmes and to outline treatment availability.

“If this forum is successful, I intend to attend further forums around the country,” the Progressive leader said.

Those confirmed for the Tauranga forum panel are:

Brian Pointon Regional Manager BOP DHB Public Health Unit  
Jenny Wolf Gen. Manager BOP DHB - Mental Health Services  
Paul Stanley Project Manager Community Action Youth and Drugs CAYADS  
Murray Lewis Senior Sgt/Dist. Commander NZ Police  
Shane Panettiere Team Leader NZ Customs

The Public Forum on P, alcohol and other drugs chaired by Jim Anderton is on Thursday 17 June at 7.30pm at the Bureta Park Motor Inn, Redwood Room, Vale Street, Otumoetai, Tauranga.
