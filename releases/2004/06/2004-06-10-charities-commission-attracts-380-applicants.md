There has been an overwhelming response to the call for Expressions of Interest for members of the inaugural Charities Commission Board, says Commerce Minister Margaret Wilson.

The Ministry of Economic Development has received about 380 applications from experienced and qualified candidates, she said.

"This high response rate reflects the intense interest the charitable sector has in the proposed Charities Commission. It leaves me in no doubt that the Commission will have the necessary governance expertise for its all important first phase of operation."

The Charities Bill, which provides for the creation of a Charities Commission with five to seven part-time Commissioners, is currently being considered by the Social Services Select Committee. The deadline for submissions on the Bill closed on 3 June.

Margaret Wilson said government appointment processes generally take six months, and the Commissioners would not be appointed until after the Bill had been passed into law, expected towards the end of 2004.

"I am mindful of the Select Committee process, and that the functions of the Commission could be changed during the Bill's progress through Parliament. The recruitment process allows for this necessary flexibility."
