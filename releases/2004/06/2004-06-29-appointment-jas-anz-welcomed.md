Michael Willing has been appointed to the Joint Accreditation System of Australia and New Zealand ("JAS-ANZ") for a three year term, announced Commerce Minister Margaret Wilson.

"JAS-ANZ supports trans-Tasman and international trade through the accreditation of organisations in both countries that conduct conformity certification programmes.

"Accreditation assists exporters of goods and services by gaining international recognition of certificates of conformity"

"Michael Willing's professional experience in quality management systems and how they support international trade will allow him to make a substantial contribution to JAS-ANZ's operations," Margaret Wilson said.

Mr Willing is the compliance manager for Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd, the world's largest exporter of dairy products.

He has advanced the development of quality systems that are internationally certified through the International Standards Organisation.

At Fonterra he is responsible for the business management system that operates globally.

While at the New Zealand Dairy Board, Mr Willing was instrumental in developing the total quality management philosophy and approach that was adopted by the individual dairy companies.

JAS-ANZ was established by a treaty between New Zealand and Australia in 1991.

The chair and deputy chair positions alternate between New Zealand and Australia. The current chair is New Zealander Dean Stockwell.

The Board is responsible for:
