“Expect an exploration boom in New Zealand in the next few years” signalled Harry Duynhoven, the Associate Minister of Energy, following the government’s announcement yesterday of a package of incentives designed to hasten the discovery of new petroleum reserves in New Zealand.

Mr Duynhoven said that the government, in consultation with industry representatives, began putting together a package of incentives for petroleum exploration when it became clear that the current level of exploration activity might not be sufficient to meet demand in the medium term.

“While this package has been estimated to be in the order of 10s of millions of dollars to explorers in New Zealand, its value to New Zealand is incalculable in terms of added energy security and improved international perceptions regarding New Zealand as an exploration destination.” said Mr Duynhoven

The package comprises:  
·a reduction in the royalty regime for oil and gas discoveries made over the next five years;  
·a review of specific tax laws affecting exploration activity;  
·additional funding to Crown Minerals for technical data acquisition to increase knowledge of the more prospective parts of New Zealand’s petroleum basins; and  
·increased resources for targeted promotion of New Zealand to international explorers and investors.

“Each item targets a key issue raised by the Petroleum Exploration Association of New Zealand (PEANZ) during our consultation with industry. Submissions from industry have played a key role in the shape of the package. Industry will have a further opportunity to comment on these proposals during consultation on the Minerals Replacement Programme which is due to be released later this month.”

Mr Duynhoven added that the incentives package went hand-in-hand with increasing the capability within the Crown Minerals group of the Ministry of Economic Development (MED) to actively promote New Zealand to international exploration companies.

“The establishment of a Petroleum and Minerals Investment Unit within Crown Minerals has brought a new focus to MED insofar as we recognise that in a post-Maui environment New Zealand must aggressively compete on a world stage to attract the exploration investment dollar” said Mr Duynhoven.

Mr Duynhoven said that concerns over international terrorism now made New Zealand an increasingly attractive destination for explorers wishing to balance risk in their investment portfolio.

“Our positive international perception in terms of sovereign risk is now complemented by this package which addresses two other key factors influencing investment decisions – the attractiveness of the fiscal regime and perceptions regarding geological prospectivity.”

Mr Duynhoven said that the proposed royalty changes and review of tax laws would enhance an already high reputation in terms of global competitiveness. He added that the proposed acquisition of up to $15 million of new geological data would significantly increase knowledge regarding key petroleum basins \[beyond Taranaki], materially improving perceptions regarding prospectivity.

“Exploration is a high risk venture and explorers understandably want to mitigate their risk by targeting the right places to drill. By significantly adding to the pool of existing geo-technical data concerning our under-explored basins we expect to improve the likelihood of successful finds.”

The Minister said that there were two key next steps. The first is the preparation by Crown Minerals of a programme to acquire additional geo-technical data. The second is targeted international visits by Crown Minerals, with assistance from Investment New Zealand, to attract increased investment and exploration in New Zealand’s Mineral estate.
