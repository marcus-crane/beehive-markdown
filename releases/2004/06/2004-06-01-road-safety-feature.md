What is it with New Zealanders who speed? Why do speeding drivers think they have a God-given right to risk their lives and that of others?

Why is the level of driver understanding around speeding so poor?

I thought an LTSA advertisement television carried recently may have been on to something when it chose a Physics Professor, of all things, to try and sell the science behind speeding.

The ad showed two cars approaching a truck. Car one, doing 60km an hour, braked and hit the truck at 5kph. Result? A caved in front bumper.

Car two, doing 65kph, hit the brakes at the same time over the same distance. But that extra 5kph meant it hit the truck doing 32kph. Why? Physics. Result? A much more serious crash and quite possibly injuries for the occupants of the car.

Can a small difference in speed mean the difference between life and death? Yes, absolutely. There's no arguing with the science.

For us non-Physics Professors, simply put the speed you're driving at will account for how far you travel before you have a chance to react to a hazard, how hard you hit anything and how likely you are to be injured or killed when you hit it.

The faster you go the more likely you'll crash, and the more likely the risk of serious injury or death.

You don't need to be technically minded to realise that travelling too fast for the conditions ('speeding') puts you and your passengers at risk. Or, for instance, that you and your passengers are more than twice as likely to be involved in a fatal crash if you travel at 120kph than 100kph.

Speeding means you're also a risk to other road users, because they have to try and get out of your way. The risk of death to pedestrians also increases as speed increases: from a 10 percent risk at 30kph, to 70 percent at 50kph, 90 percent at 60kph and 96 percent at 70kph.

Despite all this, often do you hear people complain if they're caught speeding and ticketed. They seem to expect a sympathetic response, rather than the opposite. How often have you heard someone complaining they were pinged 'only' doing 70kph in a 50kph area?

It's amazing the people down at the LTSA, the police, ambulance crews, emergency room staff and everyone else sick and tired of cleaning up after speed related accidents, haven't totally pulled their collective hair out over these attitudes.

It's incredible such workplaces aren't filled with prematurely bald headed men and women.

Worse, some Opposition MPs have indulged in a campaign of whining about police enforcing our country's speeding laws.

Their standpoint suggests drivers should be able to exceed the speed limit, and police should be criticised for doing their job.

They have fed the fallacy that police have a sinister 'quota' system of ticketing, some sort of plot willingly engaged in by police to fill government coffers.

It's that kind of deliberate programme of misinformation for political gain that fires up the talkback callers, the letter to the editor writers and the likewise discontented.

Such attitudes ignore Police Commissioner Rob Robinson's repeated disputing of the quota claim, and the sound explanation that it is recognised that police, as part of their working day, will be expected to stop a number of speeding drivers.

Yes, you probably will receive a ticket if you speed, but this will ONLY happen if you choose to speed. In other words, if you choose to break the law, you know there's likely to be consequences. And in fact, a 10kph 'over the speed limit' tolerance is in place.

Then there's the highly offended, 'there should be more discretion', singsong. Such people inevitably support discretion for themselves, but not others. Other speedsters cause accidents, not them. Apart from the obvious flaws in that line of reasoning, the fact is officers can, and do, use discretion.

The financial obligation speeding motorists put us all under should not be discounted. As ACC Chief Executive Garry Wilson recently pointed out, speedsters were responsible for more than their share of the $334m ACC spent last year to support road accident victims.  
When it comes to changing peoples' attitudes around speed, a look at some recent figures makes illuminating, if sad reading. Sad, because always behind such lists lie personal tragedies, lives lost and for those left behind, lives forever altered.  
In 2003:  
·Speeding contributed to 140 fatal crashes and 1637 reported injury crashes  
·Speeding was a factor in 167 deaths, 623 serious injuries and 1967 minor injuries  
·Speed caused 1777 crashes resulting in injury or death  
·The social cost of speed related crashes was estimated to be about $890 million  
·Nearly 80 percent of speeding drivers were male.

Focusing on speed enforcement, coupled with the introduction of the Highway Patrol, has halved the number of high-speed offences.

There are people alive today, families still together, people without injuries, because of these initiatives.

There is no apology to be made for focussing on speeding drivers, and I don't make any.
