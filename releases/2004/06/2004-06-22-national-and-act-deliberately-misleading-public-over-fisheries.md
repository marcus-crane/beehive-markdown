Fisheries Minister David Benson-Pope has slammed National and ACT for deliberately trying to mislead the country over a proposed expansion of New Zealand's quota management system (QMS).

He said that National's Phil Heatley and ACT's Gerry Eckhoff had proven themselves to be, at best, irresponsible and incompetent, but at worst they had deliberately told lies to the New Zealand public.

Both Mr Heatley and Mr Eckhoff are members of Parliament's Primary Production Select Committee, which is currently considering introducing highly migratory species like tuna caught on the open seas into the QMS.

This includes allocating a 20 per cent share to Maori as agreed to by National in the 1992 Fisheries Deed of Settlement, which outlined the full and final settlement of Maori grievances over commercial wild fisheries.

Both Mr Heatley and Mr Eckhoff have been issuing statements questioning the legitimacy of the allocation – Mr Heatley describing it as "madness" and a "welfare cheque to Maori", while Mr Eckoff had called it a "nonsense" that could jeopardise race relations.

However, Mr Benson-Pope said today that he had supplied the Primary Production Committee not one, but two Crown Law Office opinions that concluded exactly the opposite.

The Crown Law opinions that both Mr Heatley and Mr Eckhoff received last month conclude that amending Section 44 of the Fisheries Act 1996 to avoid allocating 20% of new QMS species to the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission would be in breach of the 1992 settlement.

"The entitlement of the Commission reflected in s44 is a key part of the redress," the Crown Law opinion reads.

"This is the most base form of politics," said Mr Benson-Pope. "I supplied the Crown Law opinions to the committee on May 26, after getting the legal privilege waived. The clerk of that select committee has confirmed that the opinions were tabled the following day.

"National and ACT have, for some time now, been playing fast and loose with the truth, hoping to gain electoral success by appealing to peoples prejudices rather than debating the facts."
