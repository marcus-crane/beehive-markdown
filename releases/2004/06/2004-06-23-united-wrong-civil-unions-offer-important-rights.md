Associate Justice Minister David Benson-Pope has criticised the United Future party for being deliberately obtuse over civil unions and its associated relationships legislation.

He says that those discussing civil unions in any sort of serious way had used the term 'civil union' as a shorthand for the two tandem pieces of legislation, the Civil Union Bill and the Relationships (Statutory References) Bill.

Mr Benson-Pope says United Future were trying to cynically spin the issue by separating what were interdependent Bills. He says the test of the logic of that approach becomes apparent when you apply the same test to the Marriage Act:

"Inevitably you find that, like the Civil Union Bill, the institution of marriage only gains meaning and effect from the rest of the law," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"The Civil Union Bill confers the right for different sex couples who do not wish to marry to have their relationship legally and socially recognised through a civil union.

"The Bill also confers the right for same sex couples to have their relationship legally and socially recognised.

"The registration of a civil union provides a couple with readily available proof of the nature of their relationship, rather than relying on a determination of whether their relationship falls under the definition of de facto in the Relationships (Statutory References) Bill.

"The Marriage Act 1955 does not confer rights on couples, except in relation to solemnisation and registration of the relationship. Rights and responsibilities arising from marriage are also established through other statutes.

"The act of entering into a civil union (or marriage) can be seen as an important symbolic step, as it marks the occasion on which the couple makes commitments to each other."
