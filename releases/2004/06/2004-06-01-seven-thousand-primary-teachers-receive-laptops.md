Additional government funding of $12 million will see some 7000 primary school teachers benefit from a further extension of the Laptops for Teachers scheme, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

"All permanent, full-time primary teachers of Years 4 to 6 students in about 2300 schools will be eligible for the laptops as a result of this funding," Trevor Mallard said.

"More than 17,000 principals and intermediate and secondary teachers throughout the country have already received laptops through the scheme. Last month I further extended the scheme to around 400 permanent, full-time primary teachers (years 1-6) at area schools in mostly rural areas.

"The extension of the scheme to even more primary teachers today is a further step in our commitment to encouraging the use of information technology in schools.

"This government wants to see all teachers using ICT as a professional tool, as it not only helps teachers, but also students in the classroom.

"Access to laptops motivate teachers to become familiar with and skilled at using information technology and also helps with easing teaching workloads.

"Feedback from teachers who already have laptops through the scheme has  
been really positive. They report significant improvements to their skills in using this technology when they teach."

Trevor Mallard said the Laptops for Teachers scheme reimburses schools for two-thirds of the cost of leasing a laptop, with schools or teachers paying the remaining cost. After the first three years, the school would be able to enter a new lease deal.

He made the announcement during a visit to Hataitai School, Wellington, where eligible teachers received their laptops.

Teachers can register for the laptops through their school on the Ministry of Education website:
