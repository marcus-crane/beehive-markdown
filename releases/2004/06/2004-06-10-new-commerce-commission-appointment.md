Current Electricity Commission Chair Roy Hemmingway has been appointed as an associate member of the Commerce Commission, Commerce Minister Margaret Wilson announced today.

His appointment, in respect of Part 4A (electricity thresholds regime) matters under the Commerce Act 1986, runs until14 September 2006 to coincide with the expiry date of his Electricity Commission term.

Margaret Wilson said Roy Hemmingway's appointment would strengthen the relationship between the two Commissions in respect of regulatory oversight of Transpower and the electricity lines businesses.

The Electricity Commission is the new electricity regulator with broad responsibilities for oversight of the performance of the electricity industry. The Commerce Commission also administers a targeted control regime to encourage Transpower and the electricity lines companies to improve efficiencies for the long-term benefit of consumers.

"Having Roy Hemmingway appointed to the Commerce Commission will ensure the combined impacts of regulation on electricity lines businesses are taken into account and the compliance costs for business are minimised", Margaret Wilson said.

Before taking up Electricity Commission appointment in September 2003, Roy Hemmingway was Chair of the Public Utility Commission in the State of Oregon, USA, where he was involved in national and state efforts to create competitive markets for electricity.

He spent most of his 30 years in Oregon working in the public sector on matters involving electricity. He served as a policy advisor to three Oregon governors and was a key figure in establishing the Northwest Power Planning Council, a four-state electricity planning body. In the private sector, he worked as a consultant to the electricity industry in Oregon and Washington.

Margaret Wilson said the roles of the Electricity Commission and the Commerce Commission in the electricity industry are to be amended by the Electricity and Gas Industries Bill currently before the Commerce Select Committee. The Bill provides that the government may transfer to the Electricity Commission responsibility for administering Part 4A of the Commerce Act in respect of Transpower only, or all electricity lines businesses, in certain circumstances. The Bill is expected to be reported back to Parliament in late June.
