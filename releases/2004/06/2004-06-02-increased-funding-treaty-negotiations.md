A further $1.2 million a year will be put into Treaty settlement negotiations.

Treaty Negotiations Minister Margaret Wilson says the extra resources are needed to ensure the government has capacity to negotiate with all of the groups ready to enter into negotiations.

“Now that more claimant groups than ever are in, or are ready to begin negotiations, we need to make sure the Crown can continue to match their pace.”

"We are currently in discussions with 25 claimant groups. There are signs that even more groups are interested in getting around the table", says Margaret Wilson.

Recent developments have seen negotiations commence with central north island iwi Ngäti Manawa and Ngäti Whare, and mandates recognised for Te Arawa, Ngati Tüwharetoa and Moriori.

The upcoming months will also see legislation introduced into the house for the Ngäti Awa and Ngati Tüwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) settlements and work continuing towards finalising Deeds of Settlement for Ngäti Mutunga and the Te Arawa lakes claims.
