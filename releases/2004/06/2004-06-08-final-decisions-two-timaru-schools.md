Following a 28-day consultation period, Education Minister Trevor Mallard confirmed today his decision to close Pleasant Point High School and Watlington Intermediate School.

“The Ministry of Education has consulted affected boards on my behalf and I have carefully considered the information that has been presented to me.

"It is clear, however, that Timaru city cannot sustain an intermediate as well as full primary schools and the community has clearly indicated its preference for full primary schools,” Trevor Mallard said.

“It is also clear that Pleasant Point High School’s declining roll means it will not be sustainable in the future.

“I am taking this action because in the interests of local students, it's important there is a sustainable network of quality schooling for the next 10 to 15 years in the Timaru district.

“I want to reinforce that the closure of Watlington Intermediate School and Pleasant Point High School does not reflect any lack of quality in the level of education that they provide.

"My concern has been that the quality of education will be threatened over time because of viability issues, including roll decline and potential competition between intermediate and primary schools.

"I want to record my appreciation of the service that current and previous boards and staff have given to both schools and their students,” Trevor Mallard said.

The closures will be gazetted shortly to take effect on 28 January 2005.

A Ministry of Education project manager will be in touch with the schools shortly about the next steps in the process.
