Seven polytechnics have been awarded grants for projects enabling them to better meet local skills needs, Regional and Industry Development Minister Jim Anderton and Acting Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education) Margaret Wilson announced today.

The funding is the fifth round of grants from the government’s $5 million Polytechnic Regional Development Fund. It was established in 2002 to enable and encourage polytechnics to collaborate with local industry and enterprise to develop skills-related initiatives that will support regional economic development.

Northland Polytechnic, Eastern Institute of Technology, Universal College of Learning, Wellington Institute of Technology, Aoraki Polytechnic, Otago Polytechnic and Southern Institute of Technology will receive funding totalling $457,002.

Jim Anderton said the funding confirmed the government’s commitment to assisting regions to develop sustainable economic futures.

"The level of interest among polytechnics and institutes of technology in addressing local skill and development priorities remains strong with seven institutions having had funding approved this round for a wide variety of initiatives," he said.

Margaret Wilson said the funding would assist regional polytechnics to focus on their core role of skilling the nation.

"This commitment by polytechnics and institutes of technology shows that they are keen to ensure they meet the long term needs of industries in their regions and play a key role in regional economic development," she said.

All applications were considered by the Regional Partnerships Programme Assessment Panel which is chaired by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise and includes representatives from the Ministry of Economic Development, the Tertiary Education Commission, Te Puni Kokiri and two independent members.
