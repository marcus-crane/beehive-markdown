Education Minister Trevor Mallard and Rongotai MP Annette King today announced the government is building a new early childhood education centre at Kaingaroa on the Chatham Islands.

“The government has approved $299,207 to build a new centre on the Kaingaroa School site which is expected to be completed by August 2004,” Trevor Mallard said.

“In March 2002 Annette King, who represents the Chathams, wrote to me about the need for a new centre. During a visit to the Chatham Islands in November 2002 my colleague Minister of Maori Affairs Parekura Horomia visited the early childhood education service at Kaingaroa.

“While everyone has been impressed with the commitment of the parents and the education being provided, it was clear that new premises were needed.

“The Ministry of Education explored several options, including the relocation of an early childhood centre at Owenga, but load restrictions on some of the bridges on the island meant this option was not possible.

“Constructing a new centre became the only feasible option. I am extremely pleased that we are able to support one of New Zealand’s most remote settlements," Trevor Mallard said.

Rongotai MP Annette King welcomed the news for her constituents.

"Our government is committed to ensuring that all our young children, regardless of where they live, have the same opportunities as other young New Zealanders. I'm very pleased that the under-fives on the Chatham Islands will be better catered for in the proposed new building. It's really important for our kids that education takes places in an encouraging and modern environment."

Trevor Mallard said that research showed that if children had access to quality early childhood education, then they would do better educationally later on.

"That's why Budget 2004 saw an injection of $365 million additional funding over the next four years to make quality education more affordable, and accessible to more children and families,” Trevor Mallard said.
