Prime Minister Helen Clark today officially launched the Sir Peter Blake Trust at Takapuna Grammar School, Sir Peter’s old school, in Auckland.

Helen Clark said the charitable trust commemorates the outstanding life, character, and achievements of Sir Peter, and ensures the continuation of his important environmental work.

“Sir Peter achieved fame through his achievements as a courageous and skilful yachtsman, but at the time of his tragic death in 2001 Sir Peter was channeling his energies into building awareness of the importance of our natural heritage,” Helen Clark said.

“Shortly before he died I had the honour of joining Sir Peter and the Seamaster crew as they sailed the Amazon to draw attention to the importance of its waters and forests to the whole planet.

“His work was receiving international attention and the Sir Peter Blake Trust will help ensure that it continues to do so.

“Through the trust young New Zealanders will be able to make a difference in the world through learning about and undertaking action for the environment, and by developing leadership skills.

“In April 2002 Cabinet agreed to celebrate Sir Peter’s life through the formation of the trust, and set aside $3.8 million to establish the initial capital for the venture.”

Helen Clark said she was pleased to announce the projects the trust is developing:

·The Sir Peter Blake Environmental Educator Fellowship; an outstanding environmental educator will have the opportunity to take a year’s leave to take part in an environmental adventure. This could be in conjunction with organisations such as the Department of Conservation or Antarctica New Zealand. The educator will maintain close contact with New Zealand schools through various media including on-line diaries and discussions, contributions to websites, and virtual classrooms and the development of resources. The Fellow will help students develop knowledge about, and the ability to protect and enhance, natural ecosystems  
·Sir Peter Blake Ambassadors; three students have been selected to attend the United Nations Environmental Project International Children’s Conference to be held in New London, Connecticut, USA in July 2004. This year they are Sean Farrel of Whangarei, Jarrod Coutts of Nelson and Timo Stoffregen of Takaka. The Trust has worked with the Ministry for the Environment and Tasman District Council to help the ambassadors and their chaperones attend the conference  
·Blake Medal; this prestigious leadership award will acknowledge accomplished and nationally recognised leaders, and help create additional leadership role models  
·A leadership development and awards programme will be made available to young people from a range of disciplines including sports, culture and the environment.

Helen Clark said the seven trustees appointed to manage the work of the trust are Pippa, Lady Blake; the Secretary for Education, Howard Fancy; the Secretary for the Environment, Barry Carbon; the Ambassador of Brazil, His Excellency Sergio Serra; the Chief Executive of Westpac New Zealand, Ann Sherry; scientist Dr Mark Orams; and businessman Christopher Mace. The trust’s patron is Governor General Dame Silvia Cartwright.

The Ministry of Education and the Ministry for the Environment are represented on the trust and an environmental education committee will assist the trustees in the administration, awarding and monitoring of environmental education grants.

“I look forward to hearing more about the work of the trust and seeing Sir Peter’s legacy reconnect more young New Zealanders with their natural heritage and empowering them with the knowledge, skills and attitudes to make a difference,” Helen Clark said.
