Fisheries Minister David Benson-Pope says the aquaculture proposal he announced last week is about addressing an issue the National Party wasn't brave enough to face up to.

Mr Benson-Pope has announced a plan to settle all Maori marine farming claims post September 1992 by providing iwi with, where possible, an allocation of an area equivalent to 20 per cent of the total marine farming space allocated since 1992, and 20 per cent of any new marine farming space.

The deal aligns closely with the allocation model of the 1992 Fisheries Deed of Settlement, and the Fisheries Minister says marine farming should have been included in that 1992 Settlement, but National had been too weak.

In Parliament today Mr Benson-Pope highlighted the 2002 Waitangi Tribunal report entitled Ahu Moana: The Aquaculture and Marine Farming Report which stated plainly that then National Cabinet Minister of both Fisheries and Maori Affairs, Doug Kidd, had forbidden officials from including marine farming in that settlement.

The Waitangi Tribunal report reads: "He \[Doug Kidd] thought that the Treasury had wanted to bring aquaculture into the quota management system, but he had personally forbidden Treasury officials from mentioning the matter during discussions on the deed of settlement since it would confuse an already complex set of negotiations."

Fisheries Minister David Benson-Pope says that National's current response is empty, ugly political rhetoric in light of this information.

"This proposal is a way to resolve issues that should have been addressed more than a dozen years ago as part of the full and final settlement of fisheries claims," said Mr Benson-Pope. "It is regrettable that National didn't resolve this and left it to a future Government to resolve.

"Marine farming has huge potential, but the industry is acknowledging itself, that it is unlikely to be able to make progress unless these issues are sorted out."
