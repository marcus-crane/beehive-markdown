Kaipara schools will receive a funding boost of over $42,000 to support the Te Kotahitanga O Kaipara project, a collaborative educational initiative originating from within the Maori community, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

"This project supports our government's commitment to achieving excellence in teaching and strengthening family and community involvement in their children's education," Trevor Mallard said.

"This funding will be used to raise student achievement by providing an avenue for primary school-aged students in the southern Kaipara area to be exposed to Maori language and culture in a mainstream setting. The project's main objective is to support and encourage students, keeping them enthused in education through a medium that works well for them.

"Tutors who will deliver the curriculum are from the Kaipara community group, Tu Tangata. They are fluent and competent in Maori language and culture and have been involved with implementing holistic educational plans in the Kaipara area.

"Teachers involved with the project will have the opportunity to learn along side the students. I am especially pleased that the project will provide the experience for teachers to explore ways to enhance their teaching practices so we can really lift education standards for local students, and help them succeed.

"Each year the Collaborative Innovations Fund provides $1 million to support clusters of schools which want to work together to develop new styles of teaching and learning to improve educational achievement.

"I congratulate these schools on the collaboration that they have already demonstrated and it's great to see their continued efforts to provide new opportunities for their students and teachers. The critical involvement of the students' families and community in this project can only enhance the strong learning foundations and support that students need to reach their full potential and succeed."

The schools involved in the project are: Helensville School, Parakai School, Kaupkapakapa School, Woodhill School, Waimauku School, Riverhead School, Taupaki School, Ahuroa School and Kaipara College.
