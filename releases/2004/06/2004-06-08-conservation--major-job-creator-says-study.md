Public conservation lands and the activities of the Department of Conservation (DOC) on the West Coast are supporting more than 1800 full time jobs in the region, a new economic study by independent economists has found.

The study, Regional Economic Impacts Of West Coast Conservation Land, was prepared by Christchurch-based economists, Butcher Partners, and released today by Conservation Minister Chris Carter at the first Tourism on Public Conservation Lands Forum in Wellington.

"The study calculates that economic activity dependent on DOC and public conservation land on the West Coast totals $221m a year in gross output, and supports about 1814 full time equivalent jobs in the region," Mr Carter said.

"The study explicitly demonstrates that the protection of natural environments does not prevent significant economic activity arising from them, it simply puts the needs of our threatened native species and the recreation opportunities of New Zealanders first."

Mr Carter said the study estimated that the income being earned for households from activity dependent on West Coast conservation land was about $62m a year, making that activity a significant part of the region's economy.

Tourism Minister Mark Burton said the study again showed that tourism continued to drive growth across the regions of New Zealand.

"The bulk of the economic activity identified in this report – 1450 jobs - is derived from tourism and outdoor recreation using conservation land or dependent on the appeal of it to pull in visitors. Clearly, we can balance the care, protection and enhancement of our natural environments with tourism's very real economic benefits," he said.

Chris Carter said the study also showed there were a wide variety of other economic activities occurring on conservation land.

"For instance, concessions on the West Coast for farming, mining, and sphagnum moss harvesting on conservation land, are supporting about 149 full time equivalent jobs," Mr Carter said.

"We are currently seeing significant growth in economic activity on or around conservation land nationally. Last year there were 3781 concessions in place for businesses to operate on conservation land around the country, 350 more than in 2000. Contrary to what is frequently claimed by DOC's critics, the current approval rate for concessions is about 95 per cent.

"On top of this, visits to conservation lands are rising. DOC estimates there were a staggering 33 million in 2003, up from 28 million visits in 2002. About 60 per cent of these visits are by New Zealanders, and 40 per cent by tourists," said Mr Carter.

"This kind of growth presents significant challenges for the administration of conservation land but it also demonstrates that there are widespread spin offs to conservation, over and above its environmental benefits."

Key Points of Regional Economic Impacts of West Coast Conservation Land Report

·The operation of DOC and economic use of conservation lands supports about 1814 jobs for the West Coast, and has a total gross output of $221m a year.  
·DOC spending and the activities dependant on public conservation lands form a significant part of the West Coast regional economy. They are equivalent to 15 per cent of employment, and 13 per cent of earned household income.  
·The biggest contributor is tourism activity that is based on conservation land or reliant upon the appeal of it to get visitors to come to the region. This is supporting some 1450 jobs.  
·The economists have based these figures on a Lincoln University survey in 2001, which indicated that in excess of 65% of visitors to the West Coast go there because of public conservation land or the activities on it. The economists recommend further surveys to obtain more detail on visitor motivations.  
·Other activities on conservation land, such as grazing leases, sphagnum moss harvesting and mining, support about 149 full-time equivalent jobs. These figures do not include the jobs expected to be created by the Pike River Coal Mine, which was given conditional approval recently.  
·The study's results are based on an Economic Impact model, a conventional economic technique to estimate regional impacts of existing activities.
