A report out today shows racing is a key player in the New Zealand economy, says Racing Minister Damien O’Connor.

The report, commissioned by the New Zealand Racing Board, examines the economic and social impacts of the New Zealand racing industry.

It finds racing’s contribution to GDP is over $1.4 billion and its employment impact equates to over 18,000 full-time jobs.

The report also finds that almost 28,000 people belong to racing clubs, which record an annual attendance in excess of one million customers.

“We’ve always known that racing was a valuable contributor to our economy,” Mr O’Connor said, “and it’s great that we’ve now got a robust study to support that.”

“This government recognises the significance of the racing industry and that’s why we’ve worked hard to revitalise and strengthen it. The passing of the Racing Act last year was a crucial step in this process; the appointment of the new Racing Board was another.

“Today’s report is a direct result of the Racing Board’s progressive approach, and its commitment to securing the industry’s future.

“The board’s decision to invest in robust research will pay dividends. Without knowing the industry’s current position, it would be impossible to plan for future growth.

“I expect all racing supporters and stakeholders to support the board as it develops strategies for the industry’s future prosperity. The Government will also play an important role.”
