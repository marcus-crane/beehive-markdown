Two key links in Auckland's Western ring route today got the green light.

When completed, both projects will ease the burden on local roads, provide a more direct route across the city and boost the options for future public transport development. Together they will ease two key bottlenecks and help unlock Auckland's potential for future economic growth.

Commenting on the announcement, Associate Minister of Transport and Minister of Auckland Issues, Judith Tizard, said: "This government had already made its intentions clear around helping Auckland sort out its transport system, addressing years of underfunding and delay. This was underlined with the December 2003 announcement of an $1.62 billion in funding over the next ten years for Auckland transport. Today's announcement underlines this government's commitment to action."

The two projects are:

The state highway 20 Mt Roskill extension. A $152 million project to build a four km predominantly four-lane motorway linking SH20/Queenstown Road with Maioro Street and Sandringham Road.

The extension of SH20 in Manukau to SH1. A $157 million project to build four km of four-lane motorway from SH1 at Manukau City and the SH20 Puhinui interchange.

Both projects will include cycle and walking facilities and preliminary earthworks to enable future rail or bus-way development and will be paid for out of funding for the 03 /04 National Land Transport Programme.

"The inclusion of provision for modes of transport other than the car reflects the government's determination to develop a more integrated transport system and increasing accessibility to it. Such moves give ready alternatives to car use and have clear environmental and congestion reducing potential," added Transport Minister Pete Hodgson.

Following today's announcement, Transit New Zealand will manage a tender round for both projects.
