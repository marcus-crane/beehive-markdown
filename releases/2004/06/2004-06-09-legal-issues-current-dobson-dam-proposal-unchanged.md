Conservation Minister Chris Carter says the legal impediment to the Dobson Dam power proposal remains the same as it did when the scheme was first mooted four years ago.

"The current proposal requires me to give a large part of the public's Card Creek Ecological Area to a private company in exchange for another piece of land with lesser conservation value. Quite apart from the question of whether this would be much of a deal for the public, I can't actually legally make the swap," Mr Carter said.

"Card Creek was given a very high legal status when it was first protected by a previous National government. Under the Conservation Act, I cannot exchange an ecological area for another piece of land unless I can first revoke the ecological area's legal status. I can only revoke that status if the land no longer holds the values for which it was originally protected.

"In the case of Card Creek, it is untenable to pretend those conservation values are no longer there. If anything they have increased over time.

"If I were to change the law to enable me to revoke Card Creek's status without a loss of values, I would set a precedent that could make specially protected conservation land everywhere vulnerable to developers and political whims," Mr Carter said.

"The whole purpose of conservation land is that it is held in trust by the government for future generations, and is shielded by the law. Economic use of the land is permitted and is increasing but it is economic use that does not destroy the values of the land itself."
