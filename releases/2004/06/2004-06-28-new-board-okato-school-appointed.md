Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today that five people have been appointed to the establishment board of trustees for the new school to be opened in Okato in 2005.

The board members are Barry Finch, Jackie Kopu, Tom Mulholland, Claire Stewart and Kevin Walden.

“The members of the board will bring a variety of skills and background to the establishment of the school. I am pleased the board reflects the local community and has an appropriate mix of experiences,” Trevor Mallard said.

"One of the first tasks for the establishment board of trustees is to appoint the principal and all other staff to prepare for the school opening in 2005. The board will also determine the strategic direction of the new school and put in place policies which reflect this strategic direction. Importantly, the board will also be responsible for required property developments.

The establishment board of trustees will be in place until a new one is elected in about a year’s time.

The new composite school is being established as a result of the coastal schools network review. It will be located on the Okato College site and will cater for students from Year 1 (age 5) to Year 13 (age 17).

“I am impressed with the involvement of so many Okato people in the process of review and preparation for the new school that will come into being next year. This bodes well for the future,” Trevor Mallard said.

A project manager is helping with the implementation and planning work for the new school. A resource for schools outlining the process and the next steps is available on the network review section of [www.minedu.govt.nz](http://www.minedu.govt.nz)
