The location of a new Seafood Centre of Excellence in Nelson was announced tonight by Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton.

The Nelson-Marlborough seafood cluster announced the centre today.

Jim Anderton told a function marking the establishment of the new Nelson Economic Development Agency the centre would be located on Nelson Port Company land at the north end of Akersten Street.

"It is an excellent location with sea frontages and sufficient space to permit the construction of a central complex. It will house the museum, offices and auditorium along with the New Zealand School of Fisheries and the Cawthron Institute."

Jim Anderton said considerable effort has gone into finding the site.

"I am very pleased the government has also been able to provide $1.5m for the Nelson Marlborough Seafood Centre of Excellence. It will be the main national centre for all aspects of training education and research for the seafood industry. It will significantly increase our potential to deepen and expand our links to the global opportunities for our seafood industry.

"It will combine education, research and industry in a single site. The future of high value seafood production lies in our ability add knowledge and creativity to the industry. It will be very positive for the region.

"The centre of excellence is an example of the difference the government can make to unlocking the potential of our region. Nelson has natural resources, character and a creative, talented population. We are unleashing the power of these advantages," Jim Anderton said.
