Associate Justice Minister David Benson-Pope says he is disappointed that the Care of Children Bill is being used by some to attempt to overturn a law that has worked well for 27 years.

He says Catholic education officer Pat Lynch's claims that schools are to be forced into some new, legally dangerous, situation if they help students who come to them for help accessing abortion services is a cover for a hidden agenda.

Mr Benson-Pope says the Care of Children Bill does not alter the long-established law in New Zealand, which sets out a young woman's rights to make decisions for herself about a pregnancy.

That law was the result of a Royal Commission of Inquiry in 1977 which concluded there were strong reasons why a woman under the age of 16 should not be forced to obtain parental consent to have an abortion.

"You don't have to think for long to see why this fundamental right for women should be protected," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"Currently the policy actively encourages young women to discuss with parents or other trusted adults their pregnancy and choices, and most young women do so.

"Is Mr Lynch really suggesting that a young women who is the victim of incest, sexual abuse, or an abusive family, should have to ask those very people for their approval?

"Mr Lynch has stated his aim is to overturn the 1977 law that allowed young women choice about their pregnancy. That law has been working well.

"Unlike Mr Lynch, I know that the medical professionals involved in these difficult decisions can be trusted to act responsibly."
