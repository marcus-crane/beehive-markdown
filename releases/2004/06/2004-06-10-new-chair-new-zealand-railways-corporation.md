The Chair of the New Zealand Railways Corporation, Irene Lake, today welcomed the appointment of Cameron Moore to the board. Mr Moore has been appointed as a director effective 1 June 2004, and will become Chair of the Corporation on 1 July 2004 when Ms Lake retires.

“The Corporation in its new “TrackCo” role will be an integral part of New Zealand’s land transport infrastructure. I welcome Cameron as the new Chair of the Corporation, and his appointment as the head of an organisation that is relied upon by many New Zealanders and businesses”.

“The Corporation faces demanding challenges as it assumes the “TrackCo” role of maintaining and operating New Zealand’s rail infrastructure. Cameron’s experience in business and his independence mean that he is very well suited to lead the Corporation in meeting these challenges”.

Background:

Cameron Moore is a Christchurch based businessman with wide ranging management and leadership experience. He has extensive business networks through membership and leadership of employer and manufacturer groups, and has acted as business adviser and an independent director on company boards.

The Railways Corporation currently manages the Crown’s interest in rail-related land and residual issues. However, the Crown is currently in the process of buying New Zealand’s rail infrastructure back from Toll New Zealand (formerly Tranz Rail). It is intended that the Corporation will become the Crown organisation that manages these assets in the future.
