A national tyre collection system to manage millions of old and no longer roadworthy tyres, [Tyre Track](http://www.mta.org.nz/?id=796), will be launched today in Wellington by the Ministry for the Environment and [Motor Trade Association](http://www.mta.org.nz/?id=217) (MTA).

Environment Minister Marian Hobbs says Tyre Track will ensure the right thing is done with old tyres.

"It will make it easier for tyre dealers, transporters and recyclers to recycle or safely dispose of tyres," the minister added.

"I'm delighted industry and government are working together to address a growing problem. Every year New Zealanders throw away an estimated three to four million tyres."

Tyre Track will reduce the risk of old tyres being dumped illegally or stockpiled.

"Too many old tyres wind up on roadsides or in rivers or gullies,” Marian Hobbs said. "Sometimes they end up in ugly piles where they become a toxic fire hazard. They are also hard to manage in landfills unless shredded or quartered first."

Administered by the Motor Trade Association (MTA), Tyre Track will begin operating from 1 July 2004. Tyre dealers will contact Tyre Track when they have tyres for disposal. The dealer then selects a Tyre Track registered transporter who will collect their tyres and deliver them to approved storage and disposal points: recyclers, processors and landfills.

MTA Chief Executive Stephen Matthews said he was pleased that the tyre industry, with the Environment Ministry's support, had produced a solution to deal with unwanted tyres.

"People who use a Tyre Track dealer can be confident their old tyres will be disposed of properly," he said. "Tyre Track members will sign a code of practice agreeing that their old tyres will be delivered to approved sites. Our members have already shown strong interest in the voluntary scheme."

The Ministry for the Environment is working with recyclers and companies keen to make greater use of old tyres.

"We don't have uses for all our unwanted tyres yet, but are working on it," Marian Hobbs said. "Tyre Track will provide good information on tyre volumes for reuse or recycling.

"There are already some great examples of businesses that turn old tyres into everything from playground mats or sports turf to erosion control walls."

Tyre Track will be launched at Victoria University’s Adam Art Gallery, where the floor and benches are made from recycled tyres.
