Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard is urging parents and care-givers to be vigilant with children around heaters, following a recent incident of a child sustaining severe burns when his pyjamas caught fire.

The [Commerce Commission](http://www.comcom.govt.nz/) has informed the [Ministry of Consumer Affairs](http://www.consumeraffairs.govt.nz/), following tests on the pyjamas involved, that they met the Product Safety Standard for children’s nightwear.

"I feel very sad that this family have had such a distressing time, but this unfortunate incident is a reminder that all fabrics, however well designed, will eventually burn if they are exposed to flames or a direct heat source," Judith Tizard said.

"While the government has Product Safety Standards in place to reduce fire hazards from children’s nightwear, it cannot totally eliminate this risk. Low fire risk doesn't mean no fire risk.

"I would urge people to stick to the ‘meter-heater' rule and keep children at least one metre from open fires or heaters. People should also look at putting up safety guards around their heater if they have young children and watch children at all times when heaters are on.

"Daywear worn over ‘low fire danger’ nightwear can also increase the fire danger substantially."

The [Product Safety Standard](http://www.consumeraffairs.govt.nz/productsafety/standards/index.html) creates four categories of acceptable garments for nightwear:

- Category One: garments made from fabrics with low flame propagation properties (100% polyester, nylon or wool)
- Category Two: garments, which because of their design, are less likely to catch alight and if they do, the spread of flames is reduced because of the design features (close fitting styles)
- Category Three: all-in-one style garments made predominantly from knitted fabrics, in sizes 00 to 2
- Category Four: garments that are assigned a high flammability rating typically these are more flowing in style, are made from more flammable material, and more suited to summer nightwear where the risk of heaters is not so great.

Categories 1 to 3 will have a white label stating Low Fire Danger whereas category 4 will have a red High Fire Danger label.

**Tips for parents and caregivers**

- Be vigilant with children around heaters
- Stick to the ‘meter-heater rule’ that is keep children at least one metre from open fires or heaters
- Put up safety guards around the heater if you have young children
- Don’t let children wear daywear over their ‘low fire danger’ nightwear - this can increase the fire danger substantially.
