Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that expressions of interest are being sought from designers who wish to be involved with the New Zealand Memorial project in Hyde Park, London.

“Plans for the memorial were announced in July 2003, and funding of $3 million over two years for its construction was announced in this year's budget. Now the government is initiating the process of selecting a design for this important memorial," said Helen Clark.

“Artists, architects, landscape architects and designers who would like to be considered are invited to register their interest with the Ministry for Culture and Heritage.

The memorial will commemorate the strong relationship New Zealand has with Britain, and the sacrifice made by New Zealanders who fought side by side with the British in times of war.

The memorial will provide a focus for future London ceremonies, such as those marking ANZAC Day and other anniversaries important for New Zealand. It is to be sited at Hyde Park Corner, near the memorials established by other Commonwealth countries.

“The design approved by the government, following recommendations from the selection panel, will be compatible with the other structures of Hyde Park Corner. It will have a timeless appeal, and will capture something of the distinctiveness of New Zealand,” Helen Clark said.

Those eligible to register an expression of interest are New Zealand residents or New Zealanders living overseas.

Background Note:  
Expressions of interest should be with the Ministry for Culture and Heritage on 1 October 2004. The brief for the project can be obtained from the Ministry’s website, www.mch.govt.nz, by phoning on (04) 499 4229, or by email to info@mch.govt.nz.

A shortlist of designers will be compiled by 22 October 2004, and selected designers will be asked to provide proposals by 3 December 2004. A final design will be chosen by an expert panel, and approved by the government, by early February 2005. Construction will commence in time for the memorial to be unveiled on 11 November 2005. It will be sited diagonally opposite the Australia Memorial in Hyde Park, on the large circle of land which houses the Wellington Arch.
