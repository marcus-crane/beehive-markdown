A package to help address New Zealand’s skills shortages and build skill levels in critical areas of the workforce was announced today by Prime Minister Helen Clark and Associate Education Minister Steve Maharey.

The Skills Package, aimed at enhancing education and training in the workforce, responds to demand from industry and employer groups facing significant skills shortages, said Helen Clark.

“Our strong economy and record low levels of unemployment have created skill shortages across a wide variety of industry and occupational areas. Many firms are reporting increasing difficulty in finding skilled labour. Demand for workplace training to upskill our workforce has increased significantly.

“The government has championed a range of activities to help address both immediate and future skills needs. This package will gain real traction on skills shortages issues in the short term and will help increase participation in workplace training in areas where it is most needed.”

The package includes:

- Additional funding of approximately $8.9 million over the next four years to increase the rate of expansion of [Modern Apprenticeships](http://www.modern-apprenticeships.govt.nz/rendered/home.html). This will provide for an additional 1,000 places this financial year, to bring the total number of Modern Apprenticeships to 8,500 by June 2005 (compared with the [previous target](http://www.msd.govt.nz/media-information/press-releases/2004/pr-2004-05-13.html) of 8,000 by June 2006; there were 6,874 Modern Apprentices in June 2004).
- A one-off addition of $5 million to increase participation in [industry training](http://www.itf.org.nz). This will provide for approximately 5,000 additional funded industry-training places during 2005. Provision has already been made for funding above this level in 2006 and beyond.
- $2 million to fund a pilot providing post-placement support and training for former Work and Income clients who have completed [Training Opportunities](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/find-a-job/training.html#Training_Opportunities) (TO) study and entered work. The pilot will fund up to 250 TO graduates to obtain industry specific qualifications so they have better career and earning prospects.

Steve Maharey said industry training and Modern Apprenticeships have proved so successful that demand for both programmes has increased substantially across a range of industries.

“Part of the skills challenge includes increasing recruitment in industries that have skills shortages. The TO pilot will help address this issue by linking recent graduates with the [Jobs Jolt](http://www.msd.govt.nz/media-information/jobs-jolt-update-2004-fact-sheets/jobs-jolt-factsheets-index.html) [Jobs Partnerships with Industry](http://www.msd.govt.nz/media-information/jobs-jolt-update-2004-fact-sheets/job-partnership-with-industry.html) programme that now covers retail, hospitality, road construction and transport, and banking.

“Workplace learning is an important feature of our tertiary education system and plays a key role in responding to industry skill needs. This package demonstrates the government’s commitment to helping industry address skills issues where they occur – in the workplace.

“It is now up to industry and employers to step up to the challenge of investing in the skills of their workforce.”

The Skills Package was announced at Wellington’s Botanic Gardens, a major training ground for Modern Apprentices. The Parks and Gardens Department currently has eight Modern Apprentices and about 35 of the present staff have completed a horticultural apprenticeship. Two staff are dedicated to training and career development with one working solely with apprentices.
