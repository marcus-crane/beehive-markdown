The five category winners of the Ernst and Young Entrepreneurship awards announced last night are congratulated by the Minister of Economic Development, Jim Anderton who says we should celebrate their creativity and talent.

"Entrepreneurship is an integral part of our economy and I congratulate the winners announced today as role models for emerging businesses around New Zealand. The creativity and innovation shown by these winners is the x-factor we need to compete on the world stage.

"I give special congratulations to Seeby Woodhouse, the 27 year old director of Orcon Internet Ltd, who won the Young Entrepreneur of the Year award. Orcon was set up by Seeby when he was a University student and is now the largest New Zealand owned internet service provider.

"Seeby is a strong role model for young entrepreneurs. He has already entered the Enterprise New Zealand's Young Enterprise Hall of Talent after showing expertise in their school based enterprise education programme, and now is winning awards in abundance. Last week Seeby won the North Shore Business Excellence awards, the Massey University Excellence in Technology award and the Vector Best Emerging Business Award.

"Creating a culture of enterprise amongst our young people is clearly essential to supporting economic growth for the future. This is why New Zealand Trade and Enterprise sponsored the Young Entrepreneur category this year," Jim Anderton said.
