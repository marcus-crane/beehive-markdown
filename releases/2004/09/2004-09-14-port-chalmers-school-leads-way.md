Port Chalmers School students and teachers are leading the way in the use of a groundbreaking new assessment tool that gives parents in-depth information about students' progress, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

"I was impressed to hear about how Port Chalmers School uses the assessment tool asTTle to really improve students' skills in reading, writing and maths.

"Our government is really focusing on lifting reading and writing standards in our schools, and asTTle (Assessment Tools for Teaching and Learning) is an excellent means of showing students' progress, and pinpointing where students need more help.

"At mid-year report time students at this school lead conferences with parents and teachers and explain how well they think they are doing. This is great to see. Not only can they prove what they have done and show they are achieving, they can also tell parents what they need to learn next," Trevor Mallard said.

Trevor Mallard saw one of these presentations in action during a visit to the school today.

"I am told this is part of a school-wide initiative at Port Chalmers to give students the skills to be life-long learners. The school has developed an enquiry based learning model that encourages learners to know themselves and to know their strengths and weaknesses.

"Port Chalmers School has taken the initiative in its use of asTTle and students are the big winners," Trevor Mallard said.

AsTTle, a New Zealand invention, was rolled out to all schools in 2002. It enables teachers to:

- establish where children are at in reading, writing and mathematics;
- identify what the next learning needs may be, and change lessons accordingly; and
- accurately share children’s achievement data with parents.

"I would really encourage all parents to check asTTle out. It's attracting international attention. AsTTle is unique in that it gives parents and caregivers a much more accurate picture of how their child is doing early on so that any problems can be picked up and worked on before it’s too late," Trevor Mallard said.
