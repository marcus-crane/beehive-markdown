It is a special privilege to be asked to open the upgraded Wellington Regional Plastics, Maxillofacial and Burns Inpatients Unit at Hutt Hospital today, because it represents yet another proud day in New Zealand’s already proud history in terms of plastics surgery.  
I discussed much of this history in February this year when I opened the international conference on vascular anomalies in Wellington.  
I will not repeat much of what I said that day, but it would be really remiss of me to open this upgraded unit without paying tribute to the remarkable contribution New Zealanders have made to the development of plastic surgery.  
That contribution began with Sir Harold Gillies, commonly regarded as the father of plastic surgery. He and fellow New Zealanders Rainsford Mowlem and Sir Archibald McIndoe were responsible for much of the pioneering development of plastic and reconstructive surgery in response to the horrific injuries of the First and Second World Wars.  
These surgeons trained and inspired dozens of others who followed in their footsteps, and one of those was Frank Hutter who eventually went on to help establish plastic surgery units in Christchurch, Auckland and Wellington.  
The Wellington unit moved here to Hutt Hospital in 1952, with Frank Hutter heading it until his retirement in 1973.  
No history of the Unit would be complete without also acknowledging Max Lovie's colossal personal and professional influence over three decades leading the Unit. For much of the Unit's latter history, Max Lovie and Sister Trusler were its chief supports as the unit developed its role as the burns surgery service in the Central Region.

Today’s opening of the upgraded unit marks the completion of a $2.4 million project designed to bring the ward into the 21st century. The project has been delivered ahead of time and under budget and meets all relevant national and international standards.  
The unit has come a remarkable way since Frank Hutter’s arrival. It now serves about one million people, from Wairoa to the Upper South Island. In 2002 alone the unit saw 11,000 patients.  
That extraordinary figure speaks volumes for the skill and dedication of all who work here, and I want to thank you all for your continuing commitment.  
You can all be proud of what has been accomplished with this redevelopment, and I congratulate you for the way you have helped nurture these wonderful new facilities to fruition.  
I cannot name everyone who has contributed, but I particularly want to thank Hutt Valley DHB chair Peter Glensor and his board and chief executive Chai Chuah and his executive management team for developing and pushing such a strong business case.

Their work has been ably complemented by the hospital team including the general manager of hospital services, Warrick Frater, the unit’s director Swee Tan and clinical nurse manager Carolyn Braddock, and Hutt Valley DHB’s building and property services team, managed by Gordon Whyte and supported by Ray Wallace.

Thank you also to the design team of SKM Ltd, architect Rob Ansell, the engineering team led by Nick Waddington of SKM, the project management team of Arrow International, project director Bill Stockman, project manager on site Cedric Carter, and to Rider Hunt Ltd for quantity surveying.  
And, finally, thank you to all the staff, whose lives have been disrupted during construction. I hope the new facilities make your work even more satisfying in the future.  
I think we are all aware that hospital services fulfil a symbolic and practical role within a community. The more modern and sophisticated the services are, the more reassured the community is likely to feel that its health and wellbeing is being looked after.  
For that reason, there should be a great deal of reassurance around New Zealand communities at the moment, because the Government is well into the largest public hospital building programme ever undertaken in New Zealand, with $802 million dollars committed for capital spending over four years. That funding covers a wide range of projects, including Auckland, Waitakere and North Shore, Wellington and Kenepuru, Christchurch Women’s, Hawera, Waikato, Thames, Bay of Plenty, Kaitaia, Dunstan and Wairarapa hospitals.  
The reassurance factor aside, communities also take great pride in their hospital services, and that pride is reinforced when hospitals contain specialist and high-profile sections like this Wellington Regional Plastics, Maxillofacial and Burns Inpatients Unit.

Just last week, for example, national attention was briefly focused on the unit when Silver Fern Adine Harper was rushed here to see a plastic surgeon following a collision of heads on the opening day of the national netball championships in Palmerston North.

The good news is that she didn’t need any special attention for her injury, and I am sure we all wish her and ‘Goldie’ the very best for their marriage next month.

The Government is committed to developing plastic, reconstructive and burn treatment, and has earmarked $4.3 million as part of its commitment to a future national burn centre in Middlemore Hospital.

The national burn centre will become the flagship of a wider national burn service, and will require the support of all four regional burn units to manage the treatment of burn patients in a co-ordinated manner.

While development of the national burn centre is still some time away, the Wellington regional service, wherever it is finally located, will play an integral part in the new national burns service.

Plastic surgery is a discipline that was born in response to terrible injuries of violence, and as the terrorist attack in Bali reminded us, New Zealand is not immune to international tragedies and terrorism.

Australia has recently responded to the threat of terrorist activity by examining the way in which large numbers of burn victims are managed in the aftermath of disasters in Australia. New Zealand, too, has been involved in planning for emergency situations, including those that result in burn victims.

A national burn plan is, in fact, currently being developed to manage burn victims in a national emergency or where New Zealand is required to respond to an international emergency.

Key stakeholders within the sector will be encouraged to help develop the plan, and I am sure many people here today will have made a strong contribution by the time the plan is put in place at the beginning of next year.

Congratulations again to everyone who has played a part in this redevelopment. You deserve to be proud of what has been achieved.

Thank you again for asking me to share this special event. I am confident that this regional service will continue to enhance New Zealand’s remarkable reputation in this field, and add still more lustre to the exploits of this country’s famous pioneering surgeons.
