Staffing changes within the government transport sector are proceeding to plan following the review of the sector announced in June.

Around fifty policy roles are being transferred from the Land Transport Safety Authority (LTSA) and Transfund into the Ministry of Transport (MoT). The remaining, largely operation, roles of the LTSA and Transfund are being brought together in a new body, Land Transport New Zealand (LTNZ).

Dr. Jan Wright, Simon Mitchell and Bryan Jackson have been appointed to a Board to oversee the establishment of LTNZ.

As a result, changes are being made to the budgets of the MoT and LTNZ to reflect new staffing levels. The MoT's budget is paid from the Crown Account while that of LTNZ will come from the National Land Transport Fund (NLTF). Correspondingly, less motor spirit excise duty will be diverted from the Crown Account into the NLTF. There is no change to overall government spending on transport.

This will result in a change to the refund rate on duty paid fuel for qualifying consumers of less than one quarter of one per cent. This will apply from 01 October 2004 until 01 April 2005 when it will rise 28 per cent.
