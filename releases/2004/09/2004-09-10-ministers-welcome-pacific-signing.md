New Zealand has signed onto a programme to help Pacific Island countries benefit more from international trade, Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton and Aid Minister Marian Hobbs said today.

The ministers said they were pleased this trade facilitation programme was underway.

Mr Sutton said New Zealand’s funding would assist our neighbours to trade with each other and the rest of the world.

“We are committed to working with our partners in the Pacific Islands Forum family on lifting capacity to engage with the international economy. New Zealand will continue actively to seek ways to strengthen this relationship.”

The Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER) provides a framework for the gradual and progressive integration of the Forum Island Countries (FICs) into the international economy.

Capacity-building assistance is a key element of the PACER. At a meeting in Nadi, senior trade officials of the 11 Forum members party to PACER yesterday signed off on a Regional Trade Facilitation Programme (RTFP). The RTFP will focus over the next 5 years on building regional capacity in the key areas of Quarantine, Customs and Standards and Conformance.

New Zealand has provided an initial contribution of NZ$1m over three years to the Regional Trade Facilitation Programme.

New Zealand has also established a dedicated resource in the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to manage market access requests for agricultural products from the Pacific.

Ms Hobbs said the programme was a very positive development for the region.

“Our aid focus is on the Pacific, our neighbourhood, the area where we feel we can be most effective.

“NZAID is currently supporting many trade and development initiatives that are assisting Pacific countries to identify potential income sources and, most importantly, build jobs for their own people.”

NZAID currently provides $122 million annually to the Pacific region and provides $14 million specifically to support trade related programmes.
