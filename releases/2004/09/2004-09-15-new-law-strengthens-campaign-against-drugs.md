The Misuse of Drugs Amendment (No 3) Bill, which had its first reading in Parliament today, aims to strengthen the arm of Police and Customs to help them fight drug crime, says Associate Health Minister Jim Anderton.

"To turn the tide against drug problems in society, the Labour Progressive government is implementing a multi-pronged approach which gets tough on drug dealers, helps communities reduce the demand for drugs and also provides more treatment for the victims of drugs.

"The legislation considered by Parliament today fits largely into the government's efforts to toughen up on the supply of drugs," Jim Anderton, who chairs the Ministerial Committee on Drug Policy, told Parliament.

"The new law provides, for example, for a quicker way to implement 'presumption of supply' decisions, it cracks down on importers who aim to make illicit drugs out of any of the other 20 precursors listed in the legislation, with a penalty of up to seven years' imprisonment on conviction," the Progressive leader said.

"The use of controlled deliveries, where Customs tracks a package believed to contain Class A, B, or C drugs, will be extended to all precursors to allow authorities to arrest importers once they have taken possession of the parcel.

"The legislation particularly targets the precursors ephedrine and pseudoephedrine by allowing Police the ability to respond quickly as the Bill extends the powers of search and seizure without warrant to these drugs," the Progressive leader said.

The legislation also gives Police and Customs broader powers to undertake personal searches without warrants during a controlled delivery operation, in order to take instant action to recover  
evidence.
