Prime Minister Helen Clark has confirmed that two Israelis convicted and sentenced earlier this year have been deported from New Zealand today.

"At this point there have been no approaches from the Israeli government with respect to the actions for which the two Israelis were sentenced," said Helen Clark.

"The ball is in Israel's court."
