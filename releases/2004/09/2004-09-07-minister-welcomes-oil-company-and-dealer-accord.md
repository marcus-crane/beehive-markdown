The new agreement formally recognises the benefits of a cooperative relationship between the company and its retailers, and comes at the conclusion of several months of discussion between the two parties.

“The rapid rationalisation of service stations nationwide has been of concern to me for some time” Mr Duynhoven said. “I am encouraged to see that Caltex has acknowledged the competitive environment that retailers operate under, and has shown a commitment to the success of its retailer network.”

Over 200 sites operated by Caltex will come under the agreement. Caltex has also established a new decision making structure which includes a joint Caltex-Retailer advisory group.

“After several months working alongside the MTA to encourage the adoption of an industry wide code of conduct, I am very pleased to see Caltex has taken the initiative to voluntarily adopt its own accord.

“I would expect other companies to assess the benefits of introducing similarly mutually beneficial agreements with their retailer networks” Mr Duynhoven concluded.
