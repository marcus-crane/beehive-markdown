Energy Minister Pete Hodgson has released the latest edition of the Ministry of Economic Development’s Energy Data File, a comprehensive biannual volume of energy statistics.

The July 2004 edition of the Energy Data File includes statistics on energy supply, demand and prices and shows that:

·Total primary energy supply declined by 4 per cent in the calendar year 2003, over that for the calendar year 2002. This was primarily due to a 29 per cent decrease in indigenous oil supplies, and a 24 per cent drop in gas. These falls were offset by a 12 per cent increase in imported oil and oil products.

·Petrol consumption went up by 2.8 percent, and diesel by 3.8 per cent. The transport sector accounted for 42 per cent of total consumer energy. New Zealand is currently around 20 per cent self sufficient in oil, a drop of 8 per cent over the previous year.

·Coal production in the year to March 2004 increased by 1.5 per cent on the previous year to 5.0 million tonnes. Total utilisation, including exports, increased by 8 per cent to 5.3 million tonnes for the same period.

·Domestic gas production in the year to March 2004 declined by 26 per cent with 66 per cent coming from the Maui field. Remaining total gas reserves as at 1 January 2004 are reported as 1,462 PJ (gross). This figure is only slightly lower than that for the previous year and reflects upward reviews by operators of recoverable reserves in existing fields.
