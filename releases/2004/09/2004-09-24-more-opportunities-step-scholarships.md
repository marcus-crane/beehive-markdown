[Step Up Scholarships](http://www.studylink.govt.nz/financial-assistance/step-up-scholarship/step-up-scholarship.html) are being extended to enable more university students from low income backgrounds to study in a wider range of fields, Associate Education Minister Steve Maharey announced today in an [address to the New Zealand University Students Association](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F21099).

Step Up Scholarship for students entering degree level courses in human and animal health, offered for the first time this year, are being expanded to include students up to the age of 24. From 2006 Step Up Scholarships will also be available for school leavers studying science and technology.

“Step Up Scholarships have enabled 169 students to study in the fields of human and animal health,” Steve Maharey said. “These numbers were lower than we would have liked, but with the expansion of the age eligibility over 400 students are expected to benefit from Step Up Scholarships for human and animal health in 2005, with the number rising to over 600 in 2006.

“A further benefit is the reduction of the student contribution in these fields from $2,000 to $1,000. This will apply to both new and existing students.

“In 2006, a new category will provide 175 Step Up Scholarships for science and technology-based qualifications at degree level. The year’s lead-in time will allow Studylink, who administer the scholarships, to promote this new category to secondary school students.

"The rules for the science and technology Step Up Scholarships will be the same as the 2004 rules for health. The scholarships will be available to students in their final year of school or within one year of leaving. Recipients will pay a flat fee of $2,000 a year, irrespective of the tuition fee for their chosen course, with the scholarship paying the rest of normal tuition fees for that course.

“Step Up Scholarships are all about ensuring access for people from low-income backgrounds into strategic fields of study. The scholarships will help the students to participate in tertiary education and provide New Zealand with skills critical to the country’s success.”
