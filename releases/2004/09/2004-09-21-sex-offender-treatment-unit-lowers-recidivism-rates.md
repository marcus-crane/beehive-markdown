Corrections Minister Paul Swain today welcomed the success of a world-leading sex offender treatment programme, which has lowered recidivism rates and made the community safer.

Speaking at Te Piriti Special Treatment Unit's 10th anniversary at Auckland Prison today, Paul Swain said the recidivism rates for the 466 men who had gone through the programme in the last 10 years were 5.75 per cent and 4.7 per cent for Maori. These are among the best in the world and compare to a recidivism rate of 21 per cent for a group that did not complete the programme.

"As a result of this programme New Zealand children are safer and fewer men are returning to prison. This is due to the outstanding work done by the staff running this programme."

Paul Swain said more men were now applying to enter the programme after the government's tough new sentencing and parole legislation for serious offenders.

"As recently as 18 months ago the programme had to encourage inmates to apply. But that has changed since the tougher laws were introduced. These mean offenders risk spending their whole term in prison if they do not show they are prepared to address their offending and do something about it."

In addition the extended supervision regime, which allows sex offenders to be monitored for up to 10 years after release, will keep the community safer while also providing support for men to stop them reoffending.

Paul Swain said another programme, Kia Marama in Christchurch's Rolleston Prison, has had similar success in lowering reoffending rates.

Paul Swain said the two programmes were successful because they identified the highest-risk offenders and made them accept responsibility for their offending and the impact on their victims.

"These programmes are not an easy option. They are brutally honest and make men realise how much they have hurt people. This cuts reoffending."
