New Zealand's new ambassador to Spain will be career diplomat Geoff Ward, Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced today.

“Spain’s membership of the European Union, and its growing economic and political importance in Europe, mean New Zealand needs to make sure its voice is heard in Madrid,” Mr Goff said.

“The upcoming Americas Cup in Valencia will provide New Zealand with a platform to raise its profile in Spain. We’re also interested in pursuing closer cultural and people-to-people ties.

“In the last decade New Zealand and Spain have developed a healthy trade relationship. Spain is now our 23rd largest export market, and a prospective source of investment and tourists.”

Mr Ward, who will also be accredited to Morocco and the Holy See, will take up his new position in January. He is currently director of Consular Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and has previously served as New Zealand's Ambassador in Moscow and High Commissioner in Singapore.
