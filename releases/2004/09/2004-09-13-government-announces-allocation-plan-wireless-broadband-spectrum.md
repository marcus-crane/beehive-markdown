"Widespread availability of broadband infrastructure is a key objective of the government," Associate Minister of Communications David Cunliffe said today, announcing a spectrum allocation plan for fixed wireless access broadband services.

Fixed wireless access is a method of delivering broadband by radio links, in competition with wire-based services.

"Additional radio spectrum for broadband services will help achieve our goal of increasing broadband availability. The allocation plan complements work done to implement project PROBE," the Associate Minister said.

“The allocation will make additional spectrum available to parties wishing to provide wireless broadband services in specific areas, who may not have had the incentives or resources to acquire nationwide rights. In doing so it should promote competition in the broadband marketplace," said Mr Cunliffe.

The spectrum will be managed by the Ministry of Economic Development on behalf of the Crown. It consists of two blocks in the 3.5 GHz frequency band. Licences will be available for geographic areas based on territorial local authority boundaries.

Assignment of licences will be on a commercial basis. Some restrictions on use and eligibility are proposed to promote use of the spectrum in accordance with the Government’s objectives.

Details of the allocation plan are available from the Ministry’s website [www.med.govt.nz/rsm/spp/](http://www.med.govt.nz/rsm/spp/). The first allocation round is expected to be held early in 2005, once documentation is finalised.
