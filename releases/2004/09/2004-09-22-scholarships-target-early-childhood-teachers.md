Education Minister Trevor Mallard today announced a $41.4 million new scholarship scheme that will give assistance to people from low income backgrounds to train to be early childhood education teachers.

"The new scheme sits alongside the scholarship scheme I announced yesterday for teachers who train to teach in Maori medium language settings in early childhood, primary or secondary education and in Pasifika language in early childhood education.

"Together, both streams of scholarships represent a $53.8 million dollar investment over four years. The new scholarships are better than the scholarships they replace because more people are eligible, and the monetary awards are significantly higher. Thousands of scholarships could be awarded each year compared with 230 under the previous schemes, and some students could be eligible for as much as $20,000 in total.

" There is some suggestion that financial barriers are stopping unqualified early childhood education teachers from entering teacher education programmes to gain qualifications that lead to registration, so this scheme will play an important role in helping teachers get over this hurdle. Under the scheme they will be able to do their training part time, while continuing to work.

Under the low income scheme an estimated 680 new people would be eligible each year.

"Our government is committed to getting more and more young children into affordable, accessible and top quality early childhood education, and we need more qualified teachers to help in this incredibly important goal," Trevor Mallard said.

"Research shows that teacher qualifications are a key factor in delivering quality early childhood education. We also know that regular and high quality early childhood education makes a noticeable and positive impact on a student's educational success later on."

The package announced today also includes the extension of a number of initiatives currently available in the primary and secondary sectors to the early childhood education sector. The package includes:

- relocation grants for qualified early childhood teachers who move from specific areas of New Zealand or from overseas to areas where there is a high demand for more teachers;
- grants for qualified early childhood teachers not currently teaching who return to teaching in early childhood education;
- more study grants for qualified primary teachers to undertake early childhood teacher education. These grants will also be available for those already studying towards a primary teaching qualification who want to swap to an early childhood teaching qualification;
- funding to increase the number of incentive grants available to early childhood services to help them support staff in training, particularly in Auckland.

Applications for the 2005 scholarships will open in November. Information about the scholarships will be available through the TeachNZ website, [www.teachNZ.govt.nz](http://www.teachNZ.govt.nz)

Attached is the list of initiatives tackling teacher shortages in early childhood education.

**Tackling Teacher Shortages: Initiatives in Early Childhood Education**

**Other new initiatives**

***National Relocation Grants:*** grants worth up to $3,000 will be made available to qualified early childhood teachers who move from specific areas of NZ to areas where there is a high demand for more teachers.

***International Relocation Grants:*** grants worth up to $5,000 will be made available to qualified early childhood teachers currently living overseas who are willing to move back to NZ and take up an early childhood teaching position in areas where there is a high demand for more teachers.

***Recruitment Brokers:*** the Ministry of Education will provide recruitment broker services nationally.

***Incentive Grants:*** the pool of incentive grants, which are payments made to early childhood services to help them support staff who are studying, is to be expanded to provide more grants nationally and in particular a demand driven pool of grants for Auckland.

***Primary Study Grants:*** a demand driven pool of study grants will be made available for primary qualified teachers to train in early childhood teaching, and for those who are currently studying towards a primary teaching qualification and want to switch into early childhood teaching.

Approximately 1200 assessments have been undertaken to date.
