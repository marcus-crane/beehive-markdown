Prime Minister Helen Clark and Sir Paul Reeves have officially launched the process for [Hui Taumata 2005](http://www.huitaumata.maori.nz/), a three-day hui to be held in Wellington in March to look at ways to accelerate Maori growth.

The Hui Taumata 2005 is based on a similar Maori economic development summit called in 1984 by the former Minister of Maori Affairs Koro Wetere.

"Government Maori MPs and other Maori leaders have been talking for some time about the idea of marking the 1984 summit and taking stock of how far we have come and what the issues are for the future," said Helen Clark.

"Sir Paul is convening the [Steering Group](http://www.huitaumata.maori.nz/people/steering-group.asp) organising the Hui Taumata 2005, and I am optimistic it is going to be a very positive conference about the way ahead in Maori economic and social development."

Other members of the Steering Group are Dame Te Atairangikaahu, Professor Ngatata Love, Koro Wetere, Professor Linda Smith, Alison Thom, Rob McLeod, Tumu Te Heu Heu, Shane Jones, Rawiri Te Whare, Mark Solomon, Katerina Bennett, and Taria Tahana.

Administrative support is provided by a [Secretariat](http://www.vms.vuw.ac.nz/vuw/content/display_content.cfm?school=vms&id=2046) funded by Te Puni Kokiri and Victoria University, and the government has approved funding of $1,000,000 over two years.

Today the Steering Group has also unveiled the logo and launched the website for the Hui Taumata 2005. (www.huitaumata.maori.nz)

"Between now and the Hui Taumata in March 2005, the Steering Group will release research papers to stimulate discussion around the three key themes of Developing People, Developing Assets, and Developing Enterprise," said Helen Clark.

"In 1984 there were very few Maori economic and social initiatives, but now the Maori commercial asset base is estimated to be worth $9 billion, and participation rates in areas like tertiary education and the workforce have increased markedly."

"More Maori are in jobs, in apprenticeships, in education, there is better access to services like health and housing, and innovative Maori entrepreneurs are making a valuable contribution to the country's economic success."

"The Hui Taumata 2005 will look ahead to where Maori want to be in another twenty years and beyond, how they will enhance New Zealand's overall development, and how to channel resources and energy to best effect," said Helen Clark.
