Aid Minister Marian Hobbs expressed her thanks to the New Zealand Defence Force troops returning from Iraq today for their contribution to the rebuilding of the war-torn country.

“It is wonderful to see the New Zealand troops return safely.”

“The humanitarian and reconstruction projects they completed were desperately needed by the people of Iraq and in a time of hardship, their work has been invaluable. All New Zealanders can be very proud of what these NZDF personnel have achieved,” Marian Hobbs said.

“A NZAID funded project which the group worked on was the rebuilding of St Mary’s School in Basrah. The school was re-roofed, painted, fitted with new electric and plumbing systems, and furnished with air conditioning.”

Marian Hobbs also reiterated New Zealand’s commitment to continue helping the people of Iraq through NZAID.

"More recently NZAID’s focus has moved to how to support refugees returning to Iraq and the election process when it gets underway. $3 million has been allocated to UN agencies this year to support these initiatives."

Marian Hobbs also acknowledged the brave and determined work of non-governmental organisations in Iraq.

"NZAID is providing support and funding to a number of NGOs working in Iraq, including TEAR Fund, Salvation Army, Christian World Service, Caritas Aotearoa NZ, and the Save the Children Fund.

“An example of the work NZAID is supporting through NGOs is the Thalassaemia Unit at Ibn Al Baladi Hospital in Baghdad. Thalassaemia is a congenital blood disease endemic in the Middle East,” Marian Hobbs said.

“With NZAID’s help, TEAR Fund, the New Zealand-Iraqi Relief Trust, and the Umma Trust are providing the unit with medical supplies, equipment, educational material for staff and resources for patients and their families.”

NZAID is investigating what further assistance might be provided to Iraq. Options include projects on governance, law and order (police and security reform), electoral assistance, infrastructure rehabilitation, de-mining, and work in the agricultural sector.

NZAID has $10m allocated for conflict-related humanitarian and reconstruction work, including in Iraq and Afghanistan, in the current financial year. $1m has already been spent through NZ NGOs and their partners on alleviating the pressing humanitarian crisis in the Sudan.
