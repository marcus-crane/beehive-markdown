Barriers to business growth are among the issues owners and operators have been invited to discuss with the government's Small Business Advisory Group (SBAG).

A public meeting is to be held in Christchurch next week as an opportunity for the group to listen and learn about the real issues facing New Zealand's small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs).

Announcing this today, Minister for Small Business John Tamihere said he was proud of the way the group was "fronting up" to its peers.

“They’re being accountable,” he said. “They included a feedback form in their [recently published report](http://www.med.govt.nz/irdev/ind_dev/sbag/ar/2004/index.html). Now they’re holding public meetings to hear first-hand what SMEs think of the report and its recommendations."

He said the meeting was both a forum for businesses and a chance for the advisory group to listen and to learn about the real issues facing SMEs every day.

"They are interested in the things that are hindering business growth," the Minister said. "They can then pass on the concerns directly to the government, and get some action on them."

The Small Business Advisory Group is holding its first public meeting in Christchurch on Wednesday, September 22, from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. at Mancan House on the corner of Manchester Street and Cambridge Terrace.

SBAG is an independent group of nine business owners who provide the government with advice on initiatives relevant to small and medium-sized enterprises. SBAG present its views directly to the Minister for Small Business. The group recently delivered its first annual report to the government. The report included 19 recommendations designed to enhance the position of SMEs.
