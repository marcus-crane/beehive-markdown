The government will put an extra 460 teachers into secondary schools from the beginning of 2005, as part of an ongoing commitment to drive up education standards in our schools, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

"This initiative represents a huge investment in our commitment to ensuring better teaching and improved education standards for all our students. That's because the extra teachers will alleviate teacher workloads and reduce staffing pressures so teachers have more time to concentrate on actually teaching their students and helping them achieve," Trevor Mallard said.

"The extra teachers are over and above any extra teachers who will be required to match roll growth. At a cost of $111 million over four years, they are part of the government’s continuing commitment to improve school staffing. As a result, the total number of extra teachers in primary and secondary schools provided since 2001, over and above those needed for roll growth, will rise to 2,550 from the beginning of 2005. The estimated total ongoing annual cost is $160 million.

"By 2005 most secondary schools will be receiving an extra four teachers or more as a result of this initiative."

Secondary schools have already received an estimated extra 805 teachers over the last four years. The new staffing for 2005 raises that total to 1,265 teachers.  
The extra staffing will be allocated to secondary schools as:

- up to 0.3 full time teacher equivalents (FTTEs) in management base staffing to schools with rolls over 92; and
- up to 1.2 FTTEs in guidance base staffing to schools with students in years 9 to 15.

While the extra staffing is allocated as specific components of school staffing entitlement, school boards are free to use the staffing as they think best meets the needs of their students.

"The settlement of the Secondary Teachers’ Collective Agreement has given financial certainty on costs for the next three years, making this initiative possible. Announcements for other schools will be made when they are finalised."

Trevor Mallard said the initiative would put pressure on the supply of teachers but a range of strategies was in place to compensate. (see attached list) The enhanced conditions in the new secondary teachers’ collective agreement would also help recruitment and retention.

**New Secondary Teacher Supply Initiatives**

***TeachNZ scholarships:*** Scholarships will be available which pay study fees for people studying for degrees in te reo Maori, physics, chemistry, maths and technology and then studying to become a secondary teacher of one of these subjects. Students will be eligible for the duration of the degree course. Full time students will also be eligible for up to $10,000 to assist with other study costs. Students will be bonded and have to teach for the same amount of time as they received their scholarship for.

**Existing Secondary Teacher Supply Initiatives**

***Secondary Subject Trainee Allowance***: A $10,000 allowance (payable in three instalments) available to graduates and near-graduates who have appropriate qualifications and are committed to becoming secondary teachers in targeted subjects. Currently these are biology, chemistry, computing, English, maths, physics, te reo Maori and technology.

***National Relocation Grant:*** A grant of up to $3,000 available to teachers moving within New Zealand to ‘hard-to-staff’ positions or schools.

***National Relocation Allowance:*** Available to schools recruiting to a ‘hard-to-staff’ position, where the recruited teacher is eligible for the National Relocation Grant. $2,500 is paid to the school.

***International Relocation Grant:*** A grant of $5,000 for New Zealand trained teachers and $4,000 for overseas trained teachers living overseas to return or move to teaching positions in New Zealand. The grant for overseas trained teachers has been increased by $1,000.

***Finder’s Fee:*** Up to $3,000 paid to schools to assist with the costs of recruiting teachers from overseas, such as advertising and telephone calls. The teacher must be appointed to a ‘hard-to-staff’ position.

***Returning Teacher Allowance:*** This $2,000 allowance is available to secondary teachers returning to teach a targeted subject in a ‘hard-to-staff’ school.

***Loan Support:*** Secondary teachers of maths, te reo Maori and physics who meet certain criteria are eligible for $2,500 in each of their second, third and fourth years of teaching. Teachers of other target subjects who teach in ‘hard to staff’ areas can also receive loan support.

***Retraining courses:*** Funding is provided for free retraining courses that assist fully trained teachers who have been absent from teaching for some time back into teaching. Retraining courses are also available for primary teachers with appropriate subject qualifications to enable transition into secondary teaching.

***Priority and High Priority Teacher Supply Allowances, and the Staffing Incentive Allowance:*** These are allowances available to teachers working in areas which typically have difficulty recruiting staff.
