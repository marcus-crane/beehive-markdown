Every vote in the upcoming District Health Board elections will impact their outcome, Acting Health Minister Damien O’Connor said today.

This year’s elections feature an ‘at-large’ structure where voters have a say in the election of all seven elected members to their board – rather than just the one or two that are in their ward.

And with the new Single Transferable Vote (STV) voting system, where you rank candidates in order of preference, every vote can affect the overall result.

“When it comes to voting time you hear people saying ‘what difference will my vote make?’ But in this year’s DHB elections every vote really will matter,“ said  
Mr O’Connor. “That’s why it’s important to rank as many candidates as you can on the voting paper.”

Voting packs for local government and the DHB elections start arriving in the post tomorrow, September 17.

Voters can elect seven members to each of the 21 DHBs, with the Health Minister appointing up to four more per board.

Mr O’Connor said voting in the DHB elections gave everyone a chance to have their say in the way health services were delivered.

“What you want from a board isn’t always what someone else wants. That’s why we need to hear from as many of you as possible to ensure boards truly reflect the diversity of the communities they serve.”

Voting packs will include profile statements from candidates as well as instructions on how to vote using STV. The DHB elections voting paper will be a pale yellow colour.

Postal voting closes at midday on October 9.
