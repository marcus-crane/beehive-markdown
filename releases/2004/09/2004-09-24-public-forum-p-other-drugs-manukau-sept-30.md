The national roll out of public forums on P, alcohol and other drugs promised by Associate Health Minister Jim Anderton in June begins next week in Manukau City.

“Feedback on the pilot forum held in Tauranga in June was that it was useful for communities, community workers and for local and central government politicians. It was a valuable opportunity to share ideas and information in the campaign to develop strategies to defeat drugs in our communities," the Progressive leader said.

The Progressive leader will chair a public meeting in Manukau on Thursday, September 30, followed by a meeting in Waitakere City on October 14. Public meetings will follow in coming months in different locations around the country, the details of which will be released as finalized.

"I will be leading a panel at each forum consisting of agency representatives to outline the “whole-of-government” approach to tackling drug and alcohol problems. There has been a lot of concern around the problem of “P” but alcohol abuse is New Zealand’s number one drug problem and I expect many questions from the floor on these issues"

The public meetings aim to inform the public on what is being done to secure our borders, how the police are working to enforce the law in the drugs and alcohol area, what prevention strategies can be used in communities particularly focusing on the Community Action Youth and Drugs programmes, the public health approaches and treatment availability.

The forums will be scheduled, for the most part, in locations where there is a Community Action on Youth Alcohol & Drug programme in place. There is currently a CAYAD programme in Clendon/Manurewa.

Those confirmed for the Manukau forum panel are:  
Simon Williamson - Manager Drug Investigations- Customs  
Paul Stanley - Project Manager Community Action Youth and Drugs (CAYADS) Health  
Robert Steenhuisen - Regional Manager Community Alcohol and Drug Services-Health  
Christine Kalen - CEO Odyssey House  
Vivien Knowles - Manager Student Support Education  
Inspector Alan Shearer – Manukau Central Commander - Police

Thursday 30 September 7.30pm at the Manukau Room, Manukau City Council, 31 - 33 Wiri Station Road, Manukau.
