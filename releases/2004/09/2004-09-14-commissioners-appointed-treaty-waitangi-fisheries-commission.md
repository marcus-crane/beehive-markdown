Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia today announced the appointment of 13 Commissioners to the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission. They are:

Shane Jones, Craig Ellison, Ken Mason, Naida Glavish, June Jackson, Archie Taiaroa, Hon Koro Wetere, Wira Gardiner, Dame Georgina Kirby, Rangimarie Parata Takurua, Rob McLeod, Maui Solomon and Toro Waaka.

"The role of the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission will largely be to ensure that there is an effective transition to Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited", the Minister said.

The Maori Fisheries Bill (2004) currently before Parliament is expected to complete its remaining stages shortly.

"Once the Bill is enacted I will be required to appoint six or seven directors of Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited (TOKMTL), the successor body to the present Commission. I have made these Commissioner appointments now to ensure that I have a full suite of Commissioners to consider for TOKMTL. The appointments to TOKMTL will be the first and last appointments I make as Minister to TOKMTL. The Electoral College established by the Bill will make all future appointments.

The Commissioners will be expected to contribute to the smooth transition of the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission to Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited. The efforts and work of the Commission over the last few years has made it possible for Maori to be in a position to benefit from the allocation of our fisheries assets.

"This is a watershed moment for Maori and I congratulate all who have been and continue to be involved in giving full effect to the landmark fisheries settlement. I want to pass on my personal congratulations to all the Commissioners; their combined experience brings a unique mix of skills to the Commission at this crucial time.
