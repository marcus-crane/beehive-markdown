Cabinet has made additional funds available to enable the Corrections Department to manage record inmate numbers, Corrections Minister Paul Swain said today.

Paul Swain said the decision follows negotiations between the department and staff to allow the capacity of several prisons to increase. Employment agreements currently limit prison capacities.

The deal, which is being considered by staff, will provide about an extra 180 beds through double-bunking at up to six prisons including Mt Eden, Hawkes Bay, Rimutaka and Invercargill. Staff at prisons where the capacity is exceeded would receive an allowance.

"This is a temporary measure to get us over the peak that traditionally occurs in October and November. The prison muster is more than 6900, far in excess of all predictions. I appreciate the cooperation staff have shown on this issue"

The department has already provided an additional 500 beds through various measures, including using its 4 per cent operational buffer and reopening older units.

Paul Swain said the situation will improve when four new facilities open in the next few years. These are:  
·Northland – opening 2005  
·Auckland women's – opening 2006  
·Otago – opening 2007  
·Springhill – opening 2007.

Paul Swain said the current muster situation is tight but manageable.

"The government responded to the 1999 referendum on National's inaction on law and order during its time in office. Tougher sentencing, bail, parole and preventive detention laws were introduced and police resolution rates have increased. More criminals are being caught and spending longer in prison. This is what the public wanted."
