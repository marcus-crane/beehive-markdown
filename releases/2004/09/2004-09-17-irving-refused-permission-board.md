David Irving presented at the Qantas check-in in Los Angeles today and was refused permission to board his flight to New Zealand, Associate Immigration Minister Damien O'Connor said.

Damien O'Connor said Mr Irving's status as a prohibited person under the [Immigration Act (S7)](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=272342&hitsperheading=on&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&jump=a1987-074%2Fs.7&softpage=DOC#JUMPDEST_a1987-074/s.7) means that he cannot enter New Zealand without a special direction, and no special direction has been granted.
