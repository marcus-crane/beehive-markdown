Governing councils of tertiary education institutions need to think carefully about how much they really need to increase student fees so that any fee increases are kept as low as possible, Associate Education Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Under the [fee maxima](http://www.tec.govt.nz/funding/ttf/keypolicydevelopments/fee_maxima/fee_maxima.htm) scheme, which came into effect this year, tertiary institutions are able to raise fees no more than five percent per year, [except in exceptional circumstances](http://www.tec.govt.nz/funding/ttf/keypolicydevelopments/fee_maxima/exemption_guidelines.htm) and with the approval of the Tertiary Education Commission.

“Councils are starting to set fees for next year and I urge them to carefully assess the options for fee increases before they make final decisions,” Steve Maharey said.

“While they are able to increase fees up to five percent, I would expect that in most circumstances fee increases don’t need to be any higher than cost of living increases.

“I have been asked by students around the country to attend fee setting meetings, but it would not be appropriate for me to be there. Fee setting is the responsibility of the councils of tertiary institutions. They know the circumstances of their institution and are best placed to weigh up all the relevant considerations.”
