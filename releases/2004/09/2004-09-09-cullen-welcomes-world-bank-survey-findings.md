Finance Minister Michael Cullen today welcomed the World Bank survey, which ranks New Zealand top of a list of 145 countries for ‘ease of doing business.’

Dr Cullen says “this is international evidence that the Government is committed to a supportive business environment with a flexible and resilient economy.”

The report ranks New Zealand first in terms of ease of doing business ahead of the United States, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Australia.

The World Bank looked at the cost and time taken to start-up a business, to hire and fire workers, protect investors, register a property, enforce contracts and close a business.

“The Government is committed to continuing the success of the New Zealand economy through supportive business policies which promote growth and innovation.”
