During today's visit to the flood damaged area of Awatapu, Associate Minister of Housing Dover Samuels stressed that reinstating Maori families back into their homes is a top concern.

"Many of these families have young children. A home is the foundation of learning, stability and growth and it is important to recognise that the household of a family is the vital base of family life".

Whakatane has a high Maori population and around 72 percent of the principal tenants renting Housing New Zealand homes are Maori. In Awatapu, about 700 homes were evacuated, including 13 HNZ homes – 12 of which were Maori families.

Mr Samuels met with officials from Ngati Awa Social & Health Services Trust, Te Puni Kokiri and the local Council to discuss the issues around assisting Maori families getting back into their homes and is to report back to government.

"While it is good that government responded immediately to the emergency aspect of the flooding and agencies and whanau worked together to support those affected, it is now a concern that some families are still unable to return to their homes".

"I'm here to talk face to face with some of those families that are still suffering from the effects of the floods and the experience of not being able to return to their homes. If I find there is a need for further assistance or support I will look into how to make this happen.

“Maori homes often have extended family coming and going and are a base for the wider hapu, the effect on Maori of losing their whare is really significant" Dover Samuels said.
