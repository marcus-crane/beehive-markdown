Commerce Minister Margaret Wilson today announced the release of a discussion paper, “Information Sharing by the Commerce Commission”.

The Ministry of Economic Development is seeking views on a proposal to allow the commission to share commercially sensitive information with overseas competition authorities, subject to appropriate safeguards. Currently, the commission’s ability to share information is constrained by common law, the Commerce Act 1986 and the Privacy Act 1993.

“It is crucial that the commission’s ability to enforce competition laws is not impeded by the increasingly international nature of transactions,” Margaret Wilson said. “Activities in other jurisdictions may have important implications for markets in New Zealand and, equally, information held in New Zealand may prove vital to a foreign agency’s investigation.”

The paper forms part of the work programme agreed to by CER Ministers in 2003, aimed at bringing New Zealand and Australia closer together in the area of competition law, policy and enforcement.

Submissions will be considered by the Ministry of Economic Development before it makes recommendations to the government on possible legislative reform.

The discussion paper is available from the [Ministry of Economic Development](http://www.med.govt.nz/bus_pol/cc-info-sharing) . Submissions on the paper should be sent to:

Jessica White  
Regulatory and Competition Policy Branch  
Ministry of Economic Development  
P O Box 1473  
WELLINGTON  
Email: [competition.policy@med.govt.nz]()

The closing date for submissions on the paper is Tuesday 9 November 2004.
