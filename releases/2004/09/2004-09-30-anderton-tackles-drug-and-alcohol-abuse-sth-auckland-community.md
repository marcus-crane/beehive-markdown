"The commitment, vision and determination of people working at the coalface in communities, day after day, is essential in the fight against drug and alcohol abuse," Progressive Leader, Jim Anderton said.

He was speaking at a public forum on 'P, alcohol and other drugs' held in South Auckland this evening. It is the second in a nationwide tour.

"Drug and alcohol abuse prevention is a top priority for the Progressive Party because of the pervasive damage such abuse causes in our communities. We believe Parliamentarians must take leadership in setting a strong example for our youth in particular. Mixed messages about decriminalisation of cannabis or youth drinking culture threaten not only their health and wellbeing but also their future as successful adults.

Progressive bids for budget funding of over $20 million have been won to support Jim Anderton's work as Associate Minister of Health and Chair of the Ministerial Committee on Drug Policy.

"This forum is a call to the communities to take action.

"The Government has provided $2.55 million more for fifteen new community action on youth and drug programmes (CAYADs), that get the community involved in the fight against drug and alcohol abuse. Those in the frontline in Clendon-Manurewa are working together with a plan tailored to their community.

"It takes work to get behind the most vulnerable in this community. It takes community-wide effort to turn the tide on P and other illegal dangerous drugs. I am working with you to support you in that effort with programmes to reduce supply, reduce demand and to treat drug users. Together, we will achieve safer and healthier communities," Jim Anderton said.
