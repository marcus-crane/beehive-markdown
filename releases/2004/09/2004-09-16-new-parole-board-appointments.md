The appointment of seven new members to the New Zealand Parole Board will provide greater flexibility and support in managing its large workload, says Attorney-General Margaret Wilson.

“The initial estimates for Board hearings put them at 3,500 to 4000 a year,” she said. “Last year there were 9000 hearings.”

The new appointees are Judge James Rota, Judge Arthur Tompkins, Professor Philip Brinded, Darlene Cullen, Richard Lewis, Ievaivai Nua and Patrick Tavai.

Judge Rota was appointed a Judge of the Maori Land Court in 1990 and a District Court in 1993. He is currently based in Auckland. Judge Tompkins of Whangarei was appointed as a District Court Judge in 1997. Both Judges will serve as panel convenors.

Professor Brinded is currently Clinical Director, Forensic Psychiatry Service, Canterbury District Health Board and a Clinical Associate Professor with the Department of Psychological Medicine, Christchurch School of Medicine. In 1988 he was part of the assessment team for the Mason Commission of enquiry, performing bi-cultural assessments on inmates at Paremoremo Prison.

Darleen Cullen has been a Tenancy Adjudicator and Mediator in Auckland for the past 17 years.

Richard Lewis of Christchurch has 17 years experience in the Criminal Justice sector in the United Kingdom and New Zealand, and has had extensive involvement in planning and running the Kia Marama risk management group.

An experienced social worker, Ievaivai Nua has spent eight years with the Probation Service in Auckland. He has also worked in youth justice in the United Kingdom.

Patrick Tavai of Tokoroa has been employed by the Department of Corrections at Mount Eden Prison as a facilitator and therapist in the pilot Saili Matagi Violence Prevention Programme.
