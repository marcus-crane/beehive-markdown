The Transport and Industrial Relations Committee today reported back to Parliament on the Employment Relations Law Reform Bill.

The Committee’s report recommends a number of changes to the Bill. Labour Minister Paul Swain said he welcomes the recommendations, which help strike a balance between promoting collective bargaining and the need to maintain the integrity of individual choice.

“The select committee has improved the Bill and I thank them for their efforts. The recommendations also address some concerns that organisations have raised with me about what the provisions in the Bill might mean in practice."

The select committee's key recommendations:

- Clarify the rules around 'passing on', (where collectively agreed terms and conditions are passed on to employees on individual employment agreements).
- Clarify that employers can pay employees on individual agreements the same rates as those on collective agreements, providing bargaining has been carried out in good faith.
- Remove the requirement in the duty of good faith to be ‘supportive' in every case, recognising that parties are entitled to pursue their own interests.
- Give guidance on when confidential information may be withheld, without breaching good faith.
- Remove the requirement to consider and balance the 'legitimate interests' of the employee and employer in dismissal situations (personal grievances).
- Clarify that the list of employees considered most at risk in restructuring situations includes employees working in ‘food catering services’ not ‘food services’. Tighten the process for adding to the list by requiring extensive consultation with affected parties and the Labour Minister.
- Clarify what could be considered to be a ‘genuine reason’ not to conclude a collective agreement.
- Remove the specific obligation to attend the first meeting of bargaining for a multi employer collective agreement.
- Remove proposals to update equal pay laws, which will now be considered with the government’s pay and employment equity initiatives.

Paul Swain said many small employers had concerns about the procedure for dismissals. "Once this Bill is passed I will be looking at ways to give better guidance around these issues."

The select committee also recommended that the Labour Minister amend the Bill so employers and unions could enter into mutually agreed bargaining fee arrangements allowing collective terms and conditions to be passed on to non-union employees. Non-union employees would have the opportunity to opt out of the arrangement.

Paul Swain said he agreed with the recommendation. "I will shortly be introducing an amendment proposing that where a union and an employer agree on a bargaining fee arrangement, affected employees would take part in a ballot to decide whether the bargaining fee arrangement should operate in their workplace, and non-union employees who do not want to pay a bargaining fee would be able to opt out of the arrangement. Strikes and lockouts over bargaining fee arrangements would be prohibited."

Paul Swain said the government intended to have the Bill in force by 1 December 2004.
