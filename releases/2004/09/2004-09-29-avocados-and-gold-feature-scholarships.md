Projects as diverse as seismic exploration for Otago gold and the chilling of avocados are among 22 [Enterprise Scholarships](http://www.tec.govt.nz/funding/scholarships/enterprise.htm) worth more than $550,000 over three years.

All 22 projects have significant commercial potential, with companies supporting the scholarship winners contributing dollar for dollar to the Enterprise Scholarships funding provided by the [Tertiary Education Commission](http://www.tec.govt.nz) (TEC).

Associate Education Minister Steve Maharey welcomed the wide range of projects put forward by industry.

“Some of New Zealand’s leading companies and agencies are behind applications approved in this round, including Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Solid Energy New Zealand, AgResearch and Fulton Hogan,” he said.

“Enterprise Scholarships are a very successful part of the Government’s [*Bright Future* package](http://www.tec.govt.nz/funding/scholarships/index.htm) that has supported more than 250 students to conduct research since the scheme started in 1999.

“The fact that 12 of the successful applicants are studying for doctorates, nine for masters and one at level 7 of the [National Qualifications Framework](http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/framework/), shows the programme is reaching the top level of students, as originally intended.”

Enterprise Scholarships aim to:

- Signal the value of high-level intellectual skills and abilities and their importance to New Zealand’s future
- Assist in focusing research into areas likely to help create the knowledge economy of the future and that are relevant to private companies
- Encourage stronger education/company linkages by providing incentives to tertiary educations to actively seek stronger alliances with companies
- Increase the supply of highly trained researchers and highly skilled graduates.
