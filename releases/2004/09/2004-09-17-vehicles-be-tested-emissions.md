Around 20,000 vehicles will be checked to work out how much pollution the country's vehicle fleet produces, as the government prepares to introduce emissions requirements for all vehicles from the middle of 2006.

A pilot testing programme is being carried out between now and the end of this year in ten centres around New Zealand as part of the policy development process.

To launch the programme, Judith Tizard today took a Ministerial Services car through a series of tests to check its emissions levels. The tests were carried out on equipment at the University of Auckland’s vehicle research laboratory where one series of the tests is being done.

“Over the next couple of months thousands of vehicles around the country will go through specific checks to provide information on how much and what sort of emissions they are producing,” said Judith Tizard.

“Motorists who get their warrant of fitness or certificate of fitness at a garage or testing station involved in the pilot testing programme will be invited to get their vehicle emissions checked.

“This pilot test is free, and motorists will find out valuable information about the sort of pollution their vehicle is producing and simple steps they can take to reduce their emissions."

Judith Tizard says vehicle emissions are a significant contributor to air pollution and are detrimental to the health of New Zealanders.

"It is estimated that approximately 400 people die prematurely each year from exposure to vehicle emissions, and many more suffer illnesses such as respiratory illness and heart disease."

"To reduce pollution from emissions, the government is requiring higher fuel quality, introducing standards for new and imported vehicles and encouraging all drivers to maintain their vehicles better."
