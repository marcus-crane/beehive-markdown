Immigration Minister Paul Swain today said the government's skilled migrant policy was attracting the skilled workers the country and economy needs.

He said the Skilled Migrant Category (SMC) ensures New Zealand gets a wide range of skilled workers such as builders, electricians and plumbers.

"The policy is very clear. At a selection point of 100 people are skilled migrants. That’s why 100 points was set as the minimum quality standard when the policy was introduced.

"The selection point was set deliberately high when SMC was introduced so it could be bedded in. This meant we could control the numbers and allowed us to ensure the system for processing applications was in place properly. The selection point will not drop below 100."

Paul Swain said applicants need skills, qualifications and work experience. In addition they need good English, character and health. Without these criteria, 100 points will not be reached. This ensures they are skilled migrants.

Examples of applicants selected at 100 points are:  
·Builder  
·Civil engineers  
·Nurses  
·Fitter and turner  
·Plumbing and heating engineer  
·Fitter/welder boilermaker  
·R&D chemist  
·Software engineer  
·Maths teacher  
·IT security analyst  
·Economist  
·Computer system auditor  
·Vet.

"Some people with 100 points already have jobs, and they will get residence. Those with 100 points who don’t have jobs do not get automatic residence, unlike the previous National government's system. If they do not have a job offer, they have two years to get a suitably skilled job. These people only get residence once they get a skilled job."
