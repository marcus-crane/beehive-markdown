Development specialist and former MP, Dr Marilyn Waring, will undertake a ministerial review of NZAID, the government's aid agency, Aid Minister Marian Hobbs announced today.

"I am delighted Dr Waring, who heads Massey University's Public Policy Programme, has accepted the role," Marian Hobbs said. "We're pleased to have someone of her calibre. She has extensive experience with growth and development issues, women’s work, economics and human rights.

"The review is very important. It will check that NZAID is achieving the government’s aim of a more effective aid programme.

"In addition to reviewing operations in Wellington, Marilyn will visit NZAID programmes in the Pacific, assessing the important work that NZAID is doing on the ground in New Zealand's own region."

NZAID became a semi-autonomous agency within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade on 1 July 2002. Before this New Zealand’s official development assistance was delivered through the ministry.  
NZAID's primary focus is the Pacific region where New Zealand has close links.

The agency is also working in Asia and Latin America, and is assisting with reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan.  
NZAID's main areas of support are basic education, basic health, good governance and developing the poorer countries' potential to generate income and jobs for their own people.

New Zealand's aid budget is $260 million a year. The review will be completed by May 2005.
