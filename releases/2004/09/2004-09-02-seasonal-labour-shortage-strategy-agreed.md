Labour and Immigration Minister Paul Swain today announced a series of measures to address labour shortages in the horticulture industry.

The measures follow a meeting recently between ministers, government agencies and industry representatives. Paul Swain attended along with Associate Social Development and Employment Minister Rick Barker and Associate Immigration Minister Damien O'Connor.

Cabinet has agreed a three-stage plan to address the issue in the short, medium and long term. Industry cooperation and commitment is vital as is a focus on getting New Zealanders into the industry. Paul Swain said the use of illegal immigrants is not acceptable.

The medium and long term focus is on government and industry working more closely together. Industry would be required to show what steps had been taken to continuing to show good employment and recruitment practices. Focus would also be on improving productivity and training workers.

Paul Swain said the government recognises that overseas workers will be needed this upcoming season to fill labour shortages. These people could be used through working holiday schemes, variations of conditions of visitors already here, recruiting offshore and using the Samoa and Pacific Access Category quotas. Changes to the stand-down period for unemployment benefit would mean more New Zealanders are also available to work in the industry.

He said immigration could be used to meet labour needs but only when proven that there were no suitable New Zealanders available to fill the vacancies.

Cabinet has also agreed for the Department of Labour to establish four mobile field workers to work with the seasonal industry to provide targeted immigration services. The government will be meeting with industry representatives during the coming months to develop the medium and long term strategy that will benefit the industry and the New Zealand workforce.
