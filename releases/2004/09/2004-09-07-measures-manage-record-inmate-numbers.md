The Corrections Department is managing the unexpectedly large increase in inmate numbers, Corrections Minister Paul Swain says.

The government responded to the 1999 referendum on law and order by introducing tougher sentencing, bail, parole and preventive detention laws. In addition, the government has also given police more resources to fight crime, resulting in police catching more criminals.

While it was expected that inmate numbers would rise, latest figures show that there is an extra 900 people in prison than the Ministry of Justice predicted 18 months ago. The department is managing this additional increase with the cooperation of police and the Department of Courts.

Four new facilities will add to the prison service's capacity. These are:  
·Northland – opening 2005  
·Auckland women's – opening 2006  
·Otago – opening 2006  
·Springhill – opening 2007.

Paul Swain said the department was considering increasing the capacity of some of these new facilities, to take into account the latest forecasts.

Corrections have used other measures to cope with the higher numbers in the short-term, which has provided about an extra 500 beds. These include:  
·Using the department's 4 per cent operational buffer  
·Increased double-bunking at Auckland Central Remand and Rimutaka prisons  
·Reopening the Larch unit at Rangipo prison  
·Adding cells to Waikeria prison's Nikau unit for women.

In addition, increasing capacity of existing facilities is being considered.

"Police and court cells are also used when needed. This is not ideal but Corrections staff and police have performed very well in difficult circumstances. The situation will improve markedly when the four new facilities open in the next few years."
