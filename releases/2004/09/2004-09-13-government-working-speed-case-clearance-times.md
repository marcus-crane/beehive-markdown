Pressure being placed on the court system by the volume of cases is being addressed through a series of initiatives that will improve the efficiency of court processes, says Courts Minister Rick Barker.

"Thirteen separate initiatives have been set in place to promote greater efficiency and increase the speed with which cases are heard, while still protecting the interests of justice.

"The initiatives range from increasing the number of judges, greater emphasis on mediation where appropriate, the streamlining of pre-trial procedures, and the introduction of technology to speed up courtroom proceedings.

“In the High Court we’ve moved to a more effective form of case monitoring and management, and improved pre-trial hearing processes.

“District Courts, where the pressure is greatest, are benefiting from targeted deployment of judges, more summary court sittings, special hearings to process bulk caseloads, stronger case management and streamlined processes.

"The Ministry of Justice is also working on drafting legislation to simplify criminal procedures, in line with earlier recommendations from the Law Commission.

"The government is currently considering a request from the bench to increase the number of judges and legislation has recently been passed to increase the number of High Court Judges from 42 up to 55 and District Court judges from 123 up to 140.

“Courts are getting busier because better legislation, more police, and higher crime resolution rates mean more criminals are being caught and charged, despite the falling crime rate. Some of the jury trials are more complex involving scientific evidence and interpreters.

"It is in the interests of all users of the court system, and in the wider interests of justice, that cases proceed as quickly and as smoothly as possible. That is why the government set aside $73 million in this year's Budget to address some of the pressure that courts are facing.

"The government will also shortly release its response to the [Law Commission's report](http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/reports.htm) *Delivering Justice for All*, which included a number of recommendations on possible changes to New Zealand's court structure," Mr Barker said.

**Ministry of Justice programme initiatives**

**More judicial appointments**  
Judicial Matters Bill to allow additional judges to be appointed where required. Judges appointed on temporary warrants have been given permanent warrants, resulting in an increase of four judges.  
Ministry of Justice is working to provide the administrative support required by any additional judges that are appointed.  
Appointing more judges will increase the number of cases that can be dealt with; which in turn should reduce delays in cases being heard.

**Non-judge led mediation pilot**  
Additional funding of $1.56 million was provided in the Budget for a two-year pilot using mediators, rather than judges, in four Family Courts to work with families involved in custody, access or guardianship proceedings.  
The pilot will test whether the use of mediation increases the time judges have to deal with other Family Court matters, or be deployed (where appropriate) to deal with criminal cases.

**Enhanced court room technology**  
Efficient evidence recording – additional funding of $30 million over four years in the 2004 Budget will see the introduction of digital audio technology to record evidence in the High and District Courts. Video conferencing – evidence by video conferencing will be piloted in selected High and District Court trials in 2004/05.  
Enables evidence to be given at normal speaking speed, and reduces waiting time for transcripts. Estimated 12 per cent saving in time needed to hear cases. Giving evidence at normal speaking speed will improve the courtroom experience for complainants, witnesses and defendants.  
The impact of video conferencing on the efficiency and effectiveness of hearings will be evaluated at the end of the pilot.

**Summary Court Strategy Group**  
The Ministry of Justice and the Chief District Court Judge have established a Strategy Group to address the criminal summary jurisdiction, which has become a significant area of pressure. The group is investigating a range of initiatives to streamline processes and increase efficiency. It is overseeing the Wellington District Court list pilot (below).  
*Note*: Summary courts generally operate on a judge-alone basis, and generally hear minor offences – an area of considerable pressureStrategy group will improve the ability of the ministry and judiciary to identify initiatives and monitor their effectiveness in addressing court delays.

**Wellington criminal list pilot**  
Last year Wellington District Court began trailing a more streamlined process for managing defendants through court appearances. The pilot will assist in identifying best practice for pre-trial administrative matters with a view to nationwide implementation in 2005/06

**Reduced waiting time for defendants appearing in court.**  
Greater certainty for defendants in the processing of their case.

**More summary courts in Auckland**  
From July, judicial time has been re-allocated to provide additional sitting time in the Criminal Summary Jurisdiction in the Auckland District Court. Has allowed the court to increase the number of Criminal Summary Courts from four to five per day.Increases the numbers of cases that can be heard and disposed of in Auckland.  
Over time it is expected to reduce the number of cases at hand, and reduce the time cases are waiting for a hearing.

**Special call-over sessions**  
A two-week call-over session to hear summary court cases with 'not guilty' pleas was held in the Auckland District Court from late July. Each case was examined; defendants given the opportunity to change plea (a special sentencing court was set up to provide prompt sentencing) and obstacles to a defended hearing were addressed. Two additional fixture courts have been rostered for Auckland for six weeks beginning in October. A total of 857 cases were disposed of, with 307 cases proceeding to trial.

**Review of Status Hearings**  
District Court Judges have undertaken a review of the judicial management of status hearings. The review identified a number of factors likely to result in cases being resolved at a status hearing. The Chief Judge is considering how to implement the findings of the review. The Ministry of Justice has also carried out research on the efficacy of status hearings. If successful, these changes are expected to result in some cases being resolved sooner. Reforms are being considered to improve the value of pre-trial hearings while protecting the rights of all parties.

**Preliminary Hearings Reform**  
Reforms are being considered that will see indictable cases automatically proceed to trial after written briefs of evidence are filed, unless there is a successful application for oral evidence to be heard. The purpose of the proposed reform is to remove a step in the process where this can occur without undue disadvantage, thus avoiding unnecessary court time and demands on victims and witnesses.  
The intention of the reform is to remove a step in the process for indictable cases, where this can occur without undue disadvantage to the defendant, which will cut court time and benefit victims and witnesses.  
Has the potential to reduce the number of preliminary (depositions or committal) hearings. This will reduce pressure on courtrooms, rather than judges, as most hearings are presided over by JPs or Community Magistrates.  
Should result in cases proceeding through the committal stage more quickly, and therefore some being resolved more rapidly.

**Rapid deployment of Judges**  
In June the District Court established a team of jury trial judges who can be deployed to any Court experiencing a bulge in cases.Should result in some cases being disposed of earlier, and has potential to prevent an excessive build up of cases in some courts.

**Improved information management**  
Rollout of the Case Management System (CMS) was completed last November. The Ministry of Justice is now gaining the benefits of improved management information from the database.  
CMS provides comprehensive information on cases for court administrators, including prompts on procedures and details regarding specific cases. It can be used in-court to schedule further hearings, and to transfer documents between courts. Improved information on case flows will increasingly enhance the capacity of local, regional and national groups such as the District Court Management Team and the District Court Management Committee (a combined meeting of the Judges and Ministry) to view caseloads and the age of cases and determine the need for changes.

**Strengthening District Court case management**  
Caseflow and case management have been progressively introduced into the District Courts over recent years. This year the focus is on strengthening case management capability by:

- Implementing the recommendations of a national review of operational practices to ensure that there is greater consistency, and that best practice is followed nation-wide.
- Developing and delivering case management training focussed on best practice
- improved consistency of case management practice. Regular monitoring at a national level of caseloads and numbers of cases at risk of undue delay is expected to minimise delays caused by unnecessary adjournments due to factors such as:
- the parties involved;
- witnesses not available;
- special arrangements not being made;
- late changes made in pleas.

**High Court case management**  
High Court jury trial cases currently in the District Court (where all cases are first filed) are now being monitored from entry, particularly in terms of time to depositions (and from there to committal). The Ministry informs all parties when it looks as if a case will take a long time to come to the High Court. The High Court management committee and Court of Appeal management committee have regular meetings with agencies such as Crown Law, the Law Society, the Bar Association, Police Prosecution, Legal Services Agency and, more recently, ESR. Similar meetings are sponsored by the Higher Courts management team quarterly at a national level and monthly at the local level. High Court judges have an agreed practice that a trial date will be given at the first call-over. That date will be the first available and suitable. The majority of High Court trials are in the Auckland High Court. Since March 2004, an extra judge has been rostered each week to hear jury trials so that five judges are sitting concurrently. A jury trial case list is maintained to support effective prioritisation of cases for scheduling.This allows key parties to the processing of cases to actively monitor cases and provide early warning of potential delays. Steps can then be taken, where possible, to mitigate the risk of undue delay. This prompts an examination of ways in which the process can be accelerated to ensure they are heard earlier Interaction with other parties enables managers to identify barriers to the efficient handling of cases. This promotes certainty and assists case management. More judicial resources provide the capacity for a greater number of cases to be heard.
