New Zealand is the third best destination in the world, according to readers of premiere travel publication Condé Nast, proving once again that the industry is world-class.

In addition, Air New Zealand was chosen as the world's best airline and Huka Lodge rated second best accommodation in Australasia (Blanket Bay Lodge, Queenstown and Mangapapa Lodge, and Hawkes Bay also featured). Polynesian Spa was judged 9th best in the world, and Wellington came in 18th on the list of world’s best cities.

Tourism Minister Mark Burton says he’s not surprised at all.

“New Zealand is widely recognised as one of the world’s premiere destinations, and our tourism sector is highly acclaimed by international industry leaders.

“We began the year with Tourism New Zealand (TNZ) winning two prestigious awards from the Hospitality Sales and Marketing Association International in New York: the international public relations award for destination marketing, and gold for The Royal Tour, a documentary made in association with the Discovery Channel and featuring Prime Minister Helen Clark.

“In April I accepted the 2004 Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) Grand Award for Marketing on behalf of Tourism New Zealand, for their work on the successful 100% Pure New Zealand campaign. They were also awarded gold for the 100% Pure travel poster and their official website, www.newzealand.com.

“In May, readers of the UK paper Guardian-Observer chose us as their number one destination of choice, and New Zealand won gold for its very first entry to the Chelsea Flower Show.

“And earlier this month, Blanket Bay, Huka Lodge, Wharekauhau and Kauri Cliffs were all listed on Andrew Harper’s top 20 International Resort Hideaways list. Not bad for a country that only a few short years ago was little known on the international scene.

“By any measure, tourism is a premiere New Zealand industry. I never get tired of congratulating the sector for their numerous achievements, and look forward to saying ‘well done’ for even greater successes in the future,” said Mark Burton.
