Associate Justice Minister Margaret Wilson today announced the appointment of Professor Peter Spiller as the new Principal Disputes Referee.

Professor Spiller, who will take up the appointment on 8 January next year, replaces Grant Aislabie who began serving as the first Principal Disputes Referee in June 1999.

Professor Spiller currently teaches in the School of Law at Waikato University. He has been involved with the Disputes Tribunal as a trainer since 1989 and as a Referee since 1991.

This experience combined with his academic background gives him a very broad overview of the Tribunal, Margaret Wilson said.

“I am confident he will provide the technical expertise to improve the consistency of the decision-making of referees.”

Margaret Wilson acknowledged the contribution of Mr Aislabie and in particular the drive and commitment he has provided in establishing the position.
