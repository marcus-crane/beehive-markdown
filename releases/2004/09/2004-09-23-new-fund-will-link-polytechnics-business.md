Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics (ITPs) can now apply for funding from the ITP Business Links Fund, which received $21.5 million over four years in Budget 2004.

Associate Education Minister Steve Maharey announced the new fund at the ITPNZ “Research That Works” Conference in Hamilton today.

He encouraged institutions to think carefully about how they can build on their links with their core business and professional stakeholders, not just for the coming year but for the next four years of funding.

“Thestart talking to the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) about how they can access this funding, and to get their business engagement plans in.

Tertiary Education Commission is expected to approve the first business engagement plans from ITPs early next year,” Steve Maharey said.

“All tertiary education organisations, but particularly institutes of technology and polytechnics, have to become more focused towards the needs of their communities and local economies. If they are aligned to the economic direction of their communities they will be able to contribute more strongly to regional development.

“This is not about making one-off incremental gains from projects that are peripheral to core business. Links to business needs should be one of the core roles for all ITPs.

“While the fund is primarily aimed at working with business, government recognises the importance of greater collaboration between ITPs and other key stakeholders such as industry training organisations. I encourage ITPs to work together to consider how best to access the funding.”

Funding for each ITP will be based on the content of its engagement plan, not the size of the institution. Each ITP will be able to apply for up to a maximum of $300,000 per academic year.
