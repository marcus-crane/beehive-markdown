Education Minister Trevor Mallard today named the 75 schools that will take part in a new [pilot programme](http://www.kiwicareers.govt.nz/pathfinder/default.asp?FunctionID=1100) aimed at helping young people plan their move from school to further education or work.

The $5.5 million two-year Designing Careers pilot is part of the government’s Youth Transitions Budget package announced earlier this year.

"This pilot will reach more than 15,000 students in the 75 schools. Our government is committed to improving career information and guidance in schools. We believe it's important both economically and socially for all people to have goals, and have the means to reach those goals in the workforce and in education and training.

"We need to make sure our teenagers are armed with the right information and skills to make good choices about where to next. This pilot will greatly enhance the existing career information and guidance services. It will start next year and be evaluated before decisions are made about extending it or adapting it further," Trevor Mallard said.

The Designing Careers pilot is aimed at helping Year 10 (age 14) school students develop career management skills through the use of individual learning and career plans. These plans will help students decide which subjects or courses to follow at school, and help them decide what to do in terms of further education or work after they leave school.

The pilot will also target Year 11, 12 and 13 students who are at risk of not making successful transitions from school.

Career Services will provide the professional support and resources for participating schools and special online resources will also be made available.

"All schools had the opportunity to register their interest in taking part in the pilot and there was a high level of interest. Schools were selected to cover a broad range of criteria, including region, decile, school type, roll size and capacity to deliver the pilot," Trevor Mallard said.

A pdf fact sheet about Careers Services is attached, along with a list of schools involved in the pilot.
