Attorney-General Margaret Wilson today denied allegations the government acted improperly in seeking a judicial review of Caren Wickliffe's refusal to adjourn Maori East Coast claims on the foreshore and seabed.

"Judge Wickliffe acknowledged she had to recuse herself from the proceedings because of her iwi affiliation, and did so.

"The issue in this case is the timing of recusal. She should have recused herself from all aspects of these claims. Instead she declined the Crown's application to adjourn proceedings before recusing herself."

Margaret Wilson also said court action against the Maori Land Court was not part of a political strategy.

"In most instances Maori Land Court judges to not have a personal interest in their cases. They usually hear cases dealing with established parcels of Maori freehold land, such as applications for succession orders or vesting trusts.

"The case in question involves Ngati Porou. We are not aware of other cases where Judge Wickliffe has dealt with Ngati Porou as a whole."

Margaret Wilson said the Minister of Maori Affairs appoints Maori Land Court judges, not the Attorney-General.

Judge Wickliffe was assigned by the Chief Judge of the Maori Land Court to cover Tairawhiti District and the Wairekei District for the purposes of sitting as in Whakatane and Opotiki.

This case was taken by Margaret Wilson, in her capacity as Attorney-General, on behalf of the Crown.

"It is the responsibility of the Attorney-General to uphold the rule of law. That includes maintaining confidence in the courts that hear cases by an independent and unbiased judiciary. Even the perception of bias can be damaging. That is why it is most unusual for judges not to recuse themselves when asked to do so and where there is a question of personal bias.

"This legal action was taken on the advice of Crown Law. It was based on a legal principle that judges must recuse themselves where there is apparent bias. It was not a personal decision of mine, nor was it part of a political strategy."
