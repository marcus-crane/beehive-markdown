Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey has announced the appointment of Paul Smith as a new member of the Board of New Zealand On Air.

Mr Smith begins a three-year term on the Board, replacing Professor Albert Wendt who has taken the Citizen's Chair for Pacific studies at the University of Hawaii.

"I would like to thank Professor Wendt for his considerable contribution to NZ On Air, both in his Pacific influence and literary skills. I congratulate him on his new appointment.

“Paul Smith brings a good mix of skills to the Board particularly his background as a journalist and media commentator and his experience as a former member of the Television New Zealand Board,” Steve Maharey said.

Mr Maharey has also announced the appointment of existing member Judy Callingham as Deputy Chair to fill the position previously held by Professor Wendt.

NZ On Air is established pursuant to section 35 of the Broadcasting Act 1989 to reflect and develop New Zealand identity and culture by promoting programmes about New Zealand and New Zealand interests and by promoting Maori language and culture.

Its funding requirements are also intended to ensure that the coverage of television and radio broadcasting reaches as many New Zealand communities and people of diverse gender, ethnicity, religious and ethical beliefs, and other interests as possible.
