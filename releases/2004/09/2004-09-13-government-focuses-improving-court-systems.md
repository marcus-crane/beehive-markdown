The government is focusing first on improving the efficiency of the Courts' system rather than planning radical changes to its structure, says Justice Minister Phil Goff and Minister for Courts Rick Barker.

The Ministers made the comments as the government released [its response](http://www.justice.govt.nz/pubs/reports/2004/delivering-justice-for-all/index.html) to the Law Commission's report on New Zealand's courts and tribunals, *Delivering Justice for All*, which recommended a range of changes.

“The report makes some important observations about the operation and administration of the court system. It also presents recommendations that are largely in line with, and reinforce, the government's approach," Mr Goff said.

Mr Barker said: “We accept that improvements are needed to ensure that court users – whether they be victims, defendants, witnesses or jurors – feel their cases are dealt with quickly and efficiently, and they have ready access to the services, information and support they need.

"One way of gaining efficiencies is to keep what cases we can out of the courtroom by using other options where appropriate such as alternative dispute resolution, restorative justice and status hearings. A pilot programme using court-mandated mediation in civil cases is also being considered."

Major improvements the government has already initiated include:

- A comprehensive review of the infringement scheme is being undertaken in conjunction with the Law Commission;
- Changes arising from the Care of Children Bill;
- The court-referred restorative justice pilot;
- A community legal services strategy;
- The list court pilot in the Wellington District Court.

Other initiatives underway that address issues raised by the report include:

- Improvements to legal information and advice;
- Frameworks for specific alternative criminal justice schemes;
- Simplifying criminal processes.

Recommendations that will be addressed include:

A review of appeal pathways

Further improvements to access to legal information and advice, via

- New initiatives such as a ‘meet and greet’ service at courthouses
- An 0800 service
- A legal information strategy.

The Ministry of Justice has also been instructed to develop a framework for the operation and administration of tribunals, with a view to creating a unified tribunals structure.

Mr Goff and Mr Barker said the government was not yet persuaded that structural changes as proposed in the report – such as the establishment of community courts – was necessary. However officials were doing further work on the proposals.

"Before considering radical changes to the Courts structure we need first to ensure that the underlying processes of the court system are working efficiently," Mr Barker said.

“To that end, the Ministry is conducting a baseline review examining whether current levels of service are appropriate; whether there are any major issues with those services, and the cost of making improvements in service delivery.

“The Law Commission will be involved in the baseline review to ensure a focus is maintained on the issues its report identified.”
