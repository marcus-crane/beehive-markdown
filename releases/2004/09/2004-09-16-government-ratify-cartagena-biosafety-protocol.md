The government will ratify the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, Environment and Associate Foreign Minister Marian Hobbs announced today. Public consultation on ratification attracted more than 1200 responses, mostly in favour.

"We are ratifying the protocol because New Zealand is a good international citizen and we are committed to comprehensive biosecurity," Marian Hobbs said.

New Zealand will join more than 100 countries that have ratified the protocol.  
The Cartagena Protocol to the Convention on Biological Diversity regulates international trade of certain types of genetically modified organisms known as living modified organisms (LMOs).

"We support people being informed about what's imported and exported. It can be seen as an extension of border biosecurity," Marian Hobbs said. "By working with countries that have ratified we are protecting our future trade.

"Ratification allows us to ensure the best interests of New Zealand and other agricultural exporters are taken into account in the development of the protocol. It means we have an inside track in helping determine international practice for governing trade in these products and will have an active voice in the future development of the protocol.

"We already have law covering the importation of organisms that come within the protocol so there'll be no change in the case-by-case way we deal with GMOs imported or used in New Zealand. Regulations will be put into place to ensure that New Zealand exporters of LMOs meet identification, reporting and other requirements of the protocol."

New Zealand signed the protocol in May 2000 and will ratify next year, following completion of Parliamentary processes.

The Cartagena Protocol came into force on 11 September 2003. The first formal meeting of the parties was in February, which New Zealand attended as an observer. New Zealand aims to attend the next meeting in June 2005 as a party to the protocol.

The consultation took place over six weeks in June and July. A document summarising the responses can be found at: www.mfat.govt.nz/foreign/env/biosafety/submissionsindex.html

Biosafety Protocol –Questions and Answers:

What does the Protocol do?

The Protocol regulates the trade of some types of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) known as Living Modified Organisms (LMOs). LMOs include plants, animals and any other organisms that can grow and replicate themselves.

Why did NZ sign the Protocol?

We signed because we support the biosafety principles underpinning the Protocol.

Why didn’t we ratify the Protocol at the time we signed it?

Ratifying a treaty is a different process from signing it. Signature is not legally binding, whereas ratification is. The Government must assess whether it is in New Zealand’s national interest to be bound by such a treaty. To do this, we have to consider properly the range of views held by New Zealanders about the treaty.

How did the Government canvass New Zealanders’ views on the Protocol?

A Public Consultation on whether New Zealand should ratify the Protocol was held from 4 June – 16 July. A discussion document was sent to interested parties and posted on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade website, and officials discussed the Protocol at five public meetings around the country. Over 1200 submissions were received, mostly in favour of ratification. A document summarising the submissions can be found at www.mfat.govt.nz

Why hasn’t the Government ratified the Protocol before now? Other countries have already ratified.

Several quite complex steps need to be undertaken before the Government enters a treaty relationship with other governments. There was not enough time to complete these steps, including public consultation, before the first meeting of parties to the protocol was unexpectedly brought forward from May to February 2004. The Government therefore decided to attend the first meeting as an observer and work to a timetable that would allow us to attend the second meeting next year as a full member.

Has New Zealand’s biosecurity been put at risk because the protocol has not been ratified?

No. New Zealand’s biosecurity regime is already stringent as it applies to imports, and more than meets the standards set by the Protocol. Ratification means that New Zealand will have to create a legal requirement for any potential exporters to provide accurate information to importing parties. A mechanism would need to be established to implement this.

What will the impact of ratification be for NZ?

There will be no impact in terms of imports of LMOs. New Zealand’s biosecurity and hazardous substances and new organisms regimes are already stringent as they apply to imports, and meet the standards set by the Protocol. Following ratification, New Zealand will have to create a legal requirement for any potential exporters to provide accurate information to importing parties. A mechanism will need to be established to implement this.

How much pressure were we under to ratify?

Some 107 countries have ratified the Protocol, and clearly they wanted other signatories to ratify too. The decision to ratify has been made in accordance with New Zealand’s national interest, taking the views of New Zealanders into account.

Why are we ratifying when other agricultural exporting nations have not?

Several major agricultural exporting nations have not ruled out the possibility of ratifying the Protocol in the future. However, some countries have expressed concerns that the Protocol could restrict trade. The Government weighed up these concerns in making its decision, but decided New Zealand’s interests would be best served by persuading other Protocol Parties to ensure the legitimate concerns of agricultural exporters are addressed. For this reason, the Government will encourage other agricultural exporters to ratify the Protocol.
