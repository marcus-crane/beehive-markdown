During a visit to Marlborough today, Associate Social Development and Employment Minister Rick Barker warned that poor labour conditions in vineyards had to be addressed as part of an agreed long-term strategy.

Rick Barker says too many stories are circulating of unpaid or low wages and bad working conditions. He says this is unacceptable and gives the wine province a bad reputation which will have negative knock-on effects when needing to attract more people to the vineyard labour force.

"It is in the interests of the whole industry to operate with good labour practices.  
The European Union is demanding stringent labour standards for imports and we need to comply. There could be severe consequences for our exports if the  
mistreatment of workers and taking on of illegal staff by contractors isn’t stamped out here."

A recent national meeting between growers and the Ministers of Labour, Immigration, Associate Agriculture, and Work and Income, agreed that a long term plan for seasonal industries be based on Kiwis being first in line for jobs, no illegal workers and the goal of retaining a seasonal labour force.

"Last week the government formed a new Seasonal Strategy Taskforce to gain a clearer overview of the needs of the seasonal industry and to work on a three-stage plan focusing on the training and retaining staff.

"The Marlborough viticulture industry this year produced 35% or more grapes than previous years. Obviously this means they need more staff. Work and Income are doing their best to find them, but the industry need to market themselves and make the work attractive to potential workers," he said.

Rick Barker added that part of improving the picture sits with the industry:

"Wages and conditions here need to be up to the standard expected in other industries and contractors need to comply with this. People who don't pay decent wages and employ illegal workers are letting down the brand and image of NZ products.

"I have heard the concern of police and local growers about illegal employment and the fact that some are apparently ripping workers off. There is obviously a need for better monitoring this coming season,” he said.

Rick Barker says well looked after workers are ultimately better value because they will be more efficient, raising production for Marlborough growers.
