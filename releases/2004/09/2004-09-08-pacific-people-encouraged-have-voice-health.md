The number of Pacific people standing in the District Health Board elections shows a desire for more Pacific voices in the health sector, says Associate Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Taito Phillip Field.

More than 20 Pacific candidates are among the 521 who are standing in this year’s District Health Board (DHB) elections. This is a significant increase on the number of Pacific candidates who stood in the first DHB elections in 2001.

“This is an excellent number considering the majority of the Pacific population is concentrated in the three Auckland DHBs,” says Mr Field.

“And what it says to me is that our people want to have a say in the way health services are delivered to our community.”

The majority of the Pacific candidates are standing in the three greater Auckland DHBs – Waitemata, Auckland and Counties-Manukau. There are also Pacific candidates standing in Capital and Coast, Hutt, Hawke’s Bay, Whanganui and Otago.

Each of the 21 DHBs have between 13 and 41 nominations for the seven elected positions on each board.

Mr Field wants to remind the Pacific community that there are two key aspects of enabling representation from groups such as Maori and Pacific people.

“Firstly strong candidates need to be put forward but equally as important their communities need to support these candidates.”

“Anecdotally we know that the Pacific population has a very low voting turnout so I encourage all Pacific people to ensure they’re on the roll and to get out and vote not only in the DHB elections but also the Local Body Elections."

Voting packs will start arriving in the post from September 17, with voting closing at midday on October 9.
