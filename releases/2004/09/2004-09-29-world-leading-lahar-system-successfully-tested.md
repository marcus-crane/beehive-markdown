New Zealand finally has a world-leading [lahar](http://www.doc.govt.nz/Whats-New/Issues/Mt-Ruapehu-Crater-Lake/002~Lahars.asp) (mudslide) response system installed on Mount Ruapehu fifty years after the [Tangiwai disaster](http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/Gallery/Tangiwai/), Conservation Minister Chris Carter announced today.

"The multi-million dollar [Eastern Ruapehu Lahar Warning and Response System](http://www.doc.govt.nz/Whats-New/Issues/Mt-Ruapehu-Crater-Lake/Crater-Lake-Issue-a-Management-Dilemma.asp), which includes volcanic flood sensors and automatic gates, was fully tested for the first time today with a multi-agency civil defence response," Mr Carter said from Ohakune.

"The results of the system test were very positive. People living in the Ruapehu District now have early warning of and protection from emergencies on one of most active lahar paths in the world. The problem is this system should have been in place around Ruapehu a long time ago.

"When you are doing flood protection work, you don't wait for a storm warning before starting it, you take steps well in advance based on the history of an area," Mr Carter said.

"We have known that lahars from Ruapehu have been an ongoing hazard for more than a century. There have been 15 lahar-producing eruptions on Ruapehu since Tangiwai, one of which created a lahar in 1975 of a similar size to the 1953 event," Mr Carter said.

"The [technology](http://www.pnsn.org/OPS/moreops.html) tested today has been available since it was put in place on [Mount St Helens](http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/MSH/Monitoring/msh_monitoring_intro.html) in North America in the early 1990s. Despite that, governments throughout the 1990s made no moves to adopt it, or mitigate the risks around Ruapehu, even though another lahar was a certainty.

"I am proud that the Labour-Progressive government fronted up with the cash to put a response system in place as soon as it came to office," Mr Carter said.

"It is absurd that debate about the large lahar due from Ruapehu some time in the next few years, has focussed on whether or not we should prevent it by digging up the top of the mountain.

"Excavation would do absolutely nothing to prevent future lahars or protect the district from the leading cause of them, eruptions. It would simply be a continuation of the short-sighted, cheap fix approach taken around Ruapehu for decades," Mr Carter said.

"It's well past time that approach changed, and today it has."
