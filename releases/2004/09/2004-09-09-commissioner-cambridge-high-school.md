Education Minister Trevor Mallard has today decided to dissolve the Board of Trustees of Cambridge High School and has directed the Secretary of Education to appoint a commissioner to replace the board.

"I have made this decision on the basis of Education Review Office (ERO) findings in relation to governance of the school by its board of trustees," Trevor Mallard said.

"ERO has advised me it is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds to believe there is a risk to the operation of the school, and potentially to the welfare and educational performance of its students, should the existing board remain.

"ERO is also of the view that the current board does not have the capability to address the issues raised.

"The ERO findings are based on its recent review of the school. ERO has presented me with a special review report on governance matters only. The full ERO report which covered these governance issues and other matters, has been accepted by the board but it is still unconfirmed. It will not be released until it has been confirmed by ERO.

"I have not taken this decision lightly but I consider it is essential that this school and its community urgently move on in a positive way so Cambridge High School students can receive the quality of education they are entitled to.

"I did consider waiting for the full ERO report to be confirmed. But after weighing up the advice I was given, and the serious nature of governance issues raised in the review, I believe it would have been irresponsible of me to wait any longer. I have also requested that a community advisory group be set up as soon as possible," Trevor Mallard said.
