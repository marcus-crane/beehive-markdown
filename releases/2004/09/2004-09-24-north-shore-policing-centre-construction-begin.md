Construction is expected to start later this year on the new North Shore Policing Centre, with occupation expected early in 2006.

Police Minister George Hawkins says Police will lease the four level, 7000sqm building, to be situated on Parkway Drive between Sunset Road and Constellation Drive in Albany. Designed by Beca, Carter, Hollings and Ferner, it will be built and owned by Bungalo Holdings.

Mr Hawkins said planning for the Centre took into account population growth north of Takapuna and would meet policing requirements in the area for at least the next twenty years.

Positioned in the heart of the North Shore community, it would also assist other areas in the North Shore/Waitakere/Rodney Police District.

"The Centre will provide a 24-hour service, with enhanced facilities for staff and public and house around 200 staff, " Mr Hawkins said.

"It will also provide a base for a number of Police services in the District including CIB, Youth Aid and Prosecutions, as well as facilities for agencies such as truancy, victim support and others," he said.

The current Takapuna station would remain North Shore's base, but would focus more on local residents and businesses rather than the entire area. Other policing facilities will also remain throughout the North Shore.

North Shore City enjoys one of the lowest rates of offending in the country. Despite a rising population recorded crime rates had continued to fall, Mr Hawkins said.
