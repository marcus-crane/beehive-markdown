The Ministry for the Environment has launched a [web resource](www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/waste/waste-mgmt-planning/) to help councils learn more effective ways of managing their waste, Environment Minister Marian Hobbs said today.

"This innovative new web resource shares success stories and best practice examples from all over the country of councils doing a good job of reducing and managing their rubbish," Marian Hobbs said.

Examples of councils doing well in waste management planning include Environment Waikato, North Shore City Council, Christchurch City Council and Taranaki Regional Council.

"Councils can click on the web resource to see how other councils dealt with tricky issues, and to get fresh ideas. Comprehensive information and advice is also provided by the Ministry on how to develop effective waste management plans, policies and strategies.

"The web resource will also be of interest to members of the public and community groups that wanting a say on waste planning issues in their area."

All local authorities are required by law to develop a waste management plan in consultation with their communities by 2005. The Ministry for the Environment is asking councils to adopt the New Zealand Waste Strategy 2002 as a basis for their waste planning and actions. The strategy sets a national framework and targets for reducing and better managing waste, which local authorities can adapt to suit their local circumstances.

"The web resource provides direction and offers solutions to key challenges and issues," Marian Hobbs said. "While it might be tempting to simply write a document and put it on a shelf, waste management planning is an ongoing, evolving practice. Councils know this, and will find the web resource helpful in this regard, as it will be regularly updated."

The Waste Management Planning Resource is available at www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/waste/waste-mgmt-planning/
