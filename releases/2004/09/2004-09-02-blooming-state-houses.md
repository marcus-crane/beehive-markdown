Housing Minister Steve Maharey launched a nationwide gardening competition for state house tenants today.

The Garden Awards – run by Housing New Zealand Corporation - aim to recognise the efforts of tenants who take pride in maintaining their gardens. Last time about 1,600 tenants took part. This year there are two new categories, to encourage even more people to take part.

Steve Maharey visited a Miramar household planning to enter the awards this morning.

“The idea is not necessarily to have the biggest or brightest garden. There are categories that cater to all kinds of gardens, from pot plant collections to vegetable gardens. There’s also a category for children interested in gardening.

“Having a tidy or colourful garden you created yourself offers a real sense of pride in where you live.

“The garden awards acknowledge the many tenants who go to great lengths to look after their places,” Steve Maharey said.

Categories include: New Garden, Open, Edible/Practical, Small Space, Children’s Garden, and a category for residents of Community Group Housing homes. Entry is free, and open to all Corporation tenants. Entries are open from 1 September to 12 November.

Photographs of entrants’ gardens will be judged locally in late November, and the winners will go on to national judging in December.

Local winners will be notified before Christmas and national winners will be announced early next year. Photographs of local winning gardens will be displayed in Corporation Neighbourhood Units from December.
