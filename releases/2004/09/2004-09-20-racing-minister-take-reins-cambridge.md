Racing Minister Damien O'Connor will take the reins and ride trackwork on Wednesday at the Cambridge Jockey Club.

"I haven't ridden for awhile, so there's the slight chance I'll come a cropper," said Mr O'Connor. "But that's never put me off before!"

Mr O'Connor will be in the Waikato attending tomorrow night's presentation by [New Zealand Racing Board](http://www.racenz.com/) chairman Warren Larsen.

The presentation, at Te Rapa, will outline challenges facing New Zealand racing and the Board's plans for the industry's revitalisation. Anyone with an interest in New Zealand thoroughbred, harness and greyhound racing is invited to attend.

"This is a great opportunity to hear current issues discussed, and to get a feel for future direction," Mr O'Connor said.

Similar presentations have been given at this year's racing conference AGMs. The Te Rapa presentation is aimed at those who didn't attend the AGMs, and don't get a chance to hear NZ Racing Board messages.

"It's about communicating strategies to those at the grass roots level," said Mr O'Connor.

First thing Wednesday morning, Mr O'Connor will meet with leading Waikato trainer Roger James, who has kindly entrusted one of his charges to the Minister.

He'll ride trackwork at about 7:30am, and then tour the Cambridge facility with club officials, including president Bruce Harvey and secretary Gayle Barkla.
