The government today released its strategy for realising the full potential of rail as a properly integrated part of the nation's transport infrastructure through the release of the draft National Rail Strategy (NRS) to 2014.

The NRS is the realisation of this government's commitment to rail being an essential part of the nation's infrastructure for the benefit of the economy, business, commuters, local communities and the environment. An emphasis of the NRS is to move more freight and commuters onto rail to help ease road congestion, reduce travel times and benefit the environment.

"Rail has been neglected for too long. Years of underinvestment, particularly in the 1990s has led to it being run down and underutilised to the detriment of the economy and all those that depend upon our transport infrastructure. The neglect of rail has also compounded problems on our roads which faced similar underinvestment through the 1990s. As with roads, this government is committed to fixing the problems caused by the neglect of the last National government and to getting New Zealand business and commuters moving again," says Transport Minister, Pete Hodgson.

Today's announcement follows the purchase of the national rail infrastructure assets by the government earlier this year and the injection of $200 million to restore and upgrade the rail network. The New Zealand Railways Corporation (NZRC) is now responsible for managing the national rail infrastructure, overseeing investment and ensuring costs are properly recovered.

"The prospects for transport today have never looked better. In 1999, our transport infrastructure was fragmented and being starved of investment. Changes this government has made; including the restructuring of the government transport sector earlier this year, record funding of $18.7 billion for transport over the next ten years and the buy-back of rail infrastructure assets, means that transport improvements are being properly planned and funded for the first time in years."

The NRS and New Zealand Transport Strategy both recognise the contribution that all participants in the rail industry, from service operators and users to local councils, make. Planning and investment in all modes of transport, including road, rail and shipping, can now be done in an integrated way to promote money being spent effectively and efficiently to achieve the best outcomes in terms of return on investment, congestion reduction and improvements for business, commuters, local communities and the environment.
