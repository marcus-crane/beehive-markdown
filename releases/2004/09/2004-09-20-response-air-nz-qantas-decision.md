Finance Minister Michael Cullen today expressed disappointment with the High Court’s decision on an Air New Zealand application to form an anti-competitive alliance with Qantas.  
“As shareholding minister I had hoped for a different outcome, but this is the court’s decision,” Dr Cullen said.  
“The Government has always indicated that it will abide by the court’s decision and it has no intention of attempting to overturn it.”  
Dr Cullen observed that the company’s financial position had significantly improved since the arrangement was first discussed in 2002.  
The minister will not be commenting further.
