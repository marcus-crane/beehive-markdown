The release of a discussion paper [Proposed Draft Guidelines on the Labelling of Genetically Modified Foods and Food Products](http://www.comcom.govt.nz/gm/Commerce%20Commission%20Draft%20GM-free%20Guidelines%20September%202004.PDF), by the Commerce Commission, was welcomed today by Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard.

Judith Tizard says the paper will assist with plans to develop trans-Tasman guidelines on GM-labelling by early next year.

"A trans-Tasman approach will ensure food-manufacturers, suppliers and industry in New Zealand and Australia have consistent information about labelling both genetically modified and GM-free food."

The Commerce Commission has said it will work with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to develop the joint guidelines on GM-labelling.

Judith Tizard said the government had looked at the option of developing a voluntary GM-free label, however, it was not technically possible at this stage to identify all GM content present in foods with 100% certainty.

"Consumers and industry told us that they didn't want a half way solution. In keeping with the recommendations of the Royal Commission, clear guidelines will be made available on what is required to label a food ‘GM-free'."

The discussion paper sets out the Commerce Commission’s current approach to the labelling and promotion of genetically modified foods under the Fair Trading Act. A copy of the paper is available on the Commission’s website, [www.comcom.govt.nz](http://www.comcom.govt.nz)
