Howick's new Botany Downs College will get almost $10 million worth of extra buildings to accommodate future roll growth, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

"The school opened in January 2004 with Year 9 students. By 2006 when the school has students in Years 9 to 11, additional classrooms will be required to accommodate the extra students," Trevor Mallard said.

To ensure all specialist facilities are available by the time the school has senior students, a second stage of construction will provide three further teaching blocks to provide for a planned Years 9 - 13 roll of 1500.

"Our government is committed to high education standards across the board for young New Zealanders. Providing modern, up-to-date, enjoyable and safe learning environments is essential for students. As a government, we are also keen to ensure that schools are attractive, modern and well maintained assets for local communities," Trevor Mallard said.

Detailed planning will commence immediately to enable a construction tender to be let early in 2005. This will ensure that all the required facilities will be in place by January 2006.

The first stage of construction incorporated energy sustainability features, including increased insulation, increased window areas to assist natural lighting, atrium-assisted natural ventilation and rainwater recovery tanks for re-use in toilet flushing and irrigation. These energy-conserving features will also be incorporated in the second stage of construction.
