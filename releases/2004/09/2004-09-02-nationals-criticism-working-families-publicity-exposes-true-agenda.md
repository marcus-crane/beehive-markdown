Don Brash’s criticism of the government’s Working for Families communications campaign has smoked out National’s real agenda, says Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey.

The Auditor-General this afternoon issued a largely positive report in to the need for the $21.1 million campaign. Recommendations to better coordinate the activities of Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development are being followed.

Steve Maharey said in the 1990s National relied on people not taking up their entitlements to save money and it was clear Don Brash wanted to do the same thing again.

“Working for Families is a $2.75 billion package spread over four years.

“All the money will go to low to modest income households. Some 300,000 families will benefit.

“To receive the entitlements eveyone will have to apply. Many people who have never been entitled to support will be entitled to support in the future. There will be no back-dating. So it is vital that people know when and how to apply.

“The Auditor-General approved the overall communications campaign prior to the Budget. The Auditor-General’s office will be consulted about all future elements of the campaign and has already approved two parts of it.

“The government believes that when it is spending such a large amount of money it is vitally importanty that those who are entitled to receive it do so,” Steve Maharey said.
