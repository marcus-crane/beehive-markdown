Wairoa's future was the issue under discussion for Economic Development Minister, Jim Anderton and Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia when they met with a delegation in Wairoa this afternoon.

"The government is working hard to help the people of Wairoa build a positive future for the community after they experienced some serious challenges, including gang problems last November.

"As Economic Development Minister I was asked to respond to the community concerns about education, social development, youth, skills and gang problems by a delegation in May this year. Today I was able to tell the community representatives of the progress we are making.

"Government is helping Wairoa with education, economic development, youth projects and skills development which are all leading to increased job opportunities. Wairoa itself has said economic development is not enough in itself to prevent gang violence. The Police have been given additional resources to deal with such problems.

"The regional economy is doing well. Three major local companies, AFFCO, Fraser Town Meats and Claphams Timber export 100 per cent of local production and nearly 200 jobs have been created through this export expansion. The Tairawhiti Major Regional Initiative announced today will also help boost the local economy.

"New Zealand Trade and Enterprise is currently investigating the potential for a Wairoa Maori Film Festival to showcase Maori creativity and talent. It is also working with the Wairoa Enterprise Agency to plan a 'Wairoa Business Clinic' to help people develop and expand their businesses.

"Te Puni Kokiri is working with Wairoa on community development and family support issues. It is also investigating the potential for sports and culture projects, whanau development and enterprise projects.

"All of these developments are contributing to creating a more positive future for Wairoa and this Labour Progressive government will continue to work with them towards this goal," Jim Anderton said.
