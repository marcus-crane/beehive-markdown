Attorney-General Margaret Wilson today welcomed the Maori Land Court's appointment of Judge Milroy to deal with Tairawhiti claims relating to the foreshore and seabed.

The Crown will now consider whether to file a new application in the Maori Land Court to adjourn the claims. Such an application would be along similar lines to March's application to adjourn seabed and foreshore applications.

Judge Milroy's appointment also means the Crown will discontinue its application for a High Court review of the Maori Land Court's decision of March.

"The High Court judicial review was based on the legal principle that judges must recuse themselves from all hearings where there is an appearance of bias. Judge Milroy's appointment eliminates the basis of that application.

"I would like to reiterate that the review of Judge Wickliffe's March decision was taken by the Crown. It was not based on a personal decision of mine nor was it a personal attack on Caren Wickliffe.

"The action was purely a procedural matter based on the rule of law. I am pleased it has now been rendered unnecessary."
