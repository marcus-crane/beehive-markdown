An establishment board of trustees has been appointed for Manurewa's new Wattle Downs School, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

The five appointees are: Glenys Ashby, Simon Bilton, Stephanie Ferguson, Daniel Newman, and Dennis Rose.

"These people were chosen because of their skills and background. I am pleased that the establishment board comprises experienced and skilled people who will support the school in meeting the needs and aspirations of the local community," Trevor Mallard said.

"The establishment board will appoint the principal and staff, determine school policy, establish governance practices and take responsibility for required property developments. It will be in place until an elected board takes over. School elections are likely to be held within about six months of the new school opening."

The new school, scheduled to open at the beginning of 2006, is being established to meet the increasing population growth on the Mahia Peninsula, in Manurewa.

The decision to establish a full primary school, for new students from new entrants to year 8, follows consultation with existing schools and the local community.

Nominations for the board were sought from a range of parties including local schools, residents, community groups, Manukau City Council and local iwi.
