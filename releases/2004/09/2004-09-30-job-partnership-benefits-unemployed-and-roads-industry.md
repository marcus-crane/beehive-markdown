A job partnership launched today will see up to 200 unemployed people trained in road construction over the next year, Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

The partnership with the roads industry is the latest in the government’s Jobs Jolt package. Roading joins the hospitality, retail, trucking and trades industries in partnering with Work and Income to provide unemployed people with entry level skills training.

Work and Income is contracting with InfraTrain, the Industry Training Organisation for roads. The partnership includes employer groups Roading NZ and the New Zealand Contractors’ Federation.

Twenty-four people have already completed the four week training programme, with 14 placed into jobs already. Twenty-one more people graduated today and a further 23 are currently in training. The partnership ensures the new workers have a career plan and ongoing in-work support.

Training programmes are already operating in Northland, Auckland and Dunedin, with plans underway to expand to Waikato and Wellington.

Roading New Zealand’s Chief Executive Chris Olsen said the partnership was an important initiative to avert a potential skill shortage in the roading industry as a result of the Government ‘s extra $5 billion spending on transport over the next decade.

“The Government is investing heavily in New Zealand’s roading infrastructure and the industry needs skilled people to carry out the work.”

Steve Maharey said the partnership responded to the needs of unemployed people requiring skills and jobs as well as an industry undergoing rapid growth.

“It’s a partnership that benefits everyone involved.”
