A New Zealand film has once again received one of the top awards at the Toronto Film Festival, evidence that the New Zealand film industry is going from strength to strength, says Associate Arts Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard.

[In My Father’s Den](http://www.inmyfathersden.com) was awarded the prestigious International Film Critics’ Prize at the Toronto Film Festival in Canada.

"It is great to see the industry continuing to build on the huge success of Whale Rider, which won the people's choice award at the same festival two years ago," said Judith Tizard.

"Brad McGann and everyone involved deserve to be congratulated. It is wonderful to see another great New Zealand novel so eloquently translated to the screen. This latest success reminds us that New Zealand films can compete with the best in the world."

A New Zealand-UK co-production, the film is financed by the New Zealand Film Commission, NZ On Air, Visionview and the UK Film Council.
