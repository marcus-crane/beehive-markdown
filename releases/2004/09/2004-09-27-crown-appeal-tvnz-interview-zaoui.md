The Crown will be seeking leave from the Supreme Court to appeal the Court of Appeal’s decision in the TVNZ interview case.

The Court of Appeal decision is at odds with other authority in this area and the reason for the appeal is to clarify the law.

As the papers have been filed with the Supreme Court it would be inappropriate to comment further.
