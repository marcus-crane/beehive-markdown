New research out today shows the importance of teachers using student achievement data to improve classroom teaching and lift the success of students, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

"A new research report entitled Analysis and Use of Student Achievement Data (AUSAD): Final Evaluation Report, confirms the importance of using student data when planning successful teaching programmes at the individual student and classroom level," Trevor Mallard said.

Commissioned by the Ministry of Education in 2000, the research was led by the University of Auckland’s Dr Helen Timperley. Its purpose was to improve the capacity of schools to analyse, share and learn from their student achievement information.

The research showed that positive benefits were gained for teachers and their students when teachers examined student achievement data in the classroom, used it to see how achievement might be improved and then adapted the curriculum and their teaching methods to suit the students’ needs.

"Our government is investing heavily in educational research like this because it shows us what works in practice, in the classroom in terms of lifting student achievement. We are intent on lifting education standards for all young New Zealanders so that everyone, regardless of background, has the opportunity to reach their full potential.

"The report adds to the growing pool of evidence of the importance for teachers and schools in using student data for planning teaching programmes at all levels. I would like to encourage teachers to look at the research findings," Trevor Mallard said.

The research project was separated into five distinct studies, the first three having a teaching and leadership focus and the remaining studies focusing on relationships between communities and schools.
