Work has started on the project to identify how central and local government in partnership can make significant improvements to Wellington’s transport outcomes for the benefit of the regional economy and environment.

“[In May](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F19641) this year the government was approached by Greater Wellington Regional Council to identify where central and local government in partnership can make significant and timely improvements to Wellington’s transport outcomes,” says Transport Minister, Pete Hodgson.

“Today, we welcome the forming of a partnership between Wellington's Regional and local councils and the government to work together to address the region's transport needs. I am delighted to say this approach has the support of Wellington [Labour MPs](http://www.labour.org.nz/Our_mps_top/index.html), the Green Party and United Future.”

This government has already boosted land transport funding in Wellington. During 2004/05, $104.7 million will be spent on land transport projects in the region, compared to just $60.8 million in 1998/99. Over the next ten years, the region will also benefit from $442 million in spending on State Highways plus $220 million across all areas of land transport from the recently announced regional funding package.

The Chairperson of the [Greater Wellington Regional Council](http://www.gw.govt.nz/), Margaret Shields, said that doing an assessment of Wellington’s transport needs and potential funding sources was essential to get progress.

“Greater Wellington approached the government because we believe there is a substantial gap between the current level of funding available, and the funding actually needed to do the work. Both of us have agreed the project will first examine how the regions transport projects fit with central government’s land transport strategy. The project will then make recommendations to local and central government as to how any identified funding gap might be bridged," said Councillor Shields.

Ms Shields said that the funding outcomes of the Wellington Transport Project would provide certainty for other important decisions that the region had to make.

“We are currently reviewing the transport options in the Western Corridor, and work has begun on a Economic Development Strategy for the region. The outcome of the Transport Project will tell us what level of investment we can make to deliver successively the best transport solutions for the people and businesses of the region. Of course, final decisions on the development and funding of any individual projects are a matter for the Regional Land Transport Strategy, Transit and Transfund.”

Mr Hodgson said that the government and the Regional, City and District councils had agreed to a timetable that would see a report completed in December 2004.

“Decisions will be announced in the first quarter of 2005. Officials from the councils, Treasury, Ministry of Transport, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Ministry of Economic Development Transfund, and Transit are already working on the project. I’m sure we can quickly make progress,” said Mr Hodgson.
