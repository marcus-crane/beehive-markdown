A new report shows government and industry are making progress on tackling skill shortages in the Auckland region, says Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard.

The [Industry Training report](http://www.tec.govt.nz/downloads/a2z_publications/industrytraining2003.html), released by the Tertiary Education Commission, shows the number of Auckland workers in industry training increased by around 40% in the last year, up from 15,760 to 22,000.

Modern Apprenticeships increased by 21% over the same period.

"These results are evidence of thorough work going on to ensure Auckland has the skilled workforce it needs to meet the challenges of growth," said Judith Tizard.

Judith Tizard says investment in skill development is vital for the Auckland region, where the unemployment rate stands at a low 3.7 per cent, and demand for skilled labour is growing with regional unemployment benefit numbers at 19,568, down from 29,998 in June 2003.

"The government recognises the current pressures on industry and we are working with Auckland business, local government and industry to increase skill levels in the work force."

Judith Tizard says numbers in training and Modern Apprenticeships have increased across the country as a result of a $98.4 million investment in work-based training, helped by $41.6m from New Zealand businesses.

"The positive results across the country show that workplace learning and apprenticeships are a respected option as well as an effective way of responding to skill shortages."
