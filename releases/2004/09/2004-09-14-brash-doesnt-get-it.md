Labour Minister Paul Swain today offered to brief Don Brash on the detail of the Employment Relations Law Reform Bill.

"It became clear to me today that Dr Brash needs help understanding the fundamentals of this Bill. I would be happy to clarify the key issues because this is an important piece of legislation."

Paul Swain said despite Dr Brash's comments today, the Bill clarifies that good faith is not breached if an employer gives the same terms and conditions to employees on individual agreements as those on collective agreements. However, it must be clear that the parties have bargained in good faith for these agreements (proposed new sections 59A and 59B).

"It's not surprising there is confusion considering National's constant u-turns on employment law policy. They first said they would repeal the Employment Relations Act but Dr Brash now admits businesses are happy with it."
