Local Government Minister Chris Carter is calling on New Zealanders to ensure they vote in the local authority elections.

"Voting papers for the elections will start being posted to electors all over the country tomorrow. I'm urging New Zealanders to set aside some time to sit down and read the papers, and vote by Election Day on 9 October," Mr Carter said.

"The old saying, unless you vote you can't complain, is as true for local government as it is for central government. Local elections do count.

"Local government contributes 3.5 per cent of gross domestic product. Decisions made by councils impact on a huge range of services and processes that effect people lives. Elections provide an opportunity for residents to select those who will govern and manage these services and processes," Mr Carter said.

He said there were a wide variety of people standing for councils this election, including some 260 people for city and district mayoralties.

"That means voters have a great deal of choice. I'd encourage everyone to use it. Not voting is just a lost opportunity."
