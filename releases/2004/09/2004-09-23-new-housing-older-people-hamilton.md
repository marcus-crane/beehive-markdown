Housing Minister Steve Maharey visited tenants in a new Housing New Zealand Corporation pensioner housing development in Hamilton today.

The 39 two-bedroom units in Eddlewood and Plover Courts, Rototuna, are purpose-built for older people.

Sixteen units have been completed and the rest are expected to be built by the end of the year.

“This development helps meet the need for quality, affordable housing for older people in HamiltonSteve Maharey said.

“ [Access to decent, long-term housing becomes more important as people age](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F20697).” These houses have been designed and built with the needs of older people in mind.”

The homes feature easy access entrances, open-plan living spaces and maintained grounds. They are handy to public transport, and a new shopping centre will be developed nearby next year.

“This development aligns with the Corporation’s aim of making the best use of its resources – in this case, providing opportunities for older people to move from properties that no longer suit their needs,” Steve Maharey said.

“Most of the new tenants moving here come from much larger Corporation homes that have become too big for them to manage. The homes they vacate will free up housing for local families who need more space.”

Of the 1,054 new homes to be acquired by the Corporation this year, half will be one or two-bedroom homes which are particularly suitable for older people. Over the next three years, the Corporation’s acquisition programme will add about 3,000 more homes to its overall housing stock.
