Police Minister George Hawkins says New Zealand First leader Winston Peters has not produced any evidence or demonstrated any improper behaviour or action by police around a decision not to prosecute Philip Edwards over an incident at Rocky Nook Rd, Auckland, in September 2002.

"Police have behaved appropriately," Mr Hawkins said.

In line with principles of constabulary independence there had not been and there would not be any political interference in police operational matters relating to specific cases, he said.

"This is in line with the valuable Westminster tradition that politicians have no place in determining or seeking to influence police in such matters.

"This is a critical principle, and it is a matter of real concern that Winston Peters seems to be advocating this should happen.

"As Assistant Commissioner Peter Marshall said in an interview this morning,  
there has been no political interference in this case, no judicial interference, police acted alone, they acted quite properly and with integrity and to suggest otherwise is complete nonsense."

Mr Hawkins said it was time Mr Peters 'put up or shut up.'

"If he has any evidence of any wrong doing by police, let's see it," Mr Hawkins said.

Mr Peters had demonstrated no grounds as to why police actions in this case warranted an inquiry, he said.
