Forty-eight talented athletes from the lower South Island will tonight be presented with Prime Minister's Scholarships to help them reach their sporting and educational goals, Prime Minister Helen Clark and Sport and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard announced.

The athletes are amongst a group of over 400 nationwide who were offered scholarships this year, worth up to $16,000 each per annum.

Trevor Mallard presented the scholarships at a reception in Dunedin.

The Prime Minister’s Scholarships are a government initiative, administered on its behalf by the New Zealand Academy of Sport, the high performance network of SPARC. They were established in 2000 to help athletes pursue academic or trade studies in tandem with their sporting careers.

"Our government has committed $5 million each year for the programme because we want to support young sportspeople achieving excellence in their field. These scholarships help young athletes who have the potential to become the next generation of New Zealand's outstanding sportspeople,” Helen Clark said.

The scheme includes $1 million for coaches' scholarships.

Anna Scarlett, a member of the World Championship winning Silver Ferns in 2003 who is completing a Bachelor of Physiotherapy at the University of Otago, will receive a scholarship.

Another recipient is up and coming runner Gareth Hyett, who won gold in the 800m and silver in the 1500m at this year’s National Track and Field Championship, and is undertaking a Diploma in Teaching at the Dunedin College of Education.

"It is important for sportspeople to have balance in their lives. Studying for a tertiary qualification while also training in their sport ensures that other opportunities will exist for them once they retire from their sport," Helen Clark said.

Trevor Mallard said athletes receiving scholarships would have their full tertiary fees paid, up to $10,000 per annum, and also be eligible for an allowance worth up to $6000.

"This allowance is dependent on athletes' study loads. This is a huge help for those who are struggling to make ends meet while juggling their busy lives."

Scholarships are available to athletes who are either currently carded by their national sport organisation and accessing services linked to the New Zealand Academy of Sport, or to athletes from non-carded sports who are prioritised by their national sport organisation.
