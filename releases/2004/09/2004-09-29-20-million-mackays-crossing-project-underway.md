Work starts today on a $20 million project to improve safety and ease congestion through the construction of a new four-lane railway overbridge at MacKay's crossing, north of Paekakariki on state highway one.

The event is being marked by a ceremonial sod-turning by Transport Minister, Pete Hodgson.

"Over $664 million is set to be spent on improving all modes of transport, including rail, road, walking and cycling in the Wellington region alone over the next ten years," says Pete Hodgson.

"Since coming to office, this government has worked hard to address the underinvestment and run down of our transport infrastructure through the second half of the 1990s. This government realises the importance of decent transport to our economy, local communities and the environment and is backing this with record funding, $18.7 billion over the next ten years."

Mr Hodgson noted that the commencement of work at MacKay's crossing was but one of a substantial number of land transport projects being undertaken in the Wellington region.

“Construction of the Inner City Bypass, costing $39.89 million, is soon to get underway. The $34.2 million Plimmerton to Paremata upgrade; including a new bridge at Paremata, should be completed by the middle of next year. Work is also continuing on the $14 million upgrading to SH2 north of Upper Hutt. The government has also made a contribution to refurbishing 36 Wellington rail passenger rolling stock. More funding for the Wellington rail network is likely to follow that.”

The construction of the bridge at MacKay's crossing is the result of the partnership approach to transport being taken by central and local government, community groups, Transfund and Transit. This approach was boosted earlier this month with green light being given to the Wellington Transport Project to investigate options for future transport projects and their funding in the region.
