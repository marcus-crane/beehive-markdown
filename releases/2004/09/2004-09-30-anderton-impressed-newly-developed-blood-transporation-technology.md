Jim Anderton, Minister of Economic Development and Associate Minister of Health, visited the production facilities and research laboratory of Temprecord International today to mark their successful project to develop temperature controlled transport bins for the New Zealand Blood Service.

"New Zealanders are doing a great job in producing innovative and successful technology. The temperature controlled blood transport bins developed in South Auckland's Temprecord laboratory are a great demonstration of how we can make it in the global marketplace with good ideas and top notch research. Even the Australians are after this product," Jim Anderton said.

The company has recently secured work with the Australian Blood Service.

The strict control of environmental conditions during transportation of blood products is of growing importance to a range of sectors.

The company also manufacture calibrated temperature and humidity monitoring devices, known as data loggers, which are certified to ISO 17025 standard.

In May 2003, Temprecord received a $61,950 Business Growth Grant to assist with the development and promotion of the firm, and ongoing research and development work.
