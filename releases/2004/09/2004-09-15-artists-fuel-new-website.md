A website launched today by Creative New Zealand and the Australia Council for the Arts will be a valuable resource for arts professionals, says Associate Arts Minister Judith Tizard.

The website [www.fuel4arts.co.nz](http://www.fuel4arts.co.nz) offers free advice on marketing and audience development from an international community of arts professionals.

"[Fuel4arts.com](http://www.fuel4arts.co.nz) has proven to be a highly effective tool for arts professionals across the Tasman. With the launch of the website here, New Zealand artists will have the opportunity to learn from and contribute to an on-line community of arts-marketers from around the world," said Judith Tizard.

Judith Tizard says the initiative is a direct response to research by Creative New Zealand that showed most New Zealand artists felt they needed more help in the areas of marketing and audience development.

The website includes arts marketing case studies, on-line forums, articles, trend reports, research and an up-to-date database of industry contacts.

New Zealand artists will benefit from content developed specifically to address local market issues and will also be able to communicate with, learn from and exchange ideas with international arts marketing professionals.

"The government is committed to developing an environment where arts professionals can thrive. Sharing knowledge on marketing and audience development is an important part of sustaining and growing the arts sector in New Zealand," said Judith Tizard.
