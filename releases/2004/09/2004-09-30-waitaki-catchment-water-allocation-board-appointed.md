Environment Minister Marian Hobbs today announced the five members of the Waitaki Catchment Water Allocation Board responsible for developing the regional water allocation plan for the Waitaki Catchment.

Board Chairperson is Alternate Environment Court Judge, David Sheppard, former Principal Judge of the Environment Court. "Judge Sheppard has considerable professional standing in the resource management area and has played a key role in many significant resource management cases," Marian Hobbs said.

Deputy Chairperson is Sheila Watson, a professional environmental manager with 20 years experience in the field. She is also a commissioner with the Environment Court.

Other Board members are:  
·Dr Nick Brown – an economist with expertise in agricultural economics related to irrigation schemes and similar developments.  
·Claire Mulcock – a resource management consultant with knowledge of water resources and the agricultural sector.  
·Edward Ellison – part-time iwi liaison advisor to Otago Regional Council and farmer.

"The Board reflects the right mix of specialist knowledge, qualifications and experience to get on with the important job of developing the regional plan for water allocation in the Waitaki Catchment. The plan is vital because no plan or policy basis currently exists to deal with the many competing applications to use water from the Waitaki River," Marian Hobbs said.

The Board is an independent, statutory body that has 12 months to develop and approve the water allocation plan. It has been established under the Resource Management (Waitaki Catchment) Amendment Act passed on September 9.

The Board is expected to meet shortly. Initially it will familiarise itself with its task and establish the procedures it will follow to produce the water allocation plan and review the information available.

"We expect the draft water allocation plan will be ready to be notified publicly early next year. There will be opportunities for interested parties and members of the public to get involved, make a submission and attend the hearing," Marian Hobbs said.

Once completed, the water allocation regional plan will be administered by Environment Canterbury (Canterbury Regional Council) under the Resource Management Act.

The Board will be serviced by staff in the Ministry for the Environment’s Christchurch Office.
