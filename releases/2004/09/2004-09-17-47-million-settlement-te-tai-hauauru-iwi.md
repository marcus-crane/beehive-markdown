Mita Ririnui, Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Treaty Negotiations, says the passing of the Maori Fisheries Act is probably one of the most significant pieces of Maori legislation to pass into law in the last 100 years.

After 13 years of waiting Maori will finally get to see the benefits of the [1992 fisheries settlement](http://www.tokm.co.nz/profiles/profiles/DeedofSettlement.pdf), says Mita Ririnui, "Iwi around the country will receive a share of about $750 million worth of cash and assets and Te Tai Hauauru Iwi can expect to receive a combined bundle of around $47 million.

"This is a substantial economic package that when combined with the allocation of 20 percent of all marine farming space, will give local Maori a leading role in the industry.

“Over the next few years, it will be important that [Te Ohu Kai Moana](http://www.tokm.co.nz/index.htm) ensures our representatives are fully trained to competently manage this extensive fisheries asset when allocation occurs.

"We also need to ensure that qualified Maori workers are retained within industry. These will be among the new challenges ahead," Mita Ririnui said.

The Commission continues to be a significant source of educational funding – again investing $1m in the last financial year towards training that puts Maori into the Fishing industry. It has also awarded over 1700 scholarships since 1994 and Maori now make up 30 percent of the entire fisheries industry workforce.

"This is an historic day as we focus on increasing the capability and capacity so that Maori can make the most of their own resources.

"This settlement will strengthen Maori communities as they look forward to developing to their full potential," said Mita Ririnui.

The following table represents the iwi specific figures for the substantive total.
