The Associate Minister of Housing Dover Samuels visited Awanui in Northland today, to see new housing built by 24 previously unemployed people.

Two new houses, which will be available as state rentals, are the result of a four-way initiative to improve housing and employment in Awanui.

Northland carpentry students of Unitec’s 36-week Certificate of Applied Technology course built the houses in Kaitaia. They were moved to Awanui earlier this year, where students and tutors added final touches.

The project has been a group effort: Te Runanga O Te Rarawa set-up the training initiative; Unitec provided the course curriculum; the Ministry of Social Development provided a mentoring programme; the New Zealand Housing Foundation provided seed capital to build the houses; and Housing New Zealand Corporation purchased the completed houses to add to their Northland rental base.

Dover Samuels applauded the collaborative approach.

As well as building two houses from scratch, some of these students were employed to do maintenance work on substandard housing in their community, through the Corporation’s Rural Housing Programme.

“A second carpentry course is underway and this class is building two more houses, which the Corporation will purchase to help meet the need for good quality rental homes in Northland,” Dover Samuels said.

Students will also test their new skills on seven kaumatua housing units, being built - with the support of a Corporation loan - in Kaitaia later this month.

The Corporation’s Rural Housing Programme aims to eliminate substandard housing in Northland, the East Coast and eastern Bay of Plenty. There are an estimated 3,500 houses in substandard condition in these areas.

The five-year programme funds state housing, loans for essential repairs, infrastructure improvements and community loans.

Dover Samuels said improving substandard housing in Northland required a broader view beyond simply fixing houses and infrastructure.

The Rural Housing Programme provides an immediate response to housing that is a risk to people’s health and safety, with sanitary sewerage disposal, clean drinking water and safer electrical wiring.“For these measures to be effective long-term, we also need to support iwi and local communities to build the skills and resources to maintain and improve their own homes.

"This is what we are seeing successfully with Te Runanga O Te Rarawa in Awanui,” Dover Samuels said.
