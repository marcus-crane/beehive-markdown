The Major Events Strategy announced today ensures that we make the most of top level events held in New Zealand, and maximise the economic returns for New Zealanders.

"Major events, like the America's Cup yacht race, have the potential to bring significant economic benefits to the region and the country. The America's Cup alone generated over $1 billion of economic activity for New Zealand, raised our international profile, showcased New Zealand products and expertise to the world and brought in new tourists," Jim Anderton, Minister for Economic Development said.

"Opportunities like that don't come along every day, so we need to ensure that we do what we can to make the most of them. By getting government agencies to work strategically, and in partnership with event organisers, we can maximise returns from the events on a more long term basis which creates greater potential to boost economic growth.

"The work done using this strategy will help to position New Zealand as a highly competitive and desirable destination for hosting major events," Jim Anderton said.

The Ministry of Tourism will undertake the secretariat function, as it has the expertise and networks required for the job. They will provide facilitation for major events and deal with applications and enquiries while the $12 million funding comes from Vote Economic, Industry and Regional Development (funds were announced in Budget 2004).

The Major Events Strategy sets out the strategic criteria for supporting major events based around three areas: economic gains, social and cultural benefits, and international exposure. Key goals include the retention of sustainable events; the growth of new and existing events; and attracting new major events to New Zealand.

Funding decisions will be made by the Inter-Agency Events Group. The Group will report every 6 months to the Minsters of Economic Develompent; Research, Science and Technology; Tourism; and Sport and Recreation.
