New Zealand businesses and consumers have been invited to comment on a proposed reform of the Australian product safety system, says Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard.

"I am delighted New Zealand has the opportunity to be an active participant in this review, which provides an opportunity to explore the potential for greater trans-Tasman harmonisation in consumer product safety," Judith Tizard said.

Judith Tizard says the discussion paper - [Review of the Australian Consumer Product Safety System](http://www.consumer.gov.au/html/Consumer_Product_Safety_Review/index.html) - raises a number of consumer product safety issues which are common to both New Zealand and Australia.

"A key focus is on dealing with unsafe products more swiftly, by emphasising the prevention of problems, rather than reacting once consumers have suffered harm. At the same time we need to recognise that consumers also want access to a range of safe products at affordable prices.”

Judith Tizard says the government will be looking closely at what comes out of the Australian review, prior to conducting its own review of New Zealand product safety standards.

"Competition law and consumer protection law are of fundamental importance to economic development and trade. Harmonising our laws in these areas is likely to be a focus as we seek to build on our Closer Economic Relations agreement with Australia." Judith Tizard said.

Submissions on the Australian review close on 5 November 2004. Copies of the discussion paper are available through the Ministry of Consumer Affairs website: [www.consumeraffairs.govt.nz](http://www.consumeraffairs.govt.nz/policyandlaw/discussionpapers/index.html)
