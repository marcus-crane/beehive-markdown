Acting Minister of Energy and Resources, Hekia Parata, today released a report from the Electricity Authority on the steps it has taken to improve electricity market performance.

“The report clearly shows the Electricity Authority has made significant progress in delivering priorities identified in the Ministerial review of the electricity market and Electricity Industry Act 2010,'' says Ms Parata.

"I am pleased with the progress that the Electricity Authority has made on delivering a more competitive, responsive and responsible electricity sector for the long-term benefit of all New Zealand electricity consumers.''

The Electricity Authority was required to report to the Minister by 1 November 2011 on changes it was required to give effect to under section 42 of the Electricity Industry Act 2010.

Since it was established in November 2010, the Electricity Authority has:

• introduced a requirement for electricity retailers to compensate consumers during public conservation campaigns

• facilitated the development of an active hedge market for electricity

• introduced measures that encourage the industry to better manage risks associated with supply shortfalls

• enabled the wholesale electricity market to hedge spot price differences between the North and South Islands

• introduced measures to assist large electricity consumers to adjust their electricity use and be rewarded for reducing their load

• continued work to standardise network tariff structures and use-of-system agreements.

“The Authority has addressed many issues that have been contentious. I commend the Authority for achieving considerable headway on problems that have remained unresolved for so long.

“I’m confident that the Electricity Authority will continue to work on further measures to reduce costs and improve competition and security of supply,” says Ms Parata.
