The Crown and Tāmaki Collective* have signed a Record of Agreement of the agreements reached in settlement negotiations to this point, Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson announced today.

“The Record of Agreement is a significant milestone and will form the basis for a deed of settlement about the Collective members’ shared interests to be initialled at a later date,” Mr Finlayson said.

The Record of Agreement builds on the Framework Agreement signed by the Crown and the Tāmaki Collective in February 2010. The settlement involves the transfer of 15 volcanic cones or maunga, including One Tree Hill and Mt Eden, which were announced when the Framework Agreement was signed, and four additional sites added in subsequent negotiations: Mt Albert, Mt Smart, North Head Historic Reserve and Wiri Historic Reserve.

“Ownership is being transferred to the Tämaki Collective because of the historic, spiritual and culture significance of the maunga,” Mr Finlayson said. “There will be no changes to public access and third party rights including infrastructure, buildings and leases will be protected. The cones will be co-governed by a body made up of Auckland Council, the Tāmaki Collective and a Crown representative, ensuring everyone is heard in the future governance of the volcanic cones.”

The co-governance arrangement will be a significant development towards a unified management regime for Auckland’s volcanic cones.

“The next step in the journey is to use this agreement to finalise the detail of a Deed of Settlement” said the Minister.

The members of the Tāmaki Collective will also enter into individual settlements of their particular historical grievances.
