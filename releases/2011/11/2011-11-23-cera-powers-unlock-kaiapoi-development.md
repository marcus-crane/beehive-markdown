The Government has used the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act to approve changes to the Waimakariri District Plan, freeing up 550 sections at the Silverstream Estates development in west Kaiapoi.

Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says the plan change lifts the conditional approval status placed on the land by Waimakariri District Council commissioners in September, which required adjacent land to be developed before Silverstream could proceed.

The change enables sections to go on sale almost immediately.

“The Silverstream development will comprise 550 sections or house and land packages, with the first 400 sections available for sale from next month,” Mr Brownlee said.

The decision follows the earlier use of CERA powers to change the Canterbury Regional Policy Statement, allowing parts of Kaiapoi to be exempt from noise contour restrictions imposed by Christchurch International Airport.

This exemption was specifically provided to ensure more residential areas could be developed, following the red zone classification of thousands of homes after the Canterbury earthquakes.

Mr Brownlee says the new changes will provide more opportunities for people, particularly those living in Kaiapoi’s red zone, to remain in the area.

“A significant number of the sections will accommodate smaller units designed for older people, and there is a small shopping centre planned that will provide for essential community needs.

“CERA has worked with the Waimakariri District Council, Ecan and Silverstream Estates Limited to ensure these changes can be made quickly with the aim of giving people displaced by the earthquakes as many options as possible.”

CERA is responsible for coordinating and leading the rebuild of Canterbury and supporting the welfare of its residents. For more information visit [www.cera.govt.nz](http://www.cera.govt.nz)
