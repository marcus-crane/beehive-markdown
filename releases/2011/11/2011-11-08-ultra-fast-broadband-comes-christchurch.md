The government’s ultra fast broadband (UFB) initiative is now underway in Christchurch, with the first fibre laid today in Aidanfield.

The Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Steven Joyce, says ultra fast broadband will assist the transformation of the Canterbury economy.

Under the UFB initiative Enable Networks is contracted to roll out fibre-optic cable to across Christchurch and in Rangiora.

The most immediate benefit is job creation - over 200 new Christchurch based jobs at Enable and Transfield Services Ltd are being created in the short-term to deliver the project.

An analysis of the potential economic impact of the UFB project completed by Canterbury Development Corporation (supported by Market Economics Ltd) indicated that the UFB would generate 3,307 extra jobs in Christchurch by 2031, as compared to projected employment without UFB.

"Ultra-fast broadband provides opportunities for businesses to work in new ways, schools to connect students to resources around the globe and for specialist medical expertise to be available in more places through technologies like high-definition video conferencing,” says Mr Joyce.

"Because we’re delivering fibre to the door, ultra-fast speeds will also be available at home, driving increased connectivity and access to new media and applications.

"The fibre-optic network will be open to retailers on equal terms, boosting market competition.

“Wholesale prices will be as low as half the price of current offerings for business services and residential customers will enjoy a vastly improved service for as much as they currently pay, or less,” Mr Joyce says.

The Enable Networks’ deployment connect a combined population of more than 380,000, including about 7,000 businesses, some 1,000 medical centres and 170 schools. The roll out will be completed over an eight year period and is supported by a Crown contribution of more than $200 million.

Overall the $1.5 billion Ultra-fast Broadband Initiative will see 75 per cent of New Zealanders able to access speeds of 100Mbps or more before 2020.
