Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has today announced the green zoning of 8300 non-residential properties across greater Christchurch which were previously in the un-mapped white zone.

The 8300 properties are a mixture of commercial and industrial properties, Ministry of Education and District Health Board land, parks and reserves, other community facilities such as halls, churches and child care facilities, and undeveloped private land.

"The focus of land zoning to date has been on residential properties as the Government has strived to provide certainty and viable options for quake-affected families as soon as we possibly could.

"Today’s announcement clears the way for normal insurance and consenting processes to determine where rebuilding and repairs on a large number of non-residential properties can occur," Mr Brownlee said.

"The owners of previously white zoned non-residential property needed clear guidance so they could progress using the insurance processes and consenting procedures that apply to their properties, and we’ve delivered that today."

The rezoning effectively confirms and extends the Government's 12 September 2011 announcement of an interim process which enabled owners of non-residential property in the white zone to begin rebuilding and repairing their property if an appropriate geotechnical report was submitted with their building consent applications.

"It is still important that all non-residential land owners covered by today's announcement understand that specific engineering assessment of their land will be required and that such assessments may lead to detailed site-specific geotechnical investigation and foundation design," Mr Brownlee said.

Property owners can confirm their re-zoning by visiting www.landcheck.org.nz or phoning 0800 RING CERA (0800 7464 2372).

CERA is responsible for rebuilding greater Christchurch and its surrounds, and supporting the welfare of its residents. For more information on today’s announcement, including maps, visit [www.cera.govt.nz](http://www.cera.govt.nz)
