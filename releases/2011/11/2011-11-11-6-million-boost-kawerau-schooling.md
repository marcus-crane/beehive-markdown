Education Minister Anne Tolley says the Government is set to invest $6 million in establishing a new secondary school in Kawerau, to provide modern learning environments and help boost student achievement.

The new year 7-13 school will provide excellent 21st Century facilities for students in new and refurbished buildings on the current Kawerau College site, with separate campuses for middle and senior school students.

It follows extensive community consultation on how local schools, facing falling rolls and funding reductions, should be reorganised to provide the best possible education for students.

The new school will open at the start of 2013, following the closure of Kawerau College and Kawerau Intermediate at the end of 2012.

“The new school, and the $6 million in new funding, will be a great boost for Kawerau students, the community and the local economy,” says Mrs Tolley.

“The larger school will have the benefit of increased funding and more subject choices for students in modern state of the art classrooms.

“It will also cater for both middle and senior school students on two distinct campuses, which we know through consultation is important to parents.”

The College and Intermediate schools now have 28 days to respond, before a final decision is made.

The Ministry of Education will continue to work closely with the schools during this process.
