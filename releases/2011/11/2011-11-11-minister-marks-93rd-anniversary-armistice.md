On the 93rd anniversary of the end of the First World War, Veterans’ Affairs Minister Judith Collins has today paid tribute to those who fought and died in the conflict.

On the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918, the Allies signed an Armistice with Germany ending hostilities after more than four years of war.

“Today we commemorate the end of the First World War, and remember the men and women who served our nation,” Ms Collins said.

“More than 100,000 New Zealanders served overseas during the First World War. More than 18,000 New Zealanders were killed, and a further 50,000 wounded.

“They served with distinction on distant shores, and fought in battles at Gallipoli, on the Western Front and in Sinai.

“We honour those men who made the ultimate sacrifice to defend everything that is good about this country and our way of life.

“On Armistice Day we also pay tribute to those who have served our country since then in times of war, and in peace. Our thoughts are with current members of the New Zealand Defence Force who are serving overseas.

“We thank them for their commitment to peace and stability in our world and look forward to their safe return home.”

Ms Collins will be the guest speaker at a wreath laying service to commemorate Armistice Day this Sunday in Auckland.
