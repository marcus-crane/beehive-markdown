Community and Voluntary Sector Minister, Tariana Turia, has congratulated the 2011 recipients of the Dynamic Community Learning Awards, who received their awards today at Putiki Marae in Whanganui.

“I am so proud of the amazing contribution so many groups make to enhancing our communities”.

“These awards are a way of ‘giving back’ to these people – recognising the generosity of spirit that characterises their commitment to community”.

“I was really impressed by Innermost’s vision of growing community through getting our hands in the soil” Mrs Turia said.

Innermost Gardens Inc (Wellington) is a multicultural group working in community gardens to learn from one another in their ambition to create a healthy, more sustainable future. They run workshops and their gardening days are open to the whole community.

“I want to also acknowledge the collaborative effort to protecting community safety being demonstrated by Wellington Sexual Abuse Network - a collaboration of sexual abuse survivor agencies and an offender agency - Wellington Rape Crisis, Wellington Sexual Abuse HELP Foundation and WellStop. These groups have come together to prevent sexual violence using a community development perspective.

“Their education programmes include

• ‘Sex and Ethics’ and ‘School Balls’ programmes for young people,

• ‘It’s Our Business’ workshops for bar staff,

• ‘Clinical Workshop’ for clinical therapists; and

• ‘Ethical Bystander’ training for groups with an on-the-street presence to disrupt precursor situations for unwanted sexual contact.”

Highly commended awards have gone to Manurewa Parenting Hub, Upper Hutt City Library and the Families in Cultural Transition (FiCT) programme.

“It is a stunning way to launch off Adult Learners' Week/He Tangata Mātauranga by being able to celebrate the successes and achievements of everyone participating in Adult and Community Education. When times are hard, community learning provides a vital foundation in strengthening communities, to build confidence, acquire new skills and add to the quality of our lives”.

“Full praise must go to all of our community heroes, who do so much to grow our communities”.
