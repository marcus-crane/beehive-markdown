Health Minister Tony Ryall has announced that the National government has approved a major redevelopment worth more than $3 million for Te Awhina, the Whanganui District Health Board's acute inpatient mental health unit.

Mr Ryall announced the approval during a visit to the DHB with local MP Chester Borrows today.

Mr Ryall says "This is great news for the patients and staff at Te Awhina. The community has been calling for improvements in the mental health unit and this upgrade will be a huge help. This is a welcome investment in better mental health care for Whanganui."

"Recent reviews of the unit by the Mental Health Commission and Director of Mental Health identified several problems including substandard bedrooms and bathrooms, lack of flexible spaces, a lack of privacy, and poor heating and ventilation.

"That's why the Government and DHB are moving to redesign, refurbish and upgrade its mental health unit.

"We are committed to improving services for Whanganui people"

The final cost of the project will be determined once the successful tender for the project has been decided.
