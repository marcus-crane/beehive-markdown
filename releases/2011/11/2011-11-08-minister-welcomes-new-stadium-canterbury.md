Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has welcomed today's announcement that a new temporary stadium will be built in Christchurch in time for next year's Super Rugby season.

"I'm absolutely delighted the Government has been able to pull together this deal to fund building the new temporary stadium in Christchurch," Mr Brownlee says.

"This means Cantabrians don't have to miss out on major sporting and music events for another year and will have many great occasions to look forward to," he says.

The stadium will be constructed using some of innovative techniques developed for 'The Cloud' venue on Auckland's waterfront and the Westpac Business Hub in Christchurch, Mr Brownlee says.

"The facilities will be up to international match standard with television broadcast facilities, lighting, and facilities for players and officials."

The stadium will be managed by a Trust and a full programme of events for 2012 is being developed.

"The Crusaders are New Zealand's most successful rugby franchise, with seven Super Rugby titles,” Mr Brownlee said.

"As a proud Cantabrian, I'm looking forward to being at the Crusaders’ first home game in the Super Rugby competition next year to cheer them on.

“I also know there will be keen interest in seeing the Wellington Phoenix football team and major rugby league games at the new facility.

"Along with the launch of the Re:Start project in Cashel Mall last month, this sends a strong signal that Christchurch is open for business and on the road to recovery."
