Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced over $5 million in funding to support five schools to replace seven classroom blocks, in the latest example of the Government’s commitment to upgrade and modernise school buildings.

More than 500 major building modernisation projects have already been completed, including over 270 new classrooms and gyms and more than 140 libraries, halls and administration blocks.

“This Government recognises the importance of modern, effective teaching and learning environments and the difference they can make for students, staff and school communities,” says Mrs Tolley.

“This latest funding will ensure that these new classrooms, which will replace buildings that are no longer economic to refurbish and maintain, meet the changing needs of our students so they can use the latest technology in the decades ahead.” 

The five schools receiving funding are:

- Whitiroa School – Hamilton ($1.25 million)
- Matauri Bay School – Northland ($148,700)
- Woodleigh School - New Plymouth ($653,000)
- Lyall Bay School – Wellington ($1.18 million)
- Papatoetoe High School – Auckland ($1.8 million)

“These schools will also benefit by not having to pay for the substantial maintenance cost of the existing buildings,” says Mrs Tolley.

“But this is all about students, and giving every child the chance to reach their potential is at the heart of everything we do.”
