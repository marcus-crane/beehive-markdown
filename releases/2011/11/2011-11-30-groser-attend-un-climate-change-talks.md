Minister Responsible for International Climate Change Negotiations Tim Groser will travel to Durban, South Africa, from 1-11 December to attend the annual ministerial conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

“New Zealand will be looking for progress towards a comprehensive global agreement with binding emission-reduction commitments. These commitments need to include all developed countries as well as advanced and major-emitting developing countries.

“Only a comprehensive agreement will make a real difference to climate change,” Mr Groser says.

Durban will be the first full meeting at Ministerial level since last December in Cancun, and will build on the successful outcomes of the 2010 meeting, which Mr Groser played a central chairing role in.

A key question for Durban is whether countries agree to a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol.

“Regardless of the outcome on Kyoto, our work at Durban will mark a transition towards the longer-term outcome of a comprehensive global agreement. There is still strong political leadership and commitment to tackling this global issue, and Durban needs to send that message,” Mr Groser says.

Climate Change Minister Nick Smith will travel to Durban on 4 December to join Mr Groser for the Ministerial segment of the conference.
