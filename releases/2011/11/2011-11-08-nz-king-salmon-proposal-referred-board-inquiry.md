The New Zealand King Salmon Company Limited’s (NZKS) proposal to establish eight new salmon faming sites in the Marlborough Sounds has been sent directly to an independent Board of Inquiry under the Government’s nationally significant proposal process with the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA), Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson and Environment Minister Nick Smith announced today.

“NZKS’s proposal involves two plan change requests and nine resource consent applications for eight new salmon farming sites in Pelorus Sound, Port Gore, Tory Channel and Queen Charlotte Sound,” Ms Wilkinson says. 

“This is a large expansion and meets the national significance criteria as it would involve considerable use of natural resources and impact an area of national significance and its environment.

“These effects need to be weighed up alongside the economic benefits and therefore I am directing this proposal to an independent Board of Inquiry for consideration.

“A Board of Inquiry, chaired by an Environment Court Judge and comprising members with local knowledge and relevant technical expertise and experience, is the most appropriate way to assess the merits of the proposal and decide its future.”

Environment Court Judge Gordon Whiting will chair the Board of Inquiry. The Board members are Edward Ellison, Helen Beaumont, Mark Farnsworth and Michael Briggs.

The proposal will be considered under recent aquaculture legislative amendments that allow for plan change requests and resource consent applications in relation to aquaculture to be made concurrently, where aquaculture is currently a prohibited activity.

Environment Minister Nick Smith says that the new nationally significant proposal process with the EPA was delivering real benefits for the community.

“The Board of Inquiry process for considering this proposal will provide an opportunity for all interested parties to have their views considered, while ensuring a robust and timely decision is made,” Dr Smith says.

“The Board of Inquiry will now determine whether to accept or reject the plan change request.  Should the board accept the request it will be prepared by Marlborough District Council.  The complete proposal (plan change requests and resource consent applications) will be publicly notified by the EPA in 2012.”
