The Crown signed a Deed of Settlement for all outstanding historical Treaty claims with Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei today, Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson announced.

The deed was signed in a ceremony on Auckland’s Okahu Bay. The Crown was represented by Mr Finlayson, Minister of Defence (and Auckland MP) Dr Wayne Mapp, Minister of Maori Affairs Hon Pita Sharples, and Associate Minister of Maori Affairs Hon Georgina te Heuheu. Maungakiekie MP Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga also attended.

“Ngāti Whatua Orakei lost virtually all their land as a result of the past actions of the Crown and now is the time to right the wrongs of the past,” Mr Finlayson said. “This settlement breathes new life into the relationship between Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei and the Crown, and will bring benefit to all the people of Auckland.”

Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei will receive a financial and commercial redress worth $18 million, which includes $2 million already received by Ngāti Whātua Örākei as redress for the 1993 Railways settlement, and the return of the culturally significant site, Purewa Creek Conservation Area. Public access will not be affected.

In addition Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei will purchase a block of vacant NZDF land at Wakakura Crescent and purchase and lease back land at Narrow Neck and five NZDF housing areas in Devonport, using the financial redress received in the settlement and their own funds.

“This is a robust and durable settlement for Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei - one that will hold both parties in good stead for the future,” Mr Finlayson said. “The signing of this deed also shows the real progress being made towards resolving historical grievances in the complex and important Tāmaki Makaurau area.”

Ngāti Whātua o Ōrākei will receive redress over maunga (volcanic cones) on the Tāmaki isthmus through the settlement being negotiated between the Crown and Ngā Mana Whenua o Tāmaki Makaurau (the Tāmaki Collective).
