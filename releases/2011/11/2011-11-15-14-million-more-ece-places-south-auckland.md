Education Minister Anne Tolley says the Government is investing $1.4 million to help build new early childhood education services in South Auckland, which will create another 211 ECE places for families.

Two new services and three extensions to existing services will be built in areas of high need in Weymouth West, Papakura North and Mt Wellington South.

The property funding is part of the Government’s $91.8 million investment in intensive participation projects in high priority areas, which is creating 3500 more ECE places.

“Too many children are currently missing out on ECE, which is why we are targeting specific communities,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Today’s announcement will mean that hundreds more children will be able to enjoy the benefits of quality early childhood education.”

Kids Count and Learning Houses Limited will receive $1.09 million to build two new ECE services in Papakura North and Weymouth West.

Cariad Charitable Trust will receive $125,000 to extend the existing ECE service by building an adjacent centre in Mt Wellington South.

You and Me Limited will receive $181,000 to extend two existing ECE services in Papakura North (Drury) and Weymouth West.

It’s estimated that the building projects will be completed by late 2013.

“We are committed to ensuring that children get the best possible start in life, and this year we are investing over $1.4 billion in early childhood education, which is 38 per cent more than in 2008,” says Mrs Tolley.

“An extra $550.3 million will be spent in ECE over the next four years, to allow as many families as possible to access quality services where they are needed the most.”
