Police Minister Judith Collins today opened the new Manurewa Police Station, and paid tribute to the work of local Police in reducing crime.

The station, which cost around $6 million, will be the base for 173 Police staff. The building replaces the old station which was too small for the growing number of Police in Manurewa.

Around 50 of the 300 new frontline officers deployed by the Government in Counties-Manukau are based at Manurewa.

“With all those extra officers, the Manurewa Police team outgrew the old station,” Ms Collins said.

“The solution was to build a new station – one that wasn’t only bigger than the old one, but much better suited to the needs of a Police team that is achieving such great results in this district.”

Ms Collins said that over the past three years Manurewa Police had contributed to a turnaround in crime in Counties-Manukau.

“Prior to 2008, Counties-Manukau had some of the worst crime statistics in the country. The situation is now very different with crime falling 9.5 percent in the 2010 calendar year and 6.1 percent in the fiscal year ended June 30 2011.

“Our New Zealand Police deserve plenty of support, good tools and good working conditions to keep winning the war against crime.

“This includes modern, well-equipped Police, stations such as this new facility, that allow them to perform at their best.”
