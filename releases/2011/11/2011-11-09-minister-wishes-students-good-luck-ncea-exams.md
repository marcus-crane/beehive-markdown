Education Minister Anne Tolley has wished students the best of luck for this year’s NCEA exams which get underway tomorrow.

More than 143,000 candidates are preparing for the NCEA and NZ Scholarship exams, which continue until 30 November.

“The Government is ambitious for every single New Zealand student,” says Mrs Tolley.

“I know students all over the country are studying hard, and I want to wish them all the very best of luck in the days ahead,” says Mrs Tolley.

“I hope they can perform to the best of their ability and achieve the results they want, as they prepare for further study or employment.

“I also want to thank parents and teachers for the support they have given, and will continue to give, as we enter the exam season.”

NCEA results are due to be posted online in the first half of January.
