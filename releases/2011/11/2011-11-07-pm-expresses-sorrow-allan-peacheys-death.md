Prime Minister John Key today expressed his sadness at news of the death of Allan Peachey, the National MP for Tamaki, who passed away on Sunday morning.

“Allan was a very respected and effective Member of Parliament, who represented his constituents well since he was elected in 2005,” says Mr Key. “I also want to acknowledge Allan’s hard work as chairman of Parliament’s education and science select committee over the past three years.” 

“Allan was principal of Rangitoto College from 1993 to 2005, and had considerable expertise and interest in education policy.

“He wrote the book “*What’s Up With Our Schools*” published in 2005, and wrote numerous articles on education issues. Between 1998 and 2000 he was also president of the Secondary Principals’ Association. 

“Allan also had extensive involvement in the community including Plunket, kindergartens and primary schools, and sports organisations.”

“Despite suffering ill-health in recent years, Allan was committed to continue doing his job and represent the people of Tamaki.   He showed determination and courage to keep carrying out his role in the face of illness.

“My condolences and thoughts go out to Allan’s family, friends and colleagues at this time.  My intention is to attend Allan’s funeral later this week.”
