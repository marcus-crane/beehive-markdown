Court Registrars and court staff across Christchurch and Canterbury had given extraordinary service to ensure the continuity of justice services for Christchurch following the February 22nd earthquake, Courts Minister Georgina te Heuheu said today.

Mrs te Heuheu made the comments as she visited courthouses at Timaru, Ashburton and Rangiora to talk with staff and thank them for their work since the earthquake.

“The impact of the Christchurch earthquake on court and justice services has seen the Ministry of Justice innovate and respond with new ways of working,” Mrs te Heuheu says.

“This has meant moving away from the traditional way of working, with its focus on single jurisdictions, and courtrooms used for specific purposes.

“It has involved looking beyond traditional court boundaries, and seeking the co-operation of courts outside of Christchurch to help maintain access to justice for the people of Christchurch.

“Keeping justice services running has required a high degree of co-ordination and collaboration. Staff have shown a willingness to work in different jurisdictions, and to relocate for limited periods of time, to ensure service continuity.

“The efforts of staff across the region have been outstanding. I am incredibly impressed by the level of support and hard work that has been provided over the past eight months,” Mrs te Heuheu says.

Timaru District Court has played a key role in providing Christchurch court services, and has been the primary mainstay for Christchurch jury trials since April.

An additional 51 jury trials have been held in Timaru between April and October, and a further 15 are scheduled before the end of the year.

"The Timaru community have also played their part in performing their civic duty as jurors at these trials," Mrs te Heuheu says.

Ashburton District Court is being used by a variety of different jurisdictions including the District and High Courts, the Family Court as well as specialist tribunal hearings such as the Accident Compensation Appeal Authority and the Motor Vehicle Disputes Tribunal.

Rangiora District Court has been used as Christchurch’s arrest court since March. Its proximity to Christchurch means it has played a vital role in keeping justice services available.

“The single courtroom at Rangiora District Court had previously been in use for around two days a week, but that swiftly moved to six days of sitting time after the earthquake," Mrs te Heuheu says.

"It is the only facility in the wider Christchurch area with secure custodial facilities/cells, and is also used for criminal defended hearings and custodial sentencing hearings."

Visiting court staff and thanking them for their sterling effort in challenging times had been very worthwhile, Mrs te Heuheu said.
