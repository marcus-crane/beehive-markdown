The number of New Zealanders on Unemployment Benefits dropped by 791 last month says Social Development and Employment Minister Paula Bennett.

“There are 13,500 fewer people on Unemployment Benefits since the peak last January and about half of that decrease is made up of young people.”

“We’ve seen 549 fewer 18-24 year olds on the Unemployment Benefit over the last month, which is fantastic,” says Ms Bennett.

There are 54,870 New Zealanders on the Unemployment Benefit and 330,755 people on all benefits.

“Last month 6,700 people cancelled their benefit because they got a job and I congratulate every one of those individuals because I know it’s not easy.”

"But, you won't find a job unless you're looking."

While there are fewer on the Unemployment Benefit, the number of those on the DPB and Sickness Benefits rose in October.

“The Government’s welfare reform package, with more support up-front will reset expectations around working for those on the Sickness and Domestic Purposes Benefits.”

The investment approach will see greater support for those who are capable of work, but are at risk of staying on welfare long-term without some help.
