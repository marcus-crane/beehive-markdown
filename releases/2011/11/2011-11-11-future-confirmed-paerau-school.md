Education Minister Anne Tolley says Paerau School in Central Otago is to remain open following a final decision on its future.

Consultation on its possible closure had taken place after the roll had fallen to just two students.

The school roll has now increased to 10 students, helped by community support to keep families in the rural area.

“I needed to make sure this boost in numbers wasn’t temporary, and that there wouldn’t be another drastic roll drop, before making a final decision,” says Mrs Tolley.

“The Ministry’s final report shows that families have settled permanently in the area, and I am now satisfied that the school should remain open.

“The Board of Trustees advises that roll levels are expected to remain stable over the next few years, and I want to thank the school and the community for their valuable feedback.

“This decision will provide certainty for families, and there will be a review during 2013 to ensure things are working as planned.”
