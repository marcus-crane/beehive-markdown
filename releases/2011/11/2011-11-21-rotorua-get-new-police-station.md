Rotorua is to get a new Police Station that will enable local Police to serve the community better, Police Minister Judith Collins announced today.

Demolition of the existing station, which is more than 40 years old, is scheduled to take place in May 2012 and construction will begin soon after. The new station is expected to be operational by October 2013.

The overall project cost, which will be subject to a competitive tender, is expected to be $18.5 million.

“Our New Zealand Police deserve plenty of support, good tools and good working conditions to keep winning the war against crime,” Ms Collins said.

“This includes modern, well-equipped Police stations that allow them to perform at their best.

“Rotorua has grown and flourished over the past 40 years. While the current station has served Rotorua well, it is no longer able to support the needs of modern policing.

“The new station will be purpose built to allow staff to work together more efficiently, provide improved access for the public, and for Police to serve this community better.”

The demolition and construction will have no impact on Police services.

During demolition and construction most Rotorua Police services will relocate to a temporary location across the road from the existing site in Fenton St.
