The interception of a large amount of the drug GBL is proof of the success Police and Customs achieve in the fight against crime, Police Minister Judith Collins and Customs Minister Maurice Williamson said today.

Last month Customs officers intercepted a package from Hong Kong at the International Mail Centre.

The package contents were declared as a cleaning chemical. But analysis showed the 24.24 kg of liquid was the Class ‘B’ Controlled Drug Gamma Butyrolactone commonly known as GBL or Fantasy.

A search warrant was executed at an Invercargill address and a 31 year old Invercargill man appeared in the Invercargill District Court yesterday on charges of importing and possession for supply of GBL. He also faces a further charge of possession of methamphetamine for supply.

The approximate street value for the GBL is between $100,000 and $150,000.

“The seizure of such a significant amount of GBL show the excellent co-operation between Police and Customs in the fight against crime,” Ms Collins said.

Mr Williamson said the interception sends a clear message to people that if you attempt to import drugs – you will get caught.

“This drug is a danger to our society and needs to be off the streets and away from our families.”

GBL has been a Class B controlled drug since 2002. The maximum jail term for importation and possession for supply of a Class B controlled drug is 14 years imprisonment
