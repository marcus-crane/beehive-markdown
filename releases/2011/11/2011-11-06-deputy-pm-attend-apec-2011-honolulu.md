Deputy Prime Minister Bill English will attend the 19th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders meeting on 13 November in Honolulu, USA.

Mr English will join leaders from 21 APEC economies to discuss the region's economic growth prospects and ways to advance APEC's vision for an Asia-Pacific-wide Free Trade Area.

"APEC supports closer trade and economic relationships in the region, making it easier for members to trade and invest in each other’s economies," Mr English says.

"This includes initiatives to make it easier, cheaper and faster for New Zealand companies to do business in the region.

"That's vital if we want to sell more goods and services to the rest of the world and build a faster-growing economy with higher incomes and more real jobs."

While attending APEC, Mr English will also hold a number of bilateral meetings, as well as participate in the APEC CEO Summit and other associated events.

"Closely following on from the G20 Summit in France, APEC will be an important opportunity for leaders to reaffirm their commitment to regional growth and multilateral trade," Mr English says.

Foreign Minister Murray McCully and Trade Minister Tim Groser will also travel to Honolulu to attend ministerial meetings as part of the leaders week.

Mr English departs for Honolulu on 11 November, while Mr McCully departs on 10 November and Mr Groser on 8 November.
