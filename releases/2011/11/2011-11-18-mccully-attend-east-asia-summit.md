Foreign Minister Murray McCully is representing New Zealand at the 6th East Asia Summit (EAS), being held in Bali, Indonesia, on November 18th-19th.

“The East Asia Summit is significantly expanding with both the United States and Russia attending the summit for the first time,” said Mr McCully.

“An important issue being discussed is economic integration within East Asia. ASEAN members are interested in consolidating bilateral FTAs with existing partners, including New Zealand and Australia, into a wider agreement,” said Mr McCully.

“The summit will also discuss ways to improve disaster relief cooperation in the region and how to mobilise resources quickly and effectively at times of need.”

The East Asia Summit was established in 2005 and comprises the 10 members of ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and eight others – Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, and new members Russia and the US.

Mr McCully is representing New Zealand at the meeting as Prime Minister John Key is unable attend due to election commitments.
