Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce has approved open access deeds of undertaking provided by the government’s broadband partners.

The deeds set out the requirements for open access on the Ultra-fast Broadband and Rural Broadband networks, and on Telecom’s copper network after structural separation.

All local fibre companies that are involved in the roll-out of Ultra-Fast Broadband, plus the Government’s Rural Broadband Initiative partners, have submitted deeds including: Telecom – on behalf of Chorus, Enable Networks, Ultra-fast Broadband Limited, the Whangarei Local Fibre Company and Vodafone New Zealand.

The Minister has decided that the deeds, as submitted, meet the requirements set out in the amended Telecommunications Act 2001.

Mr Joyce says a robust open access environment is vital to the success of faster broadband in New Zealand.

“These deeds will encourage a competitive marketplace for faster broadband services.”

The Minister had previously declined to approve the draft Deed submitted by Telecom on behalf of Chorus in relation to the copper network. The new Copper Deed has been modified to reflect the Minister’s feedback. Comparable changes have also been incorporated in the other new Deeds submitted by Telecom, the local fibre companies, and Vodafone.

Letters have been sent to the government’s Ultra-Fast Broadband and Rural Broadband partners setting out the Minister’s decision.

Copies of the letters and the deeds are available on the Ministry of Economic Development website www.med.govt.nz/ultra-fast-broadband. The deeds will also be available on the website of each local fibre company and Rural Broadband partner, within ten working days.

 

**Background**

Telecom’s deed of undertaking in relation to its copper business sets out the requirements for open access on Chorus’s legacy fixed copper network, after structural separation occurs. Telecom shareholders voted in favour of proceeding with structural separation at a shareholder meeting on 26 October 2011. Telecom’s initial copper deed of undertaking was not accepted and an amended deed was submitted on 6 October 2011.

Fibre deeds were submitted by all local fibre companies on 6 and 7 October 2011.

The initial Rural Broadband deed from Telecom, on behalf of Chorus, was amended to deal with issues common to the copper deed and resubmitted on 5 October 2011.

Vodafone’s initial Rural Broadband deed was amended following feedback from officials and resubmitted on 22 September 2011.
