The Associate Minister of Health and Minister for Disability Issues Tariana Turia today announced the launch of the Choice in Community Living programme in the Auckland and Waikato regions.

Choice in Community Living is about supporting disabled people who want to move from residential services, where they live in a house owned or rented by their support provider, to a home of their own.

The programme aims to assist disabled people to build a life like other New Zealanders through connection to natural supports and the wider community.

“This programme will make a big difference in the lives of disabled people through having control of the disability support services they use and a greater say when it comes to where they live and who they live with,” says Minister Turia

“I am so pleased that we are listening to the calls of disabled persons and their families to live the life they choose” said Mrs Turia.

“Choice in Community Living will encourage family and whanau to play a role in supporting disabled people alongside paid support provided by NGOs. There will also be opportunities to explore the use of assistive technology in supporting disabled people to live safely in their homes.

“The Ministry of Health is in the process of expanding individualised funding and a new model for supporting disabled people which is giving people more choice and control over the supports they receive is being demonstrated in the Western Bay of Plenty. I am hopeful that all of these initiatives brought together will improve the lives of people with disabilities.
