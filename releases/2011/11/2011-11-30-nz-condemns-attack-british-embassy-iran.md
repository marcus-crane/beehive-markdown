Foreign Minister Murray McCully has expressed serious concern over the storming of the two British Embassy compounds in Tehran yesterday.

“The storming of the British Embassy in Iran was totally unacceptable” Mr McCully said.

“We join other Governments and the United Nations Security Council in condemning the attacks and calling on the Iranian Government to take action against those responsible.

“We urge the Iranian Government to take control of the situation and protect diplomatic properties and staff, in line with their commitments under the Vienna Convention.

“New Zealand is thankful there was no loss of life as a result of the attacks on the British Embassy and we expect the Iranian Government to ensure there is no repeat of yesterday’s violence against diplomats and their families.

"The New Zealand Embassy in Iran was not impacted by the violent protests and our diplomatic staff are all accounted for."

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade advises New Zealanders in Iran to keep a low profile, avoid all public demonstrations, rallies and large public gatherings, and leave any areas where police or security forces are deployed.
