Defence Minister Wayne Mapp has announced that a United States company, JDI Holdings, is going to buy the eight remaining Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) retired Skyhawk fighters.

“I am also announcing today that Aermacchis and Strikemasters no longer needed by the RNZAF will go to aviation museums around New Zealand,” said Dr Mapp.

“The Skyhawks, Aermacchis and Strikemasters are an important part of New Zealand’s aviation history and they will make fine exhibits in our aviation museums.”

Dr Mapp said agreement has been reached on a $7.9 million purchase price for the eight Skyhawks including engines and spare parts. The deal depends on approval from the US State Department.

“This is the resolution of what has been a long process,” said Dr Mapp.  It is expected that JDI Holdings – which intends to fly the Skyhawks – will take delivery of the planes within six months.

“JDI Holdings know the Skyhawk well,” said the Minister, “and are a fitting purchaser to write the next chapter in the history of these aircraft.”

The other nine Skyhawks of the original fleet of 17 have been permanently loaned to museums around New Zealand, and one museum in Australia.

Aermacchis will go to six aviation museums, with a further three museums still to confirm their acceptance.

Some Aermacchis will stay at the RNZAF’s Ground Training Wing in Woodbourne and may be used as non-flying training aids replacing the Strikemasters used for that purpose.

One Strikemaster will be offered to MOTAT, and three to other museums.
