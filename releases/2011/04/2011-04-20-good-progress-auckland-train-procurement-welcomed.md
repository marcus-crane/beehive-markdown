Transport Minister Steven Joyce is welcoming progress towards the procurement of 38 new electric trains (EMUs) for Auckland.

KiwiRail has today announced a short list of two for the procurement and maintenance of the new trains in a selection process that will be completed in the third quarter of this year.

Mr Joyce says he expects to see the first trains on the ground and operational from 2013.

"Rail is an increasingly important way for Aucklanders to get to work each day. The upgrade and electrification of the Auckland rail network will provide for more frequent trains at peak times and help to meet future passenger demand.

"New Zealand's future success is tied to that of Auckland as our largest city and largest local economy. Getting Auckland transport working well is crucial to getting Auckland growing faster and providing more jobs.

"The government's comprehensive rail and roading plan for Auckland is gaining momentum towards improving transport across the city.  Increased productivity and growth in Auckland delivers flow-on effects for the rest of the country," says Mr Joyce.

The Crown has invested $1.6 billion in the development of Auckland's metro rail system, which comprises:

- $600 million for Project DART
- $500 million for the infrastructure required to support electrification
- $500 million for purchase of electric trains (government loan to KiwiRail).
