The $2 million fund launched to help earthquake-affected Christchurch exporters reassure international clients that the region is open for business has been extended.

The Christchurch Market Connections Fund, announced last month as part of the Government’s economic recovery package, is now $4 million.

“More than 180 export businesses are reinforcing their relationships with key customers thanks to the Fund. It is clearly meeting a need, with $2.8 million allocated so far,” says Acting Economic Development Minister David Carter.

The Fund, which is administered by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, was established in response to Canterbury exporters’ concerns about international perception of the scale of damage to the region, and the belief by some customers that businesses weren’t trading at full capacity.

“Topping up the fund will help more firms to cement existing relationships and reassure offshore partners that Christchurch, and New Zealand, is open for business,” says Mr Carter.

Support has been spread across Christchurch industries, with more than 30 firms from each of the ICT, manufacturing, creative and services sectors able to use the Fund to meet with international partners.

“One such firm is ecobulb manufacturer Energy Mad which is using the Fund to address concerns and get business back on track after earthquake-related delays,” says Mr Carter. “This is a critical part of recovery and rebuilding for the city and its businesses.”

Chris Mardon of Energy Mad says the perception that Christchurch was “flattened”, combined with a brief delay in deliveries, led to one major US client cancelling their orders.

“By visiting them in the US, we were able to turn around that decision – so the support from the Fund has been critical. We’ve also been able to reassure clients and partners in Australia and China that we’re operating as usual.”

**About the Fund**

The Christchurch Market Connections Fund was established to provide short-term assistance to earthquake-affected export businesses, supporting international visits to (or by) businesses’ existing customers, distributors, agents, and other key partners.

It is part of a wider $8.5 million business support package which is also funding business recovery coordinators, a trust fund for business operators in need following the quakes, and money for workshops and business training.

Exporters wanting information about the Fund should contact New Zealand Trade and Enterprise on 0800 555 888. For more information about the Government’s business support package: [www.recovercanterbury.co.nz](http://www.recovercanterbury.co.nz)
