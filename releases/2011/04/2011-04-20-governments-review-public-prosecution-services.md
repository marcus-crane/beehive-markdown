The Government is to undertake a review of New Zealand’s public prosecution services, the Attorney-General, the Minister of Justice, and the Minister of Police announced today.

“The review will be comprehensive, examining the organisational structures, governance, and accountability of agencies within the prosecution system, as well as their roles, functions, and processes,” said Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson, who is lead minister for the review.

“Cost pressures have been building in recent years in the wider justice sector because of increasing case volumes, and we need to ensure funding for prosecution services is sustainable.”

“The review will consider whether there are improvements to be made in the funding and purchasing systems for Crown Solicitors,” Mr Finlayson said. “The review is also necessary to respond to the Government’s requirements for ongoing fiscal constraint at a time when we are being forced to borrow an average of $300 million a week.”

Justice Minister Simon Power said recent reviews of the justice system have focused on criminal procedure, victims, and legal aid.

“It’s important that prosecutions are subject to the same level of scrutiny as other parts of the justice system to ensure its overall effectiveness and efficiency,” Mr Power said. “The aim of the review is to achieve a public prosecution service that both manages costs and upholds high standards.”

Police Minister Judith Collins said most offences were prosecuted by the Police or Crown Solicitors, through funding from Crown Law. However, a number of other public sector agencies also brought their own prosecutions.

“The Government spends at least $75 million a year on prosecutions so it’s important we ensure taxpayers are receiving a high-quality and cost-effective service,” Ms Collins said.

The Ministers announced that John Spencer has been appointed as the independent reviewer.

He is chair of KiwiRail, Tainui Holdings and WEL Networks, a director of Tower New Zealand, and Dairy New Zealand, and a deputy chair of the Legal Services Agency.

“Mr Spencer has the status and abilities necessary for this review,” Mr Finlayson said.

Mr Spencer is expected to present his report to Ministers in September.
