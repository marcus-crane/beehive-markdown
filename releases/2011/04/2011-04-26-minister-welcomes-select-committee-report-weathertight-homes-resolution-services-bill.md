Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson has today welcomed a select committee report on the Weathertight Homes Resolution Services (Financial Assistance Package) Amendment Bill.

“The Local Government and Environment Select Committee has done a comprehensive job of reviewing the draft legislation and considering a range of views on the proposed financial assistance package for owners of leaky homes,” Mr Williamson said.

Parliament will now debate the Bill for a second time.

The Bill will see qualifying homeowners receive a 25 percent contribution from the Government and may receive 25 percent from their local council. The contributions will be based on agreed actual repair costs.

“The financial assistance package will ensure more time and money is spent on repairing leaky homes instead of disputing the problem” Mr Williamson said.

Full details of the package will be announced after the supporting legislation has progressed through Parliament.

“Meantime I would urge home owners close to the 10-year limit on lodging claims to ‘stop the clock' by lodging a claim with the Department of Building and Housing now. Assuming the claim is eligible, they may choose to use the financial assistance package when it becomes operational,” Mr Williamson said.
