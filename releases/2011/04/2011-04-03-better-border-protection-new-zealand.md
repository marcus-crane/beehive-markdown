New Zealand’s border security will be strengthened following the signing of an agreement between New Zealand and Canadian immigration authorities, Immigration Minister Jonathan Coleman announced today.

The agreement is part of a Five Country Conference (FCC) biometric programme involving the immigration agencies of New Zealand, Canada the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom.

Dr Coleman says New Zealand officials will have greater tools to detect identity fraud and process genuine travellers faster by checking fingerprint details, when needed, with their Canadian counterparts. Immigration New Zealand (INZ) signed similar agreements with Australia and the United Kingdom last year.

‘’The ability to check biometric data with international partners will help INZ identify people using false identities,’’ Dr Coleman says.

‘’Organised crime groups and illegal migrants are increasingly using identity and passport fraud to evade detection. The FCC agreement provides greater confidence that non-genuine immigration cases will be refused through the improved detection of fraudulent identity and immigration claims.’’

Fingerprints of asylum claimants and people awaiting deportation who refuse to provide identity information may be checked. Fingerprints of the citizens of FCC countries will not be shared.

‘’This initiative will help Canadian and New Zealand immigration authorities work together to identify immigration fraud and previous deportees who are trying to re-enter our respective countries without permission,” says Jason Kenney, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Canada.

‘’Canada already has similar initiatives in place with the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States, and we are pleased to expand this partnership to include New Zealand.’’

Dr Coleman confirmed that the protection of personal information is important to all the countries involved and all arrangements conform with the respective Privacy Acts of member countries.
