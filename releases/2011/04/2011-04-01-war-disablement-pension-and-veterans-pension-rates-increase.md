The rate at which War Disablement Pensions are paid will increase by 3.75 percent from 1 April as part of the annual cost of living adjustment, Minister of Veterans' Affairs Judith Collins said today.

“This increase in the rate of the tax-free War Disablement Pension helps to ensure that our veterans are not disadvantaged by the rise in living costs,” Ms Collins said.

The Veterans’ Pension will also increase from 1 April. The new rate for a couple is $522.96 a week, after tax.

War Disablement Pensions are paid to veterans who have service-related disabilities.

A veteran in receipt of a 65 percent War Disablement Pension will receive an additional $129.39 per week tax free over and above any other income such as NZ Superannuation.

In addition, Veterans’ Affairs New Zealand (VANZ) meets the costs of all healthcare and travel to all medical appointments or service-related conditions.

A veteran on a 100% War Disablement Pension will receive $199.05 per week tax free on top of any other income such as NZ Superannuation or Veterans’ Pension.

**Additional information**

If a veteran is over the age of retirement, or under the age of retirement and cannot work for an extended period of time, they can receive a Veterans’ Pension in lieu of NZ Superannuation.

This means the veteran and their partner receive a Community Services Card without income or asset testing as a result of being in receipt of a Veterans’ Pension.

The Veteran’s Pension does not cease if a veteran is hospitalised for 13 weeks or more. In addition VANZ meets the costs of all health care for service-related conditions and travel to all medical appointments for service related conditions.

Veterans can access additional assistance around the house from the Attendant Allowance scheme up to a maximum of $368.65 worth of services a week. A war pension’s travel concession for recreational travel is also available.
