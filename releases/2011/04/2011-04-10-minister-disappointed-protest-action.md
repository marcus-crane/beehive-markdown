Acting Minister of Energy and Resources, Hekia Parata, has expressed her disappointment at the action of Greenpeace protestors who disrupted the research programme being undertaken by Petrobras off the East Cape today.

The Brazilian state-owned oil company suspended their seismic surveying in the Raukumara Basin after several Greenpeace protestors in survival suits came dangerously close to the Petrobas boat, making it unsafe for Petrobras to continue their research programme.

“Petrobras has been awarded a five year permit to explore what, if any, oil or gas prospects exist off the coast,’’ Ms Parata says.

“They have just started the first phase of a three and a half year research programme which currently involves 2D and 3D seismic surveying.

“Oil and gas exploration could contribute significantly to our economy.''

Ms Parata says it is disappointing that protestors are disrupting Petrobras' research programme.

“Democracy protects the right to protest but not to the extent of interfering with others’ rights,’’ Ms Parata says.

“Petrobras are within their rights to be conducting their research off the East Cape.

“A number of these protestors will sail off leaving the local people no better off socially or economically.

“Exploration gives us choices and these people are preventing New Zealanders being informed of those choices.’’

Ms Parata says Police are monitoring the situation. She urged protestors to take a calm and reasoned approach which respected the rights of Petrobras.
