Applications for funding under the 2011/12 Maori Provider Development Scheme are now being invited.

“Each year the Maori Provider Development Scheme invests in activities that build whanau capability, strengthen whanau connections, support the development of whanau leadership and enhance best outcomes for whanau.

“It also supports activities which aid the development of a highly skilled Maori health workforce and assists providers to improve their infrastructure, develop their workforce, achieve service integration and improve the quality of services.

“Maori providers play an important role in the health and disability sector, I strongly encourage them to find out more about the scheme and how it could assist them in delivering health and disability services to people in their communities,” says Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia.

To be eligible for the development funding an organisation must:

- be owned and governed by Maori, and providing health and disability services primarily but not exclusively to Maori
- have a contract/s with the Ministry of Health and/or District Health Board (DHB) and/or Primary Health Organisation (PHO)
- be in the process of developing a contract with the Ministry of Health and/or District Health Board (DHB) and/or Primary Health Care Organisation (PHO).

Application forms and guidelines for the Maori Provider Development Scheme are available from the Ministry of Health website [www.moh.govt.nz](http://www.moh.govt.nz)

Applications open today and close at noon on Friday 27 May 2011.
