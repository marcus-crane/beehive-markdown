New Zealand’s Acting Minister of Energy and Resources, Hekia Parata, and Australian Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Mark Dreyfus, met in Auckland today to collaborate on energy efficiency measures for households and businesses.

Today’s discussions covered the development of legislation for consistent energy standards and labelling for household appliances across both countries. These labels make it easier for shoppers to identify which appliances would lead to the biggest savings on their electricity and gas bills.

New Zealand and Australia have a long history of close cooperation on climate change and energy efficiency.

The energy rating website www.energyrating.gov.au is part of a joint initiative between the New Zealand, Australian, state and territory governments.

This website is a practical tool for families looking to compare the energy efficiency of household appliances like fridges and televisions. It allows comparison of appliances and the costs of operating them over for example 12 month or 10 year periods.

“By switching to more energy efficient white goods and electrical appliances, households can save serious money on their energy bills, and we want to make that switch as easy as possible,” Mr Dreyfus said.

“For example in Australia, switching from a one-star to a seven-star television could save a household around A$1000 over the ten year life of the television.”

Ms Parata said Australia and New Zealand’s joint standards and labelling programme also benefits New Zealand consumers.

“In 2009-10 alone, consumers saved an estimated NZD $157M in energy costs through buying and using more efficient products,’’ Ms Parata said.

“Working together in this way reduces compliance costs to businesses operating across both countries, reduces barriers to trade, and contributes to the development of a Single Economic Market.’’

New Zealand’s Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority is highly regarded in the Asia-Pacific region for their policy development work in regional forums.

While in New Zealand, Mr Dreyfus will meet with Nick Smith, Minister for Climate Change Issues, and Tim Groser, Minister for International Climate Change Negotiations. They will discuss New Zealand’s successful emissions trading scheme, the moves the Australian Government is making toward pricing carbon pollution, and international climate change negotiations.

Mr Dreyfus will also participate on Saturday in the final session of the Australia New Zealand Leadership Forum — ‘Economy and the Environment: Global Opportunities from Climate Change for Australia and New Zealand’.
