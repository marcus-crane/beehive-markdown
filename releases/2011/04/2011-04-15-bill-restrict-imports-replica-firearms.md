An amendment to the Arms Act that would place controls on importing airguns that look like real pistols, military style semi-automatic firearms (MSSAs) or restricted weapons was introduced to the House today by Police Minister Judith Collins.

“Replica firearms, for which there are virtually no import controls, are frequently being used for criminal offending,” Ms Collins said.

“These replicas are easily mistaken for a real firearm which makes them attractive to criminals.

“Police estimates that there could be up to one incident a week where a member of the public presents an airgun that looks like a real pistol, MSSA, or restricted weapon requiring an armed Police response, sometimes involving a call-out of the Armed Offenders Squad.

“Tightening import controls would reduce the easy availability of these replica firearms. Anyone planning to import these replicas would in future require an import permit.”

The Arms Amendment Bill will also clarify how MSSAs are defined in legislation.

This will address problems with the interpretation of the current definition of MSSA as inserted into the Act by the Arms Amendment Act 1992.

This has become necessary because of a 2010 High Court decision Lincoln v Police which created uncertainty as to whether some semi-automatic firearms were MSSAs or not.

“It is intended to take the situation back to a classification regime very similar to that administered between 1992 and 2008 that was generally understood and accepted by the firearms community but with added clarity in the legislation,” Ms Collins said.

The Government has been looking at steps that can be taken to improve firearm safety.

Regulations were changed to require owners of pre-charged pneumatic (PCP) air rifles to hold a firearms licence from October 2010. PCP air rifles had been used in two fatal shootings, including the murder of Police Sergeant Don Wilkinson.
