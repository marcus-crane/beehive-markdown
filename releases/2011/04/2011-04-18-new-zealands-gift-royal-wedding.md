Prime Minister John Key today announced that New Zealand’s gift to the Royal Wedding of His Royal Highness Prince William and Miss Catherine Middleton will be a donation to the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal.

Prince William and Miss Middleton have asked that anyone wishing to give the couple a wedding gift consider instead donating to one of the nominated charities. The couple nominated the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal as one of those charities.

“It was a very kind gesture from Prince William and Catherine Middleton to nominate the appeal as one of a small group of charities to be included in their Royal Wedding charity gift fund,” Mr Key says.

“It reflects their close ties to and affection for New Zealand.”

Mr Key and Governor-General Sir Anand Satyanand will donate $10,000 to the appeal on behalf of the people of New Zealand.

“This gift honours the generous spirit shown by the couple, and will contribute to the real needs of Christchurch,” Mr Key says.
