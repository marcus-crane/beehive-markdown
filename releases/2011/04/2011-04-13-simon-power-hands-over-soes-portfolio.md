Prime Minister John Key says senior Minister Simon Power has handed over the State Owned Enterprises portfolio to Tony Ryall.

“Mr Power approached me yesterday indicating that because of his impending retirement from Parliament, this change should be made,” says Mr Key.

“The change is being made because of Mr Power’s concern that if he remained in the portfolio there could be a perception of a conflict of interest as he made the transition to the commercial world after the election.

“I want to place on record my thanks for Mr Power’s work in the SOEs portfolio where he has made a big contribution, including work on the development of the Government’s proposed mixed ownership model.”

The change in portfolios takes effect immediately.
