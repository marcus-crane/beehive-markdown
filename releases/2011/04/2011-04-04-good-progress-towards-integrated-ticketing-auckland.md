Transport Minister Steven Joyce is welcoming the roll out of integrated ticketing in Auckland with the new HOP smartcard launched in this city this afternoon.

HOP will enable Auckland public transport users to access all public transport services with just one smartcard.

Mr Joyce says the launch of the HOP system being used in Auckland forms the base for a core public transport ticketing system which will ultimately be able to be used right around the country.

“Integrated ticketing is an important part of establishing a more efficient, effective and user-friendly public transport system.

“As I’ve said a number of times before, if we’re serious about supporting the growth of our largest city we need all our transport modes working efficiently.  The government is making a record investment in Auckland’s rail commuter network and in public transport services, at the same time as we’re making a record investment in the city’s motorway network.

“Integrated ticketing is about ensuring we get the very best results from our very large investment in public transport.

“Deployment of equipment on NZ Bus services is just the first step, with the expansion of integrated ticketing on rail and ferry services next on the agenda for Auckland. Work is on track for delivering the first phase of Auckland's integrated ticketing on rail in the middle of this year.

“The smartcard technology will mean passengers can travel across a city or region using buses, trains and ferries while getting the best available fare for their journey. What’s more, public transport users will enjoy fast and convenient ticketing.

“It is great to see Auckland Transport working collaboratively with operators to lead the way in delivering an efficient and effective public transport system for their region.

“Auckland commuters will be the first to benefit from the new national integrated ticketing approach and I hope to see other regions follow,” says Mr Joyce.
