Veterans’ Affairs Minister Judith Collins has congratulated Brigadier (Retired) Dr Brian Thomas McMahon CBE, KStJ, who was today named the Returned and Services’ Association’s (RSA) Anzac of the Year.

“Throughout his distinguished military and medical careers, Dr McMahon displayed a tireless commitment to improving the healthcare of military personnel and the public,” Ms Collins said.

“As a soldier, a doctor, a citizen and a humanitarian, his lifetime of service has been an influence and an inspiration to many.

“I would like to congratulate him on this award. He truly embodies the Anzac qualities of comradeship, compassion, courage and commitment.”

Dr McMahon is the second winner of the RSA Anzac of the Year award. The first recipient was the late Lt Col John Masters ONZM MC JP in 2010.

The award was presented to Dr McMahon by the Governor-General, Rt Hon Sir Anand Satyanand, at a ceremony at Government House today.
