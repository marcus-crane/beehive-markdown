A bill to tighten juror privacy, safety, and security and address concerns regarding who can serve on juries, passed its first reading in Parliament today with unanimous support.

The Juries Amendment Bill removes the addresses of potential jurors from jury panel lists, after convicted murderer George Baker wrote to a juror whose name he saw on a list while he was representing himself in a trial.

“The Government takes the safety of jurors seriously,” Justice Minister Simon Power said.

Currently, a jury list must contain the name, occupation, date of birth, and full address of potential jurors.

Since 2008, self-represented defendants have been prohibited from keeping a copy of the jury list or taking notes, but they can inspect it under supervision.

In addition, where there is a real risk that an accused may intimidate jurors, the prosecutor can apply for a judge-alone trial.

Mr Power said the 2008 changes were made to protect the privacy of jurors, but the Baker incident highlighted the need to further restrict access to the information.

The proposed changes will:

- Remove the addresses of potential jurors from jury lists.
- Allow the prosecution, defence lawyer, or the court-appointed adviser to defendants representing themselves to have automatic access to all address information on request.
- Prevent the accused from ever seeing potential jurors' addresses by prohibiting the defence lawyer or court-appointed adviser from showing the addresses to the accused.
- Extend section 14A(6) of the Juries Act – which makes it clear that misconduct in relation to jury lists may be treated as contempt of court – to include the act of showing the accused, or any other person, jurors' addresses.

The bill also:

- Bars people from serving on a jury if they have, in the previous five years, been sentenced to home detention for three months or more. This puts them in the same category as those sentenced to a short term of imprisonment. This closes a loophole in the Sentencing Amendment Act 2007, which created home detention as a sentence in its own right, but failed to amend the Juries Act. This meant those who had served or were serving a sentence of home detention could still sit on a jury panel. People convicted of a custodial sentence of more than 3 years are barred for life from sitting on a jury.
- Ensures that offenders who are serving a sentence of less than three months home detention be excused from jury service, or allowed to defer their attendance, until after their sentence is complete.
- Gives registrars the power to grant a person permanent excusal from serving on a jury on the grounds of age, disability, or chronic health problems.
