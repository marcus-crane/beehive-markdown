Education Minister Anne Tolley has praised secondary school teachers for voting to accept a new pay agreement.

“This will give certainty and peace of mind to students, parents and teachers,” says Mrs Tolley.

“It removes the threat of further industrial action, and we can now concentrate on raising achievement levels and giving every student the chance to reach their potential.

“It also means we can focus on lifting student engagement through the Youth Guarantee, and develop some of the ideas discussed at last week’s forum on recruiting and retaining quality teachers.”
