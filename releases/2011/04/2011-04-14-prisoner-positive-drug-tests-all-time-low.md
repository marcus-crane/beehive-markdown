The number of prisoners testing positive in random drug tests is at an all-time low, Corrections Minister Judith Collins said.

For the financial year to date, only 6 percent of prisoners have returned positive results. This compares to over 34 percent of prisoners returning positive results when random drug testing was introduced in1998.

“New laws targeting drugs and contraband, cellphone jamming at all New Zealand prisons and increased vigilance by Corrections staff have made it much harder to get drugs into our prisons. The low number of positive drugs tests show these initiatives are working,” Ms Collins said.

The Government passed legislation in 2009 that increased the search powers of Corrections Officers, introduced new offences for contraband and allowed permitted staff to read non-privileged prisoner mail.

The Corrections Amendment Act also authorised the Department to electronically detect, monitor and jam radio communications in and out of prisoners and allowed for the monitoring of prisoners’ phone calls.

Ms Collins said the Government was committed to stopping prisoners using drugs because drugs and alcohol were major drivers of crime in New Zealand.

“Two-thirds of prisoners enter prison with a drug or alcohol problem. If we want to get serious about reducing re-offending we need to stop both the supply and demand for drugs within prison.

“We are on track to double the number of prisoners receiving drug and alcohol treatment. There are now more prisoners than ever before undertaking alcohol and drug treatment within prison.”

Since 2008, Drug Treatment Units have opened at Auckland and Otago prisons and a third unit will open at Whanganui Prison by the end of the year.

“Drug Treatment Units have been highly successful in helping prisoners kick their alcohol and drug addictions and lead law-abiding lives. Recent analysis has shown that the Drug Treatment Units reduce re-offending by a third.”
