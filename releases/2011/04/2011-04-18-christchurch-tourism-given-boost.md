Prime Minister John Key has today recognised the severe impact on Canterbury tourism by the February 2011 earthquake with a funding boost.

The Ministry of Economic Development (MED), Christchurch City Council (CCC), and Christchurch International Airport (CIAL) have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding to help Christchurch and Canterbury Tourism (CCT) that is worth an additional $1.6 million.

The funding boost breaks down to $625,000 from MED, $625,000 from CIAL, and $350,000 from CCC (which is additional to core council funding of $2.2 million).

“This is a collaborative approach that is designed to help CCT stabilise its business and operations and rebuild existing tourism and travel activity,” says Mr Key.

“Despite the severe impact of the earthquake, CCT has played a vital role in helping Canterbury’s tourism industry to recover, but this would be impossible to continue without additional funding.

“Christchurch is the gateway for South Island tourism and must be supported. I would like to thank CIAL and CCC for their contribution to the recovery of the industry in Canterbury and the wider South Island.”
