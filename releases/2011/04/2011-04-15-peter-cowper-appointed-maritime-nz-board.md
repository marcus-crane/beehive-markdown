Transport Minister Steven Joyce today announced the appointment of Peter Cowper to the Maritime New Zealand Board.

The appointment is for a three year term starting on 1 May 2011.

Mr Joyce says Peter Cowper brings to the Board broad commercial experience, as well as governance expertise.

“Peter brings a range of knowledge and capabilities that will complement the existing skill set of the Board,” said Mr Joyce.

Mr Joyce also acknowledged the work of outgoing Board member Adrienne Young-Cooper, whose term on the Board concluded at the end of March.

“I would like to thank Adrienne Young-Cooper for her contribution to the maritime sector during her more than six and a half years on the Maritime New Zealand Board.

“Her contribution has been crucial over a period in which important decisions were made about the future direction of Maritime New Zealand, and in which significant challenges facing the organisation had to be managed.

“I wish her well with her ongoing involvement in public sector governance,” says Mr Joyce.
