Commerce Minister Simon Power today announced a high-powered board to run the soon-to-be established Financial Markets Authority (FMA).

The FMA, which is expected to be up and running early next month, will be the single market conduct regulator for New Zealand’s financial markets.

The FMA is designed to restore the confidence of mum and dad investors in the financial markets by actively and consistently enforcing financial laws.

The eight board members are: Shelley Cave, Colin Giffney, Mary Holm, Murray Jack, James Miller, Justine Smyth, Michael Webb, and Mark Verbiest.

In addition, Bruce Sheppard, Rebecca Eele, and Arthur Grimes have been appointed associate members of the board.

Simon Allen has previously been announced as FMA chair, and Sean Hughes as chief executive designate.

“I’m delighted with the makeup of the board,” Mr Power said.

“They bring exactly the right mix of expertise and governance experience the FMA needs to get this vital job done.”

Shelley Cave, Murray Jack, and Mark Verbiest are members of the Securities Commission, which the FMA will replace.

“The continuity of experience from the outgoing Securities Commission will help smooth the transition to the new regulator.

“The knowledge and experience from these three in particular will be crucial to the success of the inaugural board.”

Mr Power said board members’ terms range from three to five years to smooth the succession of skills and board experience.

The Financial Markets Authority (Regulator and KiwiSaver) Bill which establishes the FMA is currently before the Parliament and is expected to pass into law this month
