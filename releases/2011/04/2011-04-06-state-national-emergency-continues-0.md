Civil Defence Minister John Carter has today extended the state of national emergency until 12 April, in the aftermath of the 6.3-magnitude earthquake that struck Christchurch on 22 February.

The state of national emergency in New Zealand - that applies specifically to Christchurch City - was declared on 23 February. Under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002 a state of national emergency can be declared for a maximum of seven days at a time only.

“While the situation in Christchurch City has improved significantly in the six weeks since the earthquake, the city has not been stabilised sufficiently to change the status of this state of national emergency in Christchurch City,” Mr Carter said.

“I therefore consider it necessary to keep the state of national emergency in place.

“Once the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority has been set up there will be a hand-over from the National Controller to that organisation and the state of national emergency can be lifted.”
