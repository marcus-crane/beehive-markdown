New Zealand’s tourism sector will benefit from China Southern Airlines’ decision to fly daily from Guangzhou to Auckland, says Associate Tourism Minister Jonathan Coleman.

China Southern has confirmed that later this year it will increase its three-times a week service to daily flights. Dr Coleman says this move is expected to increase the number of visitors on China Southern Airlines to 50,000 a year, worth an estimated $150 million to the economy.

‘’China Southern’s decision to increase its schedule to daily flights is a show of commitment in the New Zealand airline market. It also opens up many opportunities for New Zealand tourism in China.

‘’China is one of New Zealand's fastest growing visitor markets. 123,000 people visited last year - up nearly 17 percent, with those visitors contributing around $365 million a year to the New Zealand economy. Tourism New Zealand has been working with China Southern to promote the new route and the benefits of visiting New Zealand for leisure and business purposes. ‘’

China Southern Airlines’ first flight from Guangzhou landed at Auckland Airport on Saturday.

Dr Coleman says by June 2011, Immigration New Zealand will have a Visa Acceptance Centre (VAC) operational in Guangzhou and VACs will also be established simultaneously in Beijing and Shanghai to meet the increased demand for immigration services.
