New Zealand and Australian inventors and patent attorneys are being invited to have their say to simplify the rules for the patent attorney profession.

Calling for comments on a discussion paper proposing a single body to regulate patent attorneys in both countries, New Zealand Commerce Minister Simon Power and Australian Innovation Minister Senator Kim Carr said it was important that government regulations took into account the needs of the patent attorneys and innovators who use them.

Patent attorneys provide specialist advice on obtaining, protecting, and exploiting intellectual property rights — in particular, patents.

The discussion paper outlines a trans-Tasman regulatory framework with a single body responsible for patent attorney registration, training and disciplinary standards.

Mr Power said the initiative forms part of the Single Economic Market outcomes framework between Australia and New Zealand to help create a seamless business environment.

“Standardised accreditation for patent attorneys will give inventors confidence that they are receiving the same high quality, informed advice on both sides of the Tasman.

“Removing barriers for patent attorneys and encouraging competition are key elements that can help drive productivity, innovation, and industry growth for both countries”.

Senator Carr said: “This is a logical and sensible step as the majority of Australian and New Zealand patent attorneys are registered in both countries.

“A single governance body will help save time, money, and effort for the profession as a whole.”

Patent attorneys, businesses, and legal practitioners are encouraged to submit comments on the discussion paper. Copies can be downloaded from the websites of Ministry of Economic Development and IP Australia
