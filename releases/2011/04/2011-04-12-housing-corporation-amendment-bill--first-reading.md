The Housing Corporation Amendment Bill provides the legislative framework needed to transfer the policy advice function currently provided by Housing New Zealand to the Department of Building and Housing(DBH).

Housing Minister Phil Heatley says the changes provide the first legislative building block for the implementation of the recommendations of the Housing Shareholders Advisory Group (HSAG).

"In its report 'Home and Housed – A vision for social housing in New Zealand', HSAG identified the need to centralise policy development to avoid the 'blurring of responsibilities and accountabilities'". The Group believes and the Government agrees, that 'DBH is the natural home of policy activity for setting high-level outcomes-based objectives in respect of housing’”, says Mr Heatley.

"Put simply we want one consistent stream of advice to inform us about social and affordable housing demand and the best methods of meeting it, whether it is for the next year, the next ten years or the next twenty years," says Mr Heatley.

"This is the legislative cornerstone of what will be the greatest change to the way social housing is delivered since the idea of the state house was first conceived."

"The Government has a very clear plan for delivering social and affordable housing at a scale that will have real impact on waiting lists. It has already signalled its intention to reform the way social housing is delivered to ensure that housing is provided to those most in need for the extent of that need as well as grow the amount of social housing developed by the third sector.

"The newly amalgamated policy group will pay a key role in determining how this plan is to be delivered," Mr Heatley said.
