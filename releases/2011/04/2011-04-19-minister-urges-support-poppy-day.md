Veterans’ Affairs Minister Judith Collins has urged all New Zealanders to support the RSA’s Poppy Day street appeal on Thursday.

“This is the time of year when we reflect and remember those who have served our country and who have given their lives in the name of peace and freedom,” Ms Collins said.

“Every year, hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders wear the poppy to keep the memory of these brave men and women alive, but also to provide ongoing support for veterans and their families.

“The Poppy Day Appeal gives the RSA funds to provide a wide range of welfare support for all returned men and women in the area in which the funds were raised."

Poppy Day is the most important fundraising appeal of the year for the RSA. More than 200 RSAs will take part and are hoping to raise more than $1 million.

“The Poppy Day Appeal has enabled the RSA to provide invaluable assistance for our veterans and their families. I would urge all New Zealanders to support their good work on Poppy Day,” Ms Collins says.

Ms Collins will commemorate ANZAC Day in Papakura where she will attend the RSA Dawn Service, the Anzac Day service at Papakura Cenotaph and she will lay a wreath at the Auckland War Memorial Museum.
