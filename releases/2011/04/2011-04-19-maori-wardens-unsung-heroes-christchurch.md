Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Tariana Turia is congratulating the Maori Wardens for all the work they have done in Christchurch since the February 22 earthquake.

Maori Wardens who have travelled from outside Christchurch to assist with the response to the earthquake will now be returning home.

“Watene Maori (Maori Wardens) travelled from throughout New Zealand to assist in the aftermath of the Christchurch earthquake and are just some of the many unsung heroes who helped to alleviate the pain of those who were suffering.

“These wonderful people were right there, without even having to be asked - offering their love and strength to help our whanau during the most challenging of times.

“The Maori Wardens exemplify manaakitanga in all that they do and in everything they have done for the people of Christchurch,” says Mrs Turia.

On average the wardens knocked on more than 700 doors every day helping to identify needs, provide emotional support and reassurance and distribute food and water.

“At last count it was estimated that the Wardens had visited more than 2800 homes and in some cases more than once. I want to thank each and every one of them for all the work they have done.”
