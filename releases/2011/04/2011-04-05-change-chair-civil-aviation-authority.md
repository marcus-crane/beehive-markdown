Transport Minister Steven Joyce has announced the appointment of Nigel Gould as Chair of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) following the resignation of Rick Bettle, who has been Chair of the Authority since 2006.

“Mr Gould brings an impressive mix of governance experience and leadership capability which will serve the CAA well at an important time for the organisation.

“The CAA is an organisation going through a period of significant challenges and changes and Rick Bettle has tendered his resignation to allow a new pair of hands to implement and see through the change.”

Among the challenges facing the CAA are implementing the recommendations of the Office of the Auditor-General’s report on The Civil Aviation Authority Progress with Improving Certification and Surveillance (June 2010), and completing value for money and funding reviews that consider the appropriate future services, capability, and funding model for the CAA to ensure it is an effective regulator.

Mr Joyce says the CAA is working hard to address issues arising from these reviews, and he wants to ensure the momentum for change is maintained.

“I would like to thank Rick Bettle for his commitment and contribution to the CAA over the last four and a half years. I wish him all the best for his future endeavours.”

Mr Gould’s appointment is for the period from 6 April 2011 to 31 October 2013.

Mr Gould has broad experience in public and private sector roles spanning almost 30 years, and is well skilled in establishing effective partnerships between governance and management responsibilities.

He was Chair of Port Wellington Limited (now CentrePort Limited) from 1988 to 2008, Pro-Chancellor of Massey University from 2000 to 2002, and Chancellor of Massey University from 2002 to 2008. Additionally, he was President of the Wellington Regional Chamber of Commerce from 1995 to 1997 and President of the New Zealand Chambers of Commerce from 2000 to 2004.

Mr Gould is a chartered accountant by background, and has held a number of senior and executive roles within various sectors, including Managing Director of Andas Group Limited.
