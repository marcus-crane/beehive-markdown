Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson has welcomed a new Forest & Bird project to preserve a Marlborough population of a critically-endangered South Island bat.

At the launch of the Te Hoiere Bat Recovery Project at Pelorus Bridge Scenic Reserve today, Ms Wilkinson said the pest control project provided an important safety net for the bat population.

“New Zealand’s bats are distinctive for being our only native land mammals. Like many of our native wildlife, these once abundant species now only survive in considerably diminished numbers due to habitat loss and introduced predators.

“The South Island long-tailed bat sub-species’ threat of extinction ranking is nationally critical, the same as that of kakapo and takahe.

“The Top of the South Region of Forest & Bird have worked hard to generate support for this project and are to be commended for stepping up to protect this population in Pelorus.

“The pest control work, carried out with help from local community volunteers, will not only benefit bats but other native species in the reserve.

“Visitors staying overnight in the reserve’s popular campground should have an increased chance of seeing bats flitting overhead in the evening sky thanks to this effort to protect them.

“DOC has also now completed an upgrade of the campground facilities, making the site even more attractive to tourists and New Zealanders who enjoy the outdoors.”

**Background information**

- New Zealand had three bat species: the largest, the greater short-tailed bat is now extinct and the two remaining species, the long-tailed and lesser short-tailed bats, are declining in number.
- Long-tailed bats are chestnut brown, have small ears, weigh 8-12 grams and produce only one offspring – pup – a year. They can fly at 60 kilometres an hour and their home territory can be up to 100 square kilometres.
- The bat recovery project takes it name Te Hoiere from the Maori name for the wider Pelorus River and Pelorus Sound area.
