Defence Minister Wayne Mapp has extended his warmest congratulations to the two Defence recipients in the New Zealand Bravery Awards 2011 announced today \[2 April].

Air Force Wing Commander Anthony Millsom (now retired) received the New Zealand Bravery Decoration and the Navy’s Chief Petty Officer Mark Taylor has been awarded the New Zealand Bravery Medal.

“Both men showed exceptional courage, putting their own lives at risk for the sake of others. As their citations show, their actions were far above and beyond their duty.

“The core values of the New Zealand Defence Force are courage, commitment and comradeship. The actions which have been recognised by these honours place their courage beyond doubt.

“They have also demonstrated both outstanding commitment to their professional responsibilities and training, and a sense of the comradeship which binds Defence personnel throughout their service and beyond.

“It is the nature of military service to put oneself in harm’s way to protect others. Defence personnel face potentially dangerous situations every day. That these men did not hesitate to step up when others needed them shows the calibre of people that serve in the NZDF.

“They are a credit to the Defence Force and the country. We should all be proud of them,” Dr Mapp said.
