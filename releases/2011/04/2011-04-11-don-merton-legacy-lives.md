Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson says the passing of internationally regarded conservationist Don Merton is a sad loss for New Zealand, however his legacy lives on.

A senior member of the Department of Conservation’s scientific staff prior to his retirement in 2005, Don was involved in the recovery of many bird species and developed vital techniques to help threatened species.

“Don has an extraordinary legacy as a conservationist. His revolutionary techniques have helped to save native species like the kakapo and black robin – two of our most iconic birds,” Ms Wilkinson says.

“He worked tirelessly and was widely-liked and respected, not just in New Zealand but internationally.

“His death on the weekend is a sad loss for New Zealand and I send my sympathies to his family.”

Don Merton will be honoured for his commitment to conservation during Conservation Week later this year.
