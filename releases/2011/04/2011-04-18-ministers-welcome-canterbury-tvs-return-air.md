Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee and Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman paid tribute to Canterbury Television (CTV) which restarts broadcasting today, less than two months after the February earthquake devastated the regional broadcaster.

"The return of CTV to our screens marks a significant point in the recovery process for Canterbury after the tragic events of 22 February," Mr Brownlee says.

"What better way to honour the lives of those people lost from the company than to continue the work they were so much a part of," he says.

"CTV is an important information tool for the province. It will enable the community to know more about how the recovery is progressing and the work the new Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority is doing to move the recovery along in conjunction with the local councils.

"We've got a big job ahead of us but we are a resilient community and CTV is very much leading the way in what will be a bigger, better, and brighter Christchurch future," Mr Brownlee says.

Dr Coleman says it is a great feat for CTV to be back on-air after suffering the losses it has and is testament to the drive and commitment of CTV and its chairman Nick Smith.

"It will also be a poignant and sad occasion after 16 staff, including managing director Murray Wood, lost their lives when the CTV building collapsed. To rebound so quickly and provide Cantabrians with their television station again shows great spirit and real grit."

CTV News will run daily, starting today, at 5.30pm and will be repeated at 9.30pm, on their local analogue frequency in Christchurch. It will also run on the Maori TV channel at 8am, 9am, 1pm and 2pm the next day.

In addition, Maori TV will broadcast CTV material on Saturdays and Sundays from 8am to 2pm with an intended commencement date of the weekend of 8-9 May.

CTV advises there will be restricted programming until Monday 2 May when it is intended full transmission will resume.
