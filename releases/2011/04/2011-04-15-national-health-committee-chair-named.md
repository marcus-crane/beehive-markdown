Health Minister Tony Ryall today announced that Associate Professor Anne Kolbe has been appointed as chair of the National Health Committee (NHC).

Associate Professor Kolbe is the sole member of the NHC at this stage, and has indicated her intention to convene a small working party to begin reconfiguring the NHC.

The committee advises the Minister of Health on health and disability issues, and will be involved in the assessment of new diagnostic and treatment services.

This was recommended by the Ministerial Review Group Report.
