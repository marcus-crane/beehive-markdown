Prime Minister John Key today welcomed Westpac’s announcement of a temporary business hub for quake-affected small businesses in Christchurch.

The Westpac Business Hub, set to open in early May, will give local small- and medium-sized businesses free access to office space, and key services and networks. It is expected the Hub will be able to house up to 70 businesses at any one time.

“It is great to see Westpac offering this practical assistance to help local businesses continue their operations and maintain their relationships with suppliers and customers,” says Mr Key.

“It also sends a strong message that Christchurch businesses, despite dealing with disruptive circumstances, are continuing to be viable.”

The facilities at the Westpac Business Hub will include:

- Office space and office furniture
- Telecommunications, wireless networking and video-conferencing facilities
- Meeting rooms, break-out areas and a corporate lounge
- Access to business support service, including legal and accounting advisors.

Westpac will be announcing the application process for businesses wanting to use the Hub in mid-April. The Hub is likely to open for around 18 months.

“I applaud Westpac for investing for the long-haul in Christchurch businesses. This is a further example of the private sector stepping up and showing their confidence in the future of Christchurch,” says Mr Key.

“Westpac was also instrumental in the establishment of the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal, and their on-going commitment to Christchurch’s recovery is welcomed.”
