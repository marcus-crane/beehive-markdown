Recently released figures show that Work and Income are helping more people in need says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

“Special Needs Grants for hardship have increased by over 50 per cent since March 2008,” says Ms Bennett.

“So yes, that does mean that more people have been asking for help, but it also means that they getting it,” says Ms Bennett.

In March this year Work and Income granted 57,831 Special Needs Grants to people who needed help with their weekly living costs.

Benefit Advances have also increased from 22,297 in March 2008 to 32,723 this March.

“There is a common misconception that people in need can’t get help from Work and Income, but these figures clearly demonstrate that this is not the case,” says Ms Bennett.
