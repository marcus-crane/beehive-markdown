Associate Minister of Health Dr Jonathan Coleman today opened the new Brain Recovery Clinic in Auckland which is set to advance the treatment of brain injuries and neurological conditions.

The Brain Recovery Clinic, which is part of the Centre for Brain Research at Auckland University, will focus on finding and developing new treatments for brain disease and therapies for patients. The initial focus of the Clinic will be on stroke and traumatic brain injury.

Dr Coleman says the Clinic brings clinicians, researchers and the community together into one place where people can be treated and benefit from greater collaboration.

The Clinic will offer clinicians an additional option for focusing on patient rehabilitation and will conduct trials of new stroke rehabilitation therapies.

‘’The Centre for Brain Research is a great example of collaboration, with over 200 researchers all working towards a common goal of finding and developing new treatments for neurological disease,’’ Dr Coleman says.

‘’The work and advances in treatment undertaken at the Clinic will lead to a better quality of life for people living with a brain injury or neurological condition. Ultimately that’s the greatest potential benefit the Clinic offers.’’
