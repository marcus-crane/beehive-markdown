A new independent statutory hunting body is to be established to improve the management of game animals in New Zealand, Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson and UnitedFuture Leader Peter Dunne announced today.

The creation of the Game Animal Council forms part of the National Government’s confidence and supply agreement with UnitedFuture.

Ms Wilkinson says the Council’s functions will relate to the management of tahr, chamois, deer and pig, including promoting hunters’ safety, improving hunting opportunities and making recommendations to the Minister of Conservation.

“Hunting is a hugely popular recreational activity in New Zealand and as a result it brings with it competing interests and concerns over the best way to manage wild game animals.

“The new Game Animal Council will have hunter’s interests at the forefront and I expect it to engage practically with local and Government authorities, land-owners and other sector groups.”

The Council can, in the future, be delegated specific management functions for particular herds or game animals in certain locations.

“The Game Animal Council will give hunters a greater say in the management of our big game resource while also providing the Minister of Conservation with a valuable stream of advice regarding the management of tahr, chamois, deer and pigs,” Mr Dunne says.

“I have long held the belief that these large game animals deserve balanced management as valued introduced species rather than just the pests government policy has historically considered them to be.

“Hunting is an integral part of the Kiwi way of life, I am proud that we have given hunters a greater say in the future of their sport while preserving their right to hunt these animals for free.”

It is intended that the Council be made up of 11 members and its functions set out under a new Act to be introduced to Parliament this year.

The primary source of funding is proposed to come from a levy on the export of trophy heads from New Zealand, with Crown funding of $100,000 in the first year and $50,000 each year thereafter.
