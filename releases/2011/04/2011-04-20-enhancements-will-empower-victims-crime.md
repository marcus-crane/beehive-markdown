Justice Minister Simon Power today announced a package of proposals to further enhance the rights and services provided to victims of crime.

“Victims can find the criminal justice system bewildering and have expressed frustration and a sense of helplessness in the face of a system that is slow and unresponsive to their needs,” Mr Power said.

“With the State prosecuting offenders on behalf of victims and the community, victims can feel sidelined.

“This Government was elected to improve the justice system for those who find themselves in it through no fault of their own and this package is a critical part of that.”

The package is the result of consultation by the Ministry of Justice with government agencies, NGOs, legal groups, and the public.

It is made up of operational changes, which can begin immediately, and legislative changes which will be included in a new Victims of Crime Reform Bill which amends the Victims’ Rights Act 2002.

Significant reforms in the package include:

Reforming Victim Impact Statements (VIS)

The Victims’ Rights Act will be amended through legislation to:

o Give victims greater scope to express their feelings in their own words.

o Give victims of serious crime the automatic right to read their statement in court.

o Provide victims of offending by children or young people the right to attend Youth Court and submit a VIS.

Guidelines will be created through regulations to provide more clarity about what can be in a VIS and the processes for completing, submitting and presenting them.

Improving the Victim Notification System (VNS)

Building on current requirements to notify victims of an offender’s release on bail or parole. Victims will now be told:

o When prisoners of short-term sentences are convicted for breaching their release conditions.

o When offenders on home detention breach their conditions.

o All outcomes of bail hearings and the conditions that relate to them as the victim.

Victims will receive more information to:

o Ensure they are aware of the VNS.

o Ensure agencies inform victims about the importance of keeping their details up to date, which will be of particular use for when the Parole Board is considering parole.

A Victims Code

The Victims’ Rights Act 2002 will be amended through legislation to require the Ministry of Justice to develop and implement a Victims Code. The code will improve the responsiveness and accountability of justice sector agencies to victims. The Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Social Development, Crown Law, Police, and the Departments of Corrections and Labour will be required to comply with the code. It will outline victims’ rights, list the services provided to victims by government agencies and NGOs, and outline the complaints processes. The Ministry of Justice will report back in October with a draft code for Cabinet’s consideration.

A Victims Centre within the Ministry of Justice

The Victims Centre will be a one-stop shop for overseeing the coordination of state-funded services available to victims of crime. Organisations such as Victim Support will continue to provide frontline services. The centre will develop and implement the Victims Code and continue to improve the information resources available for victims. It will also provide oversight of victims’ services funded by the Offender Levy, monitor the victims’ information line (0800 VICTIM), and the number of complaints received to determine if a victims complaints officer is warranted.

Improving victim-prosecutor communications

o Ensuring prosecutors take reasonable steps to contact all victims of serious crime.

o Ensuring prosecutors offer to meet family members of victims who have died, before a defended hearing or trial.

o Ensuring victims of crime are informed about changes to charges laid against the defendant in a more timely and consistent manner. Victims should be informed about significant changes to charges before they are made.

New accountability requirements

The Victims’ Rights Act 2002 will be amended to require Police, Crown Law, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Social Development, Department of Corrections, and the Department of Labour to have complaints processes. They will also have to include in their annual report to Parliament a summary of their services to victims and complaints received.

Encouraging wider use of restorative justice

This will require criminal justice agencies to provide victims with information about restorative justice, and require district courts to refer eligible cases for investigation for restorative justice where services are available.

Mr Power said the proposals would be a big step forward for victims of crime.

“We can never legislate away the pain and suffering faced by victims, but I believe this package will help ensure that victims are not re-brutalised by their participation in the process,” Mr Power said.

“This is about putting victims at the centre of the justice system, and changes around Victim Impact Statements will go a long way to achieving that. As well, the Victims Centre and Victims Code will help victims navigate the bureaucratic maze and make their interaction with the system less intimidating.

“The package builds on the eight additional services for victims of crime introduced last year and funded through the $50 Offender Levy, and the introduction of on-the-spot police safety orders.”

Mr Power said the next phase in the victims work programme is to identify reform options for alternative pre-trial and trial processes for child witnesses, and pass the Criminal Procedure (Reform and Modernisation) Bill to speed up and simplify criminal procedure to deliver more timely justice to victims, defendants, and the community.

He intends to introduce the Victims of Crime Reform Bill by the middle of the year.

The package will be paid for out of existing baselines of the Ministry of Justice and other government agencies.

Questions and Answers

Why is this package needed?

The Government is committed to improving the status of victims of crime. The Ministry of Justice has consulted with government agencies, non-government organisations, the judiciary and the public, as well as gathering information from New Zealand and international reports and the recommendations of the Select Committee Inquiry into Victims’ Rights. Despite the rights provided in the Victims’ Rights Act 2002, information gathered from these sources indicates that victims of crime find it difficult to understand criminal and court processes, and their role in them. There are also limitations to the information victims receive and are able to access, and a lack of accountability of agencies delivering services to victims.

How will the reforms allow victims to say more in their Victim Impact Statement (VIS)?

The content of a VIS is broadly set out in the Victims’ Rights Act 2002. However, there are no guidelines for what a VIS may contain. Instead, case law has determined what should and should not be included in a VIS.

This has led to the current situation where judges or officials can remove anything that does not relate to the following three areas:

• Any physical injury or emotional harm suffered by the victim through, or by means of, the offence.

• Any loss of, or damage to, property.

• Any other effects of the offence.

This prevents victims from mentioning:

• An outline of the offence.

• Opinions or comment on the offender.

• Confidential information.

• Information reflecting on the court.

Victims also have to ask for permission to read their statement in court.

The proposed reforms will provide victims with greater scope to express the impact of the offending on them in their own words. Guidelines will be produced by the Ministry of Justice in consultation with the judiciary, legal groups, and government agencies to help clarify what is allowed in a VIS.

However, some comments will remain inappropriate in a VIS, including threats against the offender, directions to the judge or comment on sentencing, references to past offending, and allegations of offending the offender has not been convicted of. Judges will retain the ability to maintain control over the court.

What are the changes to the Victim Notification System (VNS)?

Many victims want to know when the offender is released into the community. The reforms build on the current requirements to notify victims of the offender’s release on bail or parole and will ensure that victims will now be told:

• When prisoners of short-term sentences are convicted for breaching their release conditions.

• When offenders on home detention breach their conditions.

• All outcomes of bail hearings and the conditions that relate to them as the victim.

Operational improvements will also make the registration process easier for victims and ensure that victims receive more information on the VNS and the importance of keeping their details up to date. This will be of particular use for when the Parole Board is considering parole.

How big will this Victims Centre be, how much will it cost and what will it do?

The Victims Centre will be a small unit of 1.8 FTEs based in the Ministry of Justice at a cost of $218,000. This cost can be met within Ministry of Justice funding for victims information. The staff will come within the existing FTE cap for the Ministry of Justice.

The Ministry of Justice will review the Victims Centre after 12 months and report to the Minister of Justice regarding its future direction and function.

What agencies will the Victims Code cover?

The Victims Code will cover the key justice sector agencies, the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Social Development, Police, Crown Law, Department of Corrections and the Department of Labour. The Ministry of Justice will seek contributions from other agencies and non-government organisations, such as the Ministry of Health, the Parole Board, and Victim Support.

How did the government conduct the review of Victims Rights?

A public consultation document, “A Focus on Victims of Crime: A Review of Victims’ Rights,” was released in December 2009 containing 24 preliminary proposals.

The Ministry received 78 submissions from victims, the legal profession, government and non-government agencies, academics, and the public. Submitters were largely supportive of the preliminary proposals.

Analysis of submissions and further targeted consultation with stakeholders was undertaken, detailed cost analysis of proposals was undertaken, and proposals were finalised for Cabinet approval.

When will the package take effect?

Two major improvements in the package will begin immediately. The Ministry of Justice will establish the Victims Centre, which will be responsible for drafting a Victims Code for Cabinet consideration by October this year.

Legislative proposals will be included in a Victims of Crime Reform Bill that will be introduced in the middle of the year. These changes are likely to be implemented in the second half of 2012.

How is the package being funded?

The package will not require new Government spending. It has been developed to ensure that resource implications can be absorbed within government agency baselines through building on existing practice, reprioritisation, or adjustment of service delivery.

What has the Government done for victims already?

• In July last year the Government introduced a $50 levy on offenders at the time of sentencing, regardless of the crime they commit. The levy is collected after reparation and before fines, and is in addition to any sentence or court order. The levy was expected to generate $13.6 million in its first four years and is being used to fund eight new initiatives that provide additional support to victims of serious crime. They are:

o An enhanced homicide support service which provides four paid homicide support co-ordinators to work with Victim Support.

o An increase in the discretionary grant for families of homicide victims which are suffering financial difficulties, from $1,500 to $5,000.

o A court support service for victims of sexual violence which gives them access to a specialist victim advisor.

o A grant of $500 towards the expenses incurred as a result of sexual violence, such as replacing items of clothing collected for forensic evidence, or providing temporary accommodation.

o Increases in travel, accommodation and childcare assistance for victims attending court proceedings, from $1,000 to $3,000, and Parole Board hearings, from $500 to $1,500.

o A High Court attendance grant of $124 per person per day for up to five adult members of a homicide victim's family.

o A funeral grant of up to $4,500 to families of homicide victims, on top of the $5,500 available through ACC.

o New information resources, including a DVD, pamphlets and a redesigned victims' website www.victimsinfo.govt.nz, which give victims of crime access to simple and accurate information about the criminal justice system, including an outline of the court process and support services available.

• On July 1 last year on-the-spot Police safety orders to ensure the immediate safety of domestic violence victims came into effect. Judges can also now issue a protection order on behalf of a victim when sentencing an offender for a domestic violence offence.

What else is the Government doing for victims?

The reform package represents a further step in the Government’s comprehensive work programme to improve victims’ experiences of the justice system including:

• Identifying reform options for alternative pre-trial and trial processes for child witnesses.

• Developing national best-practice guidelines for the treatment of child victims and witnesses.

• Progressing the Child and Family Protection Bill that primarily amends the Domestic Violence Act 1995 and the Care of Children Act 2004 to improve the responsiveness of the courts to victims of domestic violence, and enhance the protection of children and families.

• Reforming the collections operating model with new enforcement powers which will better hold offenders to account and mean that more reparation for victims should be collected.

Will victims of crime have to be involved in the criminal justice processes if they don’t want to?

No. Victims of crime respond to offending in different ways. Some wish to engage in the criminal justice system, while others do not. This package aims to provide victims with more choice to access information and services, and to be involved in criminal justice processes, where they wish to do so.

Do changes in the Youth Court mean that it is no longer important for victims to attend the Family Group Conference?

No. The Family Group Conference (FGC) process offers a significant opportunity for victims to explain the impact of the offending and participate in decisions on how the offending will be addressed. It is important that this involvement in FGCs continues to be promoted. Officials will, therefore, monitor the impact of any change in legislation on victim participation at the FGC and undertake further work to ensure continued high levels of participation.
