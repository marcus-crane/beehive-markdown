Tauranga aviation museum Classic Flyers and the Omaka Aviation Heritage Centre in Blenheim will be the new homes of two of the Air Force’s mothballed Skyhawk fleet, Defence Minister Wayne Mapp announced today.

Dr Mapp said earlier this month that up to nine of the 17 Skyhawks had been earmarked for display in appropriate museums, on permanent loan from the Government.

“The Skyhawks are a significant part of New Zealand’s military aviation history. The Government is ensuring that all New Zealanders will have the opportunity to enjoy seeing them up close in the years to come.

“The Tauranga and Blenheim museums are well-established leaders in their field. They have easily met our requirements to receive a Skyhawk and the aircraft will be a real drawcard for them. Having a Skyhawk on display will boost their contribution to the high-quality preservation of our aviation history,” Dr Mapp said.

Destinations for four of the nine museum aircraft have already been determined. Two will go to the Air Force Museum at Wigram and another to the Museum of Transport and Technology in Auckland. A fourth will be sent to the Royal Australian Navy Fleet Air Arm Museum in Nowra, New South Wales.

Homes for the remaining three aircraft will be announced as decisions are made, the Minister said.
