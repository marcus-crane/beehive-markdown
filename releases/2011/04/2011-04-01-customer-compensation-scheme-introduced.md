The introduction of Electricity Authority’s Customer Compensation Scheme today is a welcome step forward for the electricity sector, Acting Energy and Resources Minister Hekia Parata said today.

“Another important milestone has been achieved in the Ministerial Review of Electricity Market Performance,” said Ms Parata.

“The Customer Compensation Scheme is one of the priority initiatives to be implemented by the Electricity Authority following the review into the electricity market.’’

From today retailers will be required to pay customers $10.50 per week should they be asked to conserve electricity during a public conservation campaign.

“This initiative will reduce the incentive for retailers to put in place public conservation campaigns to lower their exposure to high prices on the spot market when lake levels are low,’’ Ms Parata said.

“It will also ensure that customers are compensated for the conservation efforts should they be asked to conserve electricity.

“It is initiatives such as the compensation scheme that will contribute to a more efficiently run electricity market.”

The Electricity Authority was established under the Electricity Industry Act 2010 in October last year.
