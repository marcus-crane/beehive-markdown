Prime Minister John Key has joined the rest of New Zealand in congratulating the New Zealand Breakers on their historic victory over the Cairns Taipans in the Australian National Basketball League.

“The Breakers have gone from strength to strength throughout the competition and have pulled off some memorable wins – and tonight’s champion performance caps off a fantastic season," says Mr Key.

The Breakers’ 71-53 victory is the first time a New Zealand-based team has won an Australian A-grade sporting competition.

“This is a huge accomplishment and the investment in the side over the past eight years is now reaping rewards. It’s also great to see a team with so much Kiwi talent in the ranks take out this title," says Mr Key.

“The players from overseas have also embraced playing in New Zealand and their loyalty to the club has helped pull together an excellent team.

“Coach Andrej Lemanis and the team thoroughly deserve their victory. I look forward to congratulating members of the team and management in person should the opportunity arise when I return to New Zealand," says Mr Key.
