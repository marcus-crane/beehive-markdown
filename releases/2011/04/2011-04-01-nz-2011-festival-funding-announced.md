\\Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy has announced the 175 public events that have won a share of $9.48 million in funding from the NZ 2011 Festival Lottery Fund Committee.

“A huge variety of events and activities all over New Zealand, which are part of the REAL New Zealand Festival, have received funding which will help communities play a major part in the Rugby World Cup 2011. This is the largest ever celebration for this country and the first time a Rugby World Cup host nation has staged a nationwide festival alongside the Tournament.

“The range of successful events and activities is enormous. Concerts, festivals, exhibitions, and sports competitions from every corner of New Zealand are included.

“Some of the highlights include:

• $250,000 for Real Canterbury Market Days and 'A Taste of Canterbury’, showcasing the best food and wine from the Canterbury region.

• $350,000 for a family concert in the Auckland Domain on Labour Day.

• $350,000 for a major outdoor projection project, featuring spectacular imagery and state-of-the-art technology, on Wellington's most prominent buildings

• $50,000 for a series of live music events in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch showcasing New Zealand music.

• $100,000 for a ‘Taste of Southland’ festival.

“I’m very pleased that all but two of the events planned for Christchurch are going ahead. We have 17 successful applications from Canterbury, and 15 national projects which involve the region. Some reorganisation may be required but there is a real determination that the city will not miss out.

“I’m grateful to committee members Sir David Gascoigne, Bob Harvey, Sharon Hunter and Wally Stone who had to make some tough decisions. They received 570 applications seeking over $72 million in funding.”

The funding was allocated to the Committee by the Lottery Grants Board, which distributes the profits of New Zealand Lotteries (including Lotto and Instant Kiwi) to various statutory bodies and distribution committees.
