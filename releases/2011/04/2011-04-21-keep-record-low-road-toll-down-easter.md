Transport Minister Steven Joyce is calling for road users to stay safe on the roads this Easter weekend.

He says the year got off to a positive start with a record low road toll for the first quarter.

“While this is a positive trend, it’s important people do not become complacent. All road users must keep safety at the front of their minds especially over holiday weekends when there is a lot of extra traffic on the roads.

“Last year 12 people were killed on our roads over the Easter break — the highest since 1992. We do not want a repeat of last year. Let’s stay focused this Easter. Stay alert, drive to the conditions and don't take risks.”

The government is working to improve New Zealand's road safety through its 10 year road safety strategy, Safer Journeys.

“We will soon look to finally pass legislation that will help to improve the safety of younger drivers and reduce the impact of alcohol on our roads. This follows earlier legal changes to curb the dangerous behaviour of boyracers and prevent drivers being distracted by cellphone use.”

The official Easter holiday period runs from 4pm Thursday 21 April until 6am on Tuesday 26 April.
