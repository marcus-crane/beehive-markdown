Environment and Climate Change Minister Nick Smith will visit Japan and China over the Easter recess to meet with his respective counterparts, Minister Rya Matsumoto and Minister Zhou Shengzien, to enhance environmental cooperation between New Zealand and our two major Asian trading partners.

“My visit is particularly focussed on climate change and being better informed of the domestic policies being adopted in Japan and China to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This is important to New Zealand in that many technological changes to reduce our emissions will come from products from these economies. Any decisions we make on progressing our emissions trading scheme will also be dependent on the progress being made amongst our key trading partners like Japan and China,” Dr Smith said.

Dr Smith’s visit also includes meeting with the NZ-Japan Parliamentary Friendship League, the Nissui, Mitsubishi and Sumitomo Corporations, visits to universities on clean energy and building technologies, and representing New Zealand at the ANZAC Day commemorations at the Yokohama Commonwealth War Cemetery.

“I will also be taking the opportunity to share experiences with Japan on earthquake emergency responses, learn from Kobe’s experiences in the rebuilding and urban design post-earthquake and on technologies to improve the earthquake resistance of buildings and infrastructure,” Dr Smith said.

“I am also undertaking some private travel at my own expense to visit an AFS daughter who my family hosted in New Zealand and to visit Nelson’s sister city of Miyazu.”

Dr Smith’s visit to China is focussed on management of water, contaminated sites, invasive species, emissions trading and the opportunity for science innovations to promote green growth.
