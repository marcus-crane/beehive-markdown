Defence Minister Wayne Mapp today represented New Zealand in South Korea at ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the Battle of Kap’yong, a significant action in the Korean War.

South Korea’s Minister of National Defence Kim Kwan-jin and Minister of Patriots’ and Veterans’ Affairs Park Sung-choon attended the ceremonies with Dr Mapp, Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard, British Minister of Defence Equipment, Support and Technology Peter Luff and Canadian Senator Yonah Martin.

In his speech at the New Zealand/Australia Kap’yong Memorial, Dr Mapp said that the reasons for New Zealand’s involvement in the defence of South Korea were �œjust and valid”.

They remain so today and this is reflected in our commitment to UNCMAC. The peace has allowed both New Zealand and South Korea to broaden the relationship between our two countries in many other fields of endeavour,” he said. \[Full speech below]

After an ANZAC Day service in Seoul tomorrow Dr Mapp will go on to make official calls in both his portfolios in South Korea, India and Singapore before returning to New Zealand next Saturday.

Today, on the eve of ANZAC Day, we mark the 60th anniversary of the Battle of Kap’yong. This is part of an unbroken line of ANZAC commitment extending back to ANZAC Cove 96 years ago. Our national spirit was forged together, most crucially in battle.

As Prime Minister Gillard noted in her address to New Zealand Members of Parliament two months ago:

"Our ties were indelibly forged in hardship and mateship, from Gallipoli and the Somme to Tobruk, Korea and beyond.

"Our soldiers, as has been said, came �˜from the uttermost ends of the earth’. And wherever Australian and New Zealand blood has been shed, it remains sacred ground."

Kap’yong is truly sacred ground. Sixty years ago the rumble of guns and the cacophony of battle echoed around these hills.

Here, as the enemy forces carried out fierce assaults on positions held by the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment, New Zealand's 16th Field Regiment provided unremitting fire in support of the hard-pressed Australians.

At daybreak on 24 April 16th Field Regiment and the American batteries under their control provided more effective support, bringing down accurate and destructive fire within only a few yards of the Australian positions.

The following night the enemy attacked again. The South Koreans, fighting for your own country with your allies from Australia, Canada and Britain, stood firm. The crushing artillery support provided by the New Zealand gunners and their American comrades carried the day.

In the close-quarter battle, the New Zealand gunners directed shells just over the top of ridges held by allied troops. Their performance in this battle remains a point of great pride for the Royal New Zealand Artillery and the New Zealand Army as a whole.

In New Zealand there is a Maori saying: Waiho i te toka tū moana: Let it be like a rock in the sea”. Here the United Nations forces were a rock that stood indomitable against the enemy.

A successful thrust at Kap’yong would have ruptured the United Nations’ line. The significance of the battle was widely recognised at the time and has become even clearer with the passing of years.

But more than a battle was won. The foundations of a new nation were established. The rule of law was affirmed and new relationships were founded.

Each of these has contemporary relevance. The world in which my generation and I have grown up in have benefited from them. Our prosperous and harmonious relationships today have their origins on this battlefield.

The reasons for our involvement in the defence of South Korea were just and valid. They remain so today and this is reflected in our commitment to UNCMAC. The peace has allowed both New Zealand and Korea to broaden the relationship between our two countries in many other fields of endeavour.

Your efforts have produced the confident proud country of South Korea. But 60 years ago that could not have been foreseen. There were more immediate challenges to overcome.

Much of what we admire in our national character has come from these times of trial; steadfastness, stoicism, endurance and fortitude. Our young had to draw on their reserves of courage and commitment.

These are the very qualities we admire much in today’s servicemen and women. The three Victoria Crosses awarded in Afghanistan, to Willie Apiata, Mark Donaldson and Ben Roberts-Smith, show the very best of our ANZAC character.

The battle fought 60 years ago in these hills required the utmost of the young Australian and New Zealand soldier. They knew they were in a mortal struggle. We salute you who are here today for your deeds of valour 60 years ago. We remember those who fell in the cause of freedom.

Ki whea kotou; kia toa!

Wherever you go - be valorous!
