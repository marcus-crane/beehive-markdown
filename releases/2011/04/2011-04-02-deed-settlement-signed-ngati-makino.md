The Crown and Ngāti Mākino have signed a Deed of Settlement to settle Ngāti Mākino’s historical Treaty of Waitangi claims, Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson announced today.

The Deed of Settlement sets out commercial redress worth $11.9 million and includes the return of culturally significant sites, marae restoration and revitalisation, and social service development.

Ngāti Mākino was represented at today’s signing by the Ngāti Mākino Iwi Authority and the Crown was represented by Mr Finlayson.

The claims of Ngāti Mākino cover the Bay of Plenty region from Lakes Rotoiti and Rotomā to the coast. They relate to the New Zealand Wars and the Bay of Plenty confiscation, the operation and impact of the native land laws, the Crown's land purchasing techniques, as well as twentieth century issues relating to public works and scenic reserve takings.

Ngāti Mākino negotiators initialled a Deed of Settlement in December 2010. Members of Ngāti Mākino voted in support of the Deed with an approval rate of 99%.

The Government has accelerated the momentum of the Treaty settlement process, in order to reach just and durable settlement of historical claims.

“The government is committed to the Treaty settlement process to put right the wrongs of the past and help iwi and hapu build stronger futures for their people," Mr Finlayson said.

“I am pleased to reach a settlement with Ngāti Mākino,” Mr Finlayson said. “I would like to acknowledge the Ngāti Mākino Negotiations Team. Their commitment and leadership will leave an important legacy for the Ngāti Mākino people.”

Legislation will shortly be introduced into Parliament to implement the settlement.
