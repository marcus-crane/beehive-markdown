A Bill which makes offending against Police and Corrections Officers an aggravating factor at sentencing passed its first reading in Parliament today.

The Minister of Police and Corrections, Judith Collins, told Parliament that the current law did not require a judge to take a law enforcement officer’s status into account as an aggravating factor at sentencing. Instead, it is left to the discretion of the sentencing judge.

“It’s appalling that officers are being viciously attacked while they are protecting the public,” Ms Collins said.

“An attack on a Police or Corrections Officer represents an attack on the community and the rule of law.

“Our Police and Corrections staff keep the community safe from our most dangerous people. This Bill sends a strong signal that the Government will do everything in its power to protect them while on the job.”

Justice Minister Simon Power said the Government wanted to explicitly denounce attacks on Police and Corrections Officers in legislation.

"Though this new aggravating factor will not automatically require an increase in an offender's sentence, it will help ensure the courts impose appropriate penalties."

Figures show assaults on Police officers have increased by nearly a third between 2005 and 2009. Assaults on Corrections Officers have more than doubled, although serious assaults have dropped.

Alongside the Bill, the Ministry of Justice, in consultation with the Police and the Department of Corrections, are looking at the adequacy of existing special offences relating to assaults on law enforcement officers and will report back to the Government by June 2011.

The Bill has been sent to the Law and Order Select Committee for public submissions.
