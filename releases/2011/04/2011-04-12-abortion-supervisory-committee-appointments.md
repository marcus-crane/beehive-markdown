Justice Minister Simon Power today confirmed one new appointment and two reappointments to the Abortion Supervisory Committee.

The appointments were last week subject to a conscience vote in Parliament, and the warrants were finalised today by the Minister of Justice and the Governor-General.

Dr Tangimoana Habib has been appointed as a member, Reverend Patricia Allan has been reappointed as a member, and Professor Dame Linda Holloway has been reappointed as chair of the committee, each for terms of three years.

Dr Habib replaces Dr Rosy Fenwicke, who resigned from the committee last year.

Dr Habib’s appointment, along with that of Dame Linda, fulfils the statutory requirement for two medical practitioners on the three-member committee.

The Abortion Supervisory Committee is constituted under section 10 of the Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977, and its functions and powers are set out in section 14. They include:

- To keep under review all the provisions of abortion law, and the operation and effect of those provisions in practice.
- To receive, consider, grant, and refuse applications for licences or for the renewal of licences under the Act, and to revoke any such licences.
- To prescribe standards in respect of facilities to be provided in licensed institutions for the performance of abortions.
