Rugby World Cup Minister, Murray McCully, has welcomed progress on the development of Queens Wharf for the Rugby World Cup 2011, and confirmed the range of activities that will take place on the wharf during the tournament.

Mr McCully also announced that Michael Barnett, Chief Executive of the Auckland Regional Chamber of Commerce, has been appointed to lead the showcasing programme in the Cloud during the Rugby World Cup.

"Mr Barnett is working with a range of partners across local and central government and the private sector to deliver a quality showcasing programme across the 45 days of the tournament,” said Mr McCully.

"We have a unique opportunity during the Rugby World Cup to demonstrate the very best of who we are and what we do to an international audience. It is imperative that we offer an outstanding experience and I am confident that Mr Barnett and the team will deliver just that.

Mr Barnett will be working closely with industry representatives, New Zealand Trade and Enterprise and the Government’s New Zealand 2011 Office to deliver the showcase programme. His work will also complement that of Auckland Tourism Events and Economic Development Ltd (ATEED) and the NZ2011 Office, who share responsibility for delivering the programme of festival and fanzone events across the whole wharf.

“During the Rugby World Cup Queens Wharf will be a hub of activity for our international visitors and New Zealanders.

“It will be a place where we watch rugby games, enjoy live music and festival events, impress international guests and media with views of Auckland’s stunning harbour, and showcase the best of New Zealand with displays and other events,” said Mr McCully.

The Cloud will hold over 6,000 people and will be used for sector showcasing, exhibitions, events, concerts and festivals, as well as be part of the whole-of-wharf fan zone during Rugby World Cup matches. The harbour end of The Cloud will be used as a media lounge and for VIP hosting.

The Cloud will also house a tourism I-Site, where trained staff will help to promote the REAL New Zealand Festival and regional and national visitor experiences and tourist attractions.

Mr McCully said that the redevelopment of Queens Wharf is on schedule, with The Cloud due to be completed by August 2011 and other repairs and landscaping work progressing well.

Waterfront Auckland is managing the redevelopment project on behalf of the Government, and has today released a project update on [www.waterfrontauckland.co.nz](http://www.waterfrontauckland.co.nz)

The first use of The Cloud will be during the Pacific Islands Leaders Forum in early September, and it will then open to the public for the Rugby World Cup from 9 September.

More information about the Queens Wharf showcase, festival and fanzone will be announced over the next few weeks.
