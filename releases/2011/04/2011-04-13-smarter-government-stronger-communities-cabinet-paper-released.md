Minister of Local Government Rodney Hide today released a Cabinet paper setting out the purpose, framework, timing and terms of reference for the ‘Smarter Government, Stronger Communities: Towards Better Local Government and Public Services’ comprehensive review of local government. 

“Efficient and effective local government has a positive impact on New Zealand’s performance and is a key arm of our overall system of government.  This review is an opportunity to contribute to an important policy project that has the potential to shape the future of local government,” Mr Hide said. 

“The project seeks to address issues relating to the structure, functions and funding of local government as well as the relationship between local government and central government and how this can be improved. 

“Modern local government faces many challenges and there is a need to think very broadly about what some solutions might be and how the local government system can respond effectively to those challenges.  Decisions won’t be made until well into Parliament’s next term,” Mr Hide said.

The Cabinet paper has been released on the Department of Internal Affairs’ website: [http://www.dia.govt.nz/Resource-material-Our-Policy-Advice-Areas-Smarter-Government-Stronger-Communities](http://www.dia.govt.nz/Resource-material-Our-Policy-Advice-Areas-Smarter-Government-Stronger-Communities)
