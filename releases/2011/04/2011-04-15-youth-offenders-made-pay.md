The system to enable young offenders to pay reparation to their victims, has been tightened up says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

“It’s important for young offenders to take responsibility for what they’ve done, and make an effort to put things right,” says Ms Bennett. \`

When a young offender is held to account at a Family Group Conference, part of the reparation process includes compensation for victim’s losses.

But when young offenders don’t pay, they can end up facing a Youth Court judge for failure to pay, while the victim remains out of pocket.

To remedy this, a Youth Justice Reparation Accord has been signed between Child, Youth and Family and the National Council of Victim Support Groups.

“So now CYF and Victim Support are working together to collect the money, to ensure it gets to victims,” says Ms Bennett.

The payment amount is agreed to during a Family Group Conference.

Child, Youth and Family monitor payments to ensure the young person is keeping up with their payment schedule. When the full amount is collected, Victim Support pays the victim.

“This means that instead of victims receiving drip-fed payments that dry up before time, the payment process is managed,” says Ms Bennett.

“It also means the young offender meets their obligations and hopefully doesn’t end up in court over failure to pay reparation,” says Ms Bennett.

The cost to CYF is expected to be minimal and would be more than recouped by the savings anticipated in a reduction in reconvened FGCs and Youth Court appearances for children and young people.

The accord was piloted for six months in 2010, with nearly $8,000 collected and more than half of that already paid out to victims.

The accord has been rolled out nationwide, supporting our commitment to provide better services to victims of youth crime.

**Feedback from pilot areas**

&gt; Positive feedback from victims, some who thought they would never see their money paid back at all.

&gt; Youth justice coordinators say victims see the accord as a safe and anonymous way in which to be reimbursed for their losses.

&gt; Families have shown interest in the use of the accord to pay reparation as they are often challenged in collecting even small sums of money. They have reported that the accord is easy to use.
