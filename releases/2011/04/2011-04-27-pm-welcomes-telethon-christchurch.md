Prime Minister John Key today welcomed the announcement of a telethon to support the Government’s Christchurch Earthquake Appeal, the official, global fundraiser for the recovery effort for Christchurch and the Canterbury region.

*Rise Up Christchurch – Te Kotahitanga* will be a 12-hour event on May 22 – three months after the February 22 earthquake. All funds raised will go to the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal.

“There has been a huge outpouring of support from around the world in the wake of February’s tragic earthquake,” says Mr Key.

“This is a fantastic opportunity for people to continue to throw their weight behind the Christchurch community.”

Mr Key congratulated organisers for creating the event.

“In the aftermath of both September’s and February’s earthquakes, there has been a huge number of people and organisations volunteering their time to help Christchurch. This event characterises that generosity, and I know a lot of people are donating their time and expertise to make the event a success.”

The telethon will be broadcast from Christchurch’s CBS Arena and centres from around New Zealand by Maori Television.
