A Bill to enable the assignment of alternate place names was introduced to Parliament today.

Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson, today introduced legislation to amend the New Zealand Geographic Board (Nga Pou Taunaha o Aotearoa) Act 2008.

The Bill makes minor changes to two aspects of the Act. First, the Bill clarifies that when the Board or the Minister for Land Information assign alternative place names, both names may be used either separately or together in official documents.

Secondly, the Bill makes minor changes that enable the official record of Crown protected area names to be kept up to date.

“These changes will make the Act clearer and more workable,” Mr Williamson said.

After its first reading the Bill will be referred to the Government Administration Select Committee.
