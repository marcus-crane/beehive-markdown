The introduction of experience rating today is about providing stronger incentives for businesses to improve workplace safety and make ACC levies fairer, ACC Minister Nick Smith says.

“The averaged ACC levy system has meant businesses with good workplace safety have been carrying the cost of others that are less safe. This new system of experience rating is about better aligning ACC levies with risk and rewarding employers with good safety records,” Dr Smith said.

“Under experience rating, a business’ past claims history will be measured over a three year period. Larger firms paying more than $10,000 a year in workplace levies will get a discount or loading of up to plus or minus 50%, whereas smaller firms will simply benefit from a 10% no-claims discount. It is expected that around 200,000 small businesses and self-employed will receive a discount as a consequence of this policy as compared to around 7000 who will receive a loading.

“Experience rating is also about providing incentives for businesses to engage with health professionals on worker rehabilitation. There is clear evidence that getting workers back into the workplace on limited duties on a part-time basis assists the recovery. Employers will now have a real financial incentive in supporting this more flexible approach to rehabilitation.

“New Zealand does not compare well internationally with more than one person killed and another 600 injured at work each week. The Government’s ambition for these pragmatic changes is to provide an incentive to reduce injuries at work and reward those businesses with excellent workplace safety.”
