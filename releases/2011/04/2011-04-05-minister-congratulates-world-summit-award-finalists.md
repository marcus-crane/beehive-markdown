Covering categories ranging from entertainment and commerce to health and education the awards are an opportunity to showcase New Zealand projects that are at the forefront of new media and e-content creation.

“I am especially pleased to see projects that are taking advantage of our developing broadband infrastructure, like the AUT radio astronomical observatory.
