Entrepreneurs who use [www.business.govt.nz](http://www.business.govt.nz) to put a business plan in place could win a $60,000 prize package, Small Business Minister Maurice Williamson said.

A competition launched today by [www.business.govt.nz](http://www.business.govt.nz) will seek out the best business plan and give it a kick-start for growth.

“Small businesses are the lifeblood of the New Zealand economy and I support any initiative that encourages businesses to start and grow,” Mr Williamson said.

“The government places great value in small businesses and recognises their important contribution to the economy.”

“The [www.business.govt.nz](http://www.business.govt.nz)  website is already a great first-stop-shop of advice and information for many business owners. This competition will make more business owners aware of the wide range of services, resources and online tools it offers.”

The Flying Start Business Plan competition is open to all businesses with less than $1 million annual turnover that have a business idea.

The supreme winner will receive $30,000 from ANZ to help grow their business, along with $10,000 in website and social media development, $10,000 worth of legal advice, $5,000 in education and training and $5,000 of advertising and editorial in NZBusiness magazine.

Regional winners will receive $1,000 in cash, $1,000 in web and social media advice, and $1,000 of legal advice.

The competition closes on Friday, 3 June and winners will be announced Tuesday, 26 July.
