ACC Minister Nick Smith today announced the appointments of former Commerce Commission Chair Paula Rebstock and actuary Jill Spooner to the eight-member ACC Board.

“These new three-year appointments are about ensuring there is a diverse range of skills around the board table of ACC. Paula Rebstock brings many years of experience in Government and business from her time as Chair of the Commerce Commission and Jill Spooner will provide high quality actuarial expertise,” Dr Smith said.

Dr Smith also announced today that existing ACC Board member John McCliskie would be the new Deputy Chair.

“I sincerely thank retiring Board members Peter Neilson and Pip Dunphy who have given outstanding service to the corporation. Peter Neilson resigned last month to take up the role of Chief Executive of the Investment Savings and Insurance Association,” Dr Smith said.

“The challenge for the ACC Board is to continue its excellent work which has seen a reduction in the net liability from $12.8 billion in 2008/09 to $10.3 billion.

“This positive turnaround in ACC’s performance is a real credit to the Board and management which have worked hard to improve rehabilitation rates and better control costs.”

Dr Smith also paid tribute to ACC Chief Executive Jan White, who announced yesterday she was departing after five years of service.

“Dr White has been an outstanding Chief Executive of ACC and I regret she is not available to continue in the role. She has led ACC successfully through difficult challenges and made significant contributions to innovation in care and management of accident claimants. She has much to be proud of from her leadership of ACC and will leave large shoes for her replacement to fill. I look forward to continuing to work with her this year,” Dr Smith said.
