Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia is welcoming the Australian Government’s decision to legislate for the plain packaging of tobacco products.

In response to the Maori Affairs Select Committee enquiry into tobacco the New Zealand Government has already announced that it would monitor progress on Australia’s proposal to legislate for plain packaging of tobacco products and explore the option of New Zealand making similar moves in alignment with Australia.

“We are very supportive of today’s announcement by Australian Health Minister Nicola Roxon and it is my expectation that New Zealand will inevitably follow their lead and look to introduce the plain packaging of tobacco products.

“This government is very serious about reducing the harm caused by smoking and it is vital that we do more to help people quit smoking and stop young people from being tempted to take up the habit.

“We are committed to reaching the challenging goal of seeing Aotearoa become a nation that is essentially smokefree by 2025,” says Mrs Turia.

Government officials have commenced discussions with their respective Australian counterparts on alignment and will report back to Cabinet by 30 June 2011.
