Education Minister Anne Tolley has today officially opened a new school at Papamoa, which will eventually have the capacity to cater for 1200 Year 7-13 students.

The $28 million project was brought forward as part of the Government’s economic stimulus programme, which has seen 400 new school buildings being constructed around New Zealand since 2009.

“The new Papamoa College is a fantastic boost to the area,” says Mrs Tolley.

“It has unique learning spaces, and state of the art gymnasium, library and technology facilities, to give students wonderful opportunities to reach their potential.

“The economic stimulus programme has benefited schools, students and wider communities.

“It has kept construction firms going at a time when other parts of the market have slowed down, and the building of Papamoa College and the new Golden Sands Primary School has injected $36 million into the local economy.

“We are committed to investing in modern and effective teaching environments, and in the coming year our total capital expenditure on school property will rise to $741 million – that’s over $200 million a year more than the previous Government.”

Papamoa is one of the fastest growing communities in New Zealand. The school’s first stage provides for 760 Year 7-9 students. Based on roll growth, development will continue to cater for up to 1200 Year 7-13 students.”
