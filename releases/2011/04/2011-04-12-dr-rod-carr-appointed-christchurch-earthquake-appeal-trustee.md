Dr Rod Carr, Vice Chancellor of the University of Canterbury, has been appointed as the third trustee of the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust.

The appointment under the Trust deed has been made by Internal Affairs Minister Nathan Guy and Finance Minister Bill English.

Dr Carr’s appointment is supported by the University of Canterbury. He joins Brendan Boyle, Secretary for Internal Affairs, and John Whitehead, Secretary to the Treasury.

“Dr Carr will give the Trust a real local flavour. His position in the Canterbury community will be important in helping with the restoration of Christchurch,” says Mr Guy.

The Trustees’ main role is to ensure the Trust fund is applied and used exclusively for the relief of Christchurch and the Canterbury region from the earthquakes on 22 February 2011 and 4 September 2010.

Trustees are not paid, but reasonable expenses are met. The costs of fundraising and administering the Trust are met by the Government, so all funds go to Christchurch.

The Trust is a charitable trust, registered with the Charities Commission.
