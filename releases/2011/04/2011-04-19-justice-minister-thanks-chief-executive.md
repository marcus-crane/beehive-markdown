Justice Minister Simon Power says outgoing Ministry of Justice Chief Executive Belinda Clark brought a high degree of professionalism to her position.

"I have thoroughly enjoyed working with Ms Clark for the past 2½ years.

"She has been at the forefront of some enormous change in the justice system.

"I appreciate the professionalism she instilled in her Ministry on a variety of fronts during that time.

"Having someone with so much experience at the helm of the Ministry during that time made the path of the reforms so much easier.

"I wish her luck in her new position."
