Forestry Minister David Carter today congratulated NZ Imported Tropical Timber Group members who have committed to stopping imports of illegally sourced timber from Indonesia.

The decision by the NZITTG, which comes into force on 1 September, will bar import and sales of timber from Indonesia that does not come with credible third party verification of its legality.

Mr Carter says the stance by the group, whose members represent major importers and retailers of imported timber as well as Greenpeace NZ, sends the message to overseas companies involved in dubious logging activities that illegal logging is unacceptable.

“Illegal logging is a serious problem in the countries where it is carried out, resulting in economic, environmental and social losses.

“The National-led Government called for voluntary industry initiatives to address illegal logging, rather than regulation.”

Mr Carter says it’s also encouraging to learn that, having reached this decision on Indonesian timber imports, the NZITTG is turning its attention to imports from other regions and products other than timber.

About 13 percent of sawn timber imports – about one-quarter of a percent of domestic sawn timber consumption – come from suspected illegal sources, with kwila from the South East Asia and the Pacific the main species of concern in the New Zealand market.
