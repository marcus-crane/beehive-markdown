Civil Defence Minister John Carter has today extended the state of national emergency until 30 April, in the aftermath of the 6.3-magnitude earthquake that struck Christchurch on 22 February.

The state of national emergency in New Zealand - that applies specifically to Christchurch City - was declared on 23 February. Under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002 a state of national emergency can be declared for a maximum of seven days at a time only.

“There is still a need to use the authority of the National Controller while the transition is underway to the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA),� Mr Carter said.

“It is important that there is no void in authority, so the state of national emergency will remain in place.
