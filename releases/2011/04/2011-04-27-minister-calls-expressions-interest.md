Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee is calling for expressions of interest for membership of the community forum to be formed under the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act.

"We are looking for representatives of community-based organisations to put forward their nomination for consideration to be appointed to the community forum," Mr Brownlee said.

Under the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act, the Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery must invite at least 20 people who are suitably qualified to participate in the community forum.

"The intention is to involve a range of grass roots community, business, social, and cultural interests in the forum.

“It will in the main be made up of non-elected persons who take a representative role in their communities."

The purpose of the forum is to provide the Minister with information or advice in relation to the operation of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act.

Any community-based organisation in Canterbury with a nomination for the forum should email a brief curriculum vitae of their suggested representative(s) to communityforum@cera.govt.nz by 5pm on Wednesday 4 May 2011.

"We are looking to get this forum up and running as quickly as possible," Mr Brownlee said.
