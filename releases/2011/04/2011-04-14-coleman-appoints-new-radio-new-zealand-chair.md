Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman today announced the appointment of Richard Griffin as chair of the Radio New Zealand (RNZ) board.

Mr Griffin, a director of a Wellington public affairs company and a former RNZ political editor, was appointed to the board in May 2010. He replaces Christine Grice.

‘’Richard’s added real value to the board since joining and has the ideal background and experience to chair RNZ,’’ Dr Coleman says.

‘’Since National became Government, we have appointed six new members to the seven-person board. It’s virtually a new board with a new chair. The RNZ board now clearly understands the Government’s requirements to provide a quality service for the funding available.’’

In other board appointments, Josh Easby, a governor since May 2010, was elevated to deputy chair while Sheena Henderson and Deborah Taylor were appointed. Existing member Paul East was reappointed for another term.

Ms Henderson, previously Global Brand director for Fonterra, is a Christchurch-based consultant specialising in branding, marketing and corporate advisory work. Ms Taylor, a self-employed business consultant from Queenstown, has an extensive financial and legal background and is a former director and principal of a chartered accountants firm.

Dr Coleman thanked the outgoing board members for their work.
