Reports in this morning’s New Zealand Herald and later repeated by Opposition Leader Phil Goff that a compulsory builders' guarantee has been removed from legislation are incorrect and unhelpful to the industry, Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson said today.

Last September changes to building legislation were split into the Building Amendment Bill No 3, and Building Amendment Bill No 4.

The Herald incorrectly referred to consumer protection measures being removed from Building Amendment Bill No 3, when the measures were never part of that legislation.

Consumer protection measures agreed by Cabinet in August 2010 are set to be included in Building Amendment Bill No 4, expected to be introduced to Parliament later this year.
