The Minister for SOEs, Simon Power, confirms that he has relinquished the SOEs portfolio, effective at noon today.

"This was my decision, and is based purely around my transition to private life after the election."

He says it was a necessary step to ensure there was transparency, and he considers it was his only option.

"The type of work I'm interested in, in the private sector has the potential to bring me into the wider orbit of the SOEs, and I felt I could not continue in my current role without risking a conflict of interest, whether real or perceived.

"I consulted the Prime Minister and the Cabinet Office on my decision.

"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time as Minister of SOEs, firstly as the Government got the boards to sharpen their pencils, and then as we started work on the mixed ownership model.

"I support that work 100 per cent – in fact, I have been one of the main drivers of it for the past 18 months.

"I regard this step as a necessary one to allow the Government to continue its work in this area."
