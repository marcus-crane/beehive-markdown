The New Zealand Government’s Antarctic and Southern Ocean Science Directions and Priorities 2010-20 framework document has been officially launched at Parliament this evening by Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson.

“I am pleased to host the formal launch of the Antarctic science strategy for the next decade to 2020. It is an important event to mark the passing of the document from government to the science community - from policy setting to policy implementation,” says Ms Wilkinson.

The Antarctic science strategy is the product of extensive governmental and academic consultation which took place throughout 2009-10. It was sponsored by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Science and Innovation, and Fisheries and Aquaculture.

Under the theme of global change, Antarctic and Southern Ocean science research will focus on: climate, cryosphere, lithosphere and atmosphere; inland and coastal ecosystems; and marine systems.

“As Minister of Conservation I had the pleasure of visiting Scott Base in February this year to see first hand the remarkable environment where much of New Zealand’s Antarctic research is taking place,” says Ms Wilkinson.

“I look forward to reviewing the resulting research in the decade ahead. It has important implications for New Zealand as we learn how environmental change in Antarctica could impact on us.

“The study of marine systems will also improve our conservation and resource management of the Ross Sea and Southern Ocean.”
