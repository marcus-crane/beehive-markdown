Police Minister Judith Collins has congratulated 13 Police officers who were named as recipients of New Zealand Bravery Awards today.

Thirteen of the Police award winners were recognised for bravery during an armed siege in Napier on 7 May 2009. The siege began with the fatal shooting of Police Senior Constable Len Snee by Jan Molenaar during a routine check of a Chaucer Rd address.

The officers recognised were Constable Michael John Burne, Senior Constable Dennis Michael Hurworth, Detective Sergeant Timothy Nigel Smith, Senior Constable Paul Anthony Symonds, Sergeant Heath Courtenay Jones, Senior Sergeant Anthony James Miller, Constable Kevin Lawrence Rooney, Detective Paul Buckley, Senior Constable Bradley James Clark, and Detective Sergeant Nicholas John Clere.

Inspector Michael Ross O’Leary was recognised for his bravery in rescuing two children from a burning vehicle on State Highway One near Taupo on 24 April 2009.

Constable Nicholas Warren Corley was recognised for rescuing a driver from a burning vehicle in Auckland on 23 August 2008.

Constable James Alexander Muir will receive the award for apprehending an armed youth at Mt Maunganui on 23 June 2007.

“When the lives of others were at risk, each of these officers stepped forward and put their own safety on the line,” Ms Collins said.

“Their acts of bravery showed not only great leadership, initiative and personal courage, but an outstanding commitment to protecting and serving their fellow New Zealanders.

“When danger looms and the unexpected happens, it is reassuring to know that we have such people serving us in the Police. All New Zealanders should be proud of them.”
