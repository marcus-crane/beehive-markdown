Commerce Minister Simon Power today released a discussion document on the content of regulations in the Copyright (Infringing File Sharing) Amendment Act, which became law last week.

The Act puts into place the three-notice regime to deter illegal file sharing which will come into force on 1 September.

The discussion document seeks input into regulations on:

• Requirements for information that copyright owners send to ISPs under the new notice regime.

• Form and content of notices.

• The fee an ISP may charge a copyright owner for performing its functions under the bill.

• The method by which the copyright tribunal will calculate awards for copyright infringement.

Mr Power said there had been a thorough and constructive process on the regime from beginning to end, starting in March 2009.

"That process included the formation of a working group, stakeholder meetings, a public discussion document, and a full select committee process which considered submissions.

"The process for public input into the legislation has been comprehensive, and it's now important that interested parties provide input into the formation of regulations so we can ensure the Act is implemented effectively.

"I invite all interested parties to provide input into the development of the regulations."
