Justice Minister Simon Power today announced the appointment of Dinu Harry and reappointment of Rodger Finlay to the board of Public Trust.

Dinu Harry has been practising accountancy in Auckland for 30 years and, in 1992, established his own firm, Bertelsen Harry Waters. He has held a number of governance roles and is a member of the Unitec Council. Last year he served as President of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, and from 2005 to 2008 was chair of the Auckland Indian Association Board of Trustees.

“Mr Harry brings to the board considerable experience in providing accounting advice to a client group very similar to that of Public Trust,” Mr Power said.

Rodger Finlay has been a member of the Public Trust board since June 2009. He has extensive experience in banking, investment, and financial management developed through 22 years in investment banking and fund management roles with Paribas, CS First Boston, and UBS in Europe. Since returning to New Zealand, he has concentrated on governance roles.

“We are fortunate to be able to draw on Mr Finlay’s senior experience at Public Trust.

‘I am confident the board now has the right mix of capability and experience it needs to firmly establish Public Trust as one of New Zealand’s strongest financial institutions.”
