Education Minister Anne Tolley says improvements to the teaching workforce will be addressed at a two-day forum which gets underway in Wellington tomorrow.

“This event is extremely important as we look at ways to improve the quality of teaching, retain great teachers and lift student achievement,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Representatives from right across the education sector will discuss a range of recommendations, following over 900 submissions from teachers, principals, sector groups and the public.”

Proposals will be discussed in a number of key areas such as:

• Changes to initial teacher education

• Reward, recognition and career progression for teachers, and

• Leadership in schools and the profession

Members of the Education Workforce Advisory Group will be leading the discussion sessions at the forum.

“We all have a stake in recruiting and retaining the very best teachers to give every single young New Zealander the opportunity to reach their potential,” says Mrs Tolley.

“As we look to the future we need to work constructively together and listen to new and innovative ideas, to benefit students and teachers.”

A summary of the submissions received during consultation is available at www.minedu.govt.nz
