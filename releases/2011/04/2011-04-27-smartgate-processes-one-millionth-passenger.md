SmartGate has processed its one-millionth passenger Customs Minister Maurice Williamson announced today, as demand for the technology continues to rise.

“SmartGate has reached yet another outstanding milestone and it’s great that New Zealanders are making the most of this new technology”, Mr Williamson said.

“I am very proud of the level of uptake SmartGate has received. It is well ahead of expectations.”

The technology is currently available at Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch airports.

The increased demand for SmartGate is being driven by the increase in New Zealand and Australian passengers with ePassports who are eligible to use it. Tourism volumes are also expected to increase over the next few years.

SmartGate is part of moving trans-Tasman travel closer to the “near domestic” experience sought by both the New Zealand and Australian governments.

“Additional SmartGate capacity will greatly assist in the management of major events such as the Rugby World Cup 2011”, Mr Williamson said.
