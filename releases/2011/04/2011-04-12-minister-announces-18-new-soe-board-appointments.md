State Owned Enterprises Minister Simon Power today announced 18 new appointments and 11 reappointments across 12 SOEs and one airport company.

“I’m pleased to be making a range of strong new appointments in this round, but I also want to acknowledge the retirement of Airways Corporation chair Con Anastasiou.

“Mr Anastasiou, who is retiring at the end of July, has served on the Airways board since 2000 and has led the company with considerable success as chair since January 2005. I thank him for his dedicated service over that time.”

The deputy chair at Airways, Susan Paterson will take over as chair. She has served on the board since 2006, and has been deputy since May 2008. She is a member of the Electricity Authority, a director of Housing New Zealand, and a former director of Transpower. She has also had private sector governance experience, including at Abano Healthcare Group, Les Mills, and Goodman (NZ) Ltd.

“I look forward to working with Ms Paterson to maintain Airways’ strong performance,” Mr Power said.

Airways board member David Park has been appointed deputy chair.

Mr Power said two other deputy chairs will be moving on from their SOE boards in this appointment round.

Lorraine Witten will replace Janine Smith as deputy chair at Kordia. Ms Smith is leaving to concentrate on her role as chair of AsureQuality. Ian Fraser will replace Ian Donald as deputy chair of Transpower.

“I would like to thank Janine Smith and Ian Donald for their service.

“I’m also pleased to introduce a strong group of recognised directors and business executives to add to the existing expertise on SOE boards.”

New directors on SOEs are:

On Landcorp: John Brakenridge (CEO of the New Zealand Merino Company).

On Meridian: Peter Wilson (chair of Westpac New Zealand), John Bongard (former CEO of Fisher & Paykel Appliances), Anake Goodall (former CEO of Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu).

On Kordia: John Quirk (company director and principal of corporate advisory firm Howard and Co).

On KiwiRail: Rebecca Thomas (CEO of Mint Asset Management), Dr Kevin Thompson (former CEO of Opus Consultants).

On Metservice: Te Taru White (former CEO of the Maori Arts and Crafts Institute).

On Quotable Value: Raewyn Lovett (Partner in law firm Duncan Cotterill), Ian Holland (director and former deputy head of European Sales for Morgan Stanley), Roger Bridge (Property business owner and Director of NZ Venture Investment Fund).

On Transpower: Don Huse (former CEO of Auckland International Airport), Keith Tempest (former CEO of Trustpower). 

“These directors have a broad range of commercial experience and I expect them to make a significant contribution to delivering on the Government’s goal of better commercial performance from our SOEs.

“The quality of the appointments highlights the Government’s continuing ability to attract some of the country’s most experienced governance professionals to serve on SOE boards, as well as developing the next generation of talent.” 

Mr Power thanked retiring board members for their contributions and wished them well in their future endeavours.

Full details of the changes, which will take effect from 1 May are set out below.
