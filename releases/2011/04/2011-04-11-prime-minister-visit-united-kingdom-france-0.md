Following the cancellation of planned visits to Europe last year and in March due to the Canterbury earthquakes, Prime Minister John Key will travel to the United Kingdom and France next week.

Mr Key will attend pre-Anzac Day services at the French and New Zealand Memorials in Le Quesnoy and Longueval, before travelling to London for the Anzac Day dawn service at Hyde Park Corner and other commemorations.

In London, Mr Key will meet British Prime Minister David Cameron and participate in several events with an economic and business focus including for the rebuilding of Christchurch.

“I’m looking forward to holding talks with Mr Cameron and other members of the British coalition Government,” Mr Key says.

“This will be an important leg of my visit considering the depth of our relationship, the ties between our people and businesses, and our shared outlooks. In London I will also have an opportunity to thank those who assisted in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake and give impetus to the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal.”

Mr Key will also make his first visit to Paris as Prime Minister to meet President Nicolas Sarkozy and other senior Government representatives for formal talks.

“New Zealand has a wide-ranging relationship with France,” Mr Key says.

“I look forward to discussing our cooperation in the Pacific and in Europe, and on G20 issues, as France prepares to host the next Leaders’ Summit.”

During his visit to the United Kingdom Mr Key will attend a private audience with Her Majesty The Queen. His wife, Bronagh, will join them both for lunch afterwards. Mr Key will also meet with His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales. These engagements have been rescheduled following Mr Key’s two earlier cancelled visits to the United Kingdom.

Mr Key will complete his trip by attending, with his wife Bronagh, the royal wedding of His Royal Highness Prince William and Catherine Middleton at Westminster Abbey.
