Two reports to guide the Government’s work in unlocking the potential of Maori agribusiness have been released by Agriculture Minister David Carter and Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples.

“The Government has identified Maori agribusiness as a key priority and these reports support our work in targeting opportunities to lift the productivity of Maori land and agribusiness,” says Mr Carter.

“Maori landowners are significant contributors to New Zealand’s primary sectors and these reports identify further potential for them to develop profitable and sustainable businesses.

“Economic growth in Maori agribusiness boosts the wider New Zealand economy.”

Dr Sharples says the reports provide a helpful insight into the economic, cultural and social aspirations that Maori communities have for their land ownership. 

“The reports outline instances where Maori are successfully advancing their aspirations for the benefit of their whanau now, and in the future.

“I look forward to working with Maori landowners to build on these successes in order to assist them to achieve their aspirations for their land,” Dr Sharples says.
