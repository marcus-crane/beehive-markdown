The inaugural presentation of the New Zealand Defence Service Medal will take place at Parliament next week. 

About 30 recipients will receive their medals from Minister of Veterans’ Affairs Judith Collins and Defence Minister Wayne Mapp on Thursday.

The new medal is awarded for non-operational military service in the Defence Force by New Zealanders. Those who have served in the military for more than three years since World War Two, and those who did compulsory military training or national military service, qualify.

“This medal recognises our service personnel for their contribution to the peace, freedom and security that all New Zealanders enjoy today,” Ms Collins said.

“Our service veterans hold a special status in our society. This Government is committed to honouring those veterans who served their country operationally and in a wide range of vital support roles.”

Dr Mapp said the medal closes a gap in medallic recognition of military service.

“Many thousands of New Zealanders have met the demanding requirements of military service. They have served their country and community loyally and well, including responding to disasters such as the Christchurch earthquakes, but not on operations. 

“Up to now there has been no recognition of this service, on which the Government places high value. This medal remedies that. It delivers on the National Party’s campaign commitment to recognise those people. 

“It also honours those Reserve personnel whose service comes on top of full-time commitments in civilian life,” he said.
