Education Minister Anne Tolley and Associate Education Minister Rodney Hide have today officially opened a new $6.3 million special education facility in Lower Hutt.

Kimi Ora School, which has relocated from Thorndon, has been specifically designed to meet the needs of students with physical disabilities.

“Students, families, specialists and teachers will all benefit from the new facilities which include a hydrotherapy pool, sensory room, and state of the art learning and therapy spaces,” says Mrs Tolley.

“The Government spends $471 million on special education each year. This reflects the importance we place on ensuring students with special education needs get the best possible support and resources.”

"Special schools form a valuable part of the special education network and this Government is committed to ensuring young New Zealanders with special education needs can learn and succeed at school,” Mr Hide says.

"I am delighted that students at Kimi Ora will benefit from the state of the art environment, not only at the base school in Naenae, but also at the new $2 million satellite unit at Evans Bay Intermediate.

"The satellite unit will welcome its first students at the beginning of the new school term."
