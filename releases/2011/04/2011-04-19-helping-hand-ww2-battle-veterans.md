The Defence Force will provide a $2000 per person grant through Veterans’ Affairs New Zealand (VANZ) to help qualified veterans to attend the 70th anniversary celebrations of the Battle of Crete in May, Defence Minister Wayne Mapp announced today.

“These veterans served their country with great distinction in the most arduous circumstances. The 70th anniversary of this landmark confrontation might well be the last chance many of them have to pay their respects to their comrades who did not come home – and for us, in turn, to pay our respects to the survivors,“ Dr Mapp said.

“The grants will be administered by VANZ, and veterans who have already received VANZ grants to attend earlier commemorations will be eligible for this new funding.

“In this way the Government, through the Defence Force of today, is paying special tribute to the soldiers, sailors and airmen of yesterday.

“Those who served in this historic battle stood ready to give up their lives to preserve our freedom. These grants are one of the ways we can further acknowledge what they went through on our behalf,” the Minister said.
