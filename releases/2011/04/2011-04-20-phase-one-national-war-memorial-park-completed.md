Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson today marked the completion of the first phase of development on the new National War Memorial Park in Wellington, meaning the new public space will be available for use during Monday’s ANZAC Day ceremony.

Developed during the past 18 months, phase one of the the park sits across the road from the National War Memorial on Buckle St. The former commercial area has been transformed into a dedicated public space to remember and think of those affected by war.

“The completion of phase one of the park creates an important public space to complement the National War Memorial precinct around Buckle Street,” Mr Finlayson said.

The park will help ease on significant days of remembrance, such as ANZAC day, when the immediate space around the National War Memorial is at full capacity.

Today’s announcement signals completion of stage one of the national war memorial park.

Further development, including final decisions around roading in the area, will be carried out in the lead up to the centenary of the First World War in 2014.
