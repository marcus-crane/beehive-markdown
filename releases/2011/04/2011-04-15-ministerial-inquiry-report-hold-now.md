Social Development Minister Paula Bennett says she is unable to release the findings of a Ministerial Inquiry into alleged child abuse.

“In January I called for a Ministerial Inquiry into the alleged serious abuse of a nine year old girl from Auckland and other matters relating to the welfare, safety and protection of children in New Zealand,” says Ms Bennett.

“The Ministerial Inquiry is now complete. I would very much like to release the findings and will when possible, but for now legal reasons prevent that,” says Ms Bennett.

“Though I can't release the report itself yet, the Government is actively working on the recommendations contained within it,” says Ms Bennett.

“It is my utmost priority to see justice done and as a Minister I do not wish to release information which could affect court proceedings,” says Ms Bennett.
