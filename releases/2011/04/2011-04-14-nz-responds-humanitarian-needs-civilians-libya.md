Foreign Minister Murray McCully has today announced $1 million by New Zealand to support the international humanitarian effort to help civilians affected by fighting in Libya.

“The situation for civilians in Libya is rapidly deteriorating as intense fighting continues,” Mr McCully said.

“Five weeks of conflict has forced more than 350,000 people to flee their homes, left an unconfirmed number of civilians dead, and made the affected areas in Libya very difficult for aid agencies to reach safely.”

“New Zealand will provide $1 million dollars to the International Federation of the Red Cross who are working with the Red Crescent National Societies of Libya, Tunisia and Egypt, he said.

“This funding will help them respond to urgent humanitarian needs including medical care, water and sanitation, relief items and the re-establishment of family links."

“New Zealand supports the international coalition effort aimed at implementing UN Security Council Resolution 1973, which demands an immediate and complete ceasefire in Libya, and once again calls on the Gadaffi regime to fully comply with the terms of the Resolution,” said Mr McCully.
