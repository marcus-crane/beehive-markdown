Environment Minister Nick Smith today welcomed the passing of the Second Reading of the Environmental Protection Authority Bill without division saying New Zealand needs to strengthen and improve its environmental management.

“This reform is about providing stronger central Government direction on environmental regulation, better efficiency and cost effectiveness and improving the integrity of systems by delegating administration of regulatory functions to an independent Crown entity,” Dr Smith said.

“The Bill brings together under one Crown authority a range of environmental regulatory functions that currently reside with the Ministry for the Environment, the Environmental Risk Management Authority, the Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.”

These include functions under the Resource Management Act (1991), Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act (1998), Ozone Layer Protection Act (1996) and the Climate Change Response Act (2002).

“I’m pleased the Local Government and Environment Committee has recommended the Bill establishing the EPA should be passed. The Committee has recommended only minor changes such as including certain functions under the Ozone Layer Protection Act and the Imports and Exports (Restrictions) Act. These recommendations are helpful and will strengthen the Bill,” Dr Smith said.

“The Government’s intention is to pass this legislation to enable the Environmental Protection Authority to take up its new role from 1 July 2011.”
