Prime Minister John Key this afternoon welcomed the inaugural China Southern Airlines flight from Guangzhou.

China Southern will fly a non-stop service three times a week between Guangzhou and Auckland.

“This is a very significant development which will have substantial benefits for New Zealand business, tourism and exporting,” says Mr Key.

Tourism New Zealand (TNZ) has entered a joint marketing agreement with China Southern with each contributing up to NZD $4 million over a three year term for marketing activity promoting travel to New Zealand for business and leisure. Additionally, China Southern will undertake extensive marketing of New Zealand in Guangzhou.

“China Southern’s network extends to 64 of China’s 94 airports which will provide a substantial pool of potential travellers to New Zealand. This is a huge development, with Auckland Airport advising the service is expected to bring an additional 25,000 visitors per year to New Zealand and generate $75 million to the New Zealand economy.

“This is another very strong message that New Zealand is open to business, despite the Christchurch earthquake, and is warmly welcoming visitors as we always have.”
