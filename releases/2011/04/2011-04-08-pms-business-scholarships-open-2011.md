Prime Minister John Key says the 2011 Prime Minister’s Business Scholarships, which open for applications today, are designed to build business capability and develop skills, particularly in management and international business leadership.

“Better management skills mean better, stronger firms with higher productivity. The Government is giving our brightest and best another opportunity to study at some of the world’s best institutions so they can do just that – improve their management skills,” says Mr Key.

The first round of the scholarships in 2010 is helping nine successful recipients to attend prestigious institutions such as Harvard, INSEAD, London Business School, Wharton School, Parsons Design School and Stanford University this year.

Economic Development Minister David Carter says he expects the scholarships to bring long-term benefits to New Zealand.

“We expect recipients to bring back a raft of skills they can apply in their firms, plus they’ll build international networks that their firms can profit from, and they’ll have new ideas to help their organisations go global,” says Mr Carter.

“We’re looking for people who we know have the potential to make a positive contribution to New Zealand’s economy. Managers, executives and business owners of New Zealand-based firms who plan to attend international business schools are all encouraged to apply.”
