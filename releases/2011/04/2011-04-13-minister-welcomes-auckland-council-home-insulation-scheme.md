Acting Minister Energy and Resources, Hekia Parata, today welcomed Auckland Council’s introduction of a special rates scheme to encourage people in the region to insulate their homes.

Auckland Council has agreed to launch a programme that will allow ratepayers to access the Government’s Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart funding for home insulation and heating, and pay the difference over time through their rates bill.

“I want to congratulate Auckland Council for their commitment to this scheme which will help more Aucklanders make their homes warmer, drier and healthier,’’ says Ms Parata. 

 “With a population the size of Auckland’s there are many families that could really benefit from properly insulating and heating their homes. The Government grant, coupled with the ability to pay the difference off over time will make it easier for more people to choose to invest in insulation, and that is good for them, and the community as a whole.

‘”Insulating our homes has a significant impact on the health of the people who live there, and that means fewer visits to doctors and hospitals which reduces pressure on the local health system.”

Auckland Council joins the Greater Wellington Regional Council, Nelson City Council, Hawkes Bay Regional Council, Marlborough District Council, Tasman District Council and The Chatham Island’s Council in providing a rates scheme for its residents.

With Auckland City’s participation, 46% of the houses that are eligible for Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart funding are in areas where an option to pay through the rates system is currently offered. 

The Government’s Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart programme is investing $347 million over four years to retrofit at least 188,000 homes. To date, over 91,000 households have taken advantage of the scheme across the country.

Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart is part of a joint initiative with the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand.

**Background**
