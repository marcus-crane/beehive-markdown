Courts Minister Georgina te Heuheu and Justice Minister Simon Power today welcomed improvements made by a public awareness programme to increase juror attendance rates.

The programme features ordinary New Zealanders, committed to making a contribution to their community by attending jury service, in a series of posters which are currently being run in community and mainstream papers, as well as on Stuff and TradeMe as website message boards.

“This public awareness campaign is part of a wider programme of work to improve information and services to jurors, such as the annual juror satisfaction survey and the new jury service website,” says Mrs te Heuheu.

“Jurors make a valuable contribution to their community and the justice system every time they attend court, even if they aren’t chosen to serve on the jury.”

In 2009 more than 300,000 people were summoned for jury service. However, only 17 per cent showed up, with 21 per cent failing to attend, and a further 62 per cent being excused (this includes those who may not have been eligible or did not have to attend).

“The awareness programme is aimed at all New Zealanders eligible to serve on a jury, and in particular acknowledges those who have to make special arrangements to do so, such as for childcare,” says Mrs te Heuheu.

“The public awareness programme will also reach out to employers and government sector agencies.”

“Online surveys with potential jurors before, during and after the programme will help identify whether it has been successful in raising awareness and changing public perceptions about jury service,” says Mrs te Heuheu.

Results from the monitoring of the programme will be available in early July.

Justice Minister Simon Power said the campaign comes on top of legislation which came into effect last October to introduce jury deferrals.

“Jury deferrals are being well used by the public, with a steady increase in the number of deferrals being granted each month, as well an increase in the number of jurors attending jury service,” he said.

“There’s also been a reduction in the number of excusals granted, although the success of the deferrals will not be fully evident until early next year.”

Jury boundaries have also been extended from 30 to 45 kilometres from a jury trial courthouse, so people are less likely to be frequently summoned, particularly in smaller areas.

Last week a bill to tighten juror privacy, safety, and security and address concerns regarding who can serve on juries passed its first reading in Parliament and is at the Law and Order Select Committee for public submissions.
