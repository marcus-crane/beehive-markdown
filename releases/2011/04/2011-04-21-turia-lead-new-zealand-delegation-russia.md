Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia is leading a New Zealand delegation to the First Global Ministerial Conference on Healthy Lifestyles and Non-communicable Diseases being held in Moscow from 28 - 29 April 2011.

Non-communicable diseases include obesity, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes.

“They're called non-communicable because they can't be passed from one person to another but the rates of these diseases are increasing and having a major impact on health systems worldwide,” says Mrs Turia.

“It's estimated that 60 per cent of deaths globally are caused by non-communicable diseases which are often linked to unhealthy diet, low levels of physical activity, tobacco consumption and harmful use of alcohol.”

More than 80 Ministers or Associate Ministers from 150 countries will attend the Global Ministerial Conference, which is being hosted by Ms Tatyana Golikova, Minister of Health and Social Development of the Russian Federation.

It will follow a one-day WHO Global Forum on 27 April in Moscow, on Addressing the Challenge of Non-communicable Diseases.

The WHO Forum, which will involve Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Health, policy leaders, researchers and non-government organisations will address the evidence of the health impact of non-communicable diseases and effective health solutions to reduce risk factors which cause them.

”Non-communicable diseases are not just a health issue. They also have implications for social and economic development, international relations and trade. It is important that New Zealand is part of these discussions,” says Mrs Turia.

“This conference presents a significant opportunity for Ministers across the world to debate the evidence and consider practical steps that government, civil society and international health organisations can take to address the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases worldwide - and to join up policy in all the related areas.”
