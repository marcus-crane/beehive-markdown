Police Minister Judith Collins today opened the third and final stage of the $35 million new Manukau Police Station, and paid tribute to the work of Manukau Police in reducing crime.

The first stage of the new station was opened in February 2007 and the second in February 2009. The third stage, which was completed under the $5 million budget, will bring Crime Services Staff together under one roof. The entire project cost around $35 million and will house a staff of about 300.

“Our New Zealand Police deserve plenty of support, good tools and good working conditions. This includes modern, well-equipped Police stations that allow them to perform at their best,” Ms Collins said.

The additional office space in Stage III of the development will be used to accommodate some of the 300 extra Police officers that were deployed in Counties-Manukau between December 2008 and December 2010.

Of the 300 new officers, 54 were allocated to the CIB – mostly to the Organised Crime Group and Major Crime Group.

“CIB staff have, until now, been scattered around the building. The new offices bring the Crime Services Group together in one area where they can work more effectively at solving crime.”

Ms Collins paid tribute to Manukau Police for their role in lowering crime rates.

“Counties-Manukau has gone from having one of the worst crime rates in the country to one of the best.

“In 2010, reported crime was down 9.5%. That is its lowest level since 2004.

“This facility, and the dedicated Police staff who serve here, have played an important part of that turnaround. I would like to acknowledge and thank them for their great work.”
