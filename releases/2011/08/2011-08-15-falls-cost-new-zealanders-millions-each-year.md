Home injuries cost New Zealanders $537 million last year, says the Associate Minister for ACC, Hekia Parata.

This week is New Zealand Safety Week where the focus is on raising awareness of the extent and consequences of falls in the home.

Home injuries accounted for the highest proportion of new ACC claims – 612,000 - and the highest proportion of cost in 2010.

The most common causes of accidents in the home were slips, trips and falls.

More than 261,000 people were injured in falls at home last year, costing ACC $272 million.

“You might be surprised to learn that two thirds of those claims were made by people in the workforce and the cost to ACC of those falls was $164 million,’’ says Ms Parata.

“We often assume it is older people and young children who fall but ACC injury statistics show that we are all susceptible to falls.

“These falls can have a significant impact on our lives.”

Throughout the week ACC, with the support of over 800 businesses and community groups, is running an awareness campaign encouraging all New Zealanders to prevent falls in their homes.

“It's important to take care and be safe in your home,” says Ms Parata.
