The Government has approved capital expenditure of $20.8 million to demolish the existing Tauranga Police Station and build a state-of-the art replacement, Police Minister Judith Collins announced today.

Police have occupied the Monmouth Street site since the 1880s, with the current station built by the Ministry of Works in 1965. The existing building was built to accommodate only 50 staff and 10 police vehicles. The number of Police in Tauranga has grown to around 185 with 60 vehicles.

“The opening of this new facility won’t come soon enough for Tauranga Police,” Ms Collins said.

“The current station is cramped, is in poor condition and does not meet the needs of a modern Police service.

“Lack of space has resulted in Police leasing additional buildings in Tauranga to house parts of their operation such as prosecutions, Neighbourhood Policing Teams and various administrative functions.

“The new 3900 sq m facility will bring them together under one roof. This will enable closer co-operation and communication between Police groups, a better working environment and better facilities for the public.”

The project has a total cost of $20,787,000 over the 20-year life of the building, to be funded from Police baselines. It is expected to be fully operational around mid-2013.

“Our Police deserve plenty of support, good tools and good working conditions. This includes modern, well-equipped Police stations that allow them to perform at their best,” Ms Collins said.
