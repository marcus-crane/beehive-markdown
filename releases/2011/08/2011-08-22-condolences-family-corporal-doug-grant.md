The Minister of Defence, Dr Wayne Mapp, has extended his deepest sympathy to the family of Corporal Doug Grant, who was killed in Afghanistan on Friday.

Dr Mapp said the loss will be felt deeply by the Special Air Service and the wider Defence Force.

“We stand with the family and the SAS as we all mourn this brave man,” he said.

The government and the Defence Force will do whatever they can to support his family at this saddest of times.

Dr Mapp said he had no doubts that Linton and the wider Manawatu community would rally to support Corporal Grant’s wife and two children, wider family, friends and colleagues at this difficult time.

“The Special Air Service serves New Zealand with great courage and commitment. They face mortal danger throughout their Afghanistan deployments,” said Dr Mapp.

“Our fallen soldier has made the ultimate sacrifice for New Zealand.”

Dr Mapp said that the SAS trooper and his colleagues were protecting all New Zealanders from the risks of international terrorism.
