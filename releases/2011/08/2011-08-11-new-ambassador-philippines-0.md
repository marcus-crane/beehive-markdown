New Zealand’s next Ambassador to the Philippines will be career diplomat Reuben Levermore, Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"The Philippines is an important trading partner for New Zealand. It is our 13th largest export market and a major market for our dairy products. It is also a key member of the Association of South East Asian Nations," said Mr McCully.

”More Filipinos have settled here than from any other South East Asian country, helping to foster trade, travel, tourism and education links between our two countries.”

“As the new ambassador Mr Levermore will play an important role in helping further strengthen the trading relationship with the Philippines”, said Mr McCully.

“The government is looking to improve the business links following the recently enacted ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement,” he said.

Mr Levermore has served in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade as a negotiator to the World Trade Organisation and worked at the New Zealand Mission to the European Union in Brussels. He also took a two year sabbatical from MFAT to work in the financial services sector in London. He currently is the trade private secretary to the Minister of Trade.
