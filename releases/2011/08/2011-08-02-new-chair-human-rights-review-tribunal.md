Justice Minister Simon Power today announced the appointment of Rodger Haines, QC, as chair of the Human Rights Review Tribunal.

The tribunal reviews proceedings after complaints have been dealt with by the Human Rights Commission, the Privacy Commissioner, or the Health and Disability Commissioner.

“Mr Haines brings a wealth of experience in administrative law and a strong human rights background to the tribunal,” Mr Power said.

He replaces Royden Hindle who did not seek reappointment after completing nearly 10 years as chair.

“Mr Hindle has done a superb job as chair and I thank him for his long period of service.”
