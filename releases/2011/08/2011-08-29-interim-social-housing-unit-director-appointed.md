Housing Minister Phil Heatley has welcomed the appointment of interim Social Housing Unit (SHU) Director, Michael Pead.

"The establishment of the SHU and Michael’s appointment is an important step towards implementing Government’s aim of achieving a significant increase in the volume of social, niche and affordable housing delivered by the third sector," says Mr Heatley.

Earlier this year we announced that $40 million had been set aside to help the third sector grow the volume of social housing.

"The role of the SHU, currently a semi-autonomous unit within the Department of Building and Housing, will be to administer that funding and to actively work with third sector providers to explore and develop opportunities to increase the social and affordable housing pool," says Mr Heatley.

"The Community Housing sector has repeatedly told us and have demonstrated that they are ready, willing and able to step up to provide social and affordable housing at volume. The role of the SHU is to assist the sector with this aim, providing funding, land and if appropriate surplus Housing New Zealand stock, to enable them to leverage the greatest volume of housing possible," says Mr Heatley.

Mr Pead will take the role until a permanent Director is appointed.

Mr Heatley also announced the appointment of a new four-person panel to monitor the progress of social housing reforms.

Chaired by Brian Donnelly, the Ministerial Advisory Panel (MAP) will advise Ministers on how well the reforms are progressing, the results being achieved, and any major issues that arise.

"We have a very important programme of change underway in social housing, the role of the MAP is to ensure Ministers know exactly how the SHU and social housing reforms are progressing," says Mr Heatley.

The Panel members are:

• Brian Donnelly, Chair

• Andrew Body

• Rau Hoskins

• Lisa Woolley

"The Panel members all have significant expertise in the sector, which equips them well for this work. The MAP will not be involved in the day-to-day management of the SHU or in grant decisions but will instead provide Ministers directly with independent advice on the direction and progress of reforms. This will avoid any conflict of interest issues," Minister Heatley says.
