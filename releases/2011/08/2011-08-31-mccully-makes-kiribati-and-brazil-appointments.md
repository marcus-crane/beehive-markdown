A new High Commissioner to Kiribati and a new Ambassador for Brazil have been announced by Foreign Affairs Minister, Murray McCully.

The High Commissioner to Kiribati will be Mike Walsh, currently a Deputy Director within the Ministry’s Pacific Division.  He has previously served in Pretoria as Deputy High Commissioner, in Riyadh as Deputy Head of Mission and in Apia as Second Secretary.

“This appointment was the result of an advertised and open process which attracted a number of good internal and external applicants. Mr Walsh satisfied the panel he was the best candidate,” said Mr McCully.

“Kiribati faces major challenges. The High Commissioner will steer projects we have underway to improve water catchments and rubbish collection, and the building of a subdivision.  We are also working closely with Kiribati on fisheries to find employment in crewing and observing,” he said.

The High Commissioner is also accredited to Palau, the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia.

New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Brazil will be Jeffrey McAlister.  He is currently Consul General in Sao Paulo, and previously worked on Asian trade and economic and international security issues, both in Wellington and on postings in South Korea and the United States.

“With Brazil’s emergence as a major global economic power there are growing opportunities for New Zealand businesses,” said Mr McCully.

“New Zealand has significant investments in Brazil’s dairy sector. There is good scope to grow these ties, as well as our exports particularly around agri-technology and specialised manufacturing,” he said.
