The next Census is on track to be held in March 2013 after the introduction of a Bill in Parliament today, Statistics Minister Maurice Williamson says.

The Duties of Statutory Officers (Census and Other Remedial Provisions) Bill amends the Statistics Act to allow the census to be deferred to 2013.

The Bill also amends the Statutes, Drafting and Compilation Act 1920.

The census is the official count of how many people and dwellings there are in New Zealand and gives a unique snapshot of our communities.

"Information from the census helps decide how government funding is spent in the community. It is used by councils, community groups, iwi, and businesses to plan for the future,” Mr Williamson says.

The 8 March 2011 Census was deferred on 25 February 2011 due to the Christchurch earthquake.

The census could not have been successfully completed given the national state of emergency and the probable impact on results.
