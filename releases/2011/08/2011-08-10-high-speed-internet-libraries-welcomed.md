The Minister Responsible for the National Library Nathan Guy has welcomed the inclusion of up to 82 libraries in the final tender process for the Government’s rural broadband initiative.

“This will be a major boost for public access to the internet. Many rural communities will have access to ultra-fast broadband, even if they live outside the UFB coverage area.

“The Aotearoa People’s Network Kaharoa (APNK) provides free access to the internet in 133 public libraries and 3 maraes throughout New Zealand. This is very important to those who don’t have an internet connection at home.

“A key role of public libraries is to connect people with information and the world around them, and this will be a big step forward.

“Library connections will be able to run at full speed from opening to closing, creating a world of new opportunities. It will mean better and quicker access to information, education and job seeking tools.

“Libraries are the hub of many small communities and their role will become even more important in the future.

“This ensures the benefits of the Government’s investment into fibre will be widespread throughout the community.”
