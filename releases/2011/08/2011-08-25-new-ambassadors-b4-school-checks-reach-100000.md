Health Minister Tony Ryall says over 100,000 four year olds have now had a B4 School health check, and he is hearing reports of life-changing outcomes for children and their families.

“The B4 School Check is really an opportunity for a stock take – to see exactly where a child is at, physically, emotionally and socially.

“Children are having eyesight problems identified and are seeing clearly for the first time. Others are being helped to hear better, or to work through behavioural issues.”

Mr Ryall also welcomes a partnership between TV cartoon characters, the WotWots, and B4 School Checks and the Ministry of Health launched today in Wellington.

“the WotWots is a made-in-New Zealand children’s television show that has gone global. The characters are very popular with young children, and we hope the promise of a free the WotWots book and sticker will have children all over the country pestering mum and dad to take them for a check!

“Pukeko Pictures has been extremely generous in donating the support of DottyWot and SpottyWot for this health initiative and we appreciate their recognition of how important it is for young kids to have their final health checks before starting school.”

Mr Ryall, said there was a serious message behind the launch – making sure children are ready for school, and don’t have any issues that could impact on their ability to learn.
