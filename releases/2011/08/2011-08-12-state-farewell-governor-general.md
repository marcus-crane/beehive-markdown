Prime Minister John Key today announced details of the state farewell that will be held for the Governor-General, Rt Hon Sir Anand Satyanand, when he completes his term of office next week.

The state farewell will take place next Wednesday at Parliament starting at 11.40am.

The farewell will begin with the Governor-General, Lady Susan Satyanand, and the Vice-Regal Party arriving on the forecourt of Parliament from Government House.

There will be a powhiri, and the Prime Minister and Parliament’s Speaker will greet them. This will be followed by a Royal Salute, a 21-gun salute fired by the battery at Point Jerningham, and inspection of the Guard of Honour.

The ceremony will then move to the Grand Hall where distinguished guests will be presented to Their Excellencies. This will be followed by a State Farewell Luncheon in the Banquet Hall, which will include speeches.

The luncheon is due to finish at about 2pm. After the luncheon, the Vice-Regal Party will re-enter Parliament House for a farewell from representatives of the Indian community before departing from the forecourt.

The Governor-General designate, Lieutenant General Sir Jerry Mateparae will be sworn in as Governor-General on 31 August.
