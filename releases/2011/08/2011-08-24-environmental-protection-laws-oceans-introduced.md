The Government today introduced legislation to manage the environmental effects of activities in New Zealand’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and Extended Continental Shelf (ECS) and announced interim measures to manage the environmental effects of activities before the new law is passed.

“This legislation puts in place a robust system of environmental controls for the huge ocean and seabed area 20 times that of New Zealand’s landmass that is currently unregulated.  This is about ensuring that New Zealand is environmentally responsible in taking up the significant economic opportunities in our EEZ and ECS,” Environment Minister Nick Smith said.

The Bill makes the new Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) responsible for consenting, monitoring and enforcement of activities that impact on the environment like petroleum exploration, seabed mining, deepwater aquaculture and marine energy development.  It requires public consultation on regulations and consents and enables activities to be classified as permitted, discretionary or prohibited.  The new law is intended to come into effect on 1 July 2012.

“The Government is also putting in place interim measures from today to ensure a smooth transition to the new regime.  Environmental impact assessments will need to be undertaken and submitted to the EPA for oil and gas drilling operations.  Operators will also need to comply with the latest drilling safety rules developed in the United States following the inquiries into the Gulf of Mexico disaster.

“These measures complement last week’s announcements by the Minister of Labour on the establishment of a High Hazards Unit with four inspectors specifically for the petroleum industry.  The Minister of Transport is also reviewing the liability insurance requirements for the industry and is looking to raise it above the current level of NZ$30 million,” Dr Smith said.

“The Bill has been introduced to Parliament today and will have its first reading in September.  It will be subject to a full Select Committee process of public submissions.  The Government’s intention, subject to the results of the General Election, would be to have the Bill passed in the first half of next year.

“This initiative is part of the Government’s bluegreen agenda of growing the economy but also ensuring we have world’s best practise in place to protect the environment.”
