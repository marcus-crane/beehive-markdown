Education Minister Anne Tolley has welcomed the school support staff pay settlement which has been announced today.

“I want to congratulate the bargaining teams from the Ministry of Education and the NZEI for reaching this agreement,” says Mrs Tolley.

“If ratified by members, it represents a significant rise in wages for lower paid support staff under the National-led Government.

“It also gives peace of mind to parents and schools, who can concentrate on lifting achievement for students.”
