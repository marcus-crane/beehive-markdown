Six outstanding young Pacific New Zealanders were recognised today at the Prime Minister’s Pacific Youth Awards, an initiative which highlights the achievements and potential of future leaders.

Prime Minister John Key says the winners embody the community spirit and determination all New Zealanders admire.

“Today’s winners are high achievers in their fields and are inspirational to their peers. They have made enormous contributions to their schools and communities, and have shone academically.

“Up and down the country, our young people are doing great things, and those in the Pacific community are no exception. It’s vital all young New Zealanders are encouraged to realise their potential if they are going to be successful in their chosen fields.”

The award winners are:

- University of Auckland Leadership Award – Nadeen Papali’i, 22, Auckland
- Weta Workshop Creativity Award – Mark Dewes, 24, Auckland
- Air New Zealand Innovation Award – Cameron Hoare, 17, Christchurch
- Cogita Inspiration Award (three winners) – Jessica Papali’i-Curtin, 24, Wellington; Joyce Toleafoa, 19, Auckland; and Brandon Jackson, 22, Auckland

“The winners and their families should be hugely proud of their achievements. They have led by example in their endeavours and they all have bright futures ahead of them,” says Mr Key.

In 2010, three award winners were recognised. Leadership Award winner, J’aime Laurenson, has taken up a position at Deloitte and is looking at options for post-graduate study. Samuelu Siilata, the Creativity Award winner, is over half-way through his one-year internship at Weta Workshop, and Inspiration Award winner, Tammy Kingi, returned from her month-long educational trip to Kiribati and Fiji in May.
