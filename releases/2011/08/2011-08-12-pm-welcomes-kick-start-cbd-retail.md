Prime Minister John Key today welcomed the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal’s commitment to help the city’s CBD retailers kick-start their businesses ahead of summer.

Restart the Heart, an initiative to give temporary, re-locatable accommodation to displaced businesses, will receive a $3.36 million interest-free loan from the Appeal.

“Christchurch businesses want to be trading as the city recovers, and the sooner the better,” says Mr Key. “The heart of the city is vital, and the businesses which have invested in the area are showing great faith in its future by returning and opening their doors.”

Over 65 businesses have already registered their interest in joining the project, which will see container accommodation placed on Cashel Mall by the end of October.

“Businesses in the CBD have been facing huge challenges as they strive to get back on their feet. This project gives business owners more certainty as they look to the future,” says Mr Key.

The Christchurch Earthquake Appeal is the Government’s official, global fundraiser for the recovery effort in Christchurch and the Canterbury region. The Appeal has reached over $97 million in pledged and received funds.
