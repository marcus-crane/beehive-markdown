Minister Responsible for Whanau Ora Tariana Turia today launched the Whanau Ora E-Booklet at the first gathering of Whanau Ora provider collectives in Auckland \[Whanau Ora: Transforming our futures].

"This booklet brings together real stories about how whanau are finding their own answers to their situations. It shows whanau identifying what tools they need, how they can create change and who they want to work with, to invest in their own transformation. That is what Whanau Ora is all about".

" Whanau Ora: Transforming our futures also demonstrates the ability of agencies to work interactively to support whanau and that's what's important here too. The booklet reflects a ‘sea-change’ around service provision in that services, programmes and actions are reviewing their practice, to centre their focus on whanau”.

“I am really inspired by the transformation we can see occurring all around us by whanau taking up the opportunities to determine positive change for themselves”.

NB: The Whanau Ora Hui – Sharing the learning – brings together provider collectives with whanau and with Government agencies, to share the outcomes models and the strategies employed to demonstrate whanau centred practice. It is being held at the Holiday Inn, Auckland Airport; Mon 15-Tues 16 August
