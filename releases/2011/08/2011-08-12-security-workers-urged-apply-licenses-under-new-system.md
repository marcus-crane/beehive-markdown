Associate Minister of Justice Nathan Guy is urging workers in the security industry to apply for a license or certificate of approval by the end of August.

“New legislation means that crowd controllers and personal guards are required to hold a licence or certificate of approval by 1 November 2011. This includes bouncers and door staff working at bars, who will be regulated for the first time,” says Mr Guy.

“The new Private Security Personnel Licensing Authority has received over 12,500 applications. To ensure there is enough time to process the application, anyone wanting to continue working in this industry beyond November needs to apply as soon as possible.

“Licensing will involve a criminal background check on all applicants, and serious convictions for violence, drugs or dishonesty is likely to lead to disqualification.

“This is an important step in cleaning up the industry, improving standards and protecting the safety of the public. Bouncers and door staff often find themselves in volatile situations with the risk of violence, so it’s important we have the right people working in this area.

“I’m pleased that the major security companies providing services at World Cup venues already have certified staff, and are committed to having all their staff certified under the new regime before the tournament begins.”

The Private Security Personnel and Private Investigators Act 2010 (the Act) became law in September 2010.

The cost of a five-year certificate of approval for a crowd controller or personal guard is $200, or $170 online. Applications can be made at [www.pspla.govt.nz](http://www.pspla.govt.nz).
