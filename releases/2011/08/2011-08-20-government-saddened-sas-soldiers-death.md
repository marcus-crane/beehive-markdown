Prime Minister John Key said tonight the Government was saddened by the death of a New Zealand SAS soldier during an incident in Afghanistan’s capital.

“I have limited details about the soldier’s death, but I am advised that he died during fighting that followed an attack by insurgents in Kabul in the last few hours,” says Mr Key.

“On behalf of the Government, I want to offer my condolences to the family of the soldier.

“His death is a reminder of the dangers our Defence Force personnel face while serving in Afghanistan.”

Defence Minister Dr Wayne Mapp also acknowledged the news tonight, and offered his condolences to the family of the soldier. He said he mourned the loss.

“Whenever we deploy our defence personnel on dangerous operations, there is always risk. The SAS undertake some of the most challenging and dangerous assignments in Afghanistan.

“Their contribution is on behalf of all New Zealanders.”
