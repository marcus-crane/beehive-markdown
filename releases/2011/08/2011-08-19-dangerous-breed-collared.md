Minister of Local Government Rodney Hide today announced the addition of the Perro de Presa Canario (commonly referred to as Presa Canario) breed of dog to the list of dogs banned from importation into New Zealand.  The breeds and types of dog banned are listed Schedule 4 of the Dog Control Act 1996.

“The tendency of the Presa Canario to exhibit aggressive behaviour or attack, and the size and strength of the breed, makes it of particular concern because of the seriousness of the injuries it could inflict,” Mr Hide said.

The Presa Canario is a large heavy dog with powerful jaws, which originates from the Canary Islands, where it has been used for organised dog fights.  There have been two known fatal attacks in the United States involving Presa Canario dogs and the breed is prohibited from import into Australia. 

“While there are no known Presa Canario dogs in New Zealand, adding the breed to Schedule 4 is a precautionary public safety measure to protect New Zealanders and prevent this potentially aggressive breed becoming established in the New Zealand dog population.

“This measure does not affect the review of public safety around dogs. The review will look at the underlying principles of public safety around dogs and the effectiveness of the existing regulatory regime.  We will seek a better understanding of how to improve public safety around dogs, while ensuring that responsible dog owners are not disadvantaged,” Mr Hide said.
