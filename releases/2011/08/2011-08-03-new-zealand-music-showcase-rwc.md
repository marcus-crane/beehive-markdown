The best of New Zealand music will be on tour during the Rugby World Cup with 50 bands playing in 22 different cities in the REAL New Zealand Music Showcase.

Rugby World Cup Minister, Murray McCully, has announced a series of live concerts by New Zealand bands which are being co-ordinated by the Government’s NZ2011 Office as part of the REAL New Zealand Festival and Sector Showcase programme.

“The Rugby World Cup offers an unprecedented opportunity to showcase the best of our country to the world. Over the six weeks of the tournament we will be highlighting the best of our film, fashion, food and wine, agribusiness, ICT and many other sectors. The REAL New Zealand Music Showcase provides the platform for contemporary New Zealand music to also be on show.

“85,000 international visitors will be in New Zealand during the tournament. In between watching the rugby will be the chance to enjoy all the talent and depth of New Zealand music. Not only will it add to the festival spirit it will also showcase the best of our musical talent to our overseas visitors,” said Mr McCully.

Acts range from Opshop, Supergroove, The Feelers, Fat Freddy’s Drop, The Black Seeds, The Chills, Phoenix Foundation and I Am Giant, through to blues legend Midge Marsden.

“The depth of New Zealand music being offered is impressive. New Zealand music is worth 30 million in annual export earnings and this is an ideal opportunity to showcase our talent,” said Mr McCully.

“The Government’s NZ 2011 Office has overseen the design of the programme to ensure it fits in with key moments during the tournament. The majority of the concerts are free or very low-priced to ensure widespread participation,” he said.

In total 60 concerts will be held in towns from Kaitaia to Invercargill.

The REAL New Zealand Festival music programme does not yet include the full Queens Wharf programme which will be the centre piece of the showcase. Further announcements on the Queens Wharf programme will be made in the next few weeks.

Funding for the REAL New Zealand Festival music programme has come from the NZ2011 Festival Lottery Grants Fund, the international cultural diplomacy programme, local government festival organisers and private sector promoters.

The live music concerts are supported by the REAL New Zealand Music on Screens project which showcases three hours of New Zealand music video and will be played on big screens at Fanzones throughout the country.
