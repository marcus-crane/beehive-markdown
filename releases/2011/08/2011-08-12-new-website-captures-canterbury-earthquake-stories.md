Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister, Christopher Finlayson, today announced the launch of Quake Stories, a website for people to share their experiences of the Canterbury earthquakes.

“Quake Stories is a living memorial,” Mr Finlayson said. “The website offers a place for all those affected by the earthquakes to tell their stories, and ensures those stories will be available to the historians of the future.”

Quake Stories already features over 50 accounts vividly recalling the 4 September 2010 and 22 February 2011 earthquakes and their aftershocks.

The Ministry for Culture and Heritage created the website in partnership with Christchurch web company NV Interactive.

“All New Zealanders, and many from other countries, were touched in some way by the earthquakes. I urge those with a story to tell, great or small, to add it to the website while it is still fresh in their minds,” Mr Finlayson said.
