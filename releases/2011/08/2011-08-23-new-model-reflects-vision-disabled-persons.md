Minister for Disability Issues, Hon. Tariana Turia, has welcomed the New Model for Supporting Disabled People launched today in Tauranga.

“The overwhelming priority for me as Minister has been to support disabled people and their whanau with greater choice and control over the supports they receive” said Minister Turia.  “I have been determined to act on the aspirations  disabled people have shared with me, to identify and achieve what represents a good life for them.  

“This new model allows disabled people the flexibility they have sought to lead more fulfilling lives.  The co-ordinator will work with family and community resources to make that happen”. 

One of the key drivers under the New Model is the development of Local Area Coordination, which involves a person working with individuals, families and communities to make a practical difference to disabled people's everyday lives. It is based on developing ongoing and in-depth relationships with disabled people and their families.

“Another major feature of the New Model is the move towards allocating direct funding rather than services.  The emphasis is on reinvigorating their own natural networks, their ‘circle of friends’, to enable disabled persons and their families to build a good life for themselves.  I am really proud to know that we have been able to act on their ideas and ambitions with such a promising new approach.
