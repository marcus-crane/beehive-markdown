Prime Minister John Key today announced that Hon Henry Puna, Prime Minister of the Cook Islands, will arrive in New Zealand on Sunday for a three-day visit.

“I look forward to meeting Mr Puna on Monday,” says Mr Key. “The Cook Islands and New Zealand share the closest of ties, with Cook Islanders also holding New Zealand citizenship, and it is a relationship we value highly.

“Ahead of next month’s Pacific Islands Forum, Mr Puna and I will be discussing a range of issues of mutual interest, including economic development and tourism links to the Cook Islands.”

Mr Puna’s first official meeting with Mr Key in February was postponed due the Canterbury earthquake.

“Cook Islanders, like so many of our Pacific neighbours, have been extremely generous in fundraising for the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal, and I will be expressing my thanks to Mr Puna for this help,” says Mr Key.

Mr Puna will also meet Ministers Gerry Brownlee, David Carter, Murray McCully, Hekia Parata and Craig Foss.

He departs New Zealand on Tuesday.
