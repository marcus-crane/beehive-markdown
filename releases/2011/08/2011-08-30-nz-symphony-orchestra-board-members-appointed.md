Not-for-profit sector fundraiser Lisa Bates has been appointed to the board of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, and current members Colleen Marshal and Roger Taylor have been re-appointed, Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson announced today.

“Lisa Bates’ proven skills, which she showed in her contribution to the raising of $21 million for the Q Theatre development and her current project in the Endowment Fund for Arts Development, will add value to the Symphony Orchestra board,” Mr Finlayson said.

Her earlier career as a television producer included five years of producing medical dramas, firstly in Australia with All Saints, and later in New Zealand, with Shortland Street.

Mr Finlayson also thanked retiring board member Bill Falconer for his service to the Symphony Orchestra.
