The passing of a Bill in Parliament last night allows the next census to be held in March 2013, Statistics Minister Maurice Williamson says.

The Duties of Statutory Officers (Census and Other Remedial Provisions) Bill amends the Statistics Act 1975 and the Statutes, Drafting and Compilation Act 1920.

The census is the official count of how many people and dwellings there are in New Zealand and gives a unique snapshot of our communities.

“Businesses, community groups and local government need this critical information,” Mr Williamson says.

“It also means the Maori Electoral Option and the review of electoral boundaries can still go ahead before the 2014 election.”

The 8 March 2011 Census had to be deferred following the Christchurch earthquake on 22 February.
