Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce says an improvement in course and qualification completion rates in the tertiary education sector show that the increased focus on performance is paying off.

The Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) today released 2010 educational performance information for tertiary education organisations that highlights a marked improvement in student achievement, particularly at institutes of technology and polytechnics (ITPs) and industry training organisations (ITOs).

“In 2010, six out of 20 ITPs had course completion rates of 78 percent or higher, which is a significant improvement upon 2009 when only one ITP achieved a course completion rate at that level,” says Mr Joyce.

“Meanwhile credit achievement reported by ITOs increased to 64 percent in 2010 compared to 50 percent in 2009, and programme completions increased to 55 percent in 2010 up from 41 percent in 2009.”

This lift in educational performance shows that the sector is taking on board the Government’s expectation to focus on educational outcomes and show better value for tax payer investment in tertiary education.

The sector has further incentive to continue to improve educational outcomes - educational performance information will be used in 2012 to link some funding to performance outcomes instead of just enrolments. 

Mr Joyce says he expects to see further improvements as the sector continues to focus on ensuring that learners are given every opportunity to succeed. 

“While these results are encouraging, there is still more progress to be made, particularly in making sure that learners are supported to achieve a qualification that can set them up for a career,” says Mr Joyce.
