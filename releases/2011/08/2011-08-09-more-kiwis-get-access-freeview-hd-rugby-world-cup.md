Free-to-air high definition digital television, also known as Freeview|HD, is now available to an additional 160,000 homes in time for the Rugby World Cup, Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman announced today.

The existing digital terrestrial television (DTT) service has now been extended to homes in Whangarei, Rotorua, Gisborne, Taupo, Whanganui, New Plymouth, Wairarapa, Nelson, Timaru and Invercargill.

‘’Extending DTT will provide better picture quality for fans watching the biggest sporting event New Zealand’s ever hosted,’’ Dr Coleman says.

‘’With a month before kick-off, it’s a great time for people to switch to digital television. It offers better pictures, better quality sound, more channels, and features such as on-screen TV guides.’’

The extension means more than 86 percent of the population can now choose between the Freeview HD service, received with a UHF aerial, and the Freeview Satellite service, which requires a satellite dish. 

Dr Coleman says the $5.5 million DTT extension is part of the Government’s move to modernise New Zealand’s television broadcasting network by replacing the old analogue system with universal digital broadcasting.  

Recent research shows that 79 percent of New Zealanders have already converted to digital television. Digital switchover will be phased starting with Hawke’s Bay and the West Coast in September 2012. The rest of the country will go digital in three stages between April and December 2013.
