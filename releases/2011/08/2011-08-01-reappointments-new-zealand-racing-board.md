Racing Minister Craig Foss today announced the reappointment of Warren Bell, Dr Alan Jackson and Thayne Green to the New Zealand Racing Board’s (NZRB) governing body.

“It is vital that the NZRB displays leadership to work to improve the industry’s economic performance and deliver on its potential. These three bring necessary business and industry experience to the boardroom,” said Mr Foss.

“The Board, together with the three codes, have made good progress to address the long term challenges facing the industry, and I have reappointed the three incumbents to ensure continuity through these changes.

“I have also recently set out my expectations for the Board, focussing on the objectives set out in the Racing Act 2003. I expect the Board, with discussion and input from the racing code bodies, to make the necessary decisions to achieve these objectives, particularly on the promotion of the long-term viability of New Zealand racing.

“While its recent decisions are encouraging, the industry must strive to bring racing in New Zealand back onto a path to growth and mainstream consumer appeal. The Board must be at the forefront of this,” said Mr Foss.

Warren Bell was recommended for appointment as an independent board member by the statutory panel following consultation with the industry, and was subsequently appointed. Thayne Green was reappointed as a board member following his nomination by the greyhound racing code. Alan Jackson was reappointed as a board member following his nomination by the thoroughbred racing code.
