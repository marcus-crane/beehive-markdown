Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce welcomed the release of a discussion document prepared by the Ministry of Economic Development on the allocation of the ‘digital dividend’ radio spectrum.

The digital dividend is the radio spectrum that will be freed up when New Zealand switches over to digital television. The digital switchover is scheduled

to be completed by late 2013.

The freed up spectrum is in the 700 MHz range and is ideal for next generation mobile broadband services.

“The allocation of the 700 MHz band offers a great opportunity for New Zealand to enter the next generation of mobile telecommunications and connectivity” Mr Joyce said.

“We want to make sure we get the allocation process right so that we can unlock the highest possible economic and productivity benefits for New Zealand.”

Mr Joyce encourages industry and other interested parties to provide input to the Ministry’s consultation process.

The discussion document is available on the Ministry of Economic Development website, [http://www.rsm.govt.nz](http://www.rsm.govt.nz/).

Submissions close on 7 October 2011, and will be followed be a four-week period for cross-submissions.
