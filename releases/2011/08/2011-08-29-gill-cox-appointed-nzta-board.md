Transport Minister Steven Joyce today announced the appointment of Gill Cox to the Board of the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA).

The appointment is for the period 1 September 2011 to 31 October 2013. Mr Cox replaces Mr Garry Moore, who retired as an NZTA Board member at the end of his term on 30 June 2011.

“Gill Cox has excellent networks in the Christchurch and Canterbury region, which will be of use to the Board as the NZTA continues its significant contribution to the rebuilding of infrastructure in Christchurch. Additionally, his finance and accounting expertise, along with his significant governance experience, will further strengthen this skill set on the Board,” says Mr Joyce.

Mr Cox is based in Christchurch and has strong commercial and community connections. He was a Partner at Deloitte from 1971 to 1996 and Chairman of the National Board of Partners from 1993 to 1996. From 1996 to 2009 he was Executive Director of Advanced Business Education Ltd, the graduate admission programme for the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, in addition to holding a number of board appointments. Since 2010 Mr Cox has continued full time as a company director and consultant to both the commercial and not-for-profit sectors.

He currently holds a number of Chair positions, including Mainpower New Zealand Ltd, Transwaste Canterbury Ltd, Elastomer Products Ltd and Talbot Technologies Ltd. He chairs the Advisory Body of Development West Coast and was recently appointed to the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority’s community forum.
