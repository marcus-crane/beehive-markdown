Arts Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson has welcomed the New Zealand Film Archive’s discovery of lost reels of what is believed to be the earliest surviving Alfred Hitchcock film, 1923’s The White Shadow.

“This discovery shows the value of the Film Archive not only to New Zealand's film heritage, but internationally,” Mr Finlayson said. “It shows what a cultural asset the Film Archive is.”

Reels one through three (from six six) of Hitchcock’s The White Shadow were found earlier this year. The reels, which are highly volatile nitrate material, will be preserved at Park Road Post Production in Wellington.

“The Government gave $2 million extra funding in Budget 2010 to the Film Archive for a crucial film preservation project, Saving Frames, between the Film Archive and Park Road Post,” Mr Finlayson said. “Although the discovery and preservation of this Hitchcock classic is not part of Saving Frames, which is devoted to New Zealand film history, it demonstrates the world class resources of the Film Archive and capabilities of Park Road Post.”
