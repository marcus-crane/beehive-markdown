For the third year in a row, registration for the government's Voluntary Bonding Scheme has exceeded expectations.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says, "429 medical, nurse and midwife graduates from 2010 had registered their interest in joining the scheme by the close off date at the end of April.

"The graduates are made up of 41 doctors, 39 midwives, and 349 nurses.

The scheme rewards graduate doctors, nurses and midwives who commit to working in hard-to-staff communities and specialties for three to five years with payments against their student loans. Those without student loans will receive cash payments.

Tony Ryall says the scheme's continuing popularity demonstrates how well it is meeting its goal of encouraging New Zealand trained health professionals to establish their careers at home.

"In total, there are 1424 nurses, 220 doctors, and 179 midwives who have signed up in the first three years.

"We want more of our doctors, nurses and midwives to stay in New Zealand after graduation and the voluntary bonding scheme is doing that."
