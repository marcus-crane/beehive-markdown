More than 10,000 winter heat installations have been completed in greater Christchurch, Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee announced today.

Mr Brownlee said the Earthquake Commission’s (EQC) project manager Fletcher EQR has now installed 7172 heat pumps and repaired or installed nearly 2835 solid fuel burners.

“Fletcher EQR has worked hard to ensure the people in most need have been attended to.

“Fletchers made more than 100,000 phone calls in an effort to track down all those in need of winter heating. This included liaising with voluntary agencies and government departments responsible for some of the community's most vulnerable people."

“If anyone has been missed, Fletcher EQR needs to be made aware so that the situation can be resolved."

“Last week a call for anyone who had been missed resulted in the family of an elderly woman coming forward and a heat pump installed for her within 24 hours of notification,” said Mr Brownlee.

The winter heating programme was established to ensure households with an EQC claim, who had lost their primary heating source, can stay warm, particularly through winter.

Priority was given to those homes with occupants who are sick, elderly or who have young children, or houses with no other heating source.

“There were reports the programme had stopped. I would like to reiterate that this is not and never was the case. The programme has been ongoing,” said Mr Brownlee.

“The remaining heat source installations arising from the Chimney Replacement Programme are commencing as re-assessments are carried out by EQC and eligibility is determined,” said Mr Brownlee.
