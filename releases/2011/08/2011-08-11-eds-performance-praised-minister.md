Health Minister Tony Ryall has opened the New Zealand Emergency Department Conference in Taupo today, and told guests that the latest health target result for Shorter Stays in Emergency Departments (EDs) reflects well on all involved.

Mr Ryall said, "Two years ago, we introduced the target of 95 per cent of ED patients being admitted, treated or discharged within six hours. Several of the larger DHBs were struggling to deal with even 70 per cent of their patients in that time.

"Counties-Manukau has always been a stand out performer and sees 97 per cent of ED patients within six hours.

"Initiatives at Auckland mean it is now considered a "go to" DHB on how to make improvements, having lifted its performance from 70 per cent to 95 per cent. At the same time there has been a 21 per cent increase in patient numbers.

"Waitemata DHB started on 61 per cent in mid 2009 but they are now close to achieving the 95 percent target. 

"And despite earthquakes causing the loss of over 100 hospital beds and impacting on primary care and aged residential facilities, the Canterbury DHB became just the second ‘large’ DHB to achieve the 95% target last quarter. 

"The challenge is to continue to find innovative and improved ways to deliver services within current budget and ensure that quality standards were maintained.

"Emergency Department teams are contributing to improving New Zealand's health service to a patient-focussed world class service."
