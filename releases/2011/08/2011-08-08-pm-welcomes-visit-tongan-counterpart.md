Lord Siale 'Ataonogo Tu'ivakano will arrive in New Zealand tomorrow on his first visit as Prime Minister of Tonga, Prime Minister John Key announced today.

“Tonga and New Zealand have a strong and lengthy relationship, forged over decades of working together,” says Mr Key.

“I am pleased to be able to welcome Lord Tu'ivakano here, particularly so I can thank him personally for the generosity both the Government and the people of Tonga showed towards Canterbury in the wake of the earthquakes that devastated the region.

“I also look forward to hosting Lord Tu’ivakano in Auckland next month for the Pacific Islands Forum.”

Lord Tu’ivakano will have a bilateral meeting with Mr Key on Wednesday, in addition to bilateral meetings with the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Defence.

Lord Tu’ivakano will depart New Zealand on Saturday.
