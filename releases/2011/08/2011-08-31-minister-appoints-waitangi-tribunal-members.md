The Minister of Māori Affairs, Dr Pita Sharples, today announced the appointment of Ronald Crosby and Kaa Williams to the Waitangi Tribunal, each for a term of three years.

Ronald Crosby and Kaa Williams are new appointees to the Waitangi Tribunal, and they will join Dr Richard Hill, Dr Monty Soutar, Kihi Ngatai, Timothy Castle, Basil Morrison, Tania Simpson, Dr Aroha Harris and Professor William (Pou) Temara, who have just been reappointed.

“It is encouraging to have such high-calibre candidates being appointed and reappointed to the Tribunal,” said Dr Sharples.

“All ten appointees possess a wealth of the experience and skills that make the Tribunal so effective” he said. “The current members have made huge contributions to the Tribunal to date, and I know that Ronald Crosby and Kaa Williams will add their own experience and insight to strengthen the Tribunal.

Ronald Crosby has an extensive background in practising law, specialising in Māori interests in resource management, including Waitangi Tribunal claims. Since 2008 he has concentrated on writing, primarily on New Zealand, Maori and military history and biography.

Kaa Williams, of Ngai Tuhoe, Ngati Manawa, Ngāti Kahungunu and Ngāti Maniapoto descent, has three decades of experience in te reo Māori teaching, assessment, teacher training, policy advice and advocacy; she is an award-winning televison presenter, and in 2009 she received the Queen’s Service Order for services to Māori.

Along with the other eight reappointees to the Waitangi Tribunal, Ronald Crosby and Kaa Williams will serve for a term of three years.

“I am pleased to offer my warm congratulations to each of the members on their appointment or reappointment to the Tribunal”, said Dr Sharples.
