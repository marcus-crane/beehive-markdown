Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson today announced eight new appointments to the New Zealand Conservation Authority, the body which oversees the policies that govern how public conservation land is managed.

The Authority will also have a new chairperson, with Dr Kay Booth taking over the role from Don Ross.

Ms Wilkinson says Dr Booth brought a wealth of experience to the role.

“Kay has been a member of the Conservation Authority for six years and I am delighted that she has agreed to take on this important leadership role.”

The new appointees are John Thorburn of Christchurch, Dr Warren Parker of Rotorua, Jo Breese of Wellington, Judy Hellstrom of Picton, Dr Gerry McSweeney of Arthur’s Pass, Professor Mick Clout of Manurewa, Sandra Cook of Otautau and Ian Buchanan of Greytown.

Yvonne Sharp, Waana Davis, Hally Toia, and Brian Stephenson have been reappointed for a further term on the Authority, alongside Dr Booth.

“The Authority has a pivotal role in planning for the management of the public conservation land and resources over the medium to long term.

“It is fantastic to have such a broad range of highly experienced people on board for that purpose."

Ms Wilkinson says she wished to thank chair Don Ross and the other outgoing members of the Authority – John Nankervis, Linda Conning, Mike Browne, Louise Savage, Basil Morrison and Charles Crofts - for their contributions.
