The Government is offering to do all it can to ensure the rezoning of land for residential development in Kaiapoi happens as quickly as possible, Environment Minister Nick Smith says.

Dr Smith today visited Kaiapoi with MP Kate Wilkinson and met with officers from the Waimakariri District Council and Environment Canterbury to discuss the issue of rezoning land for residential development.

“The Government is very conscious of the loss of residential areas deemed irreparable and wants Kaiapoi to have a strong future. We want to work with the Waimakariri District Council to identify new areas that are not at risk of liquefaction and to progress them promptly through the streamlined resource management process available under the special Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act,” Dr Smith said.

“My visit to Kaiapoi was to hear first hand from council officials what their issues and challenges are. It was also to let them know that while it is up to them to take the lead on the planning and zoning of new residential subdivisions, the Government is here to assist them and streamline the planning process.

“The ambition is to identify and zone areas at least equivalent in size to those lost in the earthquakes. We want to ensure there are no hold ups to the rebuilding of Kaiapoi and allow its quake-displaced residents to build new homes on safe land as quickly as possible.”
