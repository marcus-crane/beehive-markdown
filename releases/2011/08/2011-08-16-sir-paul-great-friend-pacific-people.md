*Kua tau e au te taua lelei, kua taunuku kite hini, kua fakatalitali mai la mo oku te pale o te amiotonu.*

Many Pacific peoples will share the nation’s grief at the death of Sir Paul Reeves, acting Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Hon Tariana Turia said today.

“Sir Paul was, of course, Governor-General of Niue, the Cook Islands and Tokelau because of those countries’ special constitutional relationships with New Zealand.  But not only was he Governor-General he was also a Polynesian, and a man of God. The mana which that gave him in the Pacific was huge.”

Mrs Turia said Sir Paul’s special relationship with Pacific peoples continued beyond his term as Governor-General.

“In recent years he helped write Fiji’s constitution. He also devoted time and energy to providing opportunities for South Auckland’s young people – his heart was always with the young.”

Mrs Turia said Sir Paul brought to all his roles a combination of wisdom, humility and service which made him unique.

“I am sure Minister te Heuheu would also want to note Sir Paul’s passing and the special place he held in the hearts of Pacific people.

“New Zealand’s Pacific peoples and those in the wider region will mourn his passing. Our thoughts and prayers go to Lady Beverley, their daughters and the Whanau,” Mrs Turia said.

Translation: I have fought the good fight, I have won the race, and behold the crown of righteousness is waiting for me.
