New igloo-type ammunition storage bunkers, upgraded security systems and a modern explosive processing facility are planned for the Defence Force’s Kauri Point facility, Defence Minister Wayne Mapp announced today.

“Kauri Point will get the overhaul it needs to make it a modern facility that best meets the expectations of the community and the requirements of the contemporary defence force,” said Dr Mapp.

“The need to redevelop Kauri Point was identified some years ago. Since we became Government we have initiated a range of measures to ensure the integrity of our ammunition storage.

“We have stopped using some of the storage facilities and we have ensured that all sites and facilities are properly certified,” said Dr Mapp.

A formal arrangement has been put in place with the Australian Defence Force for their experts to undertake regular explosives safety compliance audits.

“I visited Kauri Point in May along with fellow North Shore MP Dr Jonathan Coleman, and the Chair and Deputy Chair of the local community board. We looked at what had been done and discussed the best way forward for the future.

“After that visit I asked the Defence Force to draw up a comprehensive plan for the long term development of the site.

“That plan is now nearing completion and will be implemented over the next two years,” said Dr Mapp.

The Kauri Point development plan, which has been costed at $7 million, also includes provision to address any contamination issues found by an NZDF study currently underway in cooperation with the Auckland City Council.

The Defence Force has recently improved security with upgrades to fencing, electronic systems and buildings. Patrols have been changed and the frequency of inspection increased.

“The development plan will result in a 21st century site that will allow much of the existing infrastructure to be retired,” Dr Mapp said.

“In the meantime we have put a range of measures in place to ensure that security is maintained.

“The safety of the public, along with Defence personnel who work on site, is our highest priority,” said Dr Mapp
