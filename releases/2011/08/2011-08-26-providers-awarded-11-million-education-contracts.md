Education Minister Anne Tolley says twenty-one providers around New Zealand have been awarded contracts worth over $1.1 million to provide Learning Experiences Outside the Classroom (LEOTC) following the latest contestable tender round.

“452,000 students are taking part in LEOTC visits this year, with the support of the Government’s annual investment of around $5 million,” says Mrs Tolley.

“The programmes allow teachers to take students out of the traditional classroom and to link their curriculum learning with real-life experiences.

“The successful providers cover a wide range of settings and learning experiences, from museums and art galleries to performing arts, media production and environmental education.

“But they all have one thing in common. They deliver hands-on educational experiences that enhance and enrich student learning, and provide effective support for the national curriculum and Government education priorities.

“The Ministry will continually monitor all of the programmes to make sure they are effective and that they are delivering the best possible learning for students.”
