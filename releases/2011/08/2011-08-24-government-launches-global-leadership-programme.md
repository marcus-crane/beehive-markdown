A programme designed to help New Zealand business leaders broaden their international experience and global management skills has been launched today by Economic Development Minister David Carter.

“The Global Executive Leadership Programme is the first of its kind in New Zealand and targets the global management mindset needed by our leading businesspeople to succeed in international markets,” says Mr Carter.

The 12-month programme, initiated by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, is being delivered by a partnership of the University of Auckland Business School, business growth centre the ICEHOUSE and United States-based Thunderbird School of Global Management, an internationally recognised provider of global management education.

The first participants, 23 chief executives and senior managers, begin the programme this week.

"With New Zealand’s geographic isolation, it is crucial that our senior businesspeople have as much access as possible to understanding global trends and impacts," says Mr Carter.

“No other developed nation is as reliant on exports and international connections to succeed as New Zealand is.  It is important we have the right people with the right management skills to help us compete on the world stage.”

The Global Executive Leadership Programme complements the $1 million Prime Minister’s Business Scholarships scheme that helps businesspeople study at internationally recognised business schools.
