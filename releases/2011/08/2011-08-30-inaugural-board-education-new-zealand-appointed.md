Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce has today confirmed four further appointments to the establishment Board of Education New Zealand – the new Crown Agency established to support and grow New Zealand’s export education sector.

Jenny Alford, Neil Barns, Jill Tattersall and Elizabeth Valintine join Chair Charles Finny on the Board.  The Agency commences operations on Thursday.

Mr Joyce says the new Board members bring an excellent mix of experience in the tertiary and export education sectors as well as commercial acumen and international marketing experience.

“I will also be appointing the Secretary of Education and the Chief Executive responsible for Immigration as special advisors to the Board of Education New Zealand. This will ensure a sound, two-way flow of information between Education NZ and other key agencies involved in the sector.

Education New Zealand will have an annual budget of approximately $21 million, including the extra $10 million announced by the government as part of this year’s budget.  The Agency will combine the government-funded promotional, representational and other functions and activities that are currently spread across the Ministry of Education, Education New Zealand Trust and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise. 

“International education is a vital part of our economy and we want to see that grow even further. The new agency is a key part of achieving this,” says Mr Joyce.

“International education is New Zealand’s fifth largest export earner, contributing more than $2 billion to the economy and supporting about 32,000 jobs. 

“Historically, the national level international education function has been fragmented between agencies.  The new single agency, solely focused on international education, will provide a sharper focus, better coordination and better value for money in terms of both marketing and representation abroad.”

  

**Jenny Alford** recently retired from her role as General Manager for contract education at Auckland UniServices Ltd.  She has had extensive business experience in international education, and research and development, at both the University of Auckland and the University of Waikato. Ms Alford also had responsibility for the University of Auckland's English Language Academy as a high quality ESOL provider.

**Dr Neil Barns** has extensive experience in the tertiary education sector having previously served as the Chief Executive of Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology (CPIT) and the Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology (NMIT). Dr Barns is a trustee of the current industry body, Education New Zealand Trust, and also serves on the councils of the Bay of Plenty Polytechnic and the Waiariki Institute of Technology.

**Jill Tattersall** was Chief Executive of Les Mills International Ltd from 2001 to 2010, during which time the company was twice recognised as NZTE Services Exporter of the Year.  A Business Advisor to the recently launched Global Executive Leadership program developed by the University of Auckland Business School, the ICEHOUSE and NZTE, Ms Tattersall was named one of the country's outstanding business managers by the National Business Review in 2004.

**Elizabeth Valintine** was the founder of Media Design School, and has been involved in the tertiary sector for over 20 years. Ms Valintine sold Media Design School in February 2011 to Laureate Universities, an American education group. She is currently a board member of Abilities Incorporated, a not-for-profit disability employer in Auckland.
