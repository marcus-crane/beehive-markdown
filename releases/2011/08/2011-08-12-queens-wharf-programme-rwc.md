More than 40 New Zealand bands and musicians, themed family weekends and events to showcase the best of New Zealand innovation will feature in the activities programme on Queens Wharf in Auckland during Rugby World Cup 2011.

Rugby World Cup 2011 Minister Murray McCully and Auckland Mayor Len Brown announced the core programme today.

“This is the biggest line-up of New Zealand music ever seen in one place and is a major part of the entertainment package on Queens Wharf. It allows people to enjoy the rugby live on big screens, live music, as well as viewing our New Zealand business innovation showcase in The Cloud.

“I am pleased Queen Wharf will offer a comprehensive entertainment package but its role is to also showcase our country to the world. The venue and its different spaces will be used to highlight the best of our film, fashion, food and wine, agribusiness, ICT and many other sectors,” said Mr McCully.

Queens Wharf has four main showcase and performance spaces – The Cloud, Shed 10, The Main Stage (outdoor stage) and the Forecourt.

Every Friday night during pool play there will be a concert on The Main Stage. Acts confirmed include Che Fu, and Anika Moa. During the Quarter-finals weekend, the line-up features King Kapisi, Cornerstone Roots, Thomas Oliver Band and I Am Giant. For the semi-finals weekend bands include Ardijah, The Jordan Luck Band, Flip Grater, Julia Deans, Zed, The Feelers, Dragon and Opshop.

“We’re keeping the full line-up for the finals weekend concerts under wraps at the moment, but I can promise they will be concerts to remember. Already confirmed are 1814, Katchafire and The Black Seeds, but we have five additional headline acts to announce including one act who will be heading back from overseas especially for this concert,” said Mr McCully.

But the music line-up doesn’t stop there. “Late Nights at The Cloud” on Friday and Saturday nights during pool play will feature some of New Zealand’s top DJs including P Money, Nick D and Karn Hall. “Live at The Cloud” from Monday 3 October features a series of weekday concerts with acts including Goldenhorse, Annie Crummer with Will Crummer and The Rarotongans, The Adults, Greg Johnson and Band, Don McGlashan and The Seven Sisters, Bella Kalolo and Band and top New Zealand comedians. DJs and live bands will also play in Shed 10.

As an official RWC 2011 Fanzone, Queens Wharf will have five giant screens, and more than 40 additional LCD screens, playing every match live with replays during the day in Shed 10.

Queens Wharf will also feature:

- New Zealand business innovation showcased in The Cloud throughout the Tournament with exhibitions by industry sectors including marine, agribusiness and fashion
- Taste at The Cloud showcasing the best of New Zealand food and wine with special events including Le Cordon Bleu New Zealand culinary match with the French team
- The Giant Rugby Ball open daily from 12.00pm (except Mondays)
- New Zealand On Screen interactive exhibition open daily
- Themed family weekends during the first four weeks and family programmes during the school holidays
- The REAL New Zealand Rural Sports 2011 featuring Sheep Shearing Nationals and Trans-Tasman Woodchopping Finals hosted by the Topp Twins and country music star Tami Nielson during the week between Semi-finals and Finals
- The School Robotics World Cup in The Cloud

Earlier this week Mr McCully announced that The Cloud will host part of the Pacific Leaders Forum in the days prior to the Rugby World Cup and last week, Auckland Mayor Len Brown announced the major opening night event for Friday 9 September.

“We have always said that Rugby World Cup is about more than just the rugby and the programme announced today confirms that will definitely be the case at Queens Wharf. There is something for everybody and I look forward joining Aucklanders and visitors from around New Zealand and throughout the world to party on Queens Wharf,” said Len Brown.

The Government’s NZ 2011 office and Auckland Tourism, Events and Economic Development Ltd (ATEED) are working together to deliver the six-week event on Queens Wharf from 9 September to 23 October and the two agencies have appointed Auckland Festival Trust to manage and deliver Queens Wharf.
