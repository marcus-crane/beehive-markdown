New Zealand Minister for Customs Maurice Williamson and Australian Minister for Home Affairs Brendan O’Connor today welcomed the launch of the SmartGate trans-Tasman trial.

The trial will involve the integration of New Zealand’s and Australia’s SmartGate systems and will give some travellers the opportunity to complete part of the Australian arrivals process in New Zealand.

The trial will be last till July 2012 and be available to Australian and New Zealand ePassport holders, aged 18 years and over, who are travelling from Auckland International Airport to the Gold Coast Airport.

For the first time eligible travellers will be able to bypass the SmartGate kiosk at the Gold Coast and go straight to the gate if they used SmartGate when departing from Auckland International Airport.

Mr Williamson said that the SmartGate trans-Tasman trial is another example of the great working relationship between the New Zealand Customs Service and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service.

“The New Zealand and Australian governments share the view that travelling across the ditch should be as much like a domestic experience as possible,” Mr Williamson said.

“I encourage all eligible travellers to take advantage of the new SmartGate integrated solution when flying between New Zealand and the Gold Coast.”

Mr O’Connor said the SmartGate trans-Tasman trial is a great new way to streamline passenger processing.

“The SmartGate trans-Tasman trial aims to make it easier and more efficient for travellers to self-process at passport control,” Mr O’Connor said.

“SmartGate will also help to reduce queuing by creating a more seamless border processing experience. Given the success of SmartGate, both Australia and New Zealand have planned expansions of the program at several of their international airports.”
