District Court Judge Paul Barber has been appointed chairperson of the Real Estate Agents Disciplinary Tribunal, Associate Justice Minister Nathan Guy has announced today.

The Disciplinary Tribunal was established under the Real Estate Agents Act 2008, and deals with the licensing and discipline of real estate agents.

Judge Paul Barber was appointed a District Court Judge in 1981. He retired from the Bench in 1997 but has continued to hold an acting warrant. From 1981 to 1997 Judge Barber worked principally as Taxation Review Authority and also held the position of Pharmacy Authority from 1985.

Since 1997 he has held both Taxation Review Authority and Customs Appeal Authority positions, and has also been hearing Accident Compensation Appeals since 2001.

“Judge Barber’s extensive legal experience will be a great asset to the work of the Tribunal,” says Mr Guy.

Judge Barber replaces former Judge Michael Hobbs who has served two years as Chairperson.
