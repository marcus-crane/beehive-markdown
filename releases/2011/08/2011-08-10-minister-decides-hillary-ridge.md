The South Ridge of Aoraki / Mount Cook will soon be named Hillary Ridge, Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson said today.

The Minister’s decision confirms a recommendation by the New Zealand Geographic Board Ngā Pou Taunaha o Aotearoa to alter the name South Ridge to Hillary Ridge.

“Sir Edmund made an enormous contribution to our country and abroad and it is befitting and appropriate that his contribution is acknowledged in this way,” Mr Williamson said.

“Sir Edmund was a much admired and respected climber and mountaineer, not only in New Zealand but in many other parts of the world.”

“Altering the name South Ridge to Hillary Ridge will further cement Sir Edmund’s place in New Zealand’s history.”

Sir Edmund’s personal association with this geographic feature began as one of the party of four to make the first successful ascent of the South Ridge in February 1948.  The three other climbers were guides Harry Ayres and Mick Sullivan who both led the climb, and Ruth Adams.

“My decision was made with the greatest respect to these three other accomplished climbers and their families,” Mr Williamson said.

The Hillary Ridge name will become official on 18 August 2011 when gazetted by the Board.
