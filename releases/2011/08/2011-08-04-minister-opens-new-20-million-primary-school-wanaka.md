Education Minister Anne Tolley today officially opened the new Wanaka Primary School, following Government investment of $20 million.

The school has opened on a new 7.6 hectare site, with brand new state-of-the-art facilities, after relocating due to roll growth.

“This new school is a fantastic boost for students, staff and the local community,” says Mrs Tolley.

“It shows this Government’s commitment to investing in modern and effective teaching environments.

“In the coming year our total capital expenditure on school property will rise to $741 million – that’s over $200 million a year more than the previous Government.

“Among the new features at Wanaka Primary School is an ICT capability which incorporates fibre optic cable links between its buildings and the nearby Mount Aspiring College, to allow the schools to share resources.

“I want to acknowledge the hard work of the Board, principal and staff, who have ensured that students now have a wonderful new school with all the opportunities that brings. I also want to thank parents and the local community for playing their part by providing valuable feedback during consultation.”
