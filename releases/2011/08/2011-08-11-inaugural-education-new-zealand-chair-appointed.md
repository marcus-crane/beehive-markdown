Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce has appointed former diplomat Charles Finny as the inaugural Chair of Education New Zealand – the new Crown agency established to support and encourage international education.

Education New Zealand will begin operating on 1 September.

Mr Joyce says he is pleased to have someone of Charles Finny’s experience and standing to get this vital new agency up and running.

“International education is New Zealand’s fifth largest export earner, contributing more than $2 billion to the economy and supporting about 32,000 jobs.  It is an industry with huge potential for future growth.

“Historically, the national level international education function has been fragmented between three agencies – the Ministry of Education, Education New Zealand and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise – it’s important that we remedy this and ensure our efforts are well-coordinated and efficient.

“Mr Finny’s international experience and network leave him well-placed to encourage further growth, particularly as we work to minimise the impact of the Canterbury earthquakes on the sector.”

Charles Finny was Chief Executive of the Wellington Regional Chamber of Commerce between 2005 and 2010.  Prior to that he worked as a diplomat and trade official, this included postings in China, Taiwan and Singapore.  He is a fluent Mandarin speaker.

Mr Finny is currently a member of the Board of New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, the New Zealand Film Commission and Kawarau Estate Limited. He is also a member of the Victoria University of Wellington Council and a former Chair of the Local Government Forum. 

He is currently employed by Saunders Unsworth, a Wellington government relation and public policy firm.
