Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman today announced the appointment of Ross McRobie to the board of New Zealand On Air.

Mr McRobie was formerly General Manager of the Radio Network in Christchurch for over a decade.

‘’Ross’s extensive knowledge of radio, business management and his wider business interests will add a useful perspective to the board,’’ says Dr Coleman.

Based in Wanaka, Mr McRobie is the owner and director of United Travel and a member of The Red Bus Company board. He has been appointed to the NZ On Air board for three years.

Dr Coleman thanked outgoing board member Murray Shaw for his work.
