Prime Minister John Key today announced that Kerry Prendergast has been appointed Chair of the New Zealand Tourism Board for a three year term.

The New Zealand Tourism Board, trading as Tourism New Zealand (TNZ), markets New Zealand as a tourism destination.

The current Chair, Greg Muir, is not seeking re-appointment following the completion of his three-year term in July.

Kerry Prendergast is the former Mayor of Wellington and former Vice-President of Local Government New Zealand.

Mr Key says Ms Prendergast has the skills needed to lead the board in the effective promotion of tourism in New Zealand.

“Kerry is dynamic and focused, with a passion for New Zealand that is the number one requirement in this position. She also has board experience and is a great communicator.”

Ms Prendergast is currently Chair of the Environmental Protection Authority, the New Zealand International Arts Festival Trust, and also the Wellington Jazz Music Festival Trust.

She also holds an MBA specialising in Marketing and Strategy and has extensive experience in promoting Wellington as a tourist destination.

Mr Key says he is confident Ms Prendergast will be a great asset to the tourism sector and looks forward to working with her in his role as Tourism Minister.
