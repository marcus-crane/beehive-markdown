Prime Minister John Key and Transport Minister Steven Joyce have this morning officially open the new Hobsonville motorway in Auckland – six months ahead of schedule.

The Hobsonville Motorway is part of the Western Ring Route – a 48 kilometre alternative to State Highway 1 running between Manukau and Albany via State Highways 20, 16 and 18.  The government has designated the route as a Road of National Significance in recognition of its importance to growth in Auckland and in the wider economy.

Mr Joyce says the $220 million project will significantly reduce congestion in North-west Auckland and improve journey times from the West to the North Shore.

“The new motorway will also greatly improve safety in the area by taking through traffic off the local roading network.  The NZ Transport Agency expects traffic on Hobsonville Road to reduce from 40,000 vehicles per day currently to just 6,500 vehicles per day.”

Mr Joyce says he is very pleased that the benefits of the project will be felt six months ahead of schedule and in time for the Rugby World Cup.

The Hobsonville Motorway is one of three major Auckland motorway projects opening ahead of schedule.  In July of last year, the Manukau Harbour Crossing opened seven months ahead of schedule and the Victoria Park Tunnel will open to two lanes of traffic in November – three months earlier than anticipated.

Mr Joyce says the government's billion dollar boost to state highway funding has provided a secure funding pipeline which has given contractors the confidence to continue investing in people and machinery and complete projects more quickly.
