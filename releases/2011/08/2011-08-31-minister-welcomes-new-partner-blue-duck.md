Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson has welcomed the signing today of a $2.5 million business partnership between the Department of Conservation and Genesis Energy that will help save the endangered whio (blue duck).

“Whio are unique to New Zealand and with only 3000 birds left they are rarer than kiwi.

“Genesis Energy’s decision to get involved in working to save this beautiful bird is to be applauded.

“By stepping up with $2.5 million under this new partnership, Genesis has enabled DOC to effectively double the support provided for whio recovery over the next five years.”

Ms Wilkinson says businesses are growing increasingly aware of the role they can play in protecting our environment and native wildlife.

"It's great to see that Genesis will also play an active role in the partnership by providing technical expertise and staff support, being involved in evaluating the programme's success and providing national advocacy support. This will complement work that DOC already has underway.

“DOC looks after eight million hectares of land and thousands of native species. There is always more it can do and partnerships with business provide a great boost for conservation work.”

The $2.5 million funding boost for the Genesis Energy Whio Recovery Programme will increase pest control efforts and raise the number of fully operational whio ‘security sites’ to eight throughout the country.
