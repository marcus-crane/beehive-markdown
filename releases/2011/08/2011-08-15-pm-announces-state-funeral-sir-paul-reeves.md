Prime Minister John Key says the State Funeral for Sir Paul Reeves will be held Thursday in Auckland.

“The Tangi, which precedes the State Funeral, will be at the Auckland Anglican Maori Mission's Tatai Hono Marae, Holy Sepulchre Church, in Khyber Pass starting at 2pm this afternoon.

“The State Funeral, which I will be attending along with a number of Ministers and MPs from across the House, is scheduled for 11am Thursday 18 August, at the Anglican Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Parnell, Auckland.”

For the journey from Holy Sepulchre Church to Holy Trinity Cathedral the cortege will travel through part of the Auckland Domain.

For the final segment, from the edge of the Domain along the few blocks to the Cathedral Forecourt entrance, the hearse will be escorted by Defence personnel.
