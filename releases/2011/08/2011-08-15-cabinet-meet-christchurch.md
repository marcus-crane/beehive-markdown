Prime Minister John Key has announced that, to recognise the anniversary of the first Canterbury earthquake, Cabinet will meet in Christchurch on Monday 5 September.

This will be the first time Cabinet has met outside Wellington in 16 years. The last was 1995, when Cabinet met in Paihia during Waitangi Day celebrations to commemorate the 155th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty.

“Last year’s September 4 earthquake and the subsequent February quake were of such a devastating nature that we will be dealing with the after effects for years. However it is important for the people of Canterbury to know we have a plan to rebuild their city and get their lives back to normal.”

Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker, Waimakariri Mayor David Ayers and Selwyn Mayor Kelvin Coe have been asked to brief Cabinet on the day. There will also be briefings from GNS, EQC, Tonkin and Taylor and CERA.

Minister for Earthquake Recovery, Gerry Brownlee, will then join the Prime Minister at a post-Cabinet press conference.

“It is my expectation that, after this Cabinet, we will be able to give a full update on this Government’s progress in Canterbury.”

The special Cabinet will be held at the Copthorne Commodore at 11am on Monday 5 September. This will be followed by a press conference at the same venue at 2.30 pm.
