A $2 million refurbishment of Pukekohe Police Station will enable Police to better serve their community, Police Minister Judith Collins said today.

Ms Collins joined local Police at the opening of the refurbished station today. She said that prior to the refurbishment the station was not up to the demands of modern Police work.

“Our New Zealand Police deserve plenty of support, good tools and good working conditions,” she said.

“This includes modern, well-equipped Police stations that allow them to perform at their best.

“This facility is designed to meet the needs of the fantastic team of Police we have here in Pukekohe.”

Ms Collins acknowledged the project team that had made the refurbishment possible, and also the Police who had worked in challenging conditions during the eight months of construction.

“Some staff moved to Papakura Police Station, some staff moved to the old Court building next door, and the majority of front line staff worked out of the old meal room,” Ms Collins said.

“Working out of the meal room is above and beyond the call of duty.”
