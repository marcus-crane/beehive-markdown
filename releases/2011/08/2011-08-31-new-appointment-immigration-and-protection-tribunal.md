Christchurch lawyer Matthew Martin has been appointed a member of the Immigration and Protection Tribunal, Associate Justice Minister Nathan Guy announced today.

The independent tribunal was established under the Immigration Act 2009 to consider all immigration, deportation, refugee, and protection appeals in New Zealand.

Mr Martin was awarded an LLB (Hons) from the University of Canterbury in 2004. He has practised mainly in the criminal and family jurisdictions and has experience in immigration matters, including deportation cases and has completed an English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) course. He has also been a volunteer at the Community Law Centre advising people who cannot afford a lawyer.

“Mr Martin’s legal and community experience will be an asset to the work of the tribunal,” says Mr Guy.

Mr Martin is expected to take up his appointment in Auckland in September.
