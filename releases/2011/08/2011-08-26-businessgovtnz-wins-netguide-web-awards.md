Small Business Minister Maurice Williamson has congratulated business.govt.nz for winning their category at the 2011 NetGuide Web Awards.

Business.govt.nz was judged the Best Site for Small Businesses against competition from four other websites including ird.govt.nz and xero.com.

The NetGuide Web Awards acknowledge New Zealand’s best websites and this year attracted over 270,000 votes.

“I am delighted that the team at business.govt.nz have been recognised for their work in supporting small businesses,” Mr Williamson said.

“This award is proof of the quality and standard of the advice and assistance business.govt.nz offers its users.”

MED’s Group Manager Business Registries Justin Hygate accepted the award at a ceremony at the Hilton Hotel in Auckland last night.

Business.govt.nz was re-launched in June 2010 and is a first-stop government website for small and medium businesses.

Small and medium-sized business make up 97 per cent of all New Zealand enterprises, account for 31% of all employees and contribute to 42% of the economy’s total output.
