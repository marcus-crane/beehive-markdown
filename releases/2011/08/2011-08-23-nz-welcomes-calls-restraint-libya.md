The New Zealand government welcomes the call by the Chair of the Libyan National Transitional Council, Mostafa Jalil, for all Libyans to show restraint and to respect the rule of law.

Foreign Affairs Minister, Murray McCully, says it is clear the days of the Gaddafi regime are numbered, although there may be pockets of resistance in the coming weeks.

“There will still be some difficult days ahead for Libya during the regime change. New Zealand supports the statements by NTC leadership saying all those considered guilty of crimes under the previous regime should receive a fair and just trial,” said Mr McCully.

New Zealand’s Ambassador to Egypt has been in dialgoue with National Transitional Council leaders in both Benghazi and Cairo over recent weeks.

He will shortly travel to Libya to establish a working relationship with the NTC as the legitimate voice of the Libyan people.

The New Zealand Government supported the UN resolutions which were designed to protect the rights of the people of Libya.
