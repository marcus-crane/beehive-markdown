The Government is about to begin a review of transport rules affecting agricultural contractors and vehicles, the Associate Transport Minister Nathan Guy has announced today.

“We want to make sure these rules are ensuring public safety without imposing unnecessary red-tape.

“Contractors and farmers need to harvest crops when they are ready, and when the weather is right. Sometimes this may mean working long and irregular hours. The current rules around work time and logbook requirements may not provide enough flexibility for what is a very important industry.

“We will also be looking into the rules around over-dimension and overweight vehicles, speed limits and vehicle inspections. We need to recognise that many of these vehicles, such as tractors carrying heavy loads, may not spend much time on public roads.

“The Government has listened closely to industry concerns and asked the Ministry of Transport to begin work on this review immediately.

“The review will consider whether there is room to reduce compliance costs and enhance economic growth and productivity, without compromising safety. We recognise that there will always be a need for safeguards to protect operators and road users from fatigue and other risks.

“In particular, reducing the impact of driver fatigue is an area of concern in the government’s Safer Journeys road safety strategy.

“In December last year NZTA began trialling a variation to the work time rule which has been well received, and I look forward to seeing what recommendations the Ministry of Transport come up with,” says Mr Guy.

Officials will consult with industry, Federated Farmers, Rural Contractors and other road user groups at several stages of the review, and will consider how overseas regulatory models compare to those in New Zealand. A position paper will be provided to stakeholders later in the year, and officials plan to report back to the Government on emerging issues and next steps early next year.
