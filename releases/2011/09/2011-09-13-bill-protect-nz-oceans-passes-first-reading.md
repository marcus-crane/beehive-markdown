Government legislation to manage the environmental effects of activities in New Zealand’s oceans passed its first reading in Parliament today with the support of the Maori, ACT, United Future and Green parties by 76 votes to 44.

“New Zealand’s Exclusive Economic Zone and Extended Continental Shelf spans an area of 570 million hectares, 20 times our land mass and it needs a proper system of environmental controls,” Dr Smith said.

The Exclusive Economic Zone and Continental Shelf (Environmental Effects) Bill puts in place a framework that classifies activities as prohibited, discretionary, or permitted, gives the consenting function to the new Environmental Protection Authority (EPA)and enables public consultation on significant activities like drilling for petroleum.

“The proposed new law will protect New Zealand’s oceans from the potential environmental risks of activities like petroleum exploration, mining, marine energy, and carbon capture developments. The new system will work alongside existing legislation that manages fishing and maritime transport. It has also been carefully designed to ensure it is consistent with New Zealand’s international obligations,” Dr Smith said.

“The Government has also beefed up regulation of the petroleum industry by the Labour Department with the new High Hazards Unit with four new inspectors. Additional interim measures were announced last month for the coming year requiring operators to work to the latest drilling safety rules developed in the United States following the Gulf of Mexico disaster, and environmental impact assessments to be submitted to the EPA.

“I am disappointed that Labour opposed the Bill's first reading. Its argument that the Bill has been too slow coming is a bit rich when they made no attempt to fill this gap in our environmental laws during its nine years in Government and despite 16 offshore wells being drilled without any environmental controls during this time. Labour seems more interested in playing politics than in making a serious contribution to improving New Zealand's environmental laws.

“I encourage New Zealanders to make submissions on this Bill to the Local Government and Environment Committee by Christmas so we can get the best possible regulatory environment for our massive ocean area. The Government’s ambition is to have this law passed and in place by July 2012.

“This initiative, first proposed in our Bluegreen Policy in 2006, is about supporting a strong economy and a clean environment. It will provide certainty for industry on the rules affecting their offshore investments while better protecting our marine environment.”
