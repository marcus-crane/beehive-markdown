Prime Minister John Key today said the 10th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States was a time for reflection.

“The attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York and the Pentagon remain sharply etched in our memories, and we also today remember those who lost their lives in the aircraft which crashed in Pennsylvania,” Mr Key said.

“New Zealand honours the innocent victims of these attacks.

“They came from more than 70 countries around the world including New Zealand, and our thoughts are with the families and friends who have had to rebuild their lives without their loved ones,” Mr Key said.

The 10th anniversary of September 11 is particularly poignant in New Zealand, where the United States rugby team – known as the USA Eagles – will be playing a match against Ireland as part of the Rugby World Cup.

Mr Key said the people of New Plymouth would ensure the match was played in an atmosphere of great spirit, and New Zealanders were pleased to be able to welcome the USA Eagles to the Rugby World Cup.

“The events of September 11, 2001, fundamentally reshaped our world and strengthened international resolve to fight terrorism. Our determination to fight terrorism, wherever it manifests itself, remains undimished,” Mr Key said.

“As we remember today those who died or were injured 10 years ago, I want to acknowledge those in military and civilian organisations around the world who risk their lives every day in the fight against terrorism.”
