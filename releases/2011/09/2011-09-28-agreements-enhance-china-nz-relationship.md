Five new agreements signed today show the growing relationship between China and New Zealand, Deputy Prime Minister Bill English says.

Mr English and China’s Vice Premier Hui Liangyu witnessed the signings at Premier House this morning.

The governments concluded two bilateral arrangements - one to improve market access for apples into China and one to boost scientific cooperation on fresh water management and protection.

"The protocol on New Zealand’s apple exports into China clarifies pest management conditions and will give greater certainly for New Zealand apple exporters," Mr English says.

"On fresh water, we will both benefit from encouraging knowledge and expertise to be shared between New Zealand's and China's scientists."

Three commercial deals were also signed. A clean energy joint venture between China’s steel producers Shaogang and New Zealand company LanzaTech, which develops technology to convert waste gas to ethanol, will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions of steel making in China. 

"This is an extremely exciting cleantech agreement linking New Zealand technology with Chinese capital. Using waste gases commercially promises major economic and environmental benefits," Mr English says. 

A memorandum of understanding between PwC (formerly Pricewaterhouse Coopers) and the China Development Bank, could result in greater co-operation on major development projects, including in Canterbury.

A cultural agreement between China Radio International and World TV Limited, provides new Chinese language content and editorial resources to the station, which broadcasts in New Zealand.

Mr English will hold bilateral talks later today with Vice Premier Liangyu.
