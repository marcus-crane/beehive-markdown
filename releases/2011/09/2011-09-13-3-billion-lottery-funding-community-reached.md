Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy has congratulated New Zealand Lotteries on reaching the milestone of $3 billion raised for community funds, celebrated at a function in Wellington tonight.

“Since the first Lotto draw on 1 August 1987, NZ Lotteries have done an outstanding job of raising money for the community. A total of $3 billion has now been raised from the proceeds of games like Lotto, Instant Kiwi, Big Wednesday and Keno.

“This has made an enormous contribution to the social fabric of New Zealand. It would be nearly impossible to list all of the cultural, social, sporting, recreational and community causes that have benefited from lottery grants.

“Age Concern, St John, Barnardos, Plunket, Women's Refuges and Cancer Societies are just a few organisations that have received funding, along with major institutions like Te Papa and the Zealandia wildlife sanctuary.

“Creative New Zealand, the New Zealand Film Commission, and Sport and Recreation New Zealand also receive millions of dollars every year.

“This year $8.2 million was raised for the Christchurch earthquake appeal through a special purpose Lotto draw, and a further $6 million was also allocated to the appeal.

“Lottery funding has also supported local celebrations around the Rugby World Cup, with $9.5 million going to support events as part of the REAL New Zealand Festival. This funding has really helped the World Cup become an event for all New Zealanders.

“Everyone who has brought a Lotto ticket over the last 24 years has played a part in achieving this great milestone for the community,” says Mr Guy.
