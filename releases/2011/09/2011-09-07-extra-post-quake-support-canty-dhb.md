The Government has approved $15 million for Canterbury District Health Board to relocate Christchurch Hospital's outpatients unit and the Acute Medical Assessment Unit.

Health Minister Tony Ryall said, "We have fast-tracked the approval for this work so that the facilities will be ready in time for the 2012 winter peak in demand.

"The DHB's earthquake recovery plan has identified a need to increase short to medium term medical bed capacity, and to pull most of the General Medicine services back on to one site.

"The result will be new facilities that can cope with future growth in demand for outpatient services, improved medical team efficiency, and shorter waiting times for patients.

"Funding for the new Acute Medical Assessment Unit and outpatients facility comes on top of a $16 million Government pledge for the last financial year to help pay for increased demand on health services following the quakes.

Mr Ryall said, "The Government wants to thank the dedicated staff of Canterbury DHB for their ongoing commitment to the people of Canterbury during difficult times."
