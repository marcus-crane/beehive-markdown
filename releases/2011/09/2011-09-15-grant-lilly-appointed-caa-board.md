Transport Minister Steven Joyce today announced the appointment of Mr Grant Lilly to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Board.

Mr Lilly’s appointment is for the period from 13 September 2011 to 31 August 2012.

“Since the middle of last year I have made several new appointments to the CAA Board to help increase efficiency and effectiveness at the CAA and to lead cultural change. The appointment of Grant Lilly further strengthens the mix of skills and experience on the Board and adds to its leadership and management capability,” says Mr Joyce.

Grant Lilly is based in Auckland and has a strong background in the aviation sector. He spent 30 years with Air New Zealand and a further 10 years with Qantas, holding several senior executive positions in both companies.

His previous governance experience includes a number of director roles in the aviation sector, including Jetconnect Ltd, Jetstar Airways Ltd, Air Nelson Ltd and Eagle Airways Ltd. He was also a member of the Board of Airline Representatives from 2006 to 2011, and a board member of the New Zealand Business and Parliament Trust from 2008 to 2011.

Mr Lilly replaces Susan Hughes, who retired from the Board on 17 July 2011. 

“I would like to thank Susan Hughes for her contribution to the CAA over nearly seven years of service on the Board. I wish her all the best for her future endeavours,” says Mr Joyce.
