Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman today announced the appointment of Susana Lei’ataua to the National Pacific Radio Trust (NPRT) board.

Ms Lei’ataua, a former Fulbright Senior Scholar and visiting scholar at New York University, runs a Wellington-based communications firm. Her board appointment is for three years.

‘’Susana’s journalism experience in radio, television and print, and her wider strategic communications work with both government agencies and NGOs will strengthen the board,’’ says Dr Coleman.

The NPRT is responsible for maintaining the national Pacific radio network which includes Radio 531pi and the Niu FM radio network. Dr Coleman thanked outgoing board member Marilyn Kohlhase for her work.
