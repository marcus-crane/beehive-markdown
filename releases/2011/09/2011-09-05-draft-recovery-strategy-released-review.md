Cabinet has signed off the release of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority’s draft Recovery Strategy for public consultation, Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee announced today.

"While the initial recovery is well underway in Canterbury, this strategy sets out a proposed direction and priorities for the long term recovery of greater Christchurch," Mr Brownlee said.

"This document will help shape how we rebuild the city and region in partnership with the private and public sector and with the people of greater Christchurch.

"It has a strong focus on sustaining a robust job market and ensuring the continuity of income for residents," Mr Brownlee said.

"The Government is committed to getting this right so now we need the people of Canterbury to tell us their views and if there is anything else we need to include in the Recovery Strategy," he said.

A long-term strategy for recovery from a series of natural disasters had never been needed before in New Zealand, Mr Brownlee said.

The Recovery Strategy is the overarching document into which a series of 10 more specific Recovery Plans for greater Christchurch will feed. One of these plans is the Christchurch central business district (CBD) Recovery Plan, the draft of which was released by the Christchurch City Council last month.

"The Recovery Strategy is a coordinating document which identifies the broad parameters of recovery, which parties will be involved, the Recovery Plans they will be involved in implementing, and importantly, when the work will be done,” Mr Brownlee said.

"Co-ordinating financial, physical and human resources is critical for ensuring taxpayers' money is being spent wisely and restoring confidence in the private sector.

“While local authorities will play a vital role in repairing and restoring essential infrastructure, NGOs and investment from the private sector will be critical for recovery.

"This includes not only banks, insurers, institutional investors, commercial building owners and developers but every homeowner in the greater Christchurch area – making it incredibly important that a wide range of local people give their views on the document.”

The draft Recovery Strategy will be available for the public to view and comment on from Saturday 10 September on CERA's website at [www.cera.govt.nz](http://www.cera.govt.nz).

Meetings with key organisations and the community will also be part of the public consultation, which run until the end of October 2011.

CERA is responsible for rebuilding greater Christchurch and its surrounds, and supporting the welfare of its residents. For more information visit www.cera.govt.nz
