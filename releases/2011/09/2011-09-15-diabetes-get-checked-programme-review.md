The Ministry of Health is to work with experts and Diabetes New Zealand to recommend new ways to support people with diabetes.

Health Minister Tony Ryall has made the announcement following a review of the Diabetes Get Checked programme, which concluded the programme is not making any appreciable improvement for people with diabetes.

"The review cites a study co-authored by Dr Brandon Orr-Walker, that says the programme reduced blood glucose levels by just 0.13 per cent which he said is clinically disappointing. It also found that the programme adds little clinical value to existing general practice.

"The Get Checked programme has been criticised by patients and clinicians alike as being more about box ticking than ongoing support for those living with diabetes. That's why the Government asked for the review.

"Last year the programme funded 122,000 free annual checks and cost almost $8 million. A total of $46 million has been spent on the programme since 2000.

Mr Ryall says it is too soon to say what an alternate approach would look like, but it may be that rather than have a national programme local alliances could be funded involving hospital and community clinicians and patients.

"Some alliances around the country are already looking at improvements, and we are supportive of this work continuing.

"Better diabetes management is a government preventive health target, so I am keen for this work to progress as quickly as possible. I would expect the next government would be able to make decisions by March or April 2012."
