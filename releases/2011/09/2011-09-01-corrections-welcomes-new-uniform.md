Corrections Minister Judith Collins today joined Corrections staff at Rimutaka Prison as they farewelled the green uniform that have been in service for more than 30 years.

From today, Corrections staff around the country will wear a new blue uniform following the first comprehensive review of the Corrections Officer uniform since 1976.

“Most people wouldn’t want to be wearing the same style of clothing they had in the 1970s. Our Corrections staff are no different,” Ms Collins said.

“The old uniform was old fashioned, uncomfortable and not as functional as it should be. For many staff the new uniform couldn’t come soon enough.”

In recent months staff were invited to provide feedback on the design of the new uniform. More than 1400 staff completed an online survey, 140 staff participated in on-site focus groups and 1100 staff viewed the proposed designs on site. Members of both CANZ and PSA unions have provided input into the new uniform.

The blue colour will align the Department with the wider Justice sector (Customs, Courts, and Police) as a law enforcement agency.

The new uniform costs less than the current uniform and will be met from the Department’s budget.

”The new uniform is also a reflection of the professionalism and excellence shown every day by our Corrections staff,” Ms Collins said.

“Our Corrections service is world-class – now it will look world-class too.”
