Prime Minister John Key today expressed the Government’s sadness at the death of a New Zealand Special Air Service soldier in Afghanistan.

“I was informed earlier today that the soldier was shot while the SAS were mentoring the Afghan Crisis Response Unit during an operation in the Wardak Province of Afghanistan near Kabul,” says Mr Key.

“On behalf of the New Zealand Government, I want to offer my sincerest condolences to the soldier’s family, and the Defence Force community.

“I am saddened by the loss of this SAS soldier, the second from the unit to die in Afghanistan.  It is a reminder of the volatile and dangerous conditions that our Defence Force personnel face in Afghanistan while serving their country,” says Mr Key.

“This soldier has paid the highest price for his service to this country, and we mourn his loss with heavy hearts.”
