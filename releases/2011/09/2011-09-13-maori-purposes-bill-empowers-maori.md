Four Māori Affairs Bills have passed their third and final readings in Parliament today, making a range of important changes to legislation affecting Māori, says Associate Minister of Māori Affairs, Hon Georgina te Heuheu.

“The changes within the Māori Purposes Bill, the Māori Fisheries Amendment Bill, the Māori Trust Boards Amendment Bill, and Te Ture Whenua Māori Amendment Bill, will lead directly to improvements for Māori.

“These bills represent a transition away from Government involvement in the affairs of private entities, and a move towards leaner and more responsible governance for Māori collectives, such as Trust Boards and post-settlement governance entities.  Overall, the changes represent the opportunity for Maori entities to enhance their relationship with their beneficiaries,” says Mrs te Heuheu.

They will progress changes to:

- the Māori Trust Boards Act, by enabling Trust Boards to appoint their own auditors, and to report to their beneficiaries by holding Annual General Meetings;
- the Māori Fisheries Act, by amending provisions to enable the more efficient management of fisheries settlement assets, by allowing Mandated Iwi Organisations to transfer assets to other entities representing the same set of beneficiaries;
- legislation affecting the Estate of Pukepuke Tangiora, by removing Crown involvement in the administration of the Estate and extending the distribution period for the Estate; and
- Te Ture Whenua Māori Act, by making a range of minor technical amendments that address inconsistencies within the Act.

“These changes are important in supporting the increasing independence of Māori in the stewardship of their assets,” says Mrs te Heuheu.
