The Government is investing $100,000 to bring international agricultural biotechnology experts to New Zealand next year, Minister of Science and Innovation Wayne Mapp announced today.

New Zealand was announced as the host for the 2012 Agricultural Biotechnology International Conference at the closing of the 2011 conference in South Africa.

“This prestigious conference will bring hundreds of international delegates to New Zealand,” said Dr Mapp. “It is a chance to showcase New Zealand and Australian biotech capability.”

The Ministry of Science and Innovation and AusBiotech, Australia’s biotechnology organisation, played key roles in securing the conference for Australasia.

“New Zealand has a growing reputation for the innovative use of science and technology to support our primary industries,” said Dr Mapp.

“This conference will put the spotlight on what New Zealand and Australia can offer to the international market in areas such as agricultural technology, animal health, food technology and human health.”

Agriculture-focused science and technology has, over more than a century, helped make New Zealand agriculture a world-leader and the backbone of our economy. In the last financial year agriculture generated more than $24.5 billion in exports.

NZBIO, which represents New Zealand’s biotechnology industry, will host the conference in Rotorua from 2-6 September 2012.
