International Day of Older Persons on 1 October is a day dedicated to the celebration of older people throughout New Zealand and the rest of the world.

“Nationally, the response to International Day of Older Persons will feature an exciting range of events planned to honour, celebrate and recognise the valuable contributions older New Zealanders make,” says Senior Citizens Minister Craig Foss.

“I will be taking part in a ‘young and old celebrating age’ walk and the ‘Age Celebration’ Outdoor Entertainment Event and Picnic in Hastings. I encourage you to find out what is happening in your area and to go along and join in the celebrations” says Mr Foss.

“New Zealand’s population is ageing but we are living longer and healthier. This year’s theme for International Day of Older Persons is ‘The Growing Opportunities and Challenges of Global Ageing’. It reminds us to keep a balanced view of ageing and to realise the opportunities that a very productive ageing population brings,” says Mr Foss.

“We know that older Kiwis are playing their part in the workforce, paying taxes and contributing to the economy. They keep volunteer organisations afloat and contribute to our communities in many ways. These are things that help improve the lives of all New Zealanders.
