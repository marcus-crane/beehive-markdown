New Zealand’s Native Trees, the most comprehensive book on the topic to be produced in 30 years, has been officially launched in Wellington tonight with copies to be donated to intermediate and high schools around the country for Conservation Week, says Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson.

“Authors John Dawson and Rob Lucas are to be congratulated for their work.

“New Zealand’s Native Trees is a significant book covering in great detail more than 320 species, subspecies and varieties of native trees and has a stunning collection of over 2000 photos.

“They have been well-served by a dedicated group of reviewers, botanists and editors, which will ensure this book will be a key educational tool for the foreseeable future,” Ms Wilkinson says.

“The generous financial support from the Nelson-based Dick Roberts Community Trust has enabled a copy of the book to be donated to every secondary, intermediate and area school in New Zealand – a total of 600.

“We are lucky to live in one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots and this book will help our students to learn about and identify our native trees.

“I’m sure it will end up being a well-used resource in school libraries.”
