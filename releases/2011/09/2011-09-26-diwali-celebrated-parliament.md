“The popularity of Diwali illustrates the influence Indian culture has had on our society,'' the Minister for Ethnic Affairs Hekia Parata told guests at tonight’s Diwali celebration at Parliament.

Prime Minister John Key and Ms Parata were among the guest speakers at tonight's event, which attracted more than 250 guests.

Known as the festival of lights, Diwali is India's biggest and most significant celebration and enjoyed by Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists. It signifies hope and new beginnings.

“Diwali is a time of festivity and of goodwill and is the most important festival of the year for many Hindus around the world,’’ says Ms Parata.

“It has become a popular celebration here in Aotearoa New Zealand, for both the Hindu community and wider communities. The popularity of Diwali illustrates the influence Indian culture has had on our society.

“Sharing celebrations like Diwali provides an opportunity for all New Zealanders to gain a better understanding of the different communities around us. It also plays an important role in making New Zealand a more tolerant and resilient society.''

Ms Parata says the relationship between India and New Zealand is growing, particularly in the areas of tourism, education and trade.

"This relationship is set to grow with the India-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement, which is currently being negotiated.''

Diwali is also a time for reflection especially for those who have experienced loss, such as in the Christchurch earthquakes.

According to the 2006 Census, 104,583 people resident in New Zealand identified themselves as Indian. The Indian population is the second largest Asian ethnic group, after Chinese.

The Hindu community is the second largest faith-based community in New Zealand. According to the 2006 Census, the number of people affiliated to the Hindu faith was over 64,000 individuals.

“The Government understands the great contribution that Indian New Zealanders have made, and continue to make to New Zealand,’’ says Ms Parata.

“We are committed to creating an environment and economy that supports you to participate in all aspects of New Zealand life, and to tapping into your skills, knowledge and international connections.”
