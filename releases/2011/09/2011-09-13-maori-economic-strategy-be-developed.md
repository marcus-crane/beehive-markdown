An independent panel has been established to report to Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples and Economic Development Minister David Carter with a Maori economic development strategy and action plan by July 2012.

“The panel’s  job is to help raise the rate of return on Maori-owned assets, and to grow the Maori contribution to New Zealand’s economy, by providing a framework for Maori and the Government to work together better,”  the Ministers say.

“This Maori Economic Development Panel will produce strategic recommendations on improving the infrastructure and overall collaboration of the Māori/iwi economy, and on Māori/iwi economic development in the context of the Treaty of Waitangi, New Zealand and the wider global economy,” said Dr Sharples.

“Realising the potential of the Māori economy can contribute to achieving a more internationally competitive New Zealand economy.The Māori Economic Taskforce was Phase One, highlighting the need for co-ordinated and sophisticated planning around Māori economic issues. We believe that the time is now right for Phase Two - to develop a broader, future-oriented Maori Economic Strategy and Action Plan,” he said.

“A 2010 BERL report revealed the Maori economy totals nearly $37 billion, but raises questions as to whether it is delivering to its potential,” said Mr Carter.

The strategy and action plan will identify ways to:

- improve the performance and productivity of the Māori economic sector, and;
- clarify the role, and identify the contribution that the Government can make to improving the performance of the Māori economic sector.

“The panel members bring together a broad range of expertise relevant to the review. These include the management of large New Zealand exporting businesses, the governance of Māori assets and entities and experience in international finance and investment,” the Ministers say.

Te Puni Kōkiri and the Ministry of Economic Development will provide support to the panel, and it will be funded within their existing budgets.
