Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy has announced 18 appointments across seven national lottery distribution committees today.

The appointments are:

- Individuals with Disabilities – Jonathan Darby, Jim Webber, Rev Canon Tim Delaney, and Catriona Williams have been appointed as new members.  Existing member Beverley Grammer has been reappointed and promoted to Presiding Member.
- Environment and Heritage – Philippa Barriball and Te Taru White have been appointed as new members. Sally Macauley has been appointed as the new Presiding Member.
- Health Research – Dr Sarah Young and Dr Chris Cunningham have been reappointed as members.
- Community Facilities – Andrew von Dadelszen has been appointed as a new member.
- Significant Projects – the membership has been made the same as the Community Facilities Fund by appointing Janie Annear, Andrew von Dadelszen, Bill Plunkett, and George Sue as members.  Mary Bourke has been appointed as Presiding Member.
- National Community, and Outdoor Safety – Ron Parkin has been appointed as a new member to both committees, which share the same membership.

“I want to thank the outgoing members for their service to the community. I also welcome the new members who have a real variety of skills and experience to bring to these roles,” says Mr Guy.

Lottery distribution committees make grants for community purposes, using money allocated by the Lottery Grants Board from the profits of New Zealand Lotteries. This comes from games such as Lotto, Lotto Strike, Instant Kiwi and Keno.
