The government has moved to give Canterbury’s tertiary institutions greater financial certainty as they work to recover from the effects of the September and February earthquakes.

Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce says the government’s 2012 funding commitments, which were made prior to the September 4 2010 earthquake, will be met despite an expected decrease in enrolments.

“While funding levels are normally linked to forecast enrolments, the government and the TEC Board recognise the important role Canterbury’s tertiary institutions will play in the region’s recovery."

The University of Canterbury, Lincoln University and the Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology (CPIT) will receive a total of $191.2 million in 2012.

Mr Joyce says confirmation of funding will support these major tertiary institutions to work through their business recovery plans

“Although we know student numbers are likely to be down in 2012, we also know Canterbury will need thousands of trained and qualified workers across a range of industries for the recovery.

“We want to support the institutions to maintain their capacity as much as possible in the interim while they explore opportunities to adapt and grow in the future,” says Mr Joyce.
