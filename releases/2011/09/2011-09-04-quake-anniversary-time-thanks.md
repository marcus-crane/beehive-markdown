Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says the one year anniversary of the 4 September 2010 earthquake is a time to reflect on the unprecedented events which have spilled well beyond Canterbury to touch all New Zealanders over the past year.

"The 7.1 magnitude earthquake which struck at 4:35am on 4 September was not only the largest quake to strike this country near a major population in almost 80 years, it also kicked off a series of seismic events the likes of which hasn’t been seen anywhere else in the world," Mr Brownlee said.

"We've come a long way since that day, through some very dark and trying times, but thanks to the help of New Zealanders up and down the country, and many generous souls offshore, we are making real progress.

"I'd like to commend the people of Canterbury on their passionate commitment to our region and their willingness to contribute to its future over the past 12 months.  

"The innovation shown by business owners and their staff, allowing for continuity of activity and minimal job loss, is a tribute to the entrepreneurial spirit of the city's business leaders and workforce.

"And the ongoing patience of those Cantabrians living in badly damaged properties deserves special recognition on this anniversary day," Mr Brownlee said.

"The Government remains totally committed to rebuilding greater Christchurch and providing a sound future for those who chose to call the region home."

Tomorrow the Cabinet will meet in Christchurch – the first time it has met outside Wellington for 16 years.  Cabinet will receive a series of briefings from local government and other stakeholders on how the recovery is progressing.

"I look forward to welcoming the Prime Minister and my Cabinet colleagues back to Christchurch tomorrow for what will be a very special meeting," Mr Brownlee said.
