New Zealand’s new Consul-General to New Caledonia will be career diplomat Linda Te Puni, Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully announced today.

“Ms Te Puni will also be accredited to French Polynesia and Wallis and Futuna, although resident in Noumea. This will enable her to strengthen New Zealand’s relationships with these key Pacific partners, as well as establish a greater trade presence,” said Mr McCully.

“We are looking forward to seeing New Caledonia and French Polynesia play a greater part in Pacific affairs, as they strengthen their relationships within the region.”

Ms Te Puni has just completed a term in Rarotonga as New Zealand’s High Commissioner to the Cook Islands. Previous roles include serving in both Paris and Mexico as Deputy Head of Mission.
