Environment Minister Nick Smith has welcomed the collaborative effort being taken by the Kaikōura community in protecting and managing its iconic coastline.

Dr Smith today received the proposed Kaikōura marine strategy, ‘Sustaining our Sea’, at Takahanga Marae in Kaikōura. The strategy was developed by the Kaikōura Coastal Marine Guardians (Te Korowai) made up of representatives from iwi, fishing organisations, local businesses, and environmental and recreational groups.

“There has been discussion for more than a decade about marine protection on the Kaikōura coast and with this draft strategy it’s great to see local groups working together on areas of agreement where marine protected areas should be located,” Dr Smith said.

The draft strategy aims to establish the largest marine reserve adjacent to the New Zealand mainland, a marine mammal sanctuary, an integrated coastal management plan, and a future World Heritage Area.

“Kaikōura is an iconic part of New Zealand and the home of our famous whale watching tourist industry. This draft marine strategy recognises how important it is to protect the coastal environment of Kaikōura and its future.

“The Government is a strong believer in the collaborative approach of stakeholders working closely together to resolve complex environmental issues. We will be taking a close interest in the progress of the strategy and its consultation,” Dr Smith said.
