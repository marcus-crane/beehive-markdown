Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced the ten new Trades Academies which are to open around New Zealand from 2012, providing practical skills training for secondary school students while allowing them to study for NCEA credits and tertiary qualifications.

The number of fees-free places for 16 and 17 year olds will increase to 2000 in 21 Trades Academies from next year, as the Government focuses on young people at risk of disengaging from education, and making them better-prepared for the workplace and further education.

The students will still be enrolled in school, and will be able to study at other sites, for example in tertiary institutions and in the workplace.

“Trades Academies, which opened in New Zealand for the first time this year, are already making a big difference for those students who don’t always fit into the regular classroom but are eager to learn practical skills and reach their potential,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Schools are partnering with tertiary providers, employers and industry training organisations to give 16 and 17 year olds a more flexible way of learning, and the vocational skills which will give them more career choices.”

The ten new Trades Academies which will open during 2012 are at:

- UCOL (Palmerston North – Manawatu – Horowhenua - Wairarapa – Whanganui)
- Nelson/Tasman
- West Auckland
- Manurewa (Auckland)
- Central Lakes (Otago)
- National Trade Academy (Christchurch)
- Taumarunui
- Tamaki College (Auckland)
- Kelston Girls’ College (Auckland)
- Te Aho o Te Kura Pounamu

This is in addition to the eight Academies which opened this year, and the three providers which had previously been confirmed to open from the start of next year at:

- Hawkes Bay Trades Academy (to incorporate East Coast)
- Taranaki Trades Academy
- West Coast Trades Academy

“Local economies will also benefit from these new Trades Academies, as businesses will now have more young people with better skills ready to enter the workplace,” says Mrs Tolley.

“By 2014, 12,500 places will be available for 16 and 17 year olds in Trades Academies, Service Academies and the wider Youth Guarantee as we give our young people the chance to obtain worthwhile qualifications and skills training which will lead to successful careers.”
