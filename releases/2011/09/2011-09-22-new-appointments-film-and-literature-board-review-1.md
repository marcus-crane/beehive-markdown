Internal Affairs Minister Nathan Guy has announced three new appointments to the Film and Literature Board of Review today.

“These members bring a variety of skills and experience to this important work,” says Mr Guy.

Eileen Swan, of Auckland, is a private clinical psychologist and also a clinical consultant at Refugees as Survivors New Zealand.

Clare O’Leary, of Wellington, brings experience in digital media strategy and documentary filmmaking as a Director of GoGo Media. She also works as a Palliative Care Educator with Mary Potter Hospice.

Michael Stephens, of Wellington, is the founding Principal of Stephens Lawyers and has significant experience with the New Zealand and Asian film and entertainment industries. He also has many years involvement with the organisation of national and international film festivals.

All new members have been appointed for three year terms, commencing on 25 August 2011.

“I want to thank the outgoing members, Judith Fyfe, Dr Ian Lambie and Andrea Haines for their service to the Board of Review.”

The Film and Literature Board of Review is an independent statutory appeal body. Its purpose is to review the classification of publications referred to it under the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993, after the Office of Film and Literature Classification has classified that publication.
