Agriculture Minister David Carter has welcomed today’s announcement of another successful Primary Growth Partnership bid which lifts the total funding awarded to nearly $500 million.

The Primary Growth Partnership (PGP) is to fund half of a $19.5 million programme led by Ballance Agri-Nutrients to transform traditional fertiliser use, as well as reduce nitrate run-off on dairy farms.

“Today’s announcement lifts the total PGP investment awarded in just two years to $227 million.  With industry contributions, this takes the total to $493 million,” says Mr Carter.

There are now nine PGP programmes underway, covering sectors from wool, red meat and dairy to aquaculture, manuka honey and forestry.  

“The government-industry investment in these programmes is what PGP is about – a joint commitment to boosting economic growth through research and innovation,” says Mr Carter.

“When PGP was launched in September 2009, its goal was to transform great ideas into research, development, and ultimately products, jobs and growth.

“All New Zealanders stand to benefit from innovative investment in the primary sector because our primary, food and forestry industries are pivotal to the successful performance of New Zealand’s economy.”
