A funding boost for weight-loss surgery is producing results, with Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia announcing an increase in the number of procedures nationwide in the first year.

"I can safely say that we have had an extra 75 this 2010/11year. That puts us on target for the 300 over four years which is the target of the increased funding. However, we also need to ensure that this funding is prioritised for those who need it, in particular Maori and Pasifika communities where diabetes rates are disproportionately high and who do not achieve the same outcomes as others.

“I am pleased with this result and in particular with those DHBs who are building their capacity to deliver this service. There has been quite a difference in the number of operations carried out by different DHBs.   It is evident that those with no history of providing this procedure have taken longer to increase delivery.

Mrs Turia says, "In some DHBs, where no operations have been performed to date, work is progressing to identify and prepare patients, and regional arrangements put in place to perform them.

"All DHBs are expected to increase bariatric surgery in the 2011/12 year."

“The National Health Board has worked with clinical groups to produce national referral guidance and prioritisation criteria for surgery.

“I have been concerned at the complaints I have received from those needing surgery who have had to put up with negative attitudes towards bariatric surgery from some GPs. This treatment – long term will save money and lives.

"Bariatric surgery is a key component of our work in reducing the burden of diabetes and obesity amongst our communities, and I look forward to even more DHBs coming on board”.
