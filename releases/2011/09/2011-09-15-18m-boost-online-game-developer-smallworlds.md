The Government is giving online game developer SmallWorlds $1.8 million to help realise its global growth prospects through research and development, Science and Innovation Minister Wayne Mapp announced today.

“The gaming industry is a lucrative sector and New Zealand businesses in this space need to get a piece of the action. Our investments help with this,” said Dr Mapp.

Gaming is the fastest growing entertainment sector in the world, and now generates more revenue than the music and film industry.

“The fact that SmallWorlds is backed by names such as Disney and Sam Morgan is testimony to their success.”

SmallWorlds is an Auckland-based award-winning social gaming developer with more than 6.5 million users worldwide. It received support from the Government soon after it started in 2008.

“This is a great example of how the Government’s investment in a high-potential business has paid off,” said Dr Mapp. “SmallWorlds has been able to triple its revenue and double its employees since it received the initial investment.”

With the latest investment, SmallWorlds will develop a scalable cloud-based platform for its social 3D game website that will allow the site to handle more users. The tool will also enable SmallWorlds to use the next generation of 3D technology – enhancing users’ gaming experience.

SmallWorlds will hire almost 20 new staff and work with universities and local experts to bring new products to the market.

“New Zealand is a hotbed of innovation and investments such as this will nurture and grow businesses with the potential to boost New Zealand’s economy,” said Dr Mapp.

The investment is part of the business investment programme of the Ministry of Science and Innovation (MSI). In the past year, MSI has made more than 1000 research and development investments in business with a total worth of over $170 million.
