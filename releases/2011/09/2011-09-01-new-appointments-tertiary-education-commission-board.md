Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce has appointed Dr Judith Johnston as a Commissioner of the Tertiary Education Commission. 

Dr Johnston, who has been appointed for a period of three years, will replace Deidre Dale whose term expired on 31 August 2010. 

“Judith is a highly capable individual who has had extensive governance experience,” Minister Joyce said.

“She has been a partner at Unisys Corporation and is former Chief Information Officer at the Ministry of Justice.  Judith has also held roles as a Teaching Fellow and Lecturer at the University of Auckland and University of Waikato, and was Visiting Professor of Public Policy at Princeton University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.”

Minister Joyce has also reappointed Robin Hapi and Pauline Winter, who have been Commissioners of the TEC since 2007 and 2009 respectively, for further terms of two years each. 

“Robin and Pauline have both made a strong contribution to the TEC board since their initial appointments and I look forward to working with them further,” the Minister said.

Minister Joyce also extended his thanks to Deidre Dale for her services as Commissioner.  “The TEC has gained significantly from the experience of Deidre and I am grateful for the valuable contributions she has made.”
