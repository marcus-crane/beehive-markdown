Pacific countries vulnerable to violent natural disasters are set to benefit from enhanced tsunami risk management systems, Prime Minister John Key said today.

“Our region is particularly prone to cyclones, floods, tsunami and other catastrophic disasters, many of which can wipe out hard-won development gains in minutes,” says Mr Key.

“To help protect people in the Pacific from future disasters, the Government will invest $2.7 million over the coming year to upgrade tsunami risk management systems in the Cook Islands, Samoa, Tonga, Niue and Tokelau.”

New Zealand’s Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management will work with authorities on the ground to:

- Undertake a number of activities to improve local tsunami assessment and warning processes;
- Roll out siren warning systems;
- Instigate public awareness work, including tsunami-awareness workshops, drills and educational resources for schools; and
- Use scientific data to identify tsunami evacuation routes.

“Pacific island governments, economies and livelihoods can be overwhelmed by natural disasters, and planning to reduce the impact of these events will help save lives and assist in recovery efforts,” says Mr Key.

“New Zealand has internationally-recognised expertise in disaster risk management, and we are well placed to support fellow Forum countries in this area.”

The 42nd Pacific Islands Forum is being held in Auckland from September 6 until September 9. Mr Key is the Forum Chair.
