Environment Minister Nick Smith today referred an application for the Transmission Gully roading proposal to an independent Board of Inquiry under the Government’s new national consenting process with the Environmental Protection Authority.

The New Zealand Transport Agency, Porirua City Council and Transpower New Zealand Ltd are seeking approval under the Resource Management Act for a 27-kilometre inland alternative to State Highway 1 from Linden to MacKays Crossing.

“Transmission Gully is a nationally significant roading project that impacts the greater Wellington region, as well as wider New Zealand. I am referring this application, consistent with the Authority’s recommendation, to an independent Board of Inquiry for its consideration and ultimate decision,” Dr Smith said.

The nearly $1 billion project consists of four components: the main alignment from Linden to MacKays Crossing, the Kenepuru link road; the Porirua link roads and the relocation of existing transmission lines and towers along the route.

This proposal follows an earlier request for changes to the Greater Wellington Regional Freshwater Plan. That application was referred to a Board of Inquiry in September 2010, with a final decision expected later this year. 

“The application for the Transmission Gully roading proposal is nationally significant because of the wide public interest in the project, the significant use of physical and natural resources, and the fact it affects more than one region or district,” Dr Smith said.

Dr Smith named Environment Court Judge Brian Dwyer as chair of the Board of Inquiry. Board members include Environment Commissioner Russell Howie, resource management consultant David McMahon, traffic engineering consultant David Mitchell and Resource Management Act and tikanga Maori expert Glenice Paine.

“Wellington has previously experienced long delays in decisions over transport infrastructure with the Inner City Bypass taking 17 years to consent. This process will enable affected people to have their say but will deliver a decision within nine months.”
