New improvements to the Immigration New Zealand (INZ) website will provide a more streamlined and user-friendly service for customers, says Immigration Minister Jonathan Coleman.

‘’Immigration is committed to improving its customer service. Given the important role immigration plays in bringing visitors, students, skilled migrants and others to New Zealand, services such as the website need to be responsive to customers’ needs,’’ says Dr Coleman.

‘’The revamped website is one of the many changes INZ has undergone over the past two and half years to improve its performance. Across the board, INZ has focussed heavily on simplifying its processes and reducing red-tape.’’

The most significant improvements to the website include a new Visa Options tool and an Employer’s Hub.

In one simple step prospective migrants or visitors to New Zealand can see what visas are available to them. By responding to some simple questions, customers will be provided with a selection of visas that they may like to investigate further.

The new Employer’s Hub will provide a dedicated online service for employers, where they can access the immigration information, service and assistance they need. Most importantly, the new Employer’s Hub will enable employers to search Skillfinder, INZ’s database of potential skilled candidates, by occupation and make contact (via INZ) with those candidates.

INZ’s website is available at: [www.immigration.govt.nz](http://www.immigration.govt.nz)
