Legislation to ensure consumers can have confidence in the quality of natural health products is being tabled in Parliament today, says Associate Health Minister Jonathan Coleman.

The Natural Health Products Bill is one of the shared policy initiatives agreed to by the National and Green Parties under a Memorandum of Understanding.

Dr Coleman says the Bill provides New Zealanders with assurances that the products they buy are safe and true to claim.

‘’Over 6000 natural health products, ranging from vitamin supplements to herbal medicines, are for sale in New Zealand, and the existing legislation covering these products is out-dated,’’ says Dr Coleman.

‘’The Bill creates a cost-effective scheme to oversee the industry with an emphasis on protecting the consumer. The Ministry of Health consulted widely with consumers and industry representatives over the last three years in devising this legislation.’’

There are over 450 natural health companies and the industry has an annual turnover of approximately $760 million.
