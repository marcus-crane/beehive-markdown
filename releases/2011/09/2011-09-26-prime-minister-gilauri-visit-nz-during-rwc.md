Prime Minister John Key today announced that Prime Minister Nikolaz Gilauri of Georgia will arrive in New Zealand tomorrow for a six-day visit.

“I look forward to welcoming Mr Gilauri on Wednesday for our first bilateral meeting,” says Mr Key.

“The Rugby World Cup has provided an excellent opportunity for New Zealand and Georgia to deepen our ties. We will likely discuss developments following the global financial crisis, Mr Gilauri’s perspectives on Eastern Europe, and the Rugby World Cup.

“Georgia and New Zealand both count rugby as their national sport, and I know New Zealand’s stadium of four million has given the Georgian side a warm welcome during their spirited Rugby World Cup campaign.”

Mr Key will host Mr Gilauri in Palmerston North on Wednesday evening to watch the Georgian and Romanian XVs play.

“Hosting the tournament means New Zealand is in a position to develop new relationships in regions, like Eastern Europe, where we have traditionally not had strong ties,” says Mr Key.

While in New Zealand, Mr Gilauri will also meet the Speaker of the House and Ministers Power, McCully and Guy.

Mr Gilauri departs New Zealand on 3 October.
