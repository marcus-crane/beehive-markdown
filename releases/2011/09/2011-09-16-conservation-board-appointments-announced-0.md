Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson today announced 48 new appointments to the country’s 13 regional Conservation Boards – the independent bodies that provide for interaction between the Department of Conservation (DOC) and local communities throughout New Zealand. 

"DOC manages almost a third of the country’s land area for the benefit of all New Zealanders.  Conservation Boards represent the public interest in DOC’s work, and conservation generally, and are advisors to DOC and the New Zealand Conservation Authority,” Ms Wilkinson says.

“I am pleased to see the commitment these appointees have shown to working for conservation by taking on this important role. They will provide new perspectives and experiences that will compliment those of established board members.
