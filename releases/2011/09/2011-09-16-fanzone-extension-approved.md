Rugby World Cup Minister Murray McCully has granted urgent approval under the RWC Empowering Act 2010 to the extension of the Queens Wharf fanzone, festival and showcase event.

The Minister’s decision follows yesterday's hearing on the application by the RWC Authority chaired by Sir Bruce Robertson.

The Minister says he has granted approval without any modification to the recommendations of the Authority. The decision clears the way for the Government’s NZ2011 office to operate an expanded fanzone including Captain Cook Wharf and associated waterfront areas.

Mr McCully says following receipt of the Authority's recommendations, he formally consulted four Ministerial colleagues, the Ministers of Economic Development, Transport, Police and Environment.

Mr McCully also consulted Auckland Mayor Len Brown and says Auckland Council agencies have worked closely with officials in drawing up plans.

"In particular we are working very closely with Waterfront Auckland, our partner in the ownership and operation of Queens Wharf," said the Minister.

The Minister emphasised that putting the new arrangements in place prior to this weekend was "entirely precautionary."

"No doubt some elements of the media will wish to focus on redundant capacity on the waterfront this weekend. That is intentional. We need to rebuild public confidence starting this weekend.”

“However, the following weekend when the All Blacks play France at Eden Park and with an expanded music and entertainment programme at the waterfront I expect that the new facilities will be strongly in demand, with the quarters, semi finals and finals again placing resources under more pressure,” he said.

Mr McCully said the special legislation had proven valuable in dealing with a need to address the events of last Friday in a compressed timetable.
