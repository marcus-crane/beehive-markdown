Doubling the economic value of international education to New Zealand is at the heart of the Government’s Leadership Statement for international education, says Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce.

“The government has preparedthe first version of a Leadership Statement for international education*which*sets bold aspirations for the growth that we want to achieve over the next 15 years.”

Mr Joyce says the government regards international education as a very important industry, not just for its own value but for the role it can play in strengthening New Zealand’s economic, cultural and social links with the world.

“As a trading nation, these links are vital as we work to strengthen ties and form new ones with our major trading partners across Asia, Europe and the Pacific.”

The leadership statement, which will be refined and developed with the sector over the next 12 months, aims to double the economic value of international education to $5 billion over the next 15 years.  It includes targets to:

- increase annual revenues from providing education services offshore to at least $0.5 billion
- develop and sustain mutually beneficial education relationships with key partner countries in Asia, the Pacific, the Middle East, Europe and the Americas
- increase the number of international students enrolled in New Zealand providers offshore, from 3,000 to 10,000
- double the number of international postgraduate students (particularly in programmes in addition to those at PhD level) from 10,000 to 20,000
- increase the transition rate from study to residence for international university students
- increase New Zealanders’ skills and knowledge to operate effectively across cultures.

Mr Joyce says the development of the leadership statement, coupled with the establishment of Education New Zealand – the new Crown Agency set up to oversee and grow the international education sector – will provide a sharper focus and give the sector a real boost.
