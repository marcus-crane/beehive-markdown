Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson today welcomed the opening of the new $16 million Te Wao Nui native species enclosure at Auckland Zoo, in time for Conservation Week.

“Te Wao Nui is the largest project undertaken in Auckland Zoo’s 88-year history and is a huge asset for New Zealand," Ms Wilkinson says.

“It will encompass almost a quarter of the zoo’s 17 hectares and be home to around 60 native wildlife and over 100 plant species, offering an immersive journey through six distinct habitats; the coast, islands, wetlands, forest, high country and the night.

“Visitors will be able to see our amazing habitats and encounter some of our rarest and most charismatic native species up close.

“Te Wao Nui has an important part to play in telling the story of New Zealand’s natural heritage and in inspiring support and action for conservation.

“An enormous amount of work has gone into this project and I congratulate Auckland Zoo for creating such an exciting new exhibition.”

Te Wao Nui will open to the public on Sunday 11th September - the start of Conservation Week.

“The Conservation Week message is ‘Show how much you love New Zealand’ and it is brought to life through partnerships like the one DOC signed with Auckland Zoo in 2009.

“I have no doubt Te Wao Nui will be a huge attraction for New Zealanders and tourists alike and be a fantastic educational tool for our children.”
