A film co-production agreement between New Zealand and South Africa will benefit the creative industries in both countries, Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson said today.

Mr Finlayson and the South African Minister for Arts and Culture Paul Mashatile signed the agreement at a ceremony in Wellington on Sunday.

Co-production agreements enable approved joint film projects to gain “official co-production” status. This status gives co-production film makers access to funding and incentives in line with those available for ‘national’ films in each country.

Mr Finlayson said co-production agreements provided opportunities for New Zealand filmmakers to secure overseas finance, as well as assisting with temporary immigration and importation of equipment.

The Agreement with South Africa follows the success of 2009 blockbuster District 9, produced by New Zealand’s Peter Jackson and directed by South Africa’s Neill Blomkamp.

“District 9 showed what’s possible when the best creative talent of our two countries works together,” Mr Finlayson said. “This Agreement provides incentives for more co-productions between New Zealand and South Africa, but now with the benefits that come through having official co-production status.”

New Zealand currently has 11 bilateral film co-production agreements or arrangements in force. The most recent agreement to be signed was with India in June 2011.

The Agreement was negotiated between New Zealand's Ministry for Culture and Heritage and South Africa’s Department for Arts and Culture.

Applications for co-production agreements involving New Zealand are administered by the New Zealand Film Commission.
