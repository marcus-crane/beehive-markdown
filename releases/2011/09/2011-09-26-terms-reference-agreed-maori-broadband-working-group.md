Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples and Minister for Communications and Information Technology Steven Joyce today signed off a framework for maximising opportunities for Maori from the roll-out of high-speed broadband.

Terms of Reference have been agreed between the Government; Nga Pu Waea, a Maori working group; Telecom and Vodafone, the major contractors rolling out the broadband network; and a number of regional providers of ultra-fast broadband (UFB).

“The Terms of Reference set out the roles and responsibilities of the various parties, as they work together to ensure the rollout of high-speed broadband encourages Maori to connect to and use the network, and get maximum economic opportunities from this infrastructure development,” said the Ministers.

“Nga Pu Waea has developed an annual work plan and budget to maximise the ability of Maori to connect to broadband; to make broadband affordable; so Maori are encouraged to use broadband; and so they can get jobs, training and investment opportunities from the rollout project,” said Dr Sharples.

“I am especially interested in jobs and training for the short term, and in the long term, broadband offers huge potential for social, cultural and economic development for Maori communities all over the country,” he said. “Maori are creative and entrepreneurial people, and broadband means they can connect with the world from their home base on a rural marae.”

“This is a large and complex construction project, and it is good to have Nga Pu Waea exploring the possibilities for Maori at every step,” said Mr Joyce. “Adding value for Maori gives the whole network greater value to the nation overall, and greater potential to drive a step change in our economic growth.”
