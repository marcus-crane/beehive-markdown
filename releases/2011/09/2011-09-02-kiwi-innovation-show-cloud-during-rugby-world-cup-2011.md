Rugby World Cup Minister, Murray McCully, today previewed The Cloud on Auckland’s Queens Wharf, part of New Zealand’s largest ever showcase of business creativity and innovation for Rugby World Cup 2011.

“Today’s preview of The Cloud is an important moment for New Zealand’s business sectors. Our goal is to ensure New Zealand’s innovation story plays a strong role in showcasing New Zealand during the Tournament. It is an investment which is a legacy New Zealand Trade and Enterprise will continue to build on long after the Tournament ends,” Mr McCully said.

The Cloud is open to the public at all times during the Tournament and entry is free. It includes an exhibition space, two giant screens for an innovation AV showcase and to broadcast the Rugby when it is a Fanzone, a ‘Taste at The Cloud’ food and beverage experience, the NZ 2011 media lounge and the NZ 2011 business lounge.

Visitors to The Cloud can taste the quality and diversity of New Zealand food and beverages at the daily ‘Taste at The Cloud’, experience authentic ‘Kiwi’ hospitality, see up close the amazing business innovations that New Zealand is increasingly known for internationally, attend fashion and design shows and enjoy the Fanzone of music and matches on big screens on match days.

“Our investment in The Cloud to be more than just an entertainment venue is deliberate and important. Countries participating in Rugby World Cup include some of our biggest trading partners – Australia (largest), the USA (third largest), Japan (fourth) and the UK (seventh largest).”

“From Aviation to Agribusiness and Bioscience to Marine – these forward-thinking business sectors are changing international perceptions of New Zealand. The showcase at The Cloud is the first step in broadening the brand story of New Zealand Inc. to encompass world–class innovation that is world-scalable.”

“It is time to confidently market New Zealand as a great destination for ingenuity, knowledge, investment, talent, as well as tourism and culture.”
