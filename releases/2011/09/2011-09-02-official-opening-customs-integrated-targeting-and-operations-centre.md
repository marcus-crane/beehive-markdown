Prime Minister John Key officially opened the Customs’ Integrated Targeting and Operations Centre (ITOC) in Auckland today with Customs Minister Maurice Williamson.

Based in the Auckland Customhouse, the ITOC will enhance the government’s ability to protect the safety and security of New Zealanders through more effective border control 24-hours a day. 

“Everything needed to determine risks presented by people, goods, or craft, are now brought together at the ITOC,” Mr Williamson says.

The ITOC is also staffed by the key border agencies of Immigration New Zealand the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and Maritime New Zealand.

Customs is the first country outside of the United States to trial the Automated Targeting System – Global (ATS-G), an automated targeting tool to screen for passengers posing a potential risk.

“This vastly improves on the manual process Customs currently uses.”

“This will enhance the government’s ability to protect the safety and security of New Zealanders through more effective border control,” Mr Williamson says.
