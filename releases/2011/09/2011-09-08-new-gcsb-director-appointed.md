Prime Minister John Key today announced the appointment of Ian Fletcher as the new Director of the Government Communications Security Bureau.

Mr Fletcher is a New Zealander who has held senior executive positions in Australia and the United Kingdom since 1998.

He has been a successful public sector chief executive in Australia in his current position, as the Director-General and Chief Executive Officer of the Queensland State’s Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation since 2009.

Prior to this, he was the Chief Executive and Comptroller General, Intellectual Property Office in the United Kingdom from 2007 to 2009 and Managing Director, United Kingdom Trade and Investment for three years.

Mr Fletcher was the Principal Private Secretary to the Cabinet Secretary and Head of the Home Civil Service for two years.

“Mr Fletcher has extensive policy and operational experience particularly in relation to international economic and trade matters. He has been appointed for a five year term and is expected to start the role in early 2012,” says Mr Key.

The Director leads and manages the GCSB, which contributes to national security by providing the foreign intelligence required to protect and advance New Zealand’s security, defence, economic and other interests.

“Mr Fletcher is a skilled leader who will make a valuable contribution to the bureau and wider New Zealand intelligence community,” says Mr Key.
