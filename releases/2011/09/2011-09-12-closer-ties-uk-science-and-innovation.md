Stronger links with the United Kingdom on science and innovation matters will result from an agreement signed today, Minister of Science and Innovation Wayne Mapp said.

UK Secretary of State Jeremy Browne and Dr Mapp have given Ministerial support for a New Zealand-United Kingdom Science and Innovation Working Group to be set up.

“The United Kingdom has always been one of New Zealand’s most significant science and innovation partners,” said Dr Mapp.

“Both countries share an interest in driving economic growth through investment in science and research.”

Mr Browne said the Working Group will add value and structure to the relationship between the UK and New Zealand, and allow a stronger focus on scientific opportunities.

The Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor, Professor Sir Peter Gluckman, worked with the UK High Commissioner Victoria Treadell, the UK’s Department of Business Innovation and Skills, New Zealand’s Ministry of Science and Innovation and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade to set up the Working Group.

Dr Mapp said about 30 percent of New Zealand researchers already have a UK partner with particularly strong cooperation in the biological sciences, biotechnology and the physical sciences.

The Working Group will hold up to four meetings over the coming year and will report to the respective Prime Ministers and Ministers responsible by September 2012.
