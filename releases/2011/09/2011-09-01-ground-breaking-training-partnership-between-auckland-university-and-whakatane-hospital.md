Health Minister Tony Ryall and Education Minister Anne Tolley have launched a partnership with the University of Auckland that will train more doctors and nurses and other health professionals at Whakatane Hospital.

The partnership is part of a new $4.5 million programme to train health students in rural areas so that they will return to work in rural communities.

"Over the next three years an estimated 144 student doctors, nurses, pharmacists and physiotherapists will train side by side, in the classroom and out on the job at Whakatane Hospital" says Mrs Tolley.

Launching the scheme today at Whakatane Hospital, Mrs Tolley says “Many New Zealand rural communities and hospitals have struggled to attract and retain health professionals.

"This scheme will open up new career opportunities for students from rural areas, as well as encouraging students to work in rural areas once qualified," says Mrs Tolley.

"Experience overseas suggests that health students who train in rural areas are more likely to return to work in rural areas" said Mr Ryall.

Mr Ryall says that for the first time, the University of Otago and the University of Auckland Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences are collaborating to provide the multidisciplinary training programmes based in Gisborne and Whakatane Hospitals.

"The University of Auckland programme will be based in Whakatane and will provide training for about 144 medicine, nursing, pharmacy and physiotherapy students over three years.

"The University of Otago programme will be based in Gisborne and will provide training provision for medicine, nursing, pharmacy, physiotherapy and dentistry students.

The Government is providing $4.5 million over three years from 2012 to develop and deliver the programme. Both Universities will also contribute financially, working in partnership with Health Workforce New Zealand.
