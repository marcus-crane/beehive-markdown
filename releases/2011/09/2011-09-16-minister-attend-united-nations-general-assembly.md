Justice Minister Simon Power will lead the New Zealand delegation to the opening week of the 66th United Nations General Assembly in New York next week.

The High-Level Segment, which is the biggest annual gathering of global leaders and ministers, runs from September 19 to 22.

Its theme this year is the worldwide prevention and control of non-communicable diseases, including heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. The Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor, Sir Peter Gluckman, will accompany Mr Power to the event.

“Death and disability from non-communicable diseases have reached epidemic proportions, so this is important stuff,” Mr Power said.

“Although preventable, such diseases represent a major threat to the economy and health of populations in all countries.”

Mr Power will also participate in high-level discussions concerning international cooperation on counter-terrorism, sustainable energy, and nuclear safety, as well as formally ratifying treaties on behalf of New Zealand concerning the Safety of United Nations personnel and the Rights of the Child.

He will also participate in the launch of the new Global Counter-Terrorism Forum, chaired by Turkey and the United States.

“Ten years on from the September 11 attacks on the United States, the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum has been established to mobilise resources, expertise, and political will to address 21st century terrorist threats.

“The invitation for New Zealand to be one of the forum’s core group of countries is a recognition of our strong contribution to combating international terrorism".
