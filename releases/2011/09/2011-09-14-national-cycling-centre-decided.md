The Minister for Sport and Recreation, Murray McCully, has welcomed the Waikato region winning the tender process to build the national cycling centre of excellence.

“This has been a careful tender process managed by SPARC. They have advised the Waikato’s Home of Cycling Trust that it has won the tender process since it received the support of the Waikato Regional Council today,” said Murray McCully.

“With all factors considered I support this outcome. It allows a high performance cycling centre to be constructed in the central North Island. The Waikato Bay of Plenty proposal also caters for different bike disciplines across all levels”.

“The national cycling centre of excellence will serve generations of New Zealand cyclists well by providing excellent facilities and high level coaching,” he said.

“This is a key investment in the government’s strategy to promote high performance sport outcomes by providing world-class high-performance infrastructure” said Mr McCully.

The National Cycling Centre is a $28 million infrastructure development of which the Government is providing a $7 million cornerstone investment.

It is part of a network of world-class facilities being developed around the country. Other facilities include the redevelopment of the Millennium Institute of Sport and Health and the national ocean water sports centre on Auckland’s North Shore, the Rowing New Zealand High Performance Centre at Karapiro, as well as regional high performance centres in Dunedin and Wellington.

“The tender process for the national cycling centre was competitive and I am aware several other groups have missed out. However I thank them for their patience while SPARC undertook the tender process,” said Mr McCully.
