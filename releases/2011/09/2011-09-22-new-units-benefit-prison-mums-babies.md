Mothers who have a baby while in prison will be able to keep the child with them for two years following the opening of two Mother and Baby Units this week.

Corrections Minister Judith Collins today opened a Mother and Baby Unit at Christchurch Women’s Prison. Tomorrow Ms Collins will open a unit at Auckland Region Women’s Corrections Facility.

Until now, mothers who had babies while in prison were able to keep the infant with them for only nine months.

In 2008 the Corrections (Mothers with Babies) Amendment Bill was passed by Parliament with multi-party support, setting out provisions for mothers to keep their children with them in prison up to two years of age.

It was agreed that the commencement date of the Act would be appointed by the Governor General by Order in Council when the infrastructure was in place. The facilities are now complete.

“Every child deserves a good start in life. They deserve a stable, supportive environment with a mother who is committed to what is best for that child,” Ms Collins said.

“Each year around a dozen babies in this country are born to mothers who are in prison. Irrespective of their mother’s circumstances, these babies deserve a good start and to be with their mothers.

“No-one will ever claim that these units are the ideal place for little babies. Rather they are a practical and responsible move that recognises the sometimes sad reality that criminal activity can be committed by anyone, including mothers.”

Ms Collins said mothers had to meet strict criteria, such as being drug free, to be eligible to use the units. Parenting education would be an important part of their stay in the Mother and Baby Units.

“Being able to form a strong bond with their baby will also help their mother’s rehabilitation,” Ms Collins said.

“If I can think of a single thing that will drive these adults to remain crime-free it would surely be their love for their child.”
