Environment Minister Nick Smith and representatives of Ngati Maniapoto today signed an Environment Accord at Parliament that supports the commitment both parties have made to enter a new era of co-management of the Waipa River catchment.

“The Government is pleased today to acknowledge the passion Ngati Maniapoto has shown in furthering work to enhance the health of the Waipa River.  As the largest tributary flowing into the Waikato, a cleaner Waipa will have benefits for many in the region,” Dr Smith said.

The Environment Accord will set out ways for Ngati Maniapoto and the Crown to work more closely together through sharing information, working on joint projects and meeting annually.

“The iwi model of kaitiakitanga or guardianship of natural resources is one the Government is proud to work with and we expect this historic accord to further enhance our relationship with Ngati Maniapoto,” Dr Smith said.

Waikato Tainui, Raukawa and Te Arawa have already signed accords designed to support the clean up of the Waikato and Waipa Rivers.
