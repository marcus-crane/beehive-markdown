Prime Minister John Key has congratulated the recipients of this year’s Prime Minister’s Business Scholarships.

The five recipients, three of whom are from Christchurch, will study at prestigious institutions including Harvard, London Business School, and INSEAD – the Business School for the World.

The scholarships, which were launched in 2010, are designed to build business capability and enhance New Zealand’s opportunity for growth by developing skills in management and international business leadership.

The five recipients choose which business programme they attend and each will receive up to $110,000 to cover half the costs of their course and direct expenses.

“This is a great opportunity, not just for the individuals but for New Zealand when they bring their skills back home. I congratulate all five recipients and wish them every success in their endeavours,” says Mr Key.

The recipients are Ben Gough of The Gough Group, Christchurch, James Kyd of Tait Radio Communications, Christchurch, John McVicar of McVicar Timber Group Ltd, Christchurch, Matthew Ensor of Beca Infrastructure, Auckland and Nevin Amos of Comvita Ltd, Te Puke.

Acting Economic Development Minister David Carter says, “These scholarships provide an opportunity for the recipients to go overseas and study at some of the world’s most prestigious institutions. It will be an invaluable experience.”
