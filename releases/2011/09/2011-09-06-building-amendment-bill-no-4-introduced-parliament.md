A Bill that proposes consumer protection measures to the Building Act 2004 was introduced to Parliament today.

Building Amendment Bill (No 4) provides for a range of measures designed to help consumers hold building practitioners to account.

The Bill is the companion to the Building Amendment Bill (No 3) which was introduced to Parliament in November 2010.

“These Bills form a package of changes to lift the performance and productivity of the building industry,” Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson says.

The Bill includes mandatory written contracts for all building work over $20,000, disclosure requirements for building contractors about their skills, qualifications, licensing status and track record, and rules making principal building contractors fix any defects in their work within 12 months.

The Bill also increases penalties for failing to comply with building consent requirements.

“The proposed changes set the scene for an efficient and effective building and construction sector that stands behind the quality of its work,” Mr Williamson says.
