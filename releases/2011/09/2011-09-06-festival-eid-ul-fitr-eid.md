The Minister for Ethnic Affairs, Hekia Parata, will tonight host the seventh festival of Eid ul-Fitr (Eid) at Parliament to mark the end of fasting for the holy month of Ramadan.

"The month of Ramadan is a period of contemplation, reflection and celebration - to gain spiritual harmony and give thanks for the health and happiness of friends and family," says Ms Parata.

The Minister will celebrate this occasion with members of the Muslim community from across New Zealand and will be joined by the Minister of Immigration, Jonathan Coleman and other Members of Parliament.

"There are around 36,000 thousand Muslims in Aotearoa New Zealand,’’ says Ms Parata.

“They bring a wealth of cultural and social knowledge to our country and they contribute significantly to our economy, and it is important that our government provides opportunities for their contributions to be recognised.’’

"Eid is a significant event for Muslim communities and I am looking forward to celebrating this with my fellow MPs and the wider Muslim community."
