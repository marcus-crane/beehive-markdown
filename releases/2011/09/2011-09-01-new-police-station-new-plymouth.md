New Plymouth’s 49-year-old Police Station is to be pulled down and a new one built in its place, Police Minister Judith Collins announced today.

Police will demolish the existing station and build a 2350m² station on the site. The overall project, which will be subject to a competitive tender, is expected to be in the range of $10 - $12 million.

The current station was built by the Ministry of Works and opened in August 1962. At the time there were fewer than 30 Police in New Plymouth. Today there are 155.

“The current station has served New Plymouth well, but is no longer able to support the needs of modern policing,” Ms Collins said.

“Lack of space has resulted in services, that would ideally share a single building, being housed in three different locations. 

“The new station will accommodate staff from all three locations and provide much improved facilities.

“Our Police deserve plenty of support, good tools and good working conditions. This includes modern, well equipped Police stations that allow them to perform at their best.”

Demolition is expected to start in December with the project being completed in early 2013.

The demolition and construction will have no impact on services to the public.

Police will operate out of existing leased buildings and an additional building on St Aubyn St.
