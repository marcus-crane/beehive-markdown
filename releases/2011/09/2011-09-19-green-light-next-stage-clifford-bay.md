The option of using Clifford Bay in Marlborough as base for ferry terminal operations will be further investigated, Transport Minister Steven Joyce announced today. 

“An independent report commissioned by the Ministry of Transport found that there is a financial and economic case for progressing Clifford Bay,” says Mr Joyce.

“However, there is potential for cost variations that may yet undermine the economic and financial cases for the development. Before we make any final decisions about Clifford Bay we need a detailed evaluation and a full business case.”

The evaluation will look at the business case for Clifford Bay from a national perspective and will further investigate the engineering viability of the proposal. This work is required regardless of which development options may be considered to progress a terminal at Clifford Bay.

The business case must support the government’s goals of economic growth, productivity and value for money before the project would be confirmed as a viable development.

If the development goes ahead it would cut 30 minutes off the ferry trip between the North and South Islands; 50 minutes off the road trip from Wellington to Christchurch; and 80 minutes off the same rail journey.

“I have asked the Ministry of Transport to lead the further analysis and I expect that all key stakeholders will be involved,” says Mr Joyce.
