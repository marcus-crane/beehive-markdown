Environment Canterbury has improved its compliance with resource management consenting timelines from 29% in 2007/08 to 92% in 2010/11, Environment Minister Nick Smith says.

“That only 29% of consents in 2007/08 were processed on time – the worst of New Zealand’s 84 councils – was one of the key reasons the Government stepped in and appointed Commissioners in March last year. It is a real credit to the Commissioners and Environment Canterbury staff that this has been turned around so dramatically,” Dr Smith said.

“Delays in resource consent processing add expense, inhibit growth and cost jobs. It is particularly important as Canterbury rebuilds from the devastating earthquakes that consents are processed as timely as possible.

“Environment Canterbury has achieved this turnaround by putting in place good systems, ensuring consents have all the information early on and building a good relationship with consent applicants and Canterbury’s other councils. The Government’s reforms to simplify and streamline the Resource Management Act also helped in improving consenting timelines.

“This dramatic improvement in resource consent processing follows completion of a natural resources plan, a significant improvement in compliance with farm resource consents, good progress in implementing the Canterbury Water Management Strategy and the $12 million plan to clean up Te Waihora/Lake Ellesmere. The Commissioners’ performance has significantly exceeded the Government’s expectations.”
