A Memorandum of Understanding between Police and the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) will widen the net in the fight against financial crime, Police Minister and Minister Responsible for the SFO Judith Collins said.

The MOU was signed in Wellington today. It covers a range of law enforcement activities between the two agencies, and envisages joint operations on major financial crime investigations, prosecutions and asset recovery.

“Both the SFO and Police have highly complementary skills and resources, and it is important that these are put to good effect in fighting financial crime,” Ms Collins said.

“This MOU underlines how seriously these agencies view financial crime, and how fighting financial crime can be more effective when agencies share knowledge, resources and expertise.

“I would like to commend Police and the SFO on developing this MOU.

“Strong inter-agency co-operation widens the net against financial crime and sends a message that the Government is committed to protecting investors and preserving New Zealand’s reputation as clean and free of corruption.”

In recent months the SFO has undertaken forensic accounting work for the Police on a number of cases.

At the same time, Police investigators have been seconded into the SFO to assist with a wide range of major investigations, including those of Hanover Finance and other collapsed finance companies.
