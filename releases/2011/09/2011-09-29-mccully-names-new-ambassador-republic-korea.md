New Zealand’s next Ambassador to the Republic of Korea will be Patrick Rata, Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully announced today. 

Based in Seoul, Mr Rata will be maintaining and strengthening the relationship with the Republic of Korea as well as establishing a greater trade presence.  

“Korea is New Zealand’s fifth largest trading partner. There is potential for a significant expansion of economic ties, particularly in science and innovation collaboration," said Mr McCully. 

"A conclusion of a free trade agreement will also provide a major boost to the political and trading relationship. An early and important focus for Mr Rata will be to ensure that these negotiations are brought to a successful end.”

"With 2012 marking the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our two nations, there could be no bigger statement of friendship than signing an FTA and setting the path for a vigorous and dynamic relationship for the next 50 years," he said.

The position is also accredited to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. 

"New Zealand continues to support efforts to bring peace and security to the Korean Peninsula ," Mr McCully said.

Mr Rata is currently working at the World Trade Organization in Geneva. He has been the Head of the Japan and Koreas Unit at the Ministry and held postings to the New Zealand High Commission in London and the Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York.
