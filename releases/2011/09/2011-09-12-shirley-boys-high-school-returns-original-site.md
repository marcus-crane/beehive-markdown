Education Minister Anne Tolley has welcomed the return of Shirley Boys’ High School to its original site in Christchurch, after 26  weeks of site-sharing following the February earthquake.

From tomorrow, 1300 Shirley Boys’ High students will be able to return to their home site, which suffered significant damage and liquefaction.

The Government has invested $2 million in repairing the site, making five damaged blocks safe and bringing in eight relocatable classrooms to replace the administration block and library which remain unusable.

“This signals a return to normality for students, parents and staff at the school,” says Mrs Tolley.

“It has been an extremely challenging time for Shirley Boys’ High and for Papanui High who have been site-sharing, and both schools deserve great credit for minimising the disruption to students and their learning.

“Their attitude, courage and determination has been reflected right across the education system in Canterbury, and I want to thank everyone for their hard work.”

The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) has agreed for the Shirley Boys’ High site to be used for up to two years.

Avonside Girls’ High and Marian College are now the only state secondary schools still site-sharing in the city, with Avonside set to return to its original site at the start of 2012.

The Ministry of Education is one of a number of government ministries and departments working with the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) on rebuilding greater Christchurch and its surrounds, and supporting the welfare of its residents.  For more information visit [http://www.cera.govt.nz](http://www.cera.govt.nz)
