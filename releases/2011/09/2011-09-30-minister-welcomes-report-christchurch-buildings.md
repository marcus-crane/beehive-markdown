Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson has welcomed today's release of a Department of Building and Housing technical investigation into the performance of three buildings in Christchurch.

The report released today covers the Pyne Gould Corporation, Forsyth Barr and Hotel Grand Chancellor buildings. However, the technical investigation into the fourth and final building - the Canterbury Television (CTV) building is far more complex and will be part of a second report, which will not be completed until the end of this year or early 2012.

“There are several possible reasons for the failure and the expert panel is adamant that additional analysis is necessary,” Mr Williamson said.

“The families of those injured or killed and the survivors deserve findings based on a thorough and robust investigation.”

The technical investigation findings will be used by the Department of Building and Housing to identify improvements in the way buildings are designed and constructed. The reports will also assist the Royal Commission of Inquiry.
