A public-private partnership between the Government and cruise operator Carnival Australia will help further open up the burgeoning cruise industry to the Pacific, Prime Minister John Key announced today.

“The cruise industry is the fastest-growing segment of global tourism, with average annual growth at 8.7 per cent for the past decade, and the South Pacific is one of the fastest-growing markets,” says Mr Key.

Carnival Australia is working with the community in Aneityum, Vanuatu, on a pilot shore tour programme. New Zealand will support elements of this programme, which is designed to assist the Aneityum community develop their venture. The pilot will start towards the end of the year.

“There’s a huge opportunity for Pacific communities and businesses to benefit from the rising popularity of cruise holidays. The Government’s partnership with Carnival Australia is a solid step towards growing this market, and feeds into our wider support for tourism in the region,” says Mr Key.

The Government is working with other countries to upgrade tourism infrastructure, including the redevelopment of airports in Kiribati, the Solomon Islands and Tonga, and the development of an alternative marine jetty in the Cook Islands.

“I would like to thank AusAid for developing the collaboration with Carnival Australia, and Maritime New Zealand for its work in the area of maritime safety, which will complement efforts to build on the Pacific’s tourism potential.

“The Pacific has some magic holiday destinations, and we expect these initiatives will help open up the region to the rest of the world,” says Mr Key.

The 42nd Pacific Islands Forum is being held in Auckland from September 6 until September 9. Mr Key is the Forum Chair.
