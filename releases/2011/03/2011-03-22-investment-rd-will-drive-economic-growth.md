The dramatic increase in spending on research and development announced today in a Statistics New Zealand report is proof that R&D has the power to drive New Zealand’s economic growth, Minister of Science and Innovation Wayne Mapp says.

R&D spending has gone up by 13 per cent since 2008, the report said. The total is now nearly $2.5 billion. Business is the largest single contributor, collectively spending around $1 billion.

“The Government’s policies are working, and working well. In a time of tight markets we are stimulating very high levels of investment because we are backing business R&D, and business can see that innovation is the key to economic growth. Bringing innovative products and processes to market is the path to prosperity,” Dr Mapp said.

“The Government has provided a range of support for business innovation. Last year we introduced a $234 million technology package, including the Technology Development Grants and the Technology Transfer Voucher scheme.

“$96 million has already been allocated through the Technology Development Grants, and applications for the next tranche of $48 million opened last week.

“The scheme has been oversubscribed, which is an excellent result especially considering that every public dollar is matched by $4 from business,” he said.
