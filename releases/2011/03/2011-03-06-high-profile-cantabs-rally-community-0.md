High profile Cantabrians including several All Blacks are providing messages of support and advice about where to go for help to people affected by the latest Canterbury earthquake.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says, “It's heartening to see some of New Zealand's best known sporting heroes more than willing to lend some words of comfort and support to quake victims in a television, radio and newspaper campaign.

"The whole of New Zealand has seen the resilience of those affected. We know from the previous earthquake that stress and anxiety are a normal reaction.

These ads remind and reassure people that their reactions to this awful event are normal, and reinforce that sensible advice about how to help yourself, family and neighbours.

People are reminded of the Government help line, website and to seek help from their GP if they are not coping.

“A number of non-government organisations are also bringing in extra staff involved in counselling and other support services for Christchurch, as people cope with these trying circumstances.”

The high profile Cantabrians in the ads include Richie McCaw, Julie and Dallas Seymour, Craig McMillan, Brad Thorn, Corey Flynn, Kieran Read, Maree Bowden and Alex Wyllie.

Sir Richard Taylor and Buck Shelford will also front the campaign with messages of support on behalf of the rest of New Zealand.

"Our messages are encouraging people to keep talking to family and friends, reminding them about the services that are available, and where they can go to get support.”

The six-week campaign is being funded by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Social Development.

The Government's earthquake helpline is 0800 779 997, and staff can connect quake-affected residents with the appropriate support. For community information [www.canterburyearthquake.org.nz](http://www.canterburyearthquake.org.nz)
