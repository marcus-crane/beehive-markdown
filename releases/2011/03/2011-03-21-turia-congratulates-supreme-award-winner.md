Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Tariana Turia is congratulating the Bay of Islands Vintage Railway Trust on winning the Supreme Award at the TrustPower National Community Awards.

The awards were held on Saturday night in Tauranga.

The Bay of Islands Vintage Railway Trust has restored and operates a vintage steam railway experience between Kawakawa and Opua in Northland.

“This award recognises the exceptional work of the Trust who has raised $1.6m over the past eight years to run a service four times a day on weekends and in school holidays,” says Mrs Turia.

“This Trust is run by amazing volunteers and their dedication and commitment has lifted the spirit of a small community and helped revitalise local business in Kawakawa.”

Mrs Turia says the calibre of voluntary projects was outstanding.

“These awards offer a great opportunity to showcase, recognise and celebrate the work of volunteer groups and organisations in our community.”

“I would also like to congratulate the other finalists in last night’s awards. Their projects were all worthy of winning the Supreme Award.”

“I would also like to commend TrustPower for sponsoring the event and the Mayors and Deputy Mayors who supported their community projects to enter the awards.”
