Lotto customers have been thanked for their generosity in buying tickets for last Saturday’s special draw by the Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy, which raised $8,248,300 for the people of Christchurch.

The New Zealand Lotteries Commission has today formally transferred this money to the Lottery Grants Board, which is chaired by Mr Guy. The money will now be passed onto to the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal to help the community recover.

Fifty percent of the sales of all Lotto, Lotto Strike and Lotto Powerball tickets entered into the 5 March 2011 draw have been donated.

“The public expressed a strong desire for Lotto to help the people of Christchurch in some way, and I’m very pleased we could make this happen.

“As Minister of Internal Affairs I directed New Zealand Lotteries to hold a special draw under section 245 of the Gambling Act 2003. This special draw fits with the core purpose of Lotto, which is to raise money for the community.

“We were heartened with the support of New Zealanders for this special draw, with Lotto sales up by around $5 million when compared to the previous week.

“Lotto retailers reported a huge response from their customers, many of whom bought extra tickets for the draw.

“Everyone appreciates the magnitude of the task ahead in Christchurch, and I’m very pleased that this contribution will make a real difference to people and their communities.”
