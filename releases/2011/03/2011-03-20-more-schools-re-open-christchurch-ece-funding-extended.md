Education Minister Anne Tolley says that 97 per cent of Christchurch schools are set to have re-opened by the middle of this week.

151 schools will be open tomorrow, with that figure due to rise to 157 by Wednesday.

“Schools are doing a magnificent job in making sure students can return to learning, either at their own school site or sharing a site with another school,” says Mrs Tolley.

“I’m also pleased to say that for the first time since the earthquake, the number of Christchurch students enrolled around the country has started to fall.

“More than 600 students have now returned to their original Christchurch schools, and I expect this trend to continue.”

The learning hubs set up by the Ministry, offering teaching and resources to students whose schools have yet to re-open, will continue to operate on Monday, but will be reviewed on a daily basis.

Meanwhile, 260 ECE services, 76 per cent of the total, are due to be open on Monday.

“I have decided that emergency funding for ECE services will be extended until at least the end of the month,” says Mrs Tolley.

“This means ECE centres will continue to receive funding for children who have temporarily moved away, to ensure financial stability.

“If these children are enrolled at another service in the interim, then funding will also be given to the new service.

“We will continue to do all we can to support schools and ECE services affected by the earthquake.”
