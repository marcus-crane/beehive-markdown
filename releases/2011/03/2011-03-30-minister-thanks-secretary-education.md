Education Minister Anne Tolley has thanked the Secretary for Education, Karen Sewell, for her commitment to public service following the announcement that Ms Sewell is to retire at the end of July.

“Karen has dedicated her life to education, and deserves praise for her hard work in lifting the achievement levels of students in New Zealand,” says Mrs Tolley.

“During an impressive career in the education sector, Karen has made an important contribution in her various roles.

“I have appreciated being able to call upon her advice and expertise, during a time of significant change, on a whole range of priority areas for the Government in education.

“I wish Karen all the best for the future, and a very happy retirement.”
