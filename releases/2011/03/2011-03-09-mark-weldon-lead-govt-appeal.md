Prime Minister John Key today announced Mark Weldon, Chief Executive of NZX, will spearhead the fundraising efforts of the Government’s Christchurch Earthquake Appeal.

“Mr Weldon has a wealth of experience both in New Zealand and overseas, and has the networks to enable the appeal to be a truly global one,” says Mr Key.

“I’m very pleased Mr Weldon has offered his expertise and donated his time to oversee the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal during its fundraising period.”

Mr Weldon will take a four- to six-week leave of absence from NZX in order to fulfil his role.
