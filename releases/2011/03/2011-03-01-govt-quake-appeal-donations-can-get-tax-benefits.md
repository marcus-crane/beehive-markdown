Revenue Minister Peter Dunne has confirmed that New Zealand donors to the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal announced by Prime Minister John Key on Sunday will be able to claim a tax credit or deduction on their donations.

He also said the fund would be treated as a tax-exempt entity.

“Many people are being very generous, from large businesses donating big sums through to individuals giving what they can and very generously,” Mr Dunne said.

“We want to encourage that by ensuring those donations can get a tax credit or tax deduction.  Every little bit helps” he said.

The Appeal has been designed to complement those already established, such as the funds organised by the Red Cross and the Salvation Army.

“Essentially, the Government has created the Appeal to work alongside these organisations to make sure the funds are used in the best possible way.

New Zealand government departments at home and around the world are also getting behind the Appeal.

“It will have a global reach, and with the support of New Zealand’s foreign missions it will be able to reach millions of people worldwide,” he said.

Mr Dunne also cautioned the public to “check the bona fides” of any cause or charity that they donate to, particularly at this time when scams have been created to prey on people’s kindness.

“It is important that people check that a charity that is collecting money is genuine. There are a few low-lifes who take disasters such as the Christchurch earthquake as an opportunity to make a fast and dishonest buck.

“Just take care with where you send your money,” Mr Dunne said.
