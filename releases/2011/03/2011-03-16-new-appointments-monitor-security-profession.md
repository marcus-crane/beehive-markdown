Associate Justice Minister Nathan Guy has announced the appointment of Roger Gill as the inaugural Private Security Personnel Licensing Authority, and Stevan Cole as his Deputy.

“The new position is responsible for the licensing and discipline of private security personnel, including bouncers and private investigators,” says Mr Guy.

“This will be an important and demanding job. The Ministry of Justice expects around 12,500 applications from current licensees and certificate holders, and 9,000 new applications for crowd controllers, who will be regulated for the first time.

“Licensing will involve a criminal background check on all applicants, and serious convictions for violence, drugs or dishonesty are likely to lead to disqualification. The Authority does, however, have some discretion.”

Mr Gill is a qualified lawyer and has 16 years experience as a Chief Executive of four national organisations, including the Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand and the New Zealand Stock Exchange. For the past 12 years Mr Gill was a Registrar and Manager of the Wellington High Court.

Stevan Cole, Barrister of Auckland has been appointed as the Deputy Private Security Personnel Licensing Authority. Mr Cole is a former police officer and has also worked as a Crown Prosecutor in Hong Kong and a Trial Attorney at The Hague.

“Mr Gill and Mr Cole bring a high level of legal and managerial skill to these positions,” says Mr Guy.

The Private Security Personnel and Private Investigators Act comes into force on 1 April 2011, and the Authority commences on the same date.
