The Hobsonville motorway projects (the SH18 Hobsonville Deviation and the SH16 Brigham Creek motorway extension) are on track to be finished and open for use in September – six months ahead of schedule.

Transport Minister Steven Joyce says the government's billion dollar boost to state highway funding over three years has provided a secure funding pipeline which has given contractors the confidence to continue investing in people and machinery and complete projects more quickly.

The Hobsonville motorway projects are part of the Western Ring Route - a 48 kilometre alternative to SH1 running between Manukau and Albany via State Highways 20, 16 and 18.

Mr Joyce says when complete, the $220 million project will, significantly reduce congestion in North-west Auckland and improve journey times between the West and the North Shore.

“The new road will also greatly improve road safety in the area by taking through traffic off the local roading network. The NZTA expects traffic on Hobsonville Road to reduce from 40,000 vehicles per day currently to 6,500 per day.”

"The news that the project is on track to be complete ahead of the Rugby World Cup is an added bonus."

NZTA is currently seeking planning permission and resource consents from a Board of Inquiry to complete the largest remaining piece of the Western Ring Route – the Waterview Connection and associated improvements to the Northwestern Motorway.
