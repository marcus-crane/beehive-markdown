Revenue Minister Peter Dunne announced today that Inland Revenue is taking the first steps towards implementing new business-to-business (B2B) technology that will help New Zealand businesses cut compliance costs and make it easier to manage their tax affairs.

“Last year we consulted with New Zealanders about using online services to make tax easier.

“From tomorrow, tax agents will have improved access to their clients’ key account information, via their tax management software packages” Mr Dunne said.

B2B uses software that ‘talks’ machine to machine (rather than people inputting data) and can transfer bulk information.

“Inland Revenue is working with software developers in providing this new B2B web service that will make life easier for businesses and agents. Business interested in this service should contact their tax agent or software provider,” he said.

Inland Revenue collaborated with Acclipse, Advanced Professional Solutions and MYOB on developing the service.

Mr Dunne said Inland Revenue is taking the first steps towards a full B2B channel with this web service that will initially allow tax agents to view their clients’ transactions and balances for most tax types each day.

“In the future businesses should be able to see immediately that their return has been filed or their refund credited, cutting out a lot of paperwork and waiting time.”

Over the next two years Inland Revenue plans to build on the initial capability and make further services available to businesses via the B2B channel.

“Inland Revenue already provides a very useful online service for individuals who can check their tax and whether they’re due a refund, update their details and make many payments online. Now businesses and their agents can expect further services through their own channel.”

Mr Dunne said the new service is the first step towards a future that will make it simpler for New Zealand businesses to manage their tax affairs and will help cut compliance costs.
