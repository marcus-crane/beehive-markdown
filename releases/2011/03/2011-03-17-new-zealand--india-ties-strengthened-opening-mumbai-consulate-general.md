New Zealand’s business, investment and tourism links with India will be strengthened by having a New Zealand Consulate General in Mumbai, says Immigration Minister Jonathan Coleman.

Dr Coleman, who officially opens the Mumbai office tomorrow (NZ time), says a Consulate General in India’s financial capital will help further develop business opportunities between New Zealand and India.

‘’The Consulate General with consular, trade, investment, tourism and visa functions will provide an enhanced service to growing business connections and the wider relationship between India and New Zealand,’’ Dr Coleman says.

‘’It is our first full Consulate General in India. It also symbolises the commitment of the New Zealand Government to deepening our existing warm and positive relationship with India.

‘’Trade between the two countries is continuing to increase and industries such export education and tourism can benefit from having closer connections with an Indian economy that has grown significantly over the past decade.’’

Trade between New Zealand and India is worth over NZ$1.2 billion a year and India is New Zealand’s eighth largest export market, up 16 places from three years ago when it was 24th. New Zealand is also looking to partner with India in key industries such as agricultural technology and the food supply chain, IT innovation, wood and green technologies.

The number of students from India has quadrupled in the past seven years with 9700 currently studying in New Zealand. India is New Zealand’s third largest source country for students behind China and South Korea in the $2 billion per annum export education industry.

The number of Indian holidaymakers visiting New Zealand has also tripled in the past 10 years with 14,100 touring here last year spending around $40 million.

‘’The Mumbai Consulate General is the first office in which we bring together all of our New Zealand Government agencies that previously had separate offices in Mumbai. We call it a “New Zealand Inc” approach to providing service to the Indian market – a one stop shop,’’ Dr Coleman says.

The Mumbai office houses New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, Tourism New Zealand and Immigration New Zealand.
