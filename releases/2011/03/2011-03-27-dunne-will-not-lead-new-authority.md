Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee today confirmed that New Zealand Customs chief executive Martyn Dunne will not be involved in the new government department that will manage the rebuilding and recovery of Canterbury following the February 22 earthquake.

Mr Brownlee said media speculation about Mr Dunne’s role had been premature; Mr Dunne had not been appointed interim chief executive of the department, though he had been doing some work for the State Services Commission to help with its establishment.

The new department’s structure would be announced in the next few days, Mr Brownlee said.

“I’d like to thank Martyn Dunne for the preparatory work he’s done in recent weeks and I wish him well in his new role as New Zealand’s High Commissioner to Australia,” Mr Brownlee said.

“We have said from the outset that this department must work in close collaboration with the Christchurch City Council and other community leaders.

“We have a responsibility to listen to the people of Canterbury and take them with us in the rebuilding of their region.

“I am confident the recovery structure the government will reveal in the next few days will meet those very important objectives.”
