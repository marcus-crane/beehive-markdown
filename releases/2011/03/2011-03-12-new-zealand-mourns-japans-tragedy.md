Prime Minister John Key says he has watched with horror at the scenes of devastation in the wake of the earthquake and tsunami that has struck Japan in the past few hours.

“Our hearts go out to the Japanese Government and its people.

“Japan responded to New Zealand’s own tragic earthquake with enormous support, and we are ready to help our friends in Japan at this time of need in whatever way we can.

“Our deepest sympathies are with those who have been caught up in this most terrible event."
