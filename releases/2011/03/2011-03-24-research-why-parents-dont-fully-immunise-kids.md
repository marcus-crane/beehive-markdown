Government-commissioned research into why parents and caregivers don't complete pre-school immunisations shows that, in most cases, these people aren't opposed to immunisation.

Health Minister, Tony Ryall was discussing the research and launching a new immunisation booklet at the Newtown Medical Centre today.

"We have already achieved record levels of immunisation for two year olds, with just over 88 per cent completing the schedule.

"The target by the middle of next year is 95 per cent, and we wanted to find out from parents and caregivers what we need to do to help achieve this."

Researchers found that in most cases, people aren't opposed to immunisation, but circumstances get in the way.

For example, if the child is ill when a vaccination is due, the appointment may be skipped.

Transport can be an issue particularly if the weather is not good, and some caregivers don't believe their children are at risk because they don't see the diseases in the community.

"Immunisation is an important and cost-effective public health programme.

"It provides not only individual protection, but also protection for the wider population by reducing the incidence of diseases, which stops them spreading to vulnerable people."

Effective immunisation initiatives have been pulled together in a new booklet that has been put together by the Ministry of Health and the National Health Board.

"Immunisation is a health targets success story. In 2007, the number of Kiwi children fully immunised by their second birthday was 73 per cent.

By the end of 2010, we have lifted that to just over 88 per cent.

"With a target of 95 per cent of all two years being fully immunised by July 2012, we're now looking at getting to those children and families who require a bit more effort," Mr Ryall said.

Better immunisation rates are also having other major benefits for children's health.

In the booklet, the target champion Dr Pat Tuohy explains: "Because children under two years of age and their families are now seeing primary health care services regularly for vaccinations, there are many more opportunities for a wider range of health care issues to be addressed.

"I think we are already seeing the impact of increased contact with general practice teams, with fewer hospitalisations for Maori and Pacific children for illnesses such as asthma, diabetes and pneumonia – all of which we know can be attributed to more frequent visits to general practices."

New Zealand's immunisation rates for children have been low for a long time, so it is pleasing to see such progress in this prevention programme."

The results add confidence to the view that children, from all backgrounds, are getting good access to GPs and primary care."

This booklet provides insights into the different ways that DHBs and immunisation providers have achieved their successes so far, and it's part of "sharing the knowledge" about how to improve services for patients.

The insights come from vaccinators all around the country, including the Canterbury, Counties-Manukau, Southern, West Coast, Hawke's Bay, and Capital and Coast DHB areas.

Based on the research and the immunisation target performance so far, the Ministry of Health is working to provide people with more information to support them to make a decision, and improve our immunisation rates even further.
