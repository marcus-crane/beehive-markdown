Education Minister Anne Tolley says over a quarter of schools in Christchurch City have now asked for support to re-open as soon as possible, following last week's earthquake.

“43 schools, more than double yesterday’s total, are determined to open for students as soon as they can, which is extremely encouraging,” says Mrs Tolley.

“These schools will receive all the support they need to provide a safe environment for students, so we can get young people back into learning.”

The Ministry of Education will work with the school board, Civil Defence, and other relevant authorities to determine when the schools can open. Schools are required to undertake a structural engineering report before re-opening.

“Plans are also well underway to provide an education for those students from the schools which have been worst-affected, and where possible we want to keep school communities together,” says Mrs Tolley.

“But given the size of this task, I encourage everyone involved to be flexible.

“Students and parents need certainty, and we are doing everything we can to provide that for them.

“In the meantime, 3759 students have enrolled in other schools around the country, and this continued support from principals and teachers outside Canterbury is greatly appreciated.”

Parents should go to the Ministry website at [www.minedu.govt.nz](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/) or contact their school for updates on re-opening.
