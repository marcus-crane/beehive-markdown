The Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Steven Joyce, has welcomed an announcement from Crown Fibre Holdings that it will commence negotiations with the Central Fibre Consortium for the provision of fibre infrastructure to 10 regional centres in the North Island.

The consortium consists of Unison Networks Limited, Counties Power Limited, Eastland Group Limited, Horizon Energy Distribution Limited and Centralines Limited, and covers 10 UFB candidate areas – Napier-Hastings, Palmerston North, Rotorua, Taupo, Pukekohe, Waiuku, Whakatane, Gisborne, Feilding and Masterton.

Mr Joyce says it’s great to see a large number of bidders stepping up to the mark.

“This ensures the Crown has competitive options that will deliver the best overall solution for taxpayers and consumers.”

In December, following successful negotiations, the government confirmed it was partnering with Northpower and UltraFast Fibre Limited to rollout out ultra fast broadband in Northland and in the central North Island – covering seven of the UFB candidate areas.

Information on the candidate areas and today’s announcement is available on the Crown Fibre Holdings website at [www.crownfibre.govt.nz](http://www.crownfibre.govt.nz/).
