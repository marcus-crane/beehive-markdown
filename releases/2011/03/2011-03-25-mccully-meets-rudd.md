Foreign Minister Murray McCully will host his Australian counterpart, Kevin Rudd, in Christchurch tonight and tomorrow for their twice-yearly meeting.

The Australian Foreign Minister will arrive in Christchurch this afternoon and spend time meeting with Australian personnel assisting with earthquake recovery and marking his respect for the victims of the earthquake.

The two foreign ministers will then hold formal talks in Christchurch on Saturday.

“We will discuss a range of bilateral, regional and global foreign policy issues, including recent events in the Middle East, and our ongoing cooperation in the Pacific and the wider Asia-Pacific region,” said Mr McCully.

“These talks also give me an opportunity to thank Mr Rudd in person for the tremendous support of the Australian government and the Australian people following the Christchurch earthquake.”

The talks follow the successful visit of Australian Prime Minister Gillard to New Zealand in February, and Prime Minister Gillard’s attendance, along with Governor-General Quentin Bryce and Leader of the Opposition Tony Abbott, at the Christchurch memorial service last week, in a warm demonstration of bi-partisan, trans-Tasman solidarity.

The last formal talks between Australian and New Zealand foreign ministers were held in November 2010 in Canberra.
