Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced that 19 schools in Christchurch City have indicated they want to re-open later this week or early next week, following the recent earthquake.

“It’s extremely heartening that these schools feel confident enough to re-open,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Many schools and ECE services sustained only minor damage. Those that believe they are in a position to re-open should seek support from the Ministry of Education. The Ministry will then work with the school board or ECE service, Civil Defence, and other relevant authorities to determine when they can open.

“Many schools have already begun the clean-up operation, and I want to thank Federated Farmers for their kind offer to go in and help schools over the next few days.

“Phillipstown School was the first to benefit from this today and I know the principal, who is determined to open for students as soon as possible, is extremely grateful for the assistance provided by farmers, students and local people.

“A number of options are being considered for the worst-affected schools, as we plan to get all students back into some form of education as soon as circumstances allow.

“This includes some students going off-site, schools splitting days on the same site, bringing in relocateable classrooms and providing relief teacher support where necessary.

“Meanwhile, 42 schools and 52 early childhood education services have now opened in the Selwyn and Waimakariri districts, with more to follow later in the week.”

Parents should contact their schools for more information on schools re-opening, or go to the Ministry website at [www.minedu.govt.nz](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/)

The Ministry also has Traumatic Incident teams on stand-by if schools require additional support.

“There have been generous offers of support from schools around New Zealand, and this is greatly appreciated,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Latest figures show that 2252 Christchurch students have been enrolled at schools around the country.

“This shows that parents want to get their children back into education, and we are doing everything we can to make sure Christchurch schools are up and running as quickly as we can.”

The Ministry website has been updated with information for parents on supporting children and their learning at home, at [www.minedu.govt.nz](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/).
