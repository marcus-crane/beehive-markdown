Acting Energy and Resources Minister Hekia Parata today acknowledged and thanked electricity, gas and fuel companies for the hard work and support they are providing to the people of Christchurch.

“Long hours, under difficult conditions, have gone into reconnecting Christchurch and ensuring people are safe.

“Many of those workers have their own homes and families to worry about, but they have still worked tirelessly for the greater good of Christchurch.

“Infrastructure services such as gas and electricity are the backbone of our cities and our day-to-day lives. The Christchurch earthquake has brought that into stark reality for the whole country.

“I understand that in addition to the hard work these companies are putting in to restoring vital infrastructure, several have made significant donations to relief funds, or have offered, for example, free gas through retail outlets.

“I also commend the companies that have frozen prices over coming months, and those electricity and gas companies that have deferred bill payments.

“On behalf of the government I would like to thank all those workers in the energy industry who have gone above and beyond the call of duty to help the people of Christchurch,” Ms Parata said.
