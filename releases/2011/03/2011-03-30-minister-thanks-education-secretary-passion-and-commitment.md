Associate Minister of Education Rodney Hide today thanked retiring Secretary for Education Karen Sewell for the enormous contribution she has made during the 45 years she has worked in the sector, and paid tribute to her dedication and commitment to the education of New Zealand children.

"In the short time that I have had the opportunity to work with Karen I have been able to see firsthand the commitment and passion that she has brought to the role of Secretary of Education," Mr Hide said.

"This has been particularly evident through her leadership of ‘Success for All - Every School, Every Child’; her support for Gifted and Talented education; and her leadership of the Ministry of Education's response to the Canterbury earthquake in February, which affected private and State schools alike.

"The Secretary for Education position is one that is both demanding and complex, requiring a considerable amount of energy and diplomacy.  I have been impressed by the composure, wisdom and humour that Karen has brought to the role.

"While Karen's presence at the Ministry of Education will be missed, I look forward to working with her until her retirement in July and wish her well in all her future endeavours,” Mr Hide said
