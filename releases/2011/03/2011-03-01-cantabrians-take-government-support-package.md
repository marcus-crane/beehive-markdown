The Government is assisting more than 10,000 people through its support package for Christchurch says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

"Since announcing the package yesterday, applications have been flooding in from employers and workers who are relieved support is now available to help get them through the next few weeks,” says Ms Bennett.

Earthquake Support Subsidy

• 1,718 employers covering 8,271 staff

• 1,516 sole traders

Job Loss Cover:

• 788 individual employees

“Our staff are working hard to get payments through as soon as possible, the first of which will be in banks by tomorrow,” says Ms Bennett.

Emergency Civil Defence payments continue to be made for essential needs like food, clothing, petrol and accommodation.

“To date we have paid more than four million dollars in emergency payments to people affected by the earthquake and in real need,” says Ms Bennett.

Eight Work and Income offices are open in Christchurch today and there are seven mobile vans travelling to hard hit areas, like the east of the city.

“We are doing whatever it takes to support those who need it and we’re committed to helping Christchurch get back on its feet,” says Ms Bennett.
