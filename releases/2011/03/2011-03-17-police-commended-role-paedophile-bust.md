Arrests in New Zealand as part of a major international paedophile bust shows how successfully New Zealand Police are working with overseas agencies to protect the most vulnerable in society, Police Minister Judith Collins said.

New Zealand Police have been working with international agencies since June 2009 to close down a major global paedophile ring which involved some New Zealanders.

Six people in New Zealand have been arrested. Five of those have already been convicted, with one still awaiting trial.

“This network, which spanned the world, collaborated in one of the most hideous of crimes – the abuse of innocent children and the trade in images of this sickening offending,” Ms Collins said.

“This operation shows the impact of Police and other agencies in New Zealand working with their counterparts overseas to protect children and bring paedophiles to justice.

“Dealing with those who prey on children is deeply distressing work, and I would like to thank and acknowledge Police for bringing their professionalism, skills and humanity to such vitally important work.”

Police said that as a result of this operation 16 children have been safeguarded and three have been saved from further offending after being identified in photographic evidence revealing New Zealand victims.
