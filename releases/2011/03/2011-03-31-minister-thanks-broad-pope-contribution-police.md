Police Minister Judith Collins today thanked two of the country’s top Police officers for their contribution to policing in New Zealand.

The terms of Police Commissioner Howard Broad and Deputy Commissioner – Operations, Rob Pope expire this week.

Mr Broad was appointed Commissioner in 2006. During his tenure he oversaw the rewriting of the Policing Act, the establishment of the Electronic Crime Laboratory and initiated the Policing Excellence programme which is ongoing.

Ms Collins said Mr Broad had brought strong strategic, organisational and technical knowledge to the role.

“He has been a driving force behind the modernisation of the New Zealand Police. Today, the New Zealand Police are better trained, better equipped and better able to tackle crime than at any other time."

Mr Pope was appointed Deputy Commissioner – operations in 2006, capping a 30-year Police career.

Mr Pope worked on dozens of high-profile cases, including the disappearance of Ben Smart and Olivia Hope, the murder of retired bank manager Dennis Hinds and the rape and murder of 78-year-old Christchurch woman Catherine Coster.

“As a detective Rob had a reputation for being meticulous, highly organised and with a vast knowledge of frontline policing. Those skills made him a very effective Deputy Commissioner," Ms Collins said.

“I would like to thank them both for their considerable contributions to law enforcement in New Zealand and wish them the very best for the future.”
