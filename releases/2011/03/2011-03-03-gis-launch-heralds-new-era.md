A new tool designed to give Māori land owners, judges, researchers, local government, and other interested users an unprecedented picture of freehold land was officially launched by Courts Minister, Georgina te Heuheu today.

"The launch of the Maori land Geographic Information System (GIS) Project heralds a new dawn in the history of Māori land management and utilisation," Mrs te Heuheu said.

"The system offers a "one-stop-shop" source of information to assist Māori locate their land interests and identify opportunities to improve its management and development."

"This is a far cry from the days gone by when Māori land owners would have to pore over heavily bound Court records to get the most basic information of their ownership," the Minister commented.

The new system will provide accurate geospatial information for Māori land blocks and be accessible through an internet portal to allow Māori land owners, and the wider public, to search and download information.

The portal provides a much greater range and level of detail than previously available and can also be viewed in Te Reo Māori.

The portal uses Google technology and information from LINZ to provide instant visual pictures and maps of the type and location of land which can then be used to compile reports.

"One of the many benefits is that the system has been future-proofed and designed so that it can be updated as technology advances, allowing the potential to add layers of information in the future," the Minister said.

"This capability will empower Māori land owners and enable them to engage in good decision-making, sound management and positive strategies to utilise and develop their land.

This is a significant benefit not just for themselves but for their communities and ultimately for the New Zealand economy.
