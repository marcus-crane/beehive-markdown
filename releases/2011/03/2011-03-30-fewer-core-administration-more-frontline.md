Minister of State Services Tony Ryall has today released the fourth six-monthly update on the government’s cap on core government administration numbers.

Latest figures from the State Services Commission show that as at 31 December 2010, the number of full-time equivalent positions in the core government administration has fallen by nearly 2,000 or around 5% over the last two years.

By contrast, there has been an increase in the number of full-time equivalent employees working in frontline roles in the past two years.

Mr Ryall says "We have more than 300 additional frontline Police officers, around 1600 extra teachers in our schools, over 1000 more nurses, and more than 500 extra doctors working in our public health service."

“The Government is determined to see better results from public services and expects that resources are shifted to the frontline services where they are needed most.

“We are focused on making sure New Zealanders receive improved frontline services like health, education and public safety, and this means we need to reduce administration overheads.

“Over the next few years New Zealanders should continue to see more back office savings initiatives and further reductions in staff numbers as government departments manage with little or no extra in baseline funding.

“In tight financial times taxpayers expect to see that resources are well managed and their money is being spent on improving the lives, health and well-being now and in the future.

"Like the rest of the world, New Zealand will continue to experience tight financial times for some years to come. The times call for conservatism and restraint. And this government will continue to call on the public sector to play its part."

The cap on core government administration was set at 38,859 full-time equivalent positions from December 2008. That number has dropped to 36,973 as of December 2010.
