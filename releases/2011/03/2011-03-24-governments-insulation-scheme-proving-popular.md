Another 2,583 New Zealand housholds have taken advantage of the Government’s home insulation and heating scheme in February, bringing the total to 91,506 households since July 2009, says Acting Minister of Energy and Resources Hekia Parata.

The Government is investing $347 million in Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart over four years to retrofit at least 188,000 homes. The scheme is part of a joint initiative with the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand.

“So many of our homes don’t have insulation or proper heating which is not good for people’s health or their power bills. The Government grant makes it easier for people to choose to invest in insulation, and get a warmer, drier and healthier home as a result,” says Ms Parata.

Anyone who has a home built before 2000 is eligible for 33 per cent off the cost of installing ceiling and under floor insulation up to a maximum of $1300. Community Service Card holders can get 60 per cent off the cost of installing insulation.

Ms Parata says the Government is also helping groups who need special assistance through a series of targeted projects, often with significant co-funding from other organisations.

“This year alone, organisations such as community groups, councils, private businesses, health boards and iwi have contributed an additional $15 million to the programme, targeting their funding to people on low incomes or those with specific needs.

“The additional third party funding means that some members of the community who often need it most can access the programme for free or at very little cost to them. ”

At the moment there are over 20 special projects being administered by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority under the programme including an initiative with local councils in Napier, Gisborne, Rotorua and Marlborough to install insulation in 250 council owned pensioner flats, and a project to insulate two CCS residential facilities in Otago.
