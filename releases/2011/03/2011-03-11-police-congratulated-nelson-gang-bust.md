A major organised crime bust in Nelson District, in which bomb-making equipment was seized, demonstrates the serious risk that gangs pose to the community, Police Minister Judith Collins said.

Ms Collins has congratulated Police and other agencies on the success of Operation Explorer which targeted the Red Devils, a puppet gang for the Hell’s Angels.

The operation was the culmination of 18 months of exhaustive investigations. At least 15 people from the wider Nelson region and Marlborough have been arrested. In addition to firearms, drugs and explosives, Police seized vehicles and motorcycles.

“This gang has described itself as a social club, but Police investigations revealed they were involved in serious criminal activity,” Ms Collins said. “Law-abiding social clubs don’t have bomb-making equipment, illegal drugs or firearms.

“The discovery of bomb-making equipment is of particular concern because it shows the extreme lengths organised crime will go to in protecting their drug businesses.

“Explosive devices are incredibly dangerous and indiscriminate, and present a serious risk to innocent members of the public. They will not be tolerated, and anyone caught building these devices can expect to be shown little mercy under the law.”

Today’s operation was a multi-agency exercise, involving around 240 staff from Police, NZ Defence Force, NZ Customs and the Organised and Financial Crime Agency New Zealand (OFCANZ).

“I would like to congratulate Police and the other agencies on their success,” Ms Collins said. “I’m confident today’s arrests will send a strong message to criminal gangs that the Government and Police will use every tool at their disposal to close them down.”

The Government has introduced a raft of new policies aimed at tackling criminal gangs and the drugs trade.

Last year Police and Customs seized 30.4 kg of methamphetamine, or “P”, an increase of 46 percent over 2009 when 20.8kg was seized.

In addition, $36.5 million in criminal assets have been seized under a tough new forfeiture law.
