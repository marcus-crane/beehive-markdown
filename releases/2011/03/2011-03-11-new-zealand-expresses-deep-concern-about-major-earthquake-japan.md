Foreign Minister Murray McCully has expressed deep concern and sympathy to the people of Japan following a major earthquake off the northeast coast of Japan.

The earthquake, measuring some 8.8 on the Richter scale, struck at 6.46 pm New Zealand time on Friday 11 March.

“All New Zealanders are concerned to learn of this major quake which has caused extensive damage. Our thoughts are with the people of Japan at this moment as they endeavour to respond to this disaster," Mr McCully said.

“Japan has stood by our side in our time of need in the weeks following our tragedy in Christchurch. Our hearts go out to our friends in Japan."

The New Zealand Embassy in Tokyo is checking the whereabouts and safety of New Zealanders thought to be in the four most affected prefectures of northeast Japan.

New Zealanders with concerns about family in Japan should try to contact them directly in the first instance. If they cannot make contact and they are known to be in the northeast of Japan they should contact the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade on 0800 432 111. If calling from overseas call +64 439 8000.
