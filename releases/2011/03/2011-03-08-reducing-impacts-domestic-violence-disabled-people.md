Disabled women may be at greater risk of domestic violence than other New Zealanders, says the Minister of Women’s Affairs Hon Hekia Parata.

Ms Parata was speaking at the launch of a booklet Domestic Violence and Disabled People in Auckland today, which is the centennial of International Women’s Day.

The Minister welcomed the booklet as a valuable resource which helps disabled people to be more aware of domestic violence, and provides practical advice on what to do about it.

"International research shows that women with disabilities are much more likely to suffer from domestic violence than other women.

"Given that in New Zealand the 2005 New Zealand Crime and Safety Survey (NZCASS), an estimated 30 percent of women in New Zealand as a whole had experienced partner violence in their lifetime, the figures for disabled women could be much higher."

It was important that disabled people had good resources to reduce the likelihood of domestic violence and to get appropriate help quickly if it happened, she said.

"I congratulate the Auckland Domestic Violence and Disability Group for identifying the need for better advice and the ‘It’s Not OK’ campaign of the Taskforce for Action on Violence within Families for funding it."

The booklet is also available on the ‘It’s Not OK’ campaign website ([www.areyouok.org.nz](http://www.areyouok.org.nz)).
