Social Development Minister Paula Bennett is delighted to join Auckland Mayor Len Brown in co-chairing the new Auckland Social Policy Forum.

The Forum, due to meet for the first time tomorrow, brings local and central government together to work on Auckland’s social issues collaboratively.

“I felt it was important to walk beside the new Auckland City Council and address social issues together, to make a real difference,” says Ms Bennett.

Minister Paula Bennett and Mayor Len Brown each appointed Forum members reflecting the broad range of skills needed to address diverse needs of a diverse city.

“It takes a combination of skills and experience to get the most positive social change and we certainly have that with this group,” says Ms Bennett.

The Forum will look at a range of issues including employment, child care, housing, community safety and protecting children.

“This is just a starting point, tomorrow the Forum members get their feet under the table and the work begins,” says Ms Bennett.
