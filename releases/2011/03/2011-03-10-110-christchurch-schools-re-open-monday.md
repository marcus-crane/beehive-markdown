Education Minister Anne Tolley says that 80 schools in Christchurch have now re-opened for students, with that number set to rise to at least 110 by the start of next week.

“This has been a marvellous effort by everyone involved,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Principals, teachers, parents and the Ministry have worked incredibly hard to re-open schools and get students back into education, and this fantastic progress is continuing at other schools.

“In addition, 165 ECE centres have now re-opened, with over 200 scheduled to be back up and running by Monday.

“For schools that can’t open in the short-term, alternative plans are being finalised, such as innovative site-sharing with other schools, and we are providing transport for students to attend their temporary school sites.

“The Ministry is offering support to schools by establishing distribution centres for learning resources and providing on-line teaching resources to assist teachers and parents.

“It is also bringing in experienced principals from outside the city to provide guidance to schools during this difficult time.

“I’ve been hugely impressed by the determination and can-do attitude from schools and parents.

“The future of education in Canterbury is secure and the contribution from local communities has played a huge part in that.”
