Transport Minister Steven Joyce says the release today of an evaluation of options for an additional Waitemata Harbour Crossing will help inform debate on the future shape of Auckland.

The evaluation report is the result of a request from the Minister last year for the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) to more closely examine the relative costs and benefits of tunnel and bridge crossings.

An additional harbour crossing will be needed within about 20 years to cater for increased growth.

Mr Joyce says the current and future Auckland Harbour crossings are essential transport infrastructure - providing a vital link between north and south, both physically and economically.

“Because of the importance of any new crossing, all stakeholders, including members of the public, must have access to solid information as they form opinions and consider options as to whether a bridge or tunnel is more appropriate, and when it should be built.

“While this report does not make a recommendation it does lay out the facts to date and considerations for both options.”

The report considers:

- Cost and funding options (between $3.9 billion for a bridge and $5.3 billion for tunnels in 2010 dollars)
- Benefit cost ratios
- Constructability, operability and consentability

Mr Joyce says the government has not formed a view on whether a tunnel or a bridge is most appropriate.

“Both the form of a third crossing and the timing of it will be part of the discussion around Auckland’s spatial plan.  This will likely be one of the biggest projects for Auckland over the next 20 years and it needs to be planned and sequenced carefully alongside other investments.

"It's my expectation that the third harbour crossing will increase the number of lanes across the harbour and also allow for public transport corridors and walking and cycling lanes," says Mr Joyce.
