Air Vice Marshal Peter Stockwell has been appointed Chief of Air Force, replacing Air Vice Marshal Graham Lintott.

“Air Vice Marshal Stockwell has proved himself a highly capable officer during his 38 years of Air Force service,” Defence Minister Wayne Mapp said, announcing the appointment today.

“He has successful command experience at every level and extensive operational experience. In 1995, he was awarded the Air Force Cross for his outstanding leadership as commanding officer of 40 Squadron at a high-tempo period for the squadron.

“He is a proven strategic thinker and has the leadership skills and experience to carry out the changes in the Air Force required by the ongoing implementation of the Defence White Paper.

“He is highly experienced in international relations and through the staff roles he has held in personnel and policy formation, he has gained an excellent grasp of the management requirements to make the necessary changes,” the Minister said.

Air Vice Marshal Stockwell, who is currently serving as Commander Joint Forces New Zealand at Trentham, will begin his three-year term on 1 May.

“I congratulate him on his appointment. He will make a valuable contribution at a crucial period for the Air Force, especially in the next two years as important new capability comes into service,” Dr Mapp said.
