Pacific students entrepreneurial success was a sign of the future make-up of the New Zealand economy, Pacific Island Affairs Minister Georgina te Heuheu said today.

Mrs te Heuheu was speaking at the launch of a new start-up fund to increase Pacific participation in the Lion Foundation’s Young Enterprise Scheme (YES).

“The spirit of enterprise and business is catching on among young Pacific people, and I am delighted to recognise and support this momentum”, Mrs te Heuheu said.

“Participation in the YES will equip more young Pacific people with business and entrepreneurial skills they can use to build better futures, and contribute to a growing economy”.

“Last year Pacific students at St Thomas of Canterbury showed what can be done with imagination, flair and good business practice, when they won the YES overall Company of the Year Award, taking the top prize ahead of colleges throughout the country.”

The St Thomas boys, trading under the name Oceanic Fusion in November 2010 won the Excellence in Pacific Business Award, which is funded by the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs. This year the Government is adding to that support with a modest seed fund to help more Pacific students take part in the Lion Foundation’s YES which fosters business skills, including financial literacy.

“The Pacific population is the fastest growing in New Zealand and is youthful. It’s imperative that Pacific college students are able to take their place in all sectors of the economy, including in business,” Mrs te Heuheu said.

“I am delighted to help set them on that path today.”
