Education Minister Anne Tolley says 143 Christchurch schools, 88 per cent of the total number, will have re-opened by the end of this week.

It is also expected that 234 early childhood education services, or 69 per cent, will be open.

“Schools and ECE services have worked incredibly hard to re-open,” says Mrs Tolley.

“This is great news for Christchurch parents, students and young children who want some kind of certainty and normality.

“A small number of schools still have issues such as building repairs and infrastructure to fix, and most of these should be open the following week.

“In the meantime, I’m pleased to say education plans are in place for these students.

“The Ministry has set up nine learning hubs around the city in school halls, managed by experienced principals and teachers. Year 1-8 students can attend, during normal school hours, and parents can also pick up learning resources for use at home.

“The learning hubs will be closely monitored to ensure they are meeting the needs of communities.”

The following school halls will be used:

- Sockburn Primary School
- Addington Primary School
- Somerfield School
- Waltham Primary School
- Paparoa School
- Windsor School
- St Albans Primary School
- Mairehau Primary School
- Cashmere Primary School

In addition, the Ministry is providing online teaching resources and lesson activities for all year levels, in both English and Māori medium at [www.minedu.govt.nz](http://www.minedu.govt.nz). These include specific activities for NCEA level 1, 2 and 3.

The Correspondence School has also made all of its resources available online to Christchurch students, without the need to enrol, at [www.correspondence.school.nz](http://www.correspondence.school.nz).

“Learning programmes are in place for all students,” says Mrs Tolley.

“We will continue to ensure schools and ECE services which are close to opening, or which are already up and running, have all the support they need.”
