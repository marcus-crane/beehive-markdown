Prime Minister John Key today congratulated National’s candidate, Jami-Lee Ross, on winning the Botany by-election.

“Mr Ross ran an excellent campaign and thoroughly deserves his victory,” says Mr Key.

“He has long been an advocate for Botany at a local government level, and I am sure his experience will stand him in good stead in Parliament.”

At the time results were announced, Mr Ross had captured around 55 per cent of the vote. Special votes are yet to be counted.

“I look forward to welcoming Mr Ross to caucus on Tuesday,” says Mr Key.
