ACC Associate Minister Hekia Parata will tomorrow launch a scooter safety campaign which aims to get young riders to cover up to reduce their risk of injury.

“A lot of young people are riding scooters wearing light clothing, such as teeshirts, shorts and jandals,” says Ms Parata. “This means if they come off their scooter, they’re likely to sustain significant injuries.”

The campaign, called “Add an extra layer”, will start in Auckland on Monday 14 March, then move through other cities with a high number of scooter-related ACC claims, including Palmerston North, Wellington and Hamilton. It will feature scooters clad in colourful fabric, which will be ridden around to promote key safety messages.

Ms Parata says the reason for the fabric on the scooters is to get across the message that wearing an extra layer can help reduce the severity of injury in a crash.

“Bare skin and tarseal aren’t a good mix. The message to riders will be to wear sneakers, not jandals; jeans instead of shorts; a jacket instead of a teeshirt; and gloves.”

According to ACC, simply wearing a jacket instead of a teeshirt can reduce the severity of injury in 75% of crashes. Scooter riders don’t need to buy expensive biker gear, but they should aim to cover as much bare skin as possible.

Ms Parata says the campaign is an important initiative given that scooter-related injuries are increasing.as more people are riding scooters.

“Scooter related claims and costs have increased more than six times over the last ten years. Last year, there were around 1000 new claims, and the total cost of support for injured scooter riders was $2.6 million. It’s in everyone’s interests, scooter riders and levy payers alike, to get the claims rate down.”

There will be a media opportunity at 1.10pm on Wednesday (March 9) in front of the TSB Arena, Jervois Quay, Wellington. Hon Hekia Parata will be present along with ACC staff who will be riding the scooters clad in fabric.
