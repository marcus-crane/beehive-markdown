Justice Minister Simon Power will tomorrow host a meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (SCAG) in Wellington.

The meeting, to take place at Parliament, will start at 1pm tomorrow and finish at noon on Saturday. Mr Power will host an official dinner tomorrow night.

SCAG is comprised of the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, its states and territories, and New Zealand's Minister of Justice. Norfolk Island has observer status at SCAG meetings.

SCAG provides a forum for Ministers to progress matters of mutual interest, and seeks to harmonise laws across jurisdictions, as well as simplifying legal transactions across state and trans-Tasman boundaries.

“With the meeting being held in Wellington it’s the perfect opportunity to update my Australian counterparts on our justice reforms including around legal aid and criminal procedure,” Mr Power said.

Ministers will also discuss the progress being made on implementation of the trans-Tasman treaty on court procedure.
