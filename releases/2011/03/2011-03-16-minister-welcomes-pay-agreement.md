Education Minister Anne Tolley has welcomed the decision by the secondary teachers’ union, PPTA, to agree a new pay settlement.

“This settlement, subject to ratification by members, is fantastic news for students, parents and schools,” says Mrs Tolley.

“It removes the threat of further industrial action, which has caused disruption for families.

“I also want to congratulate the bargaining team at the Ministry of Education and the union negotiators for all their efforts.

“Secondary schools will now be able to concentrate on lifting achievement and getting great results for our young people.”
