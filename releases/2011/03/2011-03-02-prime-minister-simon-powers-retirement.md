Prime Minister John Key today expressed his sadness at the news that senior Government Minister Simon Power will retire from politics at the election.

“Mr Power is an outstanding Minister and has played a key role in the National-led Government,” says Mr Key.

“He has also been an outstanding Member of Parliament, and representative for the people of Rangitikei, since his election in 1999.

“I am saddened that he will be retiring from politics at the election and he will be a great loss to National.

“Mr Power has worked extremely hard and has been completely on top of his many important portfolio responsibilities.

“I was informed of his decision on Sunday night. It has come as a complete surprise, as I’m sure it will to most people in the National Party and the Government.

“However, I accept his decision. Mr Power is hugely talented and has been dedicated to his political career. He is a loss to New Zealand politics, but I’m sure that he will continue to make an outstanding contribution to New Zealand in whatever he does next.

“Mr Power will continue in his portfolios until the election.”
