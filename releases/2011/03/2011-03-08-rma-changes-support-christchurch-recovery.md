The Government is streamlining the resource consent processes for land remediation works to enable homes to be rebuilt more quickly for Christchurch families hit by the 4 September and 22 February earthquakes, Environment Minister Nick Smith says.

“These are extraordinary circumstances that require extraordinary processes. There is no provision in any council’s plans for this sort of land remediation work. This is the worst liquefaction known anywhere in the world and poses huge challenges in the reconstruction of Christchurch as it cannot proceed until the land is made safe,” Dr Smith said.

“These new regulations enable resource consenting for this land remediation work to be fast-tracked. The normal process of public notification, hearings and appeals would delay the rebuilding of suburbs for months and potentially years. Instead, affected parties will have two weeks to provide written comments prior to councils making decisions. This minimum requirement for consultation can be extended if councils wish – although the Government’s priority is facilitating the rebuilding as quickly as possible.

“The sort of land remediation provided for includes stone piles and land compaction and vibration works that will stabilise liquefied land and provide greater protection from any future earthquakes. We are expecting the first applications for this work next week and therefore need to have the processes in place as soon as possible to ensure these consents can be advanced quickly and the work begun.”

These changes were approved today as Orders in Council under the Canterbury Earthquake Response and Recovery Act 2010.
