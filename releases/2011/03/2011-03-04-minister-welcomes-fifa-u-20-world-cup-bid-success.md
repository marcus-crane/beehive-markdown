Economic Development Minister David Carter has offered his congratulations to New Zealand Football for winning the rights to host the 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup.

“This is an exciting development for New Zealand and for New Zealand Football,” says Mr Carter. “Hosting rights for a FIFA tournament are hotly contested – both for the feast of exhilarating football on offer and also for the real economic and tourism benefits they bring to the host country.

“This announcement comes at a difficult time for New Zealand and is an example of how we must look for every opportunity to rebuild our economy.

“This is a clear vote of confidence from FIFA to entrust New Zealand with this major tournament, and I warmly congratulate New Zealand Football on their successful bid.”

The 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup is the second largest football tournament, after the senior men’s event.

New Zealand has a growing reputation as a successful host of major events, including the International Paralympics Committee World Athletics Championships 2011, FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup 2008, FIBA (International Basketball Federation) Under 19 Men’s World Championships 2009, Netball World Championships 2008 and the upcoming 2011 Rugby World Cup.

“The infrastructure and capability that we have in place to host the 2011 Rugby World Cup will hold us in good stead in 2015 to host this event”, Mr Carter says.
