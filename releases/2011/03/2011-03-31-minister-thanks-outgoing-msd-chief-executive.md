Social Development Minister Paula Bennett today paid tribute to departing Ministry of Social Development Chief Executive Peter Hughes.

“After a nearly a decade in the job Peter Hughes is moving on and I wish him all the best, he has done an outstanding job leading MSD,” says Ms Bennett.

"A job of this magnitude demands a long tenure and Peter Hughes absolutely gave it one hundred percent," says Ms Bennett.

Mr Hughes will remain in the role until September when his contract expires.

“Peter will leave the Ministry of Social Development in excellent shape and can be hugely proud of what’s been achieved in the social sector under his leadership,” says Ms Bennett.

Responsible for nearly 10,000 staff, the Ministry has successfully absorbed new functions, increased costs and delivery demands within its operating budget through an award winning Value for Money programme.

Peter Hughes has also taken a leadership role across the wider public sector.

He chairs the Victoria University's School of Government Advisory Board and sits on the boards of the Equal Employment Opportunities Trust and the Leadership Development Centre.

“Trans Tasman last year recognised those efforts in rating Peter Hughes as New Zealand’s best public sector Chief Executive,” says Ms Bennett.

“While I’m very sorry to see Peter moving on, I’m confident our search for a replacement will identify a leader that can build upon the successes achieved so far with the Ministry of Social Development,” says Paula Bennett.
