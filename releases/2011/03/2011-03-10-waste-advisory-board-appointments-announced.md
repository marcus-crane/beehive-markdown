Environment Minister Nick Smith today announced changes to the makeup of the Waste Advisory Board.

The eight-person board provides advice to the Minister for the Environment on issues relating to waste management and minimisation.

“I am pleased to welcome Gareth James to the Board. Mr James is an experienced engineer with more than 25 years experience in waste, both with local government and industry. He was instrumental in the development of the Kate Valley landfill in Canterbury and is involved in the recovery and recycling of waste materials across the South Island,” Dr Smith said.

“I am also pleased to reappoint board member Sheryl Stivens who has worked on community based waste minimisation projects for many years and has considerable skills and experience that I want to retain for the Board.”

Board members must have extensive experience in the waste sector and come from business, local government or community backgrounds.
