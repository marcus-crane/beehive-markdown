Over 8,500 applications have been made for earthquake support assistance covering more than 20,000 people says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

“Most applications are straight forward and over 14,000 people have already been approved,” says Ms Bennett.

“Some are taking a little longer because they require manual data matching with IRD or have exceptional circumstances that need to be considered,” says Ms Bennett.

Since Monday 10,533 staff, 2,559 sole traders and 987 individual employees have been approved for the Earthquake Support Subsidy and Job Loss Cover.

“Payments should be processed quickly and we are getting some good feedback from relieved employers,” says Ms Bennett.

Eight Work and Income offices are open around Christchurch today and

seven mobile vans are providing support to hard hit suburbs.

Since Monday mobile staff have helped 698 people with financial assistance in suburbs such as Aranui and New Brighton while giving advice and support to many others.

“It is good to know that these vans are on the road and getting help to people who are unable to travel to a Work and Income site,” says Ms Bennett.
