A provider of housing for low income families based in Nelson is set to benefit from the Government’s Housing Innovation Fund (HIF).

Housing Minister Phil Heatley has announced Habitat for Humanity will receive $240,000 from HIF ($168k as a term loan and a $72K grant) which it will supplement with $300,000 of its own money and resources to build two four-bedroom homes for families on low incomes.

A total of $20 million was set aside in the last budget for 2010/2011 for HIF and Maori Demonstration projects designed to deliver social, niche and affordable housing.

“The aim of HIF is to grow the supply of social housing. By working with third sector providers of social housing we can make Government money stretch much further,” says Mr Heatley.

“The $3 million already allocated to HIF projects this year will result in 26 new properties. This is an amazing return on the Government’s investment and is proof that this model of partnership delivers real benefits,” he said.

The first house has been completed and the building of the second house will commence shortly.

A further nine HIF projects and three Māori Demonstration Partnership projects are currently being developed into funding proposals. It is expected that these projects will be presented for approval by June this year.
