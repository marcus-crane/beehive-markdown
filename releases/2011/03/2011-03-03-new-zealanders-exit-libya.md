Foreign Minister Murray McCully today confirmed that New Zealand citizens who wanted to depart Libya had all exited with the help of our international partners.

"We thank our friends the British Government, the United States Government, the Irish Government, and the Canadian Government, who provided extraordinary assistance to help evacuate the remaining New Zealanders from Libya," says Mr McCully.

During the weekend (26-27 February) the remaining two New Zealanders departed Libya; one on a UK-charter flight to London, the other from Benghazi to Malta on the HMS Cumberland.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade have assisted 29 New Zealanders to depart Libya: five were evacuated to Malta by the British Government on HMS Cumberland; one took a United States-chartered ferry to Malta; two were evacuated on an Irish-charter flight to Ireland; three took advantage of British-chartered evacuation flights, and the remainder departed by commercial airline.

Four New Zealanders remain in Libya and have indicated that they currently do not wish to depart.
