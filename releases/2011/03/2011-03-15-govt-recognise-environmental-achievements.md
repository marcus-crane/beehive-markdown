Environment Minister Nick Smith today called for nominations for the 2011 Green Ribbon Awards which honour the outstanding contributions New Zealanders make in caring for the environment.

"It takes initiative and dedication to tackle environmental issues and I welcome the opportunity at the 21st Green Ribbon Awards to honour the people and organisations that are committed to protecting and improving New Zealand’s environment,” Dr Smith said.

“The Green Ribbon Awards are categorised into six areas of environmental endeavour and six different types of groups to recognise the different ways people contribute to the environment. There is also a supreme winner to recognise the best overall nomination.”

The six categories of endeavour are:

• Protecting our coasts and oceans

• Caring for our water

• Reducing our greenhouse gas emissions

• Minimising our waste

• Protecting our biodiversity

• Improving our air quality

The six categories of groups are:

• Small businesses making a difference

• Environment in the media

• Community action for the environment: volunteers and not-for-profit organisations

• Community action for the environment: Young people

• Environmentally responsible large organisations

• Central and local government stepping up

Nominations are open to all individuals, businesses, community organisations, media and public sector organisations that demonstrate visible results from their commitment to the environment. Nominations close on 15 April 2011 with winners announced on 9 June 2011. For more information and to access the Green Ribbon nomination form, visit www.mfe.govt.nz/green-ribbon.
