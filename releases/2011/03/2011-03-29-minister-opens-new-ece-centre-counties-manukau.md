Education Minister Anne Tolley says the opening of a new kindergarten in Counties Manukau means the National-led Government has now created 1198 early childhood education places in the area.

Mrs Tolley officially opened the Early Learning Counties Manukau Alfriston service today, which was built with $1.3 million of Government funding, and will offer fifty additional places for children.

“The Government has now created 27 ECE services in Counties Manukau, an area where children had few opportunities to participate in ECE in the past,” says Mrs Tolley.

“This new centre will give youngsters, especially Maori and Pasifika children, the best possible start to their education with high quality ECE.

“The Government is spending $1.4 billion on ECE this year, more than ever before, and our priority is to increase participation for children who have been missing out.

“Our targeted programmes will create an extra 3500 places for children in areas of greatest need. We know these children benefit the most from ECE, and we need to do all we can to make sure their families have access to quality services."
