New appointments to the positions of National Librarian and Chief Archivist have been welcomed by Nathan Guy, the Minister Responsible for both the National Library and Archives New Zealand.

“These are very important statutory positions and I’m pleased we have two high quality appointments,” says Mr Guy.

William (Bill) Macnaught will start as National Librarian on 2 May 2011. He is currently the manager of the Puke Ariki museum, library and visitor centre in New Plymouth, and has previously served as Director of Libraries and Arts at Gateshead Council in the UK. He was awarded a CBE in the UK for services to public libraries and cultural life.

Greg Goulding has formerly served as acting Chief Archivist and Chief Executive of Archives New Zealand. He has wide ranging experience in senior management roles at Archives, and led the development and implementation of the Public Records Act 2005. He starts his new role on 4 April 2011.

“I’ve worked closely with Mr Goulding over the last two years and I look forward to building on our strong working relationship. I’m also looking forward to working with Mr Macnaught in his new role.

“Archives New Zealand and the National Library are iconic institutions with exciting futures. Major priorities will include maximising the benefits of integration with the Department of Internal Affairs, and making greater use of technology to improve services and deliver more information online to New Zealanders.”

On February 1 Archives New Zealand and the National Library were integrated with the Department of Internal Affairs.
