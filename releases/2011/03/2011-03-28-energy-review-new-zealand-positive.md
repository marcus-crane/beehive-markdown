Acting Energy and Resources Minister Hekia Parata today confirmed New Zealand is making good progress towards implementing recommendations outlined in the International Energy Agency 2010 In-Depth Review of New Zealand’s Energy Policies.

The report was released by International Energy Agency (IEA) Executive Director Mr Nobuo Tanaka in Wellington today following a visit to New Zealand in December 2009 by a team of energy experts from Australia, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Canada, Norway, Netherlands, and the IEA’s headquarters in Paris.

“The IEA report noted that New Zealand 's strong energy markets have delivered a high level of energy security and economic prosperity for consumers,'' says Ms Parata.

The recently established Electricity Authority is an example of this. It was established to promote competition in, reliable supply by, and efficient operation of the electricity industry for the long-term benefit of consumers.

“The Government has also made progress implementing the Petroleum Action Plan to ensure we realise the full potential of New Zealand’s petroleum resources, and the Oil Emergency Response Strategy to ensure New Zealand is ready to respond to any future domestic disruptions to oil supplies.

As recommended by the IEA New Zealand will continue to work on recommendations around energy planning and efficiency.

“The Government’s home insulation programme Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart continues to contribute to energy efficiency goals. Since the programme began around 91,500 households have had heating or insulation retrofitted,” says Ms Parata.

Minister Parata and Mr Nobuo Tanaka will be available to discuss the report with the media in the Minister’s office, Level 6, Bowen House, Wellington, today at 3.25pm.

**Background**

The IEA, an intergovernmental organisation under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), reviews the energy policies of member countries every 4-5 years.

The last New Zealand review took place in 2006.

The report is an independent publication of the IEA. However, the IEA prefers to work collaboratively with member countries and has regularly sought (and received) input from New Zealand officials.

The current In-Depth Review began with a visit to New Zealand by a panel of energy experts from the IEA and IEA member countries in December 2009.

The report consists of nine chapters:

• general energy policy

• climate change

• energy efficiency

• renewable energy

• coal

• natural gas

• oil

• electricity

• energy technology research and development.
