Minister of Revenue Peter Dunne has welcomed the announcement yesterday by the Australian Government that Australian taxpayers can now make tax deductible donations directly to the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal.

“This is a very generous gesture from our friends in Australia. By making donations towards the Appeal tax deductible for Australian donors it recognises and encourages in a very practical way the significant contribution that people living in Australia are making towards our earthquake recovery efforts in Christchurch,” Mr Dunne said.

Donations made by Australians to the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal will be tax deductible in Australia for two years from yesterday.

Mr Dunne said the announcement from Australia was also an opportunity to personally thank everyone in Australia who had already generously donated towards helping the people of Christchurch deal with their immediate needs and the challenge of rebuilding their lives, homes and businesses.

“The Australian Government has also provided incredible support for the people of Christchurch through its teams of specialist personnel and police, defence airlift capacity and in its financial contributions. Yesterday’s announcement is another example of its generosity and a further demonstration of the close ties we share with Australia.”
