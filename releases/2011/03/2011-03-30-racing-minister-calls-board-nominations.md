Racing Minister John Carter has today invited nominations for appointment to the New Zealand Racing Board.

The opening of nominations is due to the expiration of a current board member’s term on 31 July 2011.

“The New Zealand Racing Board is responsible for the promotion, organisation and development of the racing industry, and also provides racing and sports betting services through the TAB,” Mr Carter says.

“It is necessary for nominees to have expertise in business, marketing and/or economics, as well as a good knowledge of the racing industry.

“Racing is a dynamic business that employs a significant number of people. However, it is not without challenges including attracting participation and competition for the discretionary dollar.

“The industry looks to the Board to lead and facilitate long-term planning that ensures its sustainability.”

Appointments are expected to be made for 1 August 2011. Nomination forms and further details about the board’s membership, functions and powers can be obtained from the Department of Internal Affairs website ([www.dia.govt.nz](http://www.dia.govt.nz)) or by phoning 04 494 0514.

The closing date for receipt of nominations is Thursday 21 April 2011.
