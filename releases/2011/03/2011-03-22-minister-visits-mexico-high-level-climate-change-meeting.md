Tim Groser, the Minister Responsible for International Climate Change Negotiations, will travel to Mexico from 22-25 March to attend a high-level Ministerial meeting on Implementing the Cancun Agreements, following the climate change summit hosted by Mexico in December 2010.

“I am pleased that the Mexican Government continues to show political leadership on climate change. Expectations for the Cancun Ministerial meeting were understandably very modest. Due to astute political management by the Mexican Government, Cancun succeeded in getting the negotiations back on track. At Cancun, I was invited to facilitate the negotiations on one of the key issues."

"The Mexican authorities are well aware that New Zealand has a more than respectable position on climate change and that we are ready to continue to work closely with them in whatever way we can”, Mr Groser said.

“Obviously, pressure is mounting to establish a comprehensive agreement to build on the Kyoto Protocol. There is no escaping the key issue - to broaden participation in any further round of emission cuts. I hope that this meeting will establish further momentum towards that objective.”

Mr Groser, in his role as Minister of Trade, will also take the opportunity to meet with New Zealand and Mexican companies with an interest in expanding the bilateral economic relationship. There will also be an opportunity for discussions with the Mexican Secretary of Agriculture, Francisco Mayorga, to follow-up on bilateral talks in New Zealand last year.

“Our relationship with Mexico is excellent. New Zealand and Mexico have a number of initiatives underway to expand our trade and economic linkages. I am pleased to be meeting with Secretary Mayorga to discuss ways in which we can build a closer economic relationship between our two countries.”

Mr Groser will also participate in a meeting to raise awareness of the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal, and to support the work of the Australia-New Zealand-Mexico Chamber of Commerce, which was re-launched in 2010.
