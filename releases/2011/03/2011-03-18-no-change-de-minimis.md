Customs Minister Maurice Williamson today announced that the de minimis level — the minimum amount of duty (including GST) which Customs collects — will remain at $60.

This means that if duty on imported goods, including GST, is less than $60, Customs will not collect it.

Given the current capabilities of Customs’ cargo reporting and revenue collection systems:

- a higher de minimis would decrease the amount of revenue collected by the Crown.
- there would be negative impacts on wider risk management (for example illicit drugs) if the present cargo reporting system for low value imports was extended for a higher level de minimis.
- a lower de minimis would increase compliance costs to importers and not produce a worthwhile increase in Crown revenue.

The de minimis will next be reviewed as part of the implementation of the Joint Border Management System.
