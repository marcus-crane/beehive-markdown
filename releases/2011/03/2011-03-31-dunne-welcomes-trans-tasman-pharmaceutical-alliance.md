Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne has welcomed the signing of the strategic alliance by the Pharmaceutical Society of New Zealand and the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia.

“The alliance will strengthen the professions of both countries and provide opportunities for greater leadership within the four areas it intends to focus on – policy, workforce planning, events and products,” Mr Dunne said.

“The signing of this alliance is a fantastic step for pharmacy in New Zealand and Australia and I expect that the knowledge gained through this will further develop the profession.

“I congratulate both parties on undertaking such a positive initiative”. Mr Dunne said.

The alliance was signed yesterday.
