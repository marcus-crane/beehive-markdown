The central Christchurch cordon put in place after the devastating 6.3 magnitude earthquake on 22 February is there to save lives, Civil Defence Minister John Carter said today.

“It is foolish to breach the cordon around the red zone. People died behind that cordon,” Mr Carter said.

“The destruction from the earthquake was extensive and left many buildings in an unsafe state. Civil Defence has been working tirelessly to get the area into a safe state.

“National Controller John Hamilton has advised the business community of plans to increase access for business owners into the red zone and he is working with the Canterbury Business Recovery group on that plan.

“Business owners need to exercise patience and consider their need to access their businesses, bearing in mind that in doing so without authorisation they may not only endanger their own lives, but also the lives of others.

“Safety is paramount and business owners will not be allowed into unsafe buildings.

“The National Controller is working on a plan to increase controlled and limited access to the red zone from Thursday this week.

“It is serious that people think they can storm or breach the cordon. They put lives at risk doing that and they will be prosecuted.”
