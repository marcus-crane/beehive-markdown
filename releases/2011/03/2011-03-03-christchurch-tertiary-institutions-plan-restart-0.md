Christchurch's two universities are well-advanced with their plans to re-open progressively following the February 22nd earthquake, says Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce who visited Christchurch again today.

Lincoln University will be open for all staff today, and postgraduate research students are being encouraged to begin contacting their supervisors. Lincoln aims to be fully operational by March 14.

Canterbury University has plans to restart progressively and is undertaking a number of measures to relieve pressure on the campus and the city in the short - medium term, including:

- some distance learning options,
- arranging for field trips to occur at the beginning of the semester,
- accepting an invitation from the University of Adelaide to accept some students for the first semester.

Mr Joyce says he is pleased to see both universities actively managing the situation and working to ensure minimal disruption to study.

"The situation for the Christchurch Polytechnic and Institute of Technology is more challenging given the bulk of its campus is within the cordon.

"Tertiary officials are working with CPIT as well as other institutes of technology and PTEs in the city on options, including relocating within the city and temporarily hosting courses at other institutions.

CPIT normally delivers a quarter of its EFTS at its Sullivan Avenue campus. Its expected that campus will be able to open shortly and they are looking at options to teach more students there.

The situation will continue to evolve and all students should first seek to maintain relationships with their current institutions.

"The institutions acknowledge that some students may wish to leave the city and they are working hard to ensure there are appropriate options for out-of-town study where required.

"The government has also relaxed enrolment caps at funded institutions outside of Christchurch to allow them to take on some students directly affected by the earthquake if required.

"I’ve also asked StudyLink to use their discretion to ensure enrolled students receiving student allowances or student loan living costs will continue to do so.
