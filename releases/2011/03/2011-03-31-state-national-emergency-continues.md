Civil Defence Minister John Carter has today extended the state of national emergency until 6 April, in the aftermath of the 6.3-magnitude earthquake that struck Christchurch on 22 February.

The state of national emergency in New Zealand - that applies specifically to Christchurch City - was declared on 23 February. Under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002 a state of national emergency can be declared for a maximum of seven days at a time only.

“There is still considerable work to be done in Christchurch that requires the powers the National Controller has to ensure the maximum possible coordination and cooperation between central and local resources to respond to this disaster," Mr Carter said.

“The response is of such a magnitude that the required civil defence emergency management is beyond the capacity of the regional civil defence emergency management group. In Christchurch there is strong support for the state of national emergency.

“The state of national emergency will not be lifted until I am satisfied that the situation has stabilised sufficiently that it is no longer required.

“Work remains focused on residents being adequately housed in safe and warm accommodation, with reliable access to water, functional sewerage disposal, electricity and communications.

“Civil Defence is aware of the importance of restoring business activity in Christchurch and is working with business owners and organisations on this.

“There is extensive damage in the cordoned off central business district, some of which is hard for people to fathom having not been able to see it.

“I have every confidence in the National Controller’s decisions around access to this area as I know his primary consideration is always public safety.”
