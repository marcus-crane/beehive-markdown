Civil Defence Minister John Carter has today extended the state of national emergency for a further seven days in the aftermath of the 6.3-magnitude earthquake that struck Christchurch last Tuesday.

The state of national emergency in New Zealand was declared last Wednesday and is expected to continue for several more weeks, Mr Carter says.

"This declaration ensures coordination and cooperation between central and local resources, and international assistance. Due to the scale of this disaster, the civil defence response is beyond the resources of the local authority," he says.

The declaration gives Civil Defence Emergency Management National Controller John Hamilton the authority to direct and coordinate resources. The Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002 requires the declaration to be renewed every seven days.

Mr Carter says the significant damage caused by the earthquake and the continuing aftershocks mean it is appropriate the state of national emergency continues.

The declaration covers Christchurch City only and does not have any direct impact on other areas of New Zealand.
