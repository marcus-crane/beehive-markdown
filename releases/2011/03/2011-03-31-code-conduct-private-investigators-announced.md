The Associate Minister of Justice Nathan Guy has unveiled a new code of conduct for private investigators that will apply from 1 April 2011.

“This new code will regulate licensed private investigators. It strikes the right balance between protecting privacy and allowing private investigators to do their job.

“Private investigators’ work has changed significantly over the years. Instead of mainly domestic issues, most work now focuses on alleged employee theft or insurance fraud. 

“The code replaces the current prohibition on private investigators taking photographs or other recordings of a person without their written consent. This is an outdated restriction which prevents investigators doing something which ordinary members of the public can do.

“The code will place tight restrictions on surveillance in certain locations. For example, a private investigator will not be able to take photographs or make other recordings of a person in a private home without the consent of the lawful occupants. 

“It also places restrictions on private investigators installing surveillance equipment on private property, vehicles or other personal items.

“A breach of this code is grounds for a complaint to the Licensing Authority. Sanctions will range in seriousness from a reprimand to suspending or cancelling a licence or certificate.

“A new investigation team within the Department of Internal Affairs will have a role in investigating complaints.

“The code of conduct does not limit or affect any other law, such as those around trespass. Existing laws apply to private investigators in the same way that they apply to ordinary people.”

The new code is made under the Private Security Personnel and Private Investigators Act 2010, and is available [here](http://www.justice.govt.nz/tribunals/private-security-personnel-licensing-authority).
