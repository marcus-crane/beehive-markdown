The Minister of Maori Affairs, Hon Dr Pita Sharples says the Government has welcomed the Maori Affairs Committee’s report on its inquiry into the Maori Community Development Act. 

“The Committee highlights the importance of engaging with Maori communities on issues relating to both the Maori Wardens and the New Zealand Maori Council,” Dr Sharples said. 

The Government’s response to the report was presented to Parliament today and says that Government will consult with Maori on specific options to improve arrangements for Maori Wardens; and on options for the future role of the New Zealand Maori Council and its subsidiary bodies.

The Maori Affairs’ Committee concluded its inquiry into the operation of the Maori Community Development Act 1962 in late 2010.  In its report, the Committee recommended a range of changes. These included re-evaluating the role of the New Zealand Maori Council, and a variety of reforms intended to improve the governance of Maori Wardens.  It also recommended that the Government undertake comprehensive consultation with Maori before any changes were made to the Act. 

“The New Zealand Maori Council has a proud history of speaking for Maori”, Dr Sharples said.  “The world has changed a great deal since the Act was passed nearly 50 years ago.  We need to ask Maori about options for the future”.

Dr Sharples said that the work of Maori Wardens as community volunteers was widely recognised.  “We need to make sure the right arrangements are in place to support the mahi these people do to strengthen our communities”.

Dr Sharples said the Government is working to develop options, and will then consult with Māori on the way forward.
