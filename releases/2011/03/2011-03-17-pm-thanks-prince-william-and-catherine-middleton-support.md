Prime Minister John Key today thanked Prince William and Miss Catherine Middleton for their generous support for Christchurch and the West Coast following the tragic events in those areas.

“Prince William’s visit to New Zealand to meet with the families of those lost in November’s Pike River Mine tragedy, and to attend the Christchurch Earthquake Memorial Service, is hugely appreciated by New Zealanders.

“The Prince’s support for New Zealand at this time underscores his commitment to the country and I am very pleased to be hosting him for his visit.”

Mr Key also welcomed the news of the Prince’s and Catherine Middleton’s decision to nominate the Government’s Christchurch Earthquake Appeal as one of a small group of charities to be included in their Royal Wedding charity gift fund.

“Prince William and Miss Middleton have chosen charities focusing on issues which matter deeply to them and, in the case of the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal, a charity which reflects the couple's close ties to and affection for New Zealand,” says Mr Key.

Prince William and Miss Middleton have asked that anyone wishing to give the couple a wedding gift consider instead donating to one of the nominated charities.

“I believe it’s a mark of great respect for New Zealand that the couple have nominated the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal as one of those charities,” says Mr Key.
