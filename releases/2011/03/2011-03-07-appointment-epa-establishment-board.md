Minister for the Environment, Nick Smith today announced the members of a four-strong Establishment Board tasked with ensuring the new Environmental Protection Authority is ready for business on 1 July.

“The Environmental Protection Authority has been established to strengthen and improve New Zealand’s environmental management. It will be an independent Crown agent at arms length from the Government with its own board of directors. The role of the Establishment Board is to start the recruitment process for a chief executive for the EPA, and give consideration to appointments to and terms of reference for the Māori Advisory Committee and Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Committee,” Dr Smith said.

The Establishment Board will be chaired by former Wellington Mayor Kerry Prendergast. The other members include Richard Woods, Chair of the Environmental Risk Management Authority; Dr Keith Turner, former Chief Executive of Meridian Energy; and Anake Goodall, retiring Chief Executive of Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu.

“This group has a high calibre of skills and experience in organisational governance, management, central government processes, and an understanding of the environment – and its links to the economy – which are all essential in giving the EPA a sound start,” Dr Smith said.

In November last year the Government introduced legislation to establish the EPA as a Crown entity. It passed its first reading unanimously and is currently before the Local Government and Environment Committee. That committee is due to report back to Parliament by the end of this month.

No presumption should be made that the Establishment Board is to form the new authority. Dr Turner has specifically only made himself available for this establishment phase.

“This is a further step along the Government’s environmental reform programme of providing stronger central Government leadership and establishing the new Environmental Protection Authority.”
