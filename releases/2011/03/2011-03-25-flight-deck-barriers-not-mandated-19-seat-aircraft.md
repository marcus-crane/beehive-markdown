The government will not be requiring flight deck barriers for small commuter aircraft, says Transport Minister Steven Joyce.

In May 2009, the government mandated strengthened flight deck barriers on aircraft with more than 30 seats, and has since been investigating the feasibility of barriers for 19 seat aircraft.

“While it is technically possible for a barrier to be installed on 19 seat aircraft, it would add to the cost of flying to provincial destinations, and likely be cost-prohibitive for operators of small commuter fleets”, says Mr Joyce.

“Officials were unable to find any example of other countries that required flight deck barriers for that size of aircraft.”

Mr Joyce says the installation of strengthened flight deck barriers on aircraft of more than 30 seats is progressing well.

“Strengthened flight deck barriers have been introduced so far for about half the number of domestic aircraft with more than thirty seats. Once this task is completed next year over 92% of passengers on all scheduled domestic air services in New Zealand will be travelling on aircraft with strengthened cockpit doors.

“Security committees are also now in place in nineteen regional airports and they are in the process of enhancing security training and education standards for airport and airline staff.”

The moves to tighten aircraft security arose from a review of domestic aviation security undertaken following an attempted hijacking of an aircraft in February 2008.
