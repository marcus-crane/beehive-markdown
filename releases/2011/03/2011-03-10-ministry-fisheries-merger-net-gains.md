Fisheries Minister Phil Heatley says merging the Ministry of Fisheries (MOF) with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will net gains for both Ministries.

"During my time as Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture I have been very impressed with the Ministry’s commitment to managing and improving the performance of competing interests in our coastal waters," says Mr Heatley.

"New Zealand’s international reputation as a high performer when it comes to fisheries management is, I believe, in no small part thanks to the passion and commitment of the Ministry and those who work for it. The Ministry has effectively promoted a sustainable fishing and aquaculture industry while balancing the needs of recreational, commercial and iwi fishers," says Mr Heatley.

"Not only will the merger announced today by State Services Minister Tony Ryall, lower the delivery cost of two key government services, but grouping together these key primary-production focussed units will create an agency with greater capacity and capability.

"As Minister of Fisheries I look forward to continuing my close affiliation with the, recreational, commercial, customary and aquaculture fishing sectors," Mr Heatley said.
