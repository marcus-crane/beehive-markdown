Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced that more than 100 Christchurch schools have now set dates for re-opening, including 21 which are already open again for students.

88 early childhood education centres have now re-opened, with 135 expected to open their doors by the end of the week.

“I want to thank everyone involved for their determination in getting schools and ECE centres up and running as soon as possible for students and young children,” says Mrs Tolley.

“It’s extremely important that we get our students back into education as soon as we can, bringing them and their families some kind of normality and routine.

“I can also confirm that we are making an estimated $20 million in additional funding available to schools and ECE services affected by the disaster.

“Schools and ECE centres in Christchurch are continuing to receive full funding, despite temporary closure or roll drops caused by the recent earthquake, as they need financial certainty at this difficult time.

“In effect, we are double-funding these students and young children. Schools and ECE centres outside the city, which have enrolled young people from Christchurch, are receiving additional funding.

“We are also providing relief teachers where required in Christchurch, and additional teachers to support Christchurch students at schools around the country.

“Students from badly-damaged schools in Christchurch, which will be sharing other school sites, will require transport and we are ensuring resources are available for this.

“The flexibility and positive attitude of everyone involved is extremely heartening, and the Government is doing all it can to support education for Christchurch students and younger children.

“In the meantime, I’m pleased to say that the Correspondence School has made all of its resources available online to Christchurch students, without the need to enrol, at [www.correspondence.school.nz](http://www.correspondence.school.nz)

The Ministry website at [www.minedu.govt.nz](http://www.minedu.govt.nz) has the latest information available on schools re-opening, as well as information for parents who want to help their child’s learning at home.

Parents should also contact their school or visit their school website.
