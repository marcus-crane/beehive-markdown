Strong hydro inflows and generation from new wind and geothermal sources has resulted in the highest level ever of annual renewable electricity generation, Acting Minister for Energy and Resources Hekia Parata said today.

“Over 32,000 gigawatt hours of electricity was produced from renewable sources in 2010 which is the highest level ever. This represents over 74 percent of all electricity generated in 2010 – a level we have not seen for 12 years.

“Generating more of New Zealand’s electricity from renewable sources will help us meet demand and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions,’’ says Ms Parata.

Data on the supply of major fuels, electricity generation and greenhouse gas emissions and the prices to the end of December 2010, is available in the latest edition of the New Zealand Energy Quarterly, published by the Ministry of Economic Development today.

Other highlights include:

- **Lowest quarterly electricity generation emissions in seven years**. The high level of renewable electricity generation this quarter led to less reliance on thermal electricity generation sources and a decrease in electricity generation emissions.
- **Diesel demand returns to pre-recession levels**. Diesel demand bounced back this quarter to a level not seen since June 2008.
- **Highest annual gas production in eight years**. Production from the Kupe field saw total production at its highest level since 2002.

The New Zealand Energy Quarterly is one of a number of energy publications produced by the Ministry of Economic Development.
