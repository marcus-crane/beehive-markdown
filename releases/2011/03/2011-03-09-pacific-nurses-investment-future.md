The introduction of a new nursing degree which incorporates Pacific values to complement clinical capability was an investment in the wellbeing of Pacific communities, Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, Hon Georgina te Heuheu said today.

Mrs te Heuheu was speaking at the launch of the Manukau Institute of Technology’s (MIT’s) Bachelor of Nursing Pacific programme in Auckland.

“I welcome the launch of this degree programme, as Pacific health workforce development is also a Government priority.”

“Growing the Pacific health workforce is a key element in lifting Pacific health status.”

Mrs te Heuheu said with Pacific people experiencing lower health outcomes in comparison with other parts of the population, it made good sense to ensure that access to appropriate health services was part of Government planning. Access was enhanced by a workforce skilled in both clinical capability and cultural sensitivity.

Mrs te Heuheu congratulated MIT for its foresight is recognising the importance of developing a programme that had been specially designed to meet the needs of the local community.

This was the first programme of its type in the Auckland region, although Whitireia Polytech in Wellington has a similar course and will continue to work with MIT.

“This augers well for better health outcomes for Pacific families in Auckland”, Mrs te Heuheu said.
