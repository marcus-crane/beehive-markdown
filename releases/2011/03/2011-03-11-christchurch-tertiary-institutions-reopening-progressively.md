The Minister for Tertiary Education, Steven Joyce, is asking students and trainees enrolled with tertiary education institutions in Christchurch to keep in touch with their providers to ensure they are abreast of reopening plans.

He says the city’s larger publicly funded institutions, which have all been closed since the February 22 earthquake, will all start to open their doors again to students next week.

Lincoln, which sustained little significant damage from the February earthquake, is planning to reopen to all students for semester one on Monday (14 March).

Student exchange programmes have been established between the University of Canterbury and five New Zealand universities, and around 300 students have applied for this option.

More than 160 first year students from the university have commenced a first semester exchange at the University of Adelaide. The Christchurch campus will progressively reopen from next Monday.

Otago University, which has a large medical campus in Christchurch, will progressively reopen from Monday – largely from alternative sites.

Christchurch Polytech Institute of Technology, which has its main campus within the cordoned off area, will also begin to restart courses next week. The Sullivan Avenue Campus will from Monday start trade programmes as well as International English and Te Puna Wanaka.

Mr Joyce says students at these institutions should monitor websites to ensure they know what’s happening and what it means for them.

There are 122 registered Private Training Establishments (PTEs) in Christchurch, 49 of them have reopened to date.

Mr Joyce says many PTEs are still unable to operate from their buildings or do not have a detailed understanding of their students’ plans.

“That’s why we’re now asking those students, along with Christchurch-based trainees from industry training organisations, to contact their providers to confirm that they are safe and to get the most up to date information about when, where and how studies will get back to business as usual.”

“The staff of institutions in Christchurch have done a fantastic job, often in difficult personal circumstances, to plan for the start up of their organisations and I want to acknowledge that.”

Because many of the smaller organisations are unable to operate from their head offices, the TEC website has a list of updated phone numbers and email addresses for private education organisations in Christchurch. These are also available from the TEC Service Centre on 0800 601 301 or [servicecentre@tec.govt.nz](mailto:servicecentre@tec.govt.nz).

“I understand that decisions about study may not be front of mind for many in Christchurch, but PTEs, community providers and ITOs have indicated to us they are at a point where they can start to plan their next moves, and it is important that students get in touch with their providers to explore their options,” says Mr Joyce.
