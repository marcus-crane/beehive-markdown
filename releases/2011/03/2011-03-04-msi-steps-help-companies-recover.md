Minister of Science and Innovation Wayne Mapp visited Christchurch Ministry staff yesterday in rented space at the Russley Golf Club.

The Ministry’s Christchurch office is in the CBD and unlikely to be available for some time. Long-term temporary accommodation is being sought.

“It was a great relief to hear that staff are safe. They are now focused on formulating a plan to support business and help the city recover from the blow it has received,” the Minister said.

“I am very impressed with the way our people there have stepped up despite the personal issues that they are all facing.

“They have moved very quickly to provide support for Christchurch companies. They have already been in touch with a large number of firms to determine how they have been affected by the earthquake and how the Ministry can best organise its support for them and its response to the situation.

“This work will complement ongoing work with regional partners and other local government agencies.

“MSI’s business priority now is working with companies for the recovery of Christchurch and maintaining the city as one of the leading New Zealand centres for high-tech industry and innovation,” he said.
