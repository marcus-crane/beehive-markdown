Superintendent Mike Bush has been appointed Deputy Commissioner of Police - Operations, Police Minister Judith Collins announced today.

The appointment will be for a five-year term which commences on 3 April 2011. The Governor-General made the appointment on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.

Mr Bush will work alongside the new Police Commissioner Peter Marshall, who takes over the role on 4 April, and Deputy Commissioner - Resource Management, Viv Rickard.

Mr Bush has been the District Commander for the Counties-Manukau Police District since September 2008. He succeeds Deputy Commissioner Rob Pope whose five-year term expires on 3 April.

Mr Bush has held a wide range of command and operational positions within the New Zealand Police. He graduated from the Police College in 1978 and served in Kaitaia, then Auckland.

In 1995 he was the officer in charge of Interpol at Police National Headquarters in Wellington before being appointed Officer in Charge of the North Shore CIB, and later Crime Manager of Bay of Plenty District.

Between 2003 and 2007 he served as New Zealand Police Liaison Officer for South East Asia, based in Bangkok. Prior to becoming District Commander for Counties-Manukau he was Crime Services Manager for Waitemata District.

“Mr Bush is a very experienced Police officer who brings 33 years’ experience in the New Zealand Police to this extremely important position,” Ms Collins said.

“The Prime Minister and I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him all the best in his new position. I look forward to working with him.”
