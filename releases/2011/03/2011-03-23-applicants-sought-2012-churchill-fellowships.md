Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Tariana Turia is inviting New Zealanders wishing to undertake research overseas to apply for a fellowship from the New Zealand Winston Churchill Memorial Trust.

“Churchill Fellowships enable New Zealanders to benefit their communities by undertaking research overseas and bringing that international knowledge back home,” says Mrs Turia.

“I am particularly keen to see more Maori and Pasifika people apply.”

Fellows are granted up to 80 per cent of their travel costs and can spend between three weeks and three months overseas. The average grant is between $5000 and$7000.

Fellows approved during the 2010/11 financial year are conducting research in the fields of education, social welfare, health, conservation, technology and the arts, including:

• Mason Tolerton, who will research the ‘Raven Aboriginal Youth Employment Programme’ in Canada and its relevance to Māori youth in New Zealand.

• Rodney Bell, who will investigate a range of youth programmes in the United Kingdom and the United States, aimed at reducing the numbers of young people becoming victims or offenders of crime.

• Rachel Teulon, who will travel to the United Kingdom to research paediatric palliative care for children with life limiting illnesses in order to identify ways to improve outcomes for them and their families.

Winston Churchill Memorial Trusts also operate in the United Kingdom and Australia.

Applications close on 31 July 2011. Successful applicants will be announced in December 2011.
