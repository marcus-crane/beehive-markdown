Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says Coca-Cola Amatil New Zealand’s announcement today that it will build a $15 million state-of-the-art bottling plant in Christchurch makes an important statement about the city’s future.

"The clear message from Coca-Cola is it believes Christchurch will maintain its role as the South Island’s economic powerhouse.

"Such a significant show of confidence in Christchurch so soon after the 22 February quake is great news for the local workforce and an important signal to other businesses in the region," Mr Brownlee said.

Last week the government announced an initial $6.85 million package to help Canterbury businesses affected by the quake get back on their feet, and ASB generously pledged $250 million of support to stimulate the Christchurch economy.

"Early reports are that both the funds and services made available are being well utilised, and I'd encourage businesspeople to investigate all options to hasten the path back to normal trading," Mr Brownlee said.

The government is working in partnership with Recover Canterbury, a joint venture between the Canterbury Employers' Chamber of Commerce and Canterbury Development Corporation.
