Prime Minister John Key is welcoming the news that Prince William is taking time to visit the people of Christchurch as they cope with the tragic aftermath of the February 22 earthquake.

St James’s Palace has announced that Prince William, on behalf of The Queen, will attend the National Memorial Service at North Hagley Park on 18 March. He will also visit Greymouth to speak to the families of the Pike River Mine disaster.

“This is a heart-warming gesture that will mean a lot to the thousands of people whose lives have been forever changed by these events.

“I would like to personally thank The Queen for thinking of New Zealand in its darkest hours and very much look forward to seeing Prince William again, even though it is in very sad circumstances.”

Prince William will be in New Zealand on March 17 and 18 before flying to Australia on March 19 where he will visit areas affected by Queensland’s cyclone and flooding.

Prince William’s itinerary will be released closer to the time of the visit.
