Transport Minister Steven Joyce has today officially opened two major new roading projects on the East Coast – the Hawkes Bay Expressway Southern Extension on SH50A and the Matahorua Gorge realignment on SH2 between Gisborne and Hawke’s Bay.

The projects were both accelerated in 2009 as part of the government’s $500 million jobs and growth plan which was designed to provide a short term economic boost through job creation and support longer term growth by providing an infrastructure upgrade.

The Hawke's Bay Expressway southern extension runs between Hastings City and Flaxmere, providing a direct link between the roundabouts at Longlands Road and York Road.

”It will remove a very significant bottleneck and crash black spot, providing a safer, more direct route for highway traffic, freeing up local roads and providing a long-term, sustainable solution which will support future growth in the region,” says Mr Joyce.

At its peak the $12 million expressway project employed more than 30 people, with more involved in supplying materials and providing supporting services.

The $30 million Matahora Gorge realignment employed a further 100 people.

Mr Joyce says the project will improve safety by realigning a very narrow and winding 4.5 kilometre section of road which is heavily trafficked by freight, particularly logging trucks.

“This work will result in improved visibility and increased road widths, which will bring real benefits in terms of safety, efficiency and reliability. It will also have the effect of bringing Napier and Gisborne closer together.

“The completion of these two projects is very significant for the East Coast and I am pleased that the government has been able to make them happen sooner than expected.”
