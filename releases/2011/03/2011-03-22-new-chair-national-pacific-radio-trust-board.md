Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman today announced the appointment of Uluomatootua Saulaulu Aiono as chair of the National Pacific Radio Trust (NPRT) board.

Mr Aiono, an Auckland businessman, chairs the Pacific Island Chamber of Commerce and is a council member of the Auckland University of Technology. He is also a member of the Auckland Regional Economic Development Forum. Mr Aiono was appointed NPRT chair for two and a half years.

”Ulu Aiono’s breadth of experience in the information technology and business world will add a valuable perspective to the board,” Dr Coleman says.

“His personal involvement with the Pacific community at many levels will ensure that the broadcaster remains in close touch with its audience.”

The NPRT is responsible for maintaining the national Pacific radio network which includes Radio 531pi and the Niu FM radio network.

Dr Coleman also acknowledged the work of Wellington broadcaster and outgoing chair Fa’amatuainu Tino Pereira, who has been a member of the Trust since its establishment in 2002, and chair for the last three years.
