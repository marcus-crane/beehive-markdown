The Minister of Foreign Affairs today lent New Zealand's support to military steps to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1973, which demanded an immediate and complete ceasefire in Libya.

"Gadaffi has been responsible for brutal acts of violence against the Libyan people," said Mr McCully.

"We fully understand the reasons why military actions have been undertaken to secure Libyan compliance with the terms of the resolution.”

"The message behind the Security Council was clear; accept a ceasefire and desist from acts of brutality against the Libyan people or there would be international intervention."

"The Paris Summit, comprising of representatives of the Arab Leaque, France, UK, USA and Canada overnight sent a clear message to Gadaffi that in the absence of a ceasefire these countries would take action consistent with Security Council Resolution 1973."

"Instead Gadaffi has ignored the warning and intensified attacks against the Libyan people," said the Minister.

"The New Zealand government calls on the Gadaffi regime to fully comply with the terms of Security Council Resolution 1973, and implement the ceasefire," he said.

The Foreign Minister also confirmed today a number of New Zealand citizens had departed Libya during recent weeks.

MFAT helped 29 New Zealanders leave: five were evacuated to Malta by the British Government on HMS Cumberland; one took a United States-hartered ferry to Malta; two were evacuated on an Irish-charter flight to Ireland; three took advantage of British-chartered evacuation flights, and the remainder departed by commercial airline.

"We are very grateful to our friends who assisted the departure of New Zealand citizens under difficult conditions, said Mr McCully.

During the weekend (26-27 February) the remaining two New Zealanders departed Libya; one on a UK-charter flight to London, the other from Benghazi to Malta on the HMS Cumberland.

At present there appears to be four New Zealanders remaining in Libya who indicated that they did do not wish to depart.
