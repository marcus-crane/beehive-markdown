ACC Minister Nick Smith today welcomed the conviction of ACC’s former national property manager Malcolm Mason on corruption and bribery charges.

“It is extremely serious when we have a senior public servant taking bribes and compromising the integrity of state purchasing,” Dr Smith said. “The victims of Mr Mason’s corruption are all New Zealanders who pay ACC levies, other businesses that missed out on work because of his corrupt acts, and public servants who do their jobs with honesty and integrity.

“These convictions arose from inquiries I initiated in 2008. People in the real estate and building industries had raised concerns with me about the cost of ACC’s property deals. A subsequent review revealed the criminal dealings of the national property manager.

“I congratulate the Serious Fraud Office on securing this conviction. We need to send a very clear message to those entrusted with public money and those who contract services to the Government that there is a zero tolerance for dishonest, corrupt and fraudulent behaviour.”
