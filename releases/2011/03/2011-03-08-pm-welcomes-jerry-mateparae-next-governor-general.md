Prime Minister John Key today welcomed the announcement that the Queen has approved the appointment of Lieutenant General Jerry Mateparae to succeed Sir Anand Satyanand as Governor-General of New Zealand.

“Lieutenant General Jerry Mateparae is a highly regarded leader with a distinguished 38-year military career. He joined the New Zealand Army in 1972, and rose through the ranks, serving and commanding in a wide variety of roles,” says Mr Key.

“This culminated in his appointment as Chief of Defence Force in 2006. He is currently the director of the Government Communications Security Bureau.

“Jerry will be New Zealand’s 20th Governor-General. I believe he will bring great mana and a wide range of qualities to this role, including judgement, energy and an enthusiasm for encouraging excellence in others.

“As Governor-General, he will have the opportunity to work with a wide range of New Zealanders and develop an active programme in the community.

“Jerry has served New Zealand with dedication and honour throughout his career, and I am delighted that he has agreed to continue that service in a new, broader role,” says Mr Key.

“Sir Anand Satyanand’s term concludes on 23 August 2011. I would like to thank Sir Anand for his dedication and service in his role as Governor-General.”

There will be a State farewell for Sir Anand on 17 August. Jerry Mateparae will be sworn in on 31 August, beginning his five-year term.
