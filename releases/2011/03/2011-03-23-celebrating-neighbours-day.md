Associate Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Hekia Parata, is encouraging Kiwis to celebrate “Neighbours Day Aotearoa” this weekend.

The vision for Neighbours Day Aotearoa is simple - “Turning streets into neighbourhoods - Hurihia nga ara hei tui i te ata noho a te tangata”.

This community-led initiative encourages everyone to go one step further to know their neighbours. It could be through a wave or smile, a first chat over the fence, inviting a neighbour in for a cuppa or holding a street barbeque.

“For Neighbours Day Aotearoa 2011, I want to encourage us all to make a special effort to greet the people in our streets – especially those we may not know so well,” says Ms Parata.

Well-connected neighbourhoods are key to healthy, sustainable communities and are essential during times of adversity.

“The importance of strong local communities has been reinforced by the outpouring of help and goodwill across Christchurch since the February earthquake. For many people, the first help they received was from their neighbours, support which will continue in the weeks and months to come as Christchurch rebuilds.”

Neighbours Day was piloted in Auckland two years ago. LIFEWISE, Inspiring Communities, and Methodist Mission Aotearoa are partnering to promote the concept nationally for the first time in 2011.
