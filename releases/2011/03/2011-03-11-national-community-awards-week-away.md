Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Tariana Turia is wishing all the TrustPower National Community Award Regional Supreme winners good luck as they compete for the National Supreme winner title this week.

The 2010 TrustPower National Community Awards are being held in Tauranga from 18 - 20 March 2011.

Representatives from 25 voluntary groups or organisations from around the country that were named Supreme Winner at their regional TrustPower Community Awards will each give an eight minute presentation on what the group has achieved and why they deserve the title of TrustPower National Community Award Supreme Winner.

The groups will be judged on that presentation, along with a 1,000 word summary of their organisation.

“Volunteers are the backbone of every New Zealand community, with 1.2 million volunteers dedicating more than 270 million unpaid hours every year for non-profit organisations up and down the country.

"The response to the Christchurch earthquake is perhaps one of the most visible signs of the amazing difference that can be made in communities, through the selfless act of giving" said Mrs Turia. "But, remarkably, this generosity is exhibited every day, in every community across the country".

“Volunteering is hugely important to New Zealand and New Zealanders. There are more than 97,000 non-profit organisations in New Zealand with approximately 90 per cent of these organisations relying entirely on volunteers.

“From my own experience in helping to establish kura kaupapa Maori and the Te Awa Youth Trust, I understand the huge amount of time and effort that volunteers put into the organisations that improve lives and communities for New Zealanders,” says Mrs Turia.

“These are among the most prestigious awards in the community and voluntary sector and I look forward to presenting the Supreme and Runner Up awards this Saturday.”
