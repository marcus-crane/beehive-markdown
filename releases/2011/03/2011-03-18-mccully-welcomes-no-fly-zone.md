Foreign Affairs Minister, Murray McCully, is welcoming the UN Security Council move to impose a No Fly Zone over Libya.

“While it is a necessary measure I am only concerned it will be a case of too little too late,” said Mr McCully.

The UN Security Council passed today a mandatory resolution imposing a No Fly Zone over the whole of the territory of Libya and called for an immediate ceasefire.

Mr McCully said it is disturbing Colonel Gaddafi is waging war on his own people, using aircraft and heavy artillery on unarmed civilians and the poorly armed forces that have risen up in support of the popular movement for change in Libya.

“This man has shown for many years that he is irrational and self-absorbed. We know now that he has no compunction in killing his own people to hang on to power,” said Mr McCully.

“It is very significant that this resolution has the support of the Arab League which called for the imposition of a No Fly Zone earlier this week. This is a recognition by the leaders of the region that they cannot sit back while a leader of a neighbouring state butchers his own people,” said Mr McCully.

The Minister said he was heartened that the Security Council had not only imposed a No Fly Zone and moved to freeze assets of the regime but also authorised the use of force to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack.
