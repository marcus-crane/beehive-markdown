Justice Minister Simon Power today officially opened the Wellington Public Defence Service for the Wellington, Lower Hutt and Porirua courts, including the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.

The PDS provides a high-quality in-house legal aid service, through the use of salaried staff rather than contracted lawyers.

“The opening of Wellington’s PDS is significant because it is the first branch to open outside the Auckland region,” Mr Power said.

“The PDS has gone from strength to strength since it was initially trialled in 2004, and is now operating at Auckland, Manukau, Waitakere, Papakura, Pukekohe, and North Shore courts, and is due to begin operating in Hamilton later this year.

Plans to expand into Christchurch will be revisited when circumstances allow.

Mr Power said two independent evaluations in 2007 of the PDS pilot at the Auckland and Manukau courts found:

- Stakeholders, including the judiciary, prosecutors, and court staff, noted the quality and preparation that PDS lawyers demonstrated in their cases, and pointed in particular to the mentoring and training opportunities that senior PDS staff are able to provide to junior lawyers.
- The flow of PDS cases through the court system led to a two-thirds reduction in jury trials, with savings in court time estimated at $400,000, not including prosecution cost savings.
- Cost savings were achieved with no difference in outcomes for the client, as measured by overall conviction rates.
- Overall, the PDS produced savings compared with the estimated cost of equivalent private provision.
- The PDS maintained or improved the quality of legal services as measured by three indicators – client experience, case handling and outcomes, and stakeholder perceptions.

“I see the PDS as playing a vital role in the new, higher-quality legal aid system which the Government is establishing following on from Dame Margaret Bazley’s review of legal aid,” Mr Power said.

“But quality is not the only issue facing legal aid, with a forecast $402 million gap between forecast and baseline legal aid expenditure over five years.

“We cannot continue to ignore the substantial cost pressures the system is facing, which is why I will soon be announcing a package of proposals to get the legal aid growth curve back under control, while ensuring continuing access to justice.”

The Wellington PDS is expected to employ around 15 lawyers and will undertake a caseload of 33% of the total number of assigned cases at courts in the three cities.
