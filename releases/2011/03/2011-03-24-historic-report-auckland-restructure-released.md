Minister of Local Government Rodney Hide today tabled the final report of the Auckland Transition Agency (ATA) in Parliament which details the work the agency did to form the new single Auckland Council.

“This report is an important historical document, and details the change management process used by the ATA for the biggest change process that local government in New Zealand has ever seen," Mr Hide said.

“The scale and scope of the project was immense.  The ATA had to design and deliver new structures to support the governing body, local boards and council-controlled organisations, and plan and oversee the day-to day business of the previous councils to ensure they could continue functioning through the transition.

“It then had to manage a seamless move into the new structure on November 1 2010.  The human resource, logistical, legal and financial work required for this should not be underestimated.

“Despite the complex undertaking, the ATA completed the transition in record time and $18.8m under budget. 

“In addition, the transition will more than pay for itself as the one-off cost will be off-set by the annual salary savings of $91m, the removal of duplication, improved processes and economies of scale. 

“Aucklanders now enjoy lower regulatory fees and charges, improved advisory services, reduced licensing costs, a 600 percent reduction in the number of applications and other forms and an average water price reduction of more than 20 percent.

“Chair Mark Ford, board members Miriam Dean QC, John Law, Wayne Walden and John Waller are to be congratulated for doing an excellent job.  The officials at the Department of Internal Affairs also did an outstanding job in working with the agency. 

"I also acknowledge the positivity and the professionalism of staff of the former councils and the Public Service Association during the transition.

“I look forward to seeing Mayor Len Brown and the new Council build on the good work that has already been done to deliver a brighter future for a unified Auckland," Mr Hide said.
