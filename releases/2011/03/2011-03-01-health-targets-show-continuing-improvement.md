The Government's extra $1.2 billion investment in Health over the past two years is delivering gains in key areas such as faster cancer treatment, more elective surgery, immunisation, and shorter stays in emergency departments.

Releasing the latest health targets performance data for the period October – December 2010, Health Minister Tony Ryall said, "Staff in New Zealand's public health service are delivering a good return on the government's record investment in health.

"In the cancer radiation treatment waiting time target, all 20 District Health Boards (DHBs) achieved the target of patients starting treatment within six weeks of their first specialist assessment. We've tightened the target to four weeks this year.

"Waiting times in emergency departments (EDs) have improved 10 percent since the introduction of these targets, up to 88 percent of patients either admitted to hospital, treated and discharged, or transferred from the ED within six hours. The target is 95 per cent.

"Big gains are continuing in immunisation, with just over 88 per cent of two year olds now fully immunised, and the new target is to achieve 90 per cent by July this year.

"We have seen a steady increase in the number of smokers who are given advice and help to quit smoking when they are in hospital, and diabetes and cardiovascular services are reaching more people more frequently.

Mr Ryall said, "The government is determined to protect and grow the public health service. We are seeing more high priority frontline services being delivered within the extra funding."

Results for the second quarter of the 2010/11 year are being published in newspapers tomorrow. The sixth quarterly health targets update is attached.
