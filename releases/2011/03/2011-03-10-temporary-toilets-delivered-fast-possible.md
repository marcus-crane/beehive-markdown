Providing temporary toilet facilities for earthquake affected Christchurch residents is being worked on urgently, Civil Defence Minister John Carter said today.

“There are 40,131 temporary toilets (both portaloos and chemical toilets) that have been sourced to meet demand,” Mr Carter said.

“Sixteen days after the earthquake, approximately 60 percent of households in Christchurch can use their toilets. I know that for those households who cannot use their toilet there is considerable anxiety. I want to assure those people that Civil Defence is getting temporary toilets into Christchurch and out to affected people as quickly as possible.

“The latest information I have is that by the end of today, 1471 portaloos will have been delivered to the suburbs that need them. A total of 4800 chemical toilets have been delivered and are in people’s houses. A further 5000 chemical toilets are expected into Christchurch today.

“There is detailed information on locations of portaloos and chemical toilet collection tanks at [www.eqviewer.co.nz](http://www.eqviewer.co.nz/)

“The earthquake on 22 February did significant damage to the waste water network throughout Christchurch. Civil Defence and Christchurch City Council staff are working as quickly as possible to assess the damage and develop both short and long-term solutions.

“One of the issues is significant silt build up, that is causing blockages that need to be identified. This silt then needs to be jet blasted out of sewerage pipes before damage can be fully assessed.

“Residents will be given information as their water is connected on how to find out if their toilet can be used. It is important to follow the instructions and advice of Civil Defence.”
