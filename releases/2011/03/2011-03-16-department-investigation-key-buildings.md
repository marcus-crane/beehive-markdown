The Department of Building and Housing is undertaking a technical investigation into the performance of key buildings in Christchurch and the reasons that some of them collapsed, Minister for Building and Construction Maurice Williamson said today.

“The Department is inviting people with information and evidence about the performance of key buildings to contribute to this investigation, which will include the Canterbury TV and Pyne Gould Corporation buildings, the Forsyth Barr building and the Hotel Grand Chancellor.”

The Department is seeking photographs, video recordings and first-hand accounts of the state, or performance of, the buildings prior, during and after the February 22 earthquake.

People who have material or information that will help the investigation should ring 0800 242 243 or Email [chchinvestigations@dbh.govt.nz](mailto:chchinvestigations@dbh.govt.nz).

The Department is already gathering information about the buildings and will engage expert engineers to carry out investigations. It will also set up an expert panel to review the work.

Mr Williamson said the investigation will proceed as quickly as possible.

“However, it is an important task and it is vital to get it right. Detailed engineering analysis of the performance of the buildings and the factors that contributed to the collapse of the Pyne Gould Corporation and CTV buildings - as well as the damage to the others - is likely to take several months.”
