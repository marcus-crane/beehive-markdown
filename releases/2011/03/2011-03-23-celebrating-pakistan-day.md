The Minister for Ethnic Affairs, Hekia Parata, has acknowledged the rich contribution that people of Pakistani origin make to New Zealand during a speech to mark Pakistan Day in Wellington tonight.

Ms Parata said New Zealand and Pakistan have enjoyed a good relationship over many years.

‘’We have worked, and continue to work positively in a range of international forums including the Commonwealth, United Nations, World Trade Organisation and the Cairns Group.

‘’We also enjoy strong sporting, educational and cultural links which help build the bonds of friendship between our two countries.’’

Ms Parata said over the last few months both nations have experienced suffering as a result of natural disasters.

“Like many New Zealanders, last year I was shocked by images of floods in Pakistan that displaced 17 million people from their homes. The New Zealand Government responded quickly, providing substantial assistance for disaster relief and reconstruction efforts. Pakistan’s messages of support following the two earthquakes in Canterbury are much appreciated and provide encouragement to those now trying to rebuild their lives.’’

Looking ahead, Ms Parata said more can be done to strengthen the two countries bilateral relationship, particularly in the areas of trade and economic co-operation.

“I would like to congratulate you, Your Excellency Syed Ibne Abbas, the High Commissioner of Pakistan to New Zealand, for establishing the Pakistan New Zealand Chamber of Business and Professionals last year. I am sure this organisation will be at the forefront of efforts to expand trade relations between our two countries.’’
