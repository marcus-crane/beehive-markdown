The Minister of Women’s Affairs Hekia Parata has applauded an initiative by the Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand to encourage more women into engineering.

The Institution of Professional Engineers (IPENZ), along with officials from the Ministry of Women’s Affairs, has developed a business plan which aims to increase the number of women in engineering.

The business plan proposes a number of actions including: investigating the barriers women face remaining and advancing in engineering; exploring the economic benefits of diversity in the profession; the subject choice of female students; leadership; the culture within the profession; and, recognition.

“The Women in Engineering Business plan is about taking action to increase the number of women studying engineering, and ensuring that women can have rewarding engineering careers,’’ Ms Parata says.

“The business plan fits well with ensuring women are fully engaged in the economy which is one of the Government’s key priorities.’’

New Zealand needs more engineers. A report by the Department of Labour and IPENZ in 2009 suggested that an additional 1700 to 1800 engineers would be required over the next five years.

With the devastating earthquakes in Christchurch, the need is now heightened.

“The tragic events over the last few months has meant that developing New Zealand’s engineering workforce is even more crucial,’’ Ms Parata says.

- **The IPENZ business plan will officially be launched tomorrow morning at the Amora Hotel, 170 Wakefield St, Wellington at 7.15am. Hon Hekia Parata will be the guest speaker.**
