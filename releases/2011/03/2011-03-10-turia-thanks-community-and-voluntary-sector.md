Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Tariana Turia is thanking the many individual volunteers and communities that have assisted with the response to the Christchurch earthquake.

“I have been so impressed with the way New Zealanders have come together to help each others in such trying circumstances including the many non-government agencies, fire, police, defence, local and international search and rescue personnel who have all been working together for the common good.

“I want to thank all of you that have stepped up during this time. I have watched in awe as you have descended on Christchurch from throughout the country and around the globe and set about ensuring people are getting everything they need to get through this crisis,” says Mrs Turia.

"What you have done has not only been watched by the world, but it has also resonated in the hearts and minds of our children. One of the most moving tributes to the human spirit that I have seen has been to see our tamariki - school children, sons and daughters, getting out with the shovel and wheelbarrow, and helping clear the silt from the driveway.

“The generosity of spirit has been very humbling. There are so many unsung heroes that have acted selflessly during this crisis.”

Mrs Turia says organisations such as Ngai Tahu, Maori Wardens, Salvation Army, Rangiora Earthquake Express, Student Volunteer Army, the farmers’ army, Red Cross, marae throughout Aotearoa and many many more non-government organisations have really stepped up to help.

"We have also seen those who have been caring for the carers like the individuals, marae and organisations such as the Brethren church who have been providing nourishing meals to front line workers.

“This energy and perseverance could well have been the defining actions that have helped many people cope through this time,” says Mrs Turia.

“As we look to the future the challenges will be vast, complex and exhausting but I know the community and voluntary sector will be right there working tirelessly to help get Christchurch back on its feet.”
