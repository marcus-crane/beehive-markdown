The Earthquake Commission's new assessment process will give Christchurch homeowners more certainty about the status of their homes, Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says.

The EQC announced today it will begin a new rapid assessment process of all Christchurch houses over the next eight weeks to prioritise needs and urgent repairs.

"The rapid assessments will give homeowners some certainty about their homes in a quicker timeframe," Mr Brownlee says.

"Given the scale of this disaster, the recovery process will take some time, so it’s vital EQC prioritises those with the greatest need."

The rapid assessment process will rank homes into categories of damage and give homeowners a timeframe for when they will receive their full EQC assessment.

"A full EQC assessment can take up to five hours so it could leave some homeowners in limbo for several months if there wasn’t a rapid assessment process," Mr Brownlee says.

"Homeowners do not need to be home when the rapid assessment takes place - a form will be left on their property to let them know which category they fall into.

"You do not need to have lodged an EQC claim yet either, as the rapid assessment teams will look at all houses. However, only those properties that are insured and have lodged an EQC claim will receive a full assessment," Mr Brownlee says.

Properties requiring emergency repairs to be weather-tight, secure or sanitary will be the first priority. The rapid assessment will also include affected parts of Selwyn and Waimakariri.

Mr Brownlee says the rapid assessments will begin today and EQC expects to have completed the initial rapid assessments for every house in metropolitan Christchurch, including Lyttelton, within eight weeks.

EQC will start in the suburbs most affected by the earthquake – Avondale, Wainoni, Bexley, Aranui, Avonside, North Linwood, Bromley, Mount Pleasant and Redcliffs – and progressively move out from there.
