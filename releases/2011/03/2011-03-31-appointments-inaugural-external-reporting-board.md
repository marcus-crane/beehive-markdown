Commerce Minister Simon Power today announced the makeup of the soon-to-be established External Reporting Board (XRB).

The XRB supersedes the Accounting Standards Review Board (ASRB) but will have a much broader range of powers. It will be responsible for all aspects of financial reporting, and for accounting and auditing standards-setting. It will begin on 1 July.

Members of the board are: Simon Carey, Neil Cherry, Annabel Cotton, Michele Embling, Graeme Mitchell, Ralph Simpson, and Ken Warren.

All of them, excluding Mr Cherry and Mrs Cotton who have been appointed for five year terms from the date the XRB commences, are members of the ASRB.

ASRB chair Kevin Simpkins will have his role transferred to the XRB.

“The continuity of experience from the current ASRB members will be crucial to the success of the inaugural External Reporting Board,” Mr Power said.

“The collective experience of this group in strategy, governance and oversight will help the board get off to a strong start.”
