Prime Minister John Key today thanked Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II for her support, through the Queen’s Charitable Trust, of the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal.

“Her Majesty’s charitable trust will be making a monetary donation to the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal, which is a generous and gratefully received measure of support for the people of Christchurch,” says Mr Key.

“I am sure New Zealanders will join me in thanking Her Majesty for her kind support at such a tragic time for the city.”

Her Majesty’s support sits alongside that of Prince William’s and Miss Catherine Middleton’s, who have included the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal in their Royal Wedding charitable gift fund.

“Prince William’s visit earlier this week was deeply humbling and was met with so much enthusiasm and goodwill from New Zealanders. I know the Prince’s attending the Christchurch Earthquake Memorial Service in Her Majesty’s stead on Friday made the event an even more moving and memorable occasion,” says Mr Key.
