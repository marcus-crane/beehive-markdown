The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has upgraded its advice for New Zealanders in Japan.

“Due to the ongoing risk of disruptions to essential services and the supply of goods we are now advising New Zealanders who do not have a pressing need to be in Tokyo, and affected provinces, to consider departing these areas,” said Foreign Minister Murray McCully.

“In regards to Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant (240km north of Tokyo) we are now advising an increase in the suitable safe zone from the facility. As a precautionary measure New Zealanders who live within an 80km radius of the nuclear plant should leave,” he said.

“The Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will be visiting Japan, and we will continue to monitor the situation closely,” said Mr McCully.

“The New Zealand National Radiation Laboratory is monitoring the situation regarding radiation levels and we are also in close contact with our consular partners.”

“We will review our travel advice on a regular basis and we encourage those in the affected areas to check for updates to the travel advice over the coming days.“

“Those who have plans to travel to Tokyo and the affected provinces may wish to reconsider their travel plans in light of the disruptions to services and the supply of goods,” said Mr McCully.

Since Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, MFAT has confirmed the safety of 2004 New Zealanders. There are specific concerns around the safety of one individual who is thought to be in the affected area.

“The New Zealand Embassy in Tokyo is continuing to assist New Zealanders in Japan. A bus has this afternoon been transporting 12 New Zealanders from Sendai to Tokyo,” said the Minister.

New Zealanders in Japan who are concerned about their safety and require assistance should contact the Embassy on +81 3 3467 2271 or MFAT crisis centre on +64 4 439 8000.”

New Zealanders who are unable to contact family in the northeast of Japan should contact the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade on: 0800 432 111; If calling from overseas call +64 4 439 8000
