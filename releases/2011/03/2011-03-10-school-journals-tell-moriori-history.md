Education Minister Anne Tolley has presented new School Journals featuring stories and illustrations about Moriori to Chatham Islands schools.

“For the first time Moriori have an authentic voice in the pages of the School Journal,” says Mrs Tolley.

“These journals will help children to learn about the Moriori culture and history.

“Moriori were misrepresented in twentieth century publications of the School Journal and this resulted in generations of New Zealanders having little understanding of the true origin and status of Moriori people.”

Mrs Tolley made the presentation of eight new School Journal publications at Kopinga Marae on the Chatham Islands.

“Through these publications, all New Zealand children will have the opportunity to learn about Moriori people, their culture and identity,” says Mrs Tolley.
