The Minister for Ethnic Affairs, Hekia Parata, has told ethnic communities in Auckland that the current financial environment presents opportunities to improve coordination and collaboration.

During a two day visit to Auckland Ms Parata met with representatives from the Chinese, Indian, Korean, Filipino, Muslim and African communities along with the Sikh Council, the South East Asian Business Core Group and  Ethnic Business Councis, to share views about the Government’s responsiveness to ethnic people in New Zealand.

The Minister stressed the Government’s priorities of supporting ethnic businesses, promoting responsiveness, participation and social harmony.

Ms Parata highlighted the important role ethnic communities can make in shaping the social and economic well-being of New Zealand in the future.

However she said in the current environment of austerity community groups and businesses need to work alongside the Government to improve their effectiveness.

“Small and medium services need to collaborate more, particularly when applying for funding,’’ Ms Parata said.

“The Government is streamlining its services to reduce unnecessary administration costs, provide more frontline staff, and free up money.  Services will also need to start thinking about how they can provide a more effective, but efficient service.”

Although each ethnic community has its own specific needs Ms Parata pointed out that many of the issues ethnic communities face are similar, such as access to Government services and information, and the employment of skilled migrants. 

Ms Parata also highlighted the important role ethnic communities can play in improving New Zealand’s place on the global stage.

“If we take advantage of the cultural richness that ethnic communities bring to Aotearoa New Zealand we will have a greater chance of creating new and innovative products and services.”

Ms Parata will be speaking at the EthnicA conference in Auckland tomorrow at Alexandra Park Raceway in Greenlane from 1.30pm-2.30pm. She will be available for interviews.
