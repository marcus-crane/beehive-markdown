Housing Minister Phil Heatley has today announced that a further three projects are to get Housing Innovation Fund (HIF) funding. This funding will see 14 new homes built for New Zealanders on low to moderate incomes, or with special housing needs.

The first successful Maori Demonstration Project (MDP) applicant has been decided as part of this funding round.

Ngati Mutunga O Wharekauri Asset Holding Co Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ngati Mutunga o Wharekauri Iwi Trust will match $830,500 of HIF funding to build five affordable rental homes on land owned by the Iwi Trust in Te One, Chatham Islands. It plans to build three three-bedroom houses and two one-bedroom units for kaumatua.

Trust Chair, Trudee Thomas, says this is an exciting opportunity for the Iwi to develop and administer housing on Wharekauri in a manner that appropriately meets the needs of its people in an affordable way. She also thanked those who had helped make this successful funding application possible, including the previous Chair, Paula Page, the Chatham Islands Housing Trust and the Board and Management of the Asset Holding Company.

Mr Heatley says $4 million of the $20 million set aside for HIF was allocated for MDP projects in recognition of the need to partner with Māori around housing issues, especially those relating to Māori land.

"The Government has always maintained it needs to work in partnership with others to grow the supply of social housing. It is pleasing to be able to partner with these organisations to provide affordable housing for the benefit of New Zealanders in need," he says.

"HIF is focused on housing providers who can match Government funding with their own money. These projects demonstrate that there are partners out there more than capable of meeting this requirement."

"The other two projects will result in nine new properties," he said

The total amount allocated to HIF projects so far this year is over $3 million. $20 million was set aside in the last budget for 2010/2011 funding.

There are still nine general HIF projects, and three Māori Demonstration Partnership projects being developed into funding proposals. It is expected that these projects will be presented for approval by June this year.

Other projects approved include:

1. The New Zealand Housing Options Trust will build six houses in South Auckland to be used as affordable rentals for low-income people with mental illness, and physical disabilities. It will receive $1 million and contribute $1 million.
2. Habitat for Humanity – Tauranga will build three 3-bedroom homes in Te Puke. These homes will be available for families on low incomes who can rent to buy. It will receive $300,000 and contribute $330,000.

In January the Auckland based social housing provider, Community of Refuge Trust (CORT) had $1 million in HIF funding approved and will contribute $1 million of its own money to provide ten one-bedroom affordable rental homes in the Tamaki area.
