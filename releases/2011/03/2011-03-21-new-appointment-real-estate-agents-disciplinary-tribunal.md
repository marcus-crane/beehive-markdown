Associate Justice Minister Nathan Guy has announced the appointment of Kate Davenport as a member and the deputy Chairperson of the Real Estate Agents Disciplinary Tribunal.

The Tribunal is an independent body that hears and determines disciplinary charges against real estate agents.

Ms Davenport is an Auckland-based lawyer with a wide range of legal experience in New Zealand and the UK. She is a former Vice President of the New Zealand Law Society, and is an experienced mediator.

She chairs the National Ethics Committee on Assisted Reproductive Technology (ECART), and is the Deputy Chair of the Health Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal. She also sits on the Registered Architects Board and is a member of the Weathertight Homes mediation panel.

“Ms Davenport brings a wealth of legal and professional skills to this role. Her experience in mediation and professional conduct issues will be a real asset to the Tribunal,” says Mr Guy.

Ms Davenport replaces the Hon Justice Mary Peters as the deputy Chairperson, who resigned from the Tribunal after being appointed to the High Court bench last year.

The current Chair of the Tribunal is the former District Court Judge, Michael Hobbs.
