Agriculture and Forestry Minister David Carter has welcomed the plan to merge the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry with the Ministry of Fisheries.

“This merger creates a single organisation which will be an efficient and co-ordinated voice for all New Zealand’s primary industries.

“Most importantly, it will provide integrated policy advice to better support the Government’s agenda for long-term economic growth from our primary producers. New Zealand’s future prosperity relies on the strength and productivity of our primary industries.

"The new agency will be better equipped to work with primary sector stakeholders, including iwi, local Government and international trading partners on regulatory, food and biosecurity issues.

“The merger will also reduce duplication and operational costs, and I expect a proportion of these savings will be shared with the sectors the agency works with to reduce the costs of doing business,” says Mr Carter.

A merger date of 1 February 2012 has been agreed, to allow time for stakeholder engagement, staff consultation, planning, any legislative change required and to prepare both agencies for the merger.
