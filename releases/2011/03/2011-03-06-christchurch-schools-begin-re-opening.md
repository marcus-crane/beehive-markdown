Education Minister Anne Tolley says that schools in Christchurch City will begin re-opening from tomorrow.

31 schools have indicated they will be open for students from Monday or over the next few days.

A further 55 schools have also been confirmed as structurally sound and can open for staff immediately, with opening dates for students expected soon.

“I want to thank principals, teachers and parents for all the hard work they are putting into getting their schools open as soon as possible,” says Mrs Tolley.

“I’m confident that most schools will be up and running by the end of the week, as we do all we can to get students back into learning.”

Parents should contact their school, visit their school website or go to [www.minedu.govt.nz](http://www.minedu.govt.nz) for updates on when schools are re-opening.

34 schools have issues which are being addressed, including four with structural damage where buildings can be isolated to get students back on site soon. At least six schools have substantial damage and won’t be able to open on their own site in the near future, but arrangements are being made for students.

“I’m pleased to announce that interim plans are in place for a further 2200 students at three of these schools,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Shirley Boys’ High will now share the site at Papanui High, St Paul’s Dallington and St Mary’s will go to Champion Street and Catholic Cathedral College will share with St Thomas’s.

“The flexibility being shown by all of the schools involved is extremely encouraging, as we try to give certainty for students and parents as soon as we possibly can.

“In the meantime, the Ministry website has information for parents on helping their child’s learning at home."
