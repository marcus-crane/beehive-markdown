Tariana Turia says she will miss working with Peter Hughes – the chief executive of the Ministry of Social Development and Employment who will be departing the position soon.

“Peter made a very important contribution to whanau ora by investing in the early preparatory stages of the approach,” said Mrs Turia, the Minister Responsible for Whanau Ora.

“He was open to the possibility of fundamental reform to enable our whanau to benefit from transformation and we will be forever appreciative of that open attitude.

“Peter is a consummate public sector executive who ran an extremely well organised machine while at the same time having the courage to be creative as the occasion demanded.

“He was always very responsive and responsible and I will miss working with him.”
