Brigadier David Gawn will become Commander Joint Forces New Zealand on 1 May, succeeding Air Vice Marshal Peter Stockwell who has been appointed Chief of Air Force. Brigadier Gawn will be promoted to Major General for his new role.

“Brigadier Gawn has demonstrated exceptional leadership strengths, especially on operations. His proven command skills are fundamental to this appointment,” Defence Minister Wayne Mapp says.

“His considerable operational experience includes being the first commanding officer of Kiwi Company in Bosnia in 1994. His success in this position was recognised by the award of the MBE.

“In 2000 he became commanding officer of the 3rd New Zealand Battalion Group in East Timor, for which he received a Force Commander’s Commendation.

“In a wide-ranging career the many senior appointments he has held include that of Land Component Commander at Headquarters Joint Forces New Zealand (HQJFNZ), and his current role of Deputy Chief of Army.

“HQJFNZ has a pivotal role in every aspect of the work of the Defence Force, especially its response to any security event or disaster relief situation. Command at that level requires an officer of the highest calibre.

“HQJFNZ will play a vital part as the Defence Force implements the changes set out in the Defence White Paper, to meet New Zealand’s national security needs in the coming decades.

“Brigadier Gawn has the skills and experience required to lead the headquarters at a critical point in our evolving Defence framework,” the Minister said.

“I congratulate him on his appointment and look forward to working with him.”
