New Zealand’s commitment to preventing people smuggling and human trafficking will be reinforced at the Bali Process Ministerial Conference, says Immigration Minister Jonathan Coleman.

Dr Coleman is attending the fourth Bali Process in Indonesia this week. The conference brings together Asia-Pacific countries to work on practical measures to help prevent and deter people smuggling and human trafficking.

‘‘People smuggling and human trafficking are serious issues throughout the region and the Bali Process is about working together effectively to prevent and deter these dangerous and undesirable activities,’’ says Dr Coleman.

‘’Attending the Bali Process confirms New Zealand’s support and commitment to tackling the irregular movement of people. Our geographical isolation mitigates our exposure to smuggling and trafficking, but as a regional partner, the Government is determined to support ways to deter these criminal acts.’’

The Bali process, which is being co-chaired by Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd and Indonesian Foreign Minister Dr Marty Natalegawa, will focus on strengthening regional plans to effectively combat people smuggling and human trafficking.

New Zealand launched a Plan of Action to prevent human trafficking in 2009. The Plan puts specific strategies in place to prosecute traffickers to the full extent of the law, and meet the needs of victims.
