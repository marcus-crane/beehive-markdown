Education Minister Anne Tolley has confirmed that Avonside Girls’ High School and Shirley Boys’ High School in Christchurch will temporarily return to their home sites for up to two years.

“I have to emphasise that this is a temporary measure, and that the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) has only agreed to the sites being used for up to two years,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Their return also depends on there being no more adverse events that might affect the safety or viability of these sites.”

Students will use a combination of existing useable classrooms and relocatable classrooms, with Shirley Boys’ expected to return to its site later this year, and Avonside Girls’ set to return at the start of the 2012 school year.

Both schools border “orange zones” – areas where CERA has yet to say whether rebuilding can occur.

Avonside is currently sharing a site with Burnside High School, while Shirley Boys’ is co-locating at Papanui High School.

“I would like to thank the principals, teachers, students, trustees and families at all four schools for their efforts to make this co-location work in incredibly difficult circumstances,” says Mrs Tolley.

The Ministry of Education is working with the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) on rebuilding greater Christchurch and its surrounds, and supporting the welfare of its residents.  For more information visit [www.cera.govt.nz](http://www.cera.govt.nz)
