Using recycled plastic bottles to make floating wetlands is helping nature restore water quality in Rotorua’s lakes, Minister for the Environment Nick Smith says.

Dr Smith was at Lake Rotoehu today to launch a new 2800 square metre floating wetland made from 364,000 recycled plastic soft-drink bottles. The wetland is one initiative of the Rotorua Lakes protection and restoration programme in which the Government has invested $72.1m.

“Native plants are planted on floating islands of plastic bottles, which then form a new habitat for both the plants and wildlife. The roots of the plants reach into the water, removing nitrogen as the plants grow. Because the plants are naturally working to remove the nitrogen from the water, we are giving nature a hand to solve a man-made problem,” Dr Smith said.

“The Bay of Plenty Regional Council and the Te Arawa Lakes Trust have successfully used floating wetlands on local lakes and are looking to extend their use. Nitrogen from intensifying land-use is one of the causes of the algal blooms that choke the waterways in and around the Rotorua lakes.

“As well as improving the quality of water in the lakes, the floating wetlands are also providing a habitat for wildlife such as native crayfish species like koura, and bird life.

“Using recycled plastic drinking bottles that may have otherwise ended up in landfill is in itself great for the environment, but to use them to help improve water quality and provide a habitat for local wildlife is a huge bonus.”
