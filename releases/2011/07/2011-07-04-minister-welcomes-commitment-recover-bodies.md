Acting Minister of Energy and Resources, Hekia Parata, says the Government supports the approach being taken by the Pike River receivers to seek a commitment from any purchaser of the mine to take all reasonable steps to recover the miners’ bodies.

It is expected such a commitment would form part of any Sale and Purchase agreement between the receivers and the mine purchasers.

“In May the receivers stated publicly that they would seek a commitment from any purchaser to take all reasonable steps to recover the miners’ bodies,” says Ms Parata.

“We support this approach, and have made clear the Government’s expectation that parties will continue to explore all options to recover the bodies.

“We understand potential purchasers have acknowledged this in their indicative bids, and that any purchaser would commit under the Sale and Purchase Agreement to using their best endeavours to recover the bodies.

“The Government welcomes the receivers' clear expectation that any purchaser would commit to recover the bodies of the miners, provided it is reasonably possible to do so, and subject always to safety considerations. As such, the Government would expect to see any application to transfer the mining permit to be subject to a suitable commitment from the purchaser.

"Applications to transfer mining permits are considered by me under section 41 of the Crown Minerals Act.''

Ms Parata says any new owner would be extremely mindful of the wishes of the local community for recovery of the miners’ bodies, and the impact this would have on the re-establishment of a successful mining business.

“The challenges faced at the Pike River mine are complex. We fully understand the desire of the West Coast community, and especially the immediate families of the miners, to have their bodies retrieved from the mine.

“We are seeking to proceed in a way that offers the best chance of recovering the miners’ bodies, and restoring to the West Coast a working mine at Pike River, if it is possible to do so.”
