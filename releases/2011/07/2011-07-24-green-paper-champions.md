Social Development Minister Paula Bennett is delighted to announce three New Zealanders who will facilitate debate on the Green Paper on Children.

The Green Paper will be released on Wednesday 27 July at Aotea Square in Auckland at 1pm. It will then be available for consultation nationwide.

“I encourage New Zealanders to come to the rally and get the Green Paper.”

“It’s vital New Zealanders read this, talk about it with their communities, really understand the issues and say what they think,” says Ms Bennett.

“I’ve chosen three people who care deeply about the welfare of children, who are trusted by New Zealanders and who can help facilitate this debate.”

Murray Edridge, Norm Hewitt and Sandra Alofivae will help families and communities around New Zealand in the upcoming, direct public consultation.

“Murray, Norm and Sandra will be at the one o’clock public rally in Aotea Square on Wednesday, where New Zealanders can come and show they’ve had enough abuse and want better for our children,” says Paula Bennett.

Leading the Green Paper Champions, Murray Edridge is the CEO of Barnados, an organisation that’s been working with parents, families and communities since the 1970s.

“Murray has the experience, knowledge and expertise to really help communities grapple the complex issues within the Green Paper.”

Norm Hewitt, well known for his sporting achievements has also played a strong role in community and is an Upsidedowns Trust ambassador.

“Norm is a strong, warm-hearted man and a loving father. He gets what it means to be a parent and he understands New Zealand communities.”

Sandra Alofivae has more than 20 years legal experience in family and youth law as well as extensive community and voluntary sector involvement. She also has a special understanding of issues affecting Pacific families.

“Our Children’s Champions want to help New Zealanders as we have a brutally honest, sometimes uncomfortable, but vital debate about how we help every child in this country to thrive, belong and achieve,” says Paula Bennett.

“I believe this is the single most important debate this country can have.”
