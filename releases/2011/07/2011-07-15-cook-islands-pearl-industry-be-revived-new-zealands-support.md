New Zealand will contribute to the revitalisation of the Cook Islands pearl industry as part of a three year programme funded through the New Zealand Aid Programme, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

“At the industry’s peak in 2000, black pearls contributed $18 million to the national economy per year”, Mr McCully said.

“Limited regulation and some unsustainable environmental and farming practices, coupled with a slump in international pearl prices saw production in the Cook Islands reach record lows.”

“New Zealand, as part of our harmonised aid programme with Australia, will commit NZ$3 million to the Pearl Industry Revitalisation programme aimed at developing sustainable farming practices and increasing income for those involved in the black pearl sector”, Mr McCully said.

“Our support will contribute to monitoring and regulating pearl farm production, local, regional and international marketing, and financial assistance and capacity development for farmers to enhance current and future prospects of the industry.”

“Revitalising the industry will have immense flow on benefits for outer island communities. 90 percent of Cook Islands pearls are produced in the northern island lagoon of Manihiki - 1160 kilometres north of Rarotonga - where employment and livelihood opportunities are limited”, the Minister said.

“This programme builds on research already carried out into the ongoing viability of Cooks Island’s marine resources, and an initial investment into market research aimed at helping to effectively position the Cook Island’s pearl industry internationally.”

“Investment in the pearl industry is a priority initiative under the New Zealand and Cook Islands Joint Commitment for Development, and is complemented by New Zealand’s support for waste management and sanitation improvement in the Cook Islands which seeks to safeguard the country’s lagoons for future generations”, Mr McCully said.

The Joint Commitment for Development will serve to strengthen the development relationship and deliver real, long term outcomes for the people of Cook Islands. 

Mr McCully is in the Cook Islands as part of the 2011 Pacific Mission.
