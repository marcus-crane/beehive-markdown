Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment, Hon Tariana Turia, says good progress is being made to implement the New Zealand Carers' Strategy and Five Year Action Plan.

“Carers are doing New Zealand a great service in supporting the person they care for in their daily life and enabling them to stay closely connected to their family and community. 

Our nation is indeed fortunate that despite the presssure they are under,  carers demonstrate such enduring commitment and resilience in supporting others”.

"Since the Carers' Strategy was launched in 2008, there has been greater support and information for those New Zealanders providing ongoing care to friends and family members,  who need help with everyday living because of ill-health, disability or aging".

"Over the next year, the Ministry of Health will review respite care with a view to improving the design, purchase and delivery of respite services.   As part of this, the Ministry is soon to trial a new respite service model in Nelson" said Mrs Turia.   "The Ministry of Health is also reviewing assistance and support to recruit relief cares".

"While progress is being made, I'm committed to ensuring that we continue to work with the Carers' Alliance to develop better supports and information for New Zealand's wonderful community of carers".

Key achievements include:

• 'A Guide for Carers, a practical and accessible guide', which was updated this year, provides an invaluable source of information on the government-funded services and supports available for carers.  This has made it easier for carers to find out exacty what support is available \[http://www.msd.govt.nz/what-we-can-do/community/carers/index.html]

• A carer wellbeing and learning programme including ACC injury prevention for carers through regular excerpts in the Family Care magazine

• Events sponsored by the Ministry of Social Development to promote DPB - Care of the Sick and Infirm (the main form of income support for carers who provide significant levels of care, full time)

• Work with health sector groups and medical practitioners to improve their understanding about financial assistance available for carers;

• and a Ministry of Health Review to improve training programmes for informal carers.
