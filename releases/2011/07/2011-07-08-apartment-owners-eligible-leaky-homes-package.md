Claims that apartment owners are not eligible for the leaky homes financial assistance package are incorrect, Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson said today.

“Owners of leaky apartments are entitled to the financial assistance package,” Mr Williamson said.

Last month’s change to the Unit Titles Act enables apartment dwellers to access the financial assistance package if 75 per cent of the residents agree this is what they want.

The third reading of the Weathertight Homes Resolution Services (Financial Assistance Package) is expected to take place next Tuesday.

Under the package, qualifying home owners will receive a 25 per cent contribution from the Government and may receive 25 per cent from their local council. The contributions will be based on actual repair costs.
