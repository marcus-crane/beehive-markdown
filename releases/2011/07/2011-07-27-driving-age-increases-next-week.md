An increase in the driving age from 15 to 16 from Monday (1 August) is one of a number of measures designed to make young New Zealanders safer on the roads, says Transport Minister Steven Joyce.

Other measures include introducing a zero blood alcohol limit for drivers under 20 (from 7 August) and strengthening the restricted license test to encourage more practice (in place February 2012).

Mr Joyce says improving the safety of young drivers is a priority for the government as young drivers are disproportionately represented in fatal and serious crash statistics.

Young people (15-24 years) make up 14.6 percent of New Zealand's population and 15% of all licensed drivers, but in 2010 they were involved in around 35% of all serious injury crashes. Crashes where young drivers were at fault resulted in 128 deaths and 697 seriousinjuries last year alone. 

Mr Joyce says increasing the age to 16 strikes a balance between ensuring our young people have the maturity and the cognitive skills to get behind the wheel, and not unduly affecting their personal freedom.

From 1 August new minimum ages for obtaining restricted and full licences will also apply. An exemption application process is available for those currently holding a Learner licence as at 1 August 2011 who, when they turn 16, wish to progress to a Restricted licence, if they meet certain conditions.

“While none of the new measures is a silver bullet on its own, together they will have a significant impact over time they will all help keep our most inexperienced drivers safer on the roads.”
