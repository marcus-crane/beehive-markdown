Education Minister Anne Tolley and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne have today launched a new tax education online curriculum tool for school students.

The Citizenship and Tax Education tool is designed for Year 7-10 social studies classes.

“This will be a welcome addition to the resources currently available to schools,” says Mrs Tolley.

“It’s a useful and practical programme and it’s aligned to the new curriculum, so students and teachers will benefit.”

Mr Dunne says the resource essentially starts discussions around citizens paying tax, why we do it and why there is an obligation to do so.

“Very positive feedback from trials shows that when young people used the tool they demonstrated a real understanding and appreciation of why we pay tax to have a fair, whole and functioning society.”

The programme was developed by Inland Revenue with advice from the Ministries of Education and Youth Development, and includes animations, quizzes, and games.
