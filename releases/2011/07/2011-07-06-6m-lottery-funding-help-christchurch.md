$6 million in lottery funding has been allocated to the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal, the Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy has announced today.

“In total $154 million in lottery allocations will be pumped back into the community this year, from the proceeds of games like Lotto, Instant Kiwi and Daily Keno.

“The $6 million grant will go to the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal, following a grant of $8.2 million raised by a special Lotto draw earlier this year.

“The core purpose of these lotteries is to raise money for the community, so it is only fitting that this allocation goes towards rebuilding Christchurch.

“The people of Christchurch have been through a very tough time, but the focus is now shifting to rebuilding the city. Every bit helps and this will be one of the biggest donations the Appeal has had.

“An extra $250,000 has also been allocated to the Lottery Canterbury/ Kaikoura Regional Committee to help the region.

“Demand for outdoor safety services is increasing in our communities and the Board has recognised that with an additional allocation of $750,000.

"New Zealand's sporting talent is getting a big helping hand with a grant of almost $33 million to Sport and Recreation New Zealand (SPARC).

"$11.4 million has been allocated to the New Zealand Film Commission and $24.5 million goes to Creative New Zealand.

“$26 million will go to regional community committees based on updated demographic and socio-economic factors.

“This funding plays an enormous role in building stronger communities. A huge variety of organisations receive funding, such as Age Concern, St John, Barnardos, Plunket, Women's Refuges and Cancer Societies.

"Over the last few years I've seen just how important lottery funding is in building strong, sustainable communities in New Zealand.”

The Lottery Grants Board distributes the profits of games run by New Zealand Lotteries to a range of regional, national and statutory bodies.
