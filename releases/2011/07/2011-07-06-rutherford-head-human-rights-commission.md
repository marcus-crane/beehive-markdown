David Rutherford has been appointed Chief Commissioner of the Human Rights Commission, Justice Minister Simon Power announced today.

Mr Rutherford replaces Rosslyn Noonan, who is completing her second five-year term.

“Mr Rutherford has proven leadership abilities and creative and practical approaches which will help advance the understanding of human rights in New Zealand,” Mr Power said.

“He is especially interested in youth, Māori, and disability rights – the latter through his extensive involvement in the Special Olympics.”

Mr Rutherford will take up his role on 1 September.

Mr Power thanked Ms Noonan for her two terms as Chief Commissioner.

“Ms Noonan led the mainstreaming of human rights in the public service and has strongly advocated for the inclusion of human rights standards in major legislation.

“She strengthened the integrity and reputation of the commission and human rights protections both in New Zealand and internationally, and I thank her very much for her work."
