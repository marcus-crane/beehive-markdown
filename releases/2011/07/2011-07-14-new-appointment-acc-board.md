ACC Minister Nick Smith today announced the appointment of respected accountant John Meehan to the ACC Board.

“John Meehan’s extensive experience in audit, risk management and governance will strengthen the eight-member Board,” Dr Smith said.

“The Board has made excellent progress in getting ACC’s finances under control. The Board and management have worked hard to improve rehabilitation rates and better control costs giving room for levy reductions. Strong financial skills are important to ensuring ongoing performance.”

Mr Meehan has 34 years experience as a practising chartered accountant with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), in the United Kingdom, the United States, and New Zealand, within the audit and assurance division. For 24 of these years, he was a partner in PwC until his retirement in December 2010. He is a member of the NZ Institute of Chartered Accountants Professional Conduct committee, executive director of Olivo Ltd and Wairarapa Olives Ltd, a Board member of The Royal New Zealand Ballet Trustees, and a member of the Audit Committee of the Historic Places Trust.

Dr Smith thanked retiring Board member Dr Marie Bismark, whose term on the ACC Board has finished. Dr Bismark is taking a position as a Board member for the newly independent Dispute Resolution Services Limited.

“This new appointment is a flow-on from the decision to create an independent dispute resolution service,” Dr Smith said. “Dr Bismark’s skills and expertise will help to ensure the success of the new separate entity.”
