The Government’s second infrastructure plan highlights both progress and strategic opportunities for telecomunications and transport infrastructure, Associate Infrastructure Minister Steven Joyce says.

The second plan takes a strategic look at the country’s infrastructure over the next 20 years.

"The Government is committed to ensuring New Zealand has the infrastructure to support faster economic growth," Mr Joyce says. "Effective transport and telecommunications networks will be central to achieving this.

"The Government is focused on creating the most efficient mix of transport options that benefits all New Zealanders and contributes to improved productivity and economic growth.

"Integral to this is a network of infrastructure that effectively links rail, sea and air ports and the roading network."

The Plan also highlights areas for attention, including looking at specific regions where economic and population growth place severe pressure on some aspects of our transport infrastructure.

"Auckland, Wellington and the rebuild of Christchurch are key to this. The Government's Roads of National Significance and increased passenger rail investment in Auckland and Wellington are an example of responding to these needs.

"The roll out of fibre-optic technology – to both rural and urban communities – is equally important and will become increasingly so in the years ahead.

"Combined, the Government's rural broadband initiative and ultra fast broadband roll out will mean that 97.8 per cent of households will have access to broadband of 5Mbps or faster, with 75 per cent having access to 100Mbps.

"The combined plans will also mean that 98 per cent of schools will have access to ultra fast internet."

Goals for telecommunications outlined in the plan focus on access, security and resiliency of the infrastructure.
