The final Board of Inquiry decision approving consents for the Waterview Connection is good news for Auckland and New Zealand, Transport Minister Steven Joyce says.

"We are today a big step closer to unlocking the benefits that the completed Western Ring Route will bring to Auckland and the whole country," Mr Joyce says.

The Waterview Connection is part of the Western Ring Route Road of National Significance and is the first roading project to use the Government's new national consenting process.

"This is a project that's been debated for decades. The Government came in with a plan that was much less costly than the previous government's, while balancing the needs of communities along the route.

"Since the project was referred to the Board of Inquiry through the new national consenting process it has taken just 10 months for a final decision.

"The Board of Inquiry has effectively endorsed our approach. That's good news for the community and good news for taxpayers.

"The completion of the route is essential to the continued growth and economic development of the Auckland region. It will also contribute to better business and freight links between key industrial hubs in Manukau, Auckland, Waitakere and North Shore.

"I'm pleased that everyone involved will soon have certainty about exactly what's happening, when and how," Mr Joyce says.
