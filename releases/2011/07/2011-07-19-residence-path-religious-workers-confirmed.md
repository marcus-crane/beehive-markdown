Religious communities across New Zealand will benefit from changes giving religious workers a pathway to residence, Immigration Minister Jonathan Coleman announced today.

‘’This new policy provides a path to residency for religious workers as well as an updated temporary work visa for shorter stays. Previously there was no residence option available to religious workers, so some communities were having trouble filling positions long-term, ‘’ Dr Coleman says.

‘’Religious leaders play an important role in the spiritual lives of many New Zealanders. We consulted widely on the policy and made some changes that now meet the needs of many communities. If they meet criteria, religious workers can apply for residence from later this year.’’

Some of the key residence criteria religious workers will need to meet include: being sponsored by a religious organisation to work here; the organisation must demonstrate a long-term need for the person; religious workers must have previously spent three years in New Zealand on a temporary visa.

Under the changes, which come into effect in November, an updated temporary visa for religious workers will be introduced. The temporary visa allows a person to stay for up to four years, at the end of which they can apply for residence.

Over 1,100 migrant religious workers were in New Zealand in 2009/10. More information is available at: [www.immigration.govt.nz/migrant/general/generalinformation/news/religiouswork.htm](http://www.immigration.govt.nz/migrant/general/generalinformation/news/religiouswork.htm)
