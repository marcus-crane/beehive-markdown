People living in the greater Christchurch area are being asked by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) to provide their views on what should be done to help the region recover from the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes.

The information gathered will be used by CERA in producing a Recovery Strategy for the region by the end of this year, in keeping with the requirements of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011.

Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says the Recovery Strategy will set directions and priorities for recovery across five main areas:

1\. Community well-being;

2\. The built environment;

3\. The natural environment;

4\. The economy; and,

5\. Culture and heritage.

Other recovery plans will sit under this overarching strategy.

While CERA will be taking into account the views gathered by Christchurch City Council during its Share an Idea consultation, the Recovery Strategy’s focus is on the entire greater Christchurch area, rather than just the central city. CERA is also consulting Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu, local and regional authorities and other key agencies on their views of recovery.

A series of community workshops starts next Thursday 14 July to give people an opportunity to share their opinions. These will be held in Christchurch, Lyttelton, Lincoln, Kaiapoi and Rangiora, during the day and in the evening. People will also be able to make submissions online at www.cera.govt.nz or pick up a submission form from council offices and public libraries.

CERA chief executive Roger Sutton says one of the most energising aspects of his job is “how passionate people are about living here; and how willing they are to contribute to its future. We really want to harness some of this passion for the Recovery Strategy.”

The community will also have a chance to comment on the draft strategy later this year.

CERA is responsible for rebuilding greater Christchurch and its surrounds, and supporting the welfare of its residents. For more information visit www.cera.govt.nz
