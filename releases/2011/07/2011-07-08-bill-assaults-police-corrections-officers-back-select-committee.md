A bill which makes offending against Police and Corrections officers an aggravating factor at sentencing has been welcomed back from select committee by Justice Minister Simon Power and Police and Corrections Minister Judith Collins.

Mr Power said the Sentencing (Aggravating Factors) Amendment Bill reflected the Government's wish to explicitly denounce in legislation attacks on Police and Corrections officers.

"Under the current Sentencing Act, the fact that an offence has been committed against a law enforcement officer is not an aggravating factor that must be taken into account at sentencing.

"Though the new aggravating factor does not automatically require an increase in an offender's sentence, I’m confident that explicit legislation denouncing this type of offending will help ensure courts impose tough penalties," Mr Power said.

Ms Collins said the Government wanted to send a clear message that offending against law enforcement officers was unacceptable, after a considerable increase in the number and rate of assaults over the past five years.

Between the 2004-05 year and 2008-09, total assaults on Police increased by 33 per cent, from 1,869 to 2,481, while serious assaults increased by 38 per cent, from 298 to 412. The number of serious assaults on Corrections staff who required hospitalisation or time off work has been tracking down over the past year. However, between 2004-05 and 2008-09 the total number of assaults doubled, from 151 to 304.

“These figures are of great concern. An attack on a Police or Corrections officer represents an attack on the community and the rule of law,” Ms Collins said.

“Our Police and Corrections staff keep the community safe from our most dangerous people. This bill sends a strong signal that the Government will do everything in its power to protect them while on the job.”
