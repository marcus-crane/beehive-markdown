Two major organised crime busts this week have sent gangs the message that crime won’t pay, Police Minister Judith Collins said today.

Police arrested around 25 people – mostly members of the Nomads gang – in the Wellington area and seized thousands of dollars in drugs, cash and vehicles. A further 25 people were arrested in the Bay or Plenty in another multi-agency raid on organised crime.

“These operations – which involved some courageous undercover officers – will severely disrupt the supply of methamphetamine and other drugs into those communities,” Ms Collins said.

“I’m so proud of the great work our Police are doing. They are taking on some very dangerous, very well organised criminals and they are winning.

“Crime doesn’t pay. The gangs would have to be pretty thick if that message hasn’t gotten through by now.”

Taking down the gangs and methamphetamine trade has been one of the Government’s main law and order priorities.

It has passed new laws giving Police new powers to intercept gang communications and seize gang assets.

A special Police unit was set up to identify, target and seize the millions in proceeds gangs make from crime.

At the end of June 2011 New Zealand Police held Restraining Orders over an estimated $38.5 million worth of assets. That included hundreds of thousands in cash, luxury cars, motorbikes, properties, jewellery and gold.

“We think taking away the profit motive is a good way to tackle these illegal businesses,” Ms Collins said.

“The message has been sent to the gangs – the Government and Police are coming after them and will use every tool at their disposal.”
