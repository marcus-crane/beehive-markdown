The first people on a new Government programme to help overseas-trained doctors prepare for New Zealand registration are about to take their medical exams.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says, "This Government recognises that health workforce issues are a top priority. We are taking action on a number of fronts.

"This new programme has been developed by Health Workforce New Zealand with input from the Medical Council. It is for unregistered international medical graduates already living in New Zealand to help them prepare for the Medical Council's registration exams.

The first intake of eight candidates from eight countries will sit their registration exam by the end of August. Interviews are underway for a second intake of up to 10 candidates.

"As well as supporting overseas-trained doctors to meet New Zealand registration requirements, we have:

• increased the number of training places at medical schools

• increased the number of GP training places

• introduced voluntary bonding to encourage newly qualified doctors, nurses and midwives to work in hard to staff locations and specialties

• established Health Workforce New Zealand to consolidate the planning and development of the country's health and disability workforce

• introduced prescribing by specialist diabetes nurses.

"We will continue to make changes that encourage and support health professionals to work in New Zealand," Mr Ryall says.
