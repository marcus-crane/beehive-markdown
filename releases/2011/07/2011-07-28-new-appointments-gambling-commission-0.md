Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy has announced two new appointments to the Gambling Commission.

“Abigail Foote, a Christchurch lawyer brings legal expertise, governance and management experience to her role.

“Russell Bell, a chartered accountant from Wanganui has a strong background in risk management and auditing.

“These two appointments bring the Commission to its full complement of five members. They will join Chief Commissioner Graeme Reeves, and Commissioners Paul Stanley and Lisa Hansen.”

The Gambling Commission is an independent statutory decision-making body.  The Commission hears casino licensing applications, and appeals on licensing and enforcement decisions made by the Secretary of Internal Affairs in relation to gaming machines and other non-casino gambling activities.

The Commissioners’ terms are for three years.
