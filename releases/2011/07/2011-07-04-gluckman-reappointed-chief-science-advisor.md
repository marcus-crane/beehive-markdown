Prime Minister John Key today announced the reappointment of Professor Sir Peter Gluckman as the Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor for another two years.

Mr Key says Sir Peter has been an extremely effective Chief Science Advisor since he was appointed to the newly-created role in 2009.

“When I created this role it was my intention that science be put at the heart of Government and our decision-making – and Sir Peter has worked hard to achieve this in the past two years,” Mr Key says.

“Sir Peter is one of New Zealand’s best known and most distinguished medical scientists, at home and internationally.

“He has fulfilled the purposes of the role since taking it up, and I am very pleased to reappoint him for a further two years.”

Mr Key says the role of Chief Science Advisor is vitally important and demands not only a high level of science expertise, but also the utmost integrity to fairly represent the state of science knowledge.

“I’m delighted Sir Peter will continue to provide me with a direct line to advice when I need it. He is an independent voice that will complement existing channels of advice such as government departments and the Royal Society,” Mr Key says.

Sir Peter’s two-year reappointment period commenced on July 1.
