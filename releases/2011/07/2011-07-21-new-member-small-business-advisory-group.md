Small Business Minister Maurice Williamson has announced the appointment of Wellington businessman Mark Whitecliffe to the Small Business Advisory Group.

Mr Whitecliffe is the managing director of Wellington firm MSO Design, becoming owner in 1996.

“With 29 years business experience and active involvement in Te Awe (Wellington Māori Business Network), he will bring a wealth of knowledge and insight to the group’s work,” Mr Williamson says.

“His practical experience and skills in design and communications complement the group.”

The Small Business Advisory Group advises the government on issues affecting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and helps government agencies communicate more effectively with SMEs.

The current group, made up of small business owners from throughout New Zealand, was appointed in December 2009 for a term of three years.

Mr Whitecliffe’s appointment is effective immediately until December 2012.
