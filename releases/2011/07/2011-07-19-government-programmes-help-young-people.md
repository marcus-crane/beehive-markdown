Social Development Minister Paula Bennett says the Government has maintained a high priority on young people with a particular focus on employment.

“This Government has spent millions on upskilling young people, getting them work experience and that vital foot in the door with a first job,” says Ms Bennett.

Since 2009 the National-Led Government has invested $66 million in Job Ops, $57 million in Community Max, $44 million in the Limited Service Volunteer programme (LSV) and just over $17 million in Skills for Growth.

Of those young people who have completed Job Ops 89% are not on a benefit with a further 72% off benefit through Community Max. LSV has also helped 2,800 young people get job ready over the last two years.

"Not to mention the extra effort from Work and Income staff who have ensured youth make up 94% of the reduction in Unemployment Benefits in the last month alone," says Ms Bennett.

“In January last year we had 23,500 young people on an unemployment benefit which has now dropped to 17,000 solely because of a significant effort and focus firmly on young people,” says Ms Bennett.

“This Government has spent $13 million per year on the Youth Transition Service through the Mayors Taskforce," says Ms Bennett.

"It is no secret that we are currently looking at this funding and I make no apologies for critically assessing how public funds are spent on helping our young people work towards their futures,” says Ms Bennett.

“No one wants to see young people floundering on benefits and we will keep the focus on our youth, however evidence tells us the programmes this Government has introduced are making a difference," says Ms Bennett.
