Foreign Minister, Murray McCully, will lead a delegation of MPs, business people, NGOs, officials, and media on the 2011 Pacific Mission to Tonga, Samoa, Cook Islands and Niue next week.

“The annual Pacific Mission provides an opportunity for a wide range of New Zealand representatives to meet with their Pacific counterparts on issues such as trade and investment, development assistance, and cultural and sporting ties,” Mr McCully said.

“It reinforces the importance New Zealand places on the region, its continued growth and development, and the close ties between our people at all levels.”

“This Mission carries greater significance with New Zealand hosting the 40th anniversary of the Pacific Islands Forum in Auckland in September,” said Mr McCully.

“The Government wants to ensure the Forum delivers meaningful outcomes for the people of the region, and we will use this trip to hear first hand the priorities for Pacific nations,” he said.

“The Pacific Mission will also highlight the opportunities arising from the 2011 Rugby World Cup for Pacific businesses and will acknowledge the strong support we received from the Pacific in our bid to host the Cup,” said the Minister.

“Rugby legend, Jonah Lomu, and  Rugby NZ2011 CEO, Martin Snedden, will be part of the delegation to help promote the World Cup, and the game of rugby to young Pacific people,” Mr McCully said.

The delegation departs 12 July and returns to New Zealand on 16 July.
