Finance Minister Bill English will attend the Pacific Island Forum economic ministers’ meeting next week in Apia, Samoa.

The meeting is expected to focus on how to increase growth and broaden economic activity in the region.

"New Zealand places huge importance on the region's continued growth and development," Mr English says.

"I'm very keen to hear other ministers' views on how we can lift sustainable economic growth in the region, ahead of the Pacific Islands Forum in Auckland in September.

"Stronger growth raises living standards and supports stability. We want to ensure the forum meeting in Auckland helps achieve that.

"I will also be highlighting the opportunity the Rugby World Cup presents for Pacific businesses and for the region to showcase itself to the world," Mr English says.

Ministers are also likely to discuss how to improve public finance management, development co-ordination and revenue collection across the region.

The meeting runs from 19-21 July.
