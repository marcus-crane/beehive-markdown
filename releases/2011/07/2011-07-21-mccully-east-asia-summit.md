Foreign Minister Murray McCully arrives in Indonesia today to meet Asia-Pacific leaders for discussions on regional security, economic integration, disaster response, and development assistance. 

Mr McCully is in Bali for three days attending the East Asia Summit Foreign Ministers’ Consultations, the 18th ASEAN Regional Forum, the Post-Ministerial Conference between New Zealand and ASEAN partners, and the 9th South West Pacific Dialogue.

“The visit provides a useful opportunity for one-on-one discussions with a number of the region’s Foreign Ministers where we will discuss the development of economic and security arrangements, said Mr McCully.

“Both New Zealand and Japan have recently experienced the huge impact a natural disaster can have. I will also be sharing New Zealand lessons in discussions about coordinated disaster response for the Asia Pacific region,” he said.

In an historic first, the US and Russian Federation will also take part in the East Asia Summit Ministerial meeting. 

“It’s a milestone and we welcome the presence and input these two countries offer,” said Mr McCully.
