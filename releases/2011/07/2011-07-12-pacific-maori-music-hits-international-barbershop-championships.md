The Musical Island Boys Barbershop Quartet from Wellington took the first non-English song to the International Open Barbershop Championships held this past week in Kansas City, Missouri taking out second place – an achievement to be truly proud of, says Acting Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Tariana Turia.

Thanks to a recent rule change allowing the inclusion of non-English songs in the contest, they sang an arrangement of Now is the Hour/Pō Atarau in the finals, and received a standing ovation from the 10,000 strong arena-packed audience.

Mrs Turia says their unique contribution to the Championships sets a great example for the Pasifika and Māori music communities.

“This quartet competed against 51 other national champion quartets from around the world and gained the second highest cumulative score and that is an amazing achievement in itself,” says Mrs Turia.

“They have broken new ground through their music proudly representing their own cultures and home country gaining second place for an international medal.”

Mrs Turia said the boys, who are of Pacific and Māori descent, returned to New Zealand from the 73rd International Barbershop earlier today and were welcomed by their friends and family who proudly watched them via the webcast.

“My sincere congratulations go out to The Musical Island Boys who have proven yet again to be such inspiring role models not only for Pacific and Māori musicians, but all up and coming aspiring New Zealand artists,” says Mrs Turia.
