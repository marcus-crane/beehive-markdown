Consultation on the rules by which independent milk processors can access raw milk from Fonterra is now underway, Agriculture Minister David Carter announced today.

The Raw Milk Regulations form a key part of the decade-old dairy industry regulatory regime.

“The Government’s goal is to promote fair and efficient dairy markets in New Zealand and after 10 years, it’s timely to revisit the raw milk regulations,” says Mr Carter.

The review of the raw milk rules covers such issues as how much regulated milk independent processors should have access to, and for how long; and the total volume of regulated milk that should be made available each year.

It does not cover the farm gate milk price, or the design of a regulatory regime around Fonterra’s Trading Among Farmers proposal, pieces of work which are being progressed separately.

“I encourage all industry players to take part in this important consultation process.  The Raw Milk Regulations are a key part of ensuring a fair and efficient dairy industry in New Zealand,” Mr Carter says.

Submissions close 2 September 2011 and the consultation document is available [here](http://www.maf.govt.nz/news-resources/consultations/review-of-raw-milk-regulations).
