Internal Affairs Minister Nathan Guy has announced the reappointment of Judge Carolyn Henwood as Chair of the Confidential Listening and Assistance Service.

The service has been operating since mid-2009 to provide a confidential environment in which people in state care before 1992 can voice their concerns about abuse, neglect, or the way in which they were treated. 

This includes people who spent time in psychiatric hospitals, health camps, child welfare homes, foster care, and special education homes.

“I am very pleased to reappoint Judge Henwood,” Mr Guy said. “She has brought strength and sensitivity to the important work of the service, helping people come to terms with their experiences.”

The service usually operates as a three-person panel and travels around the country to meet with participants and supporters. Counselling and other assistance is available for those who take part in meetings. 

It is expected that the service will operate until mid 2013.  People can find out more about the service via the website www.listening.govt.nz or by phoning 0800 356 567.
