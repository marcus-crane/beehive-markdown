Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Tariana Turia has announced three appointments to the Board of the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust, each for a period of six years from 1 July 2011.

"I am delighted with the calibre of the appointees, who each bring unique skills which will strengthen the Board membership" said Minister Turia. "I know that the Trust members look forward to welcoming Fiona Tregonning and Len Cook to the Board, and to benefit from the continuing expertise of Bruce Robertson".

The Winston Churchill Memorial Trust was established as a living memorial to Sir Winston Churchill. The Board distributes funds to assist New Zealanders to travel overseas to learn more about other people and cultures and to investigate topics that will help them to increase their contribution to the community and their trade, industry, profession, business or calling. Around 25 Winston Churchill Fellowships are funded each year.

The Board of the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust is appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector.
