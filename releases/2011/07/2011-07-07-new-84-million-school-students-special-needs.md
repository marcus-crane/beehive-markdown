Education Minister Anne Tolley has officially opened the new $8.4 million Mahinawa Specialist School and Resource Centre, based at Mana College in Porirua.

“This new school and resource centre shows the Government’s commitment to providing education for students with special needs,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Mahinawa Specialist School ensures that some of our most vulnerable students have a learning environment that effectively supports their additional learning and support needs.

“This is in contrast to the poor conditions they had to endure on the previous Kapi Mana school site.

“And with the main school situated on the Mana College site, it means students can become integrated in the life of the college – something which they weren’t able to do at their previous school.

“In addition to the investment in new buildings at Mahinawa, we are continuing to fund improvements at mainstream schools so that they are accessible to students with special needs.”

27 students attend the Mahinawa base school at Mana College, with another 30 students attending satellite units at Raumati Beach, Titahi Bay Intermediate, Ngati Toa School and Porirua School.
