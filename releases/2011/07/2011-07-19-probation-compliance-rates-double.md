More staff and improved work practices have resulted in Community Probation Services (CPS) doubling community work compliance rates since 2009, Corrections Minister Judith Collins said.

Speaking at the official opening of the Blenheim CPS Service Centre today, Ms Collins said the Government’s $256 million investment in CPS was paying off. CPS manages 45,000 offenders who are on parole or serving community based sentences.

“We need to make sure that we are in the best possible position to manage these offenders appropriately and at the same time improve public safety,” Ms Collins said.

“That is why the Government has injected $256 million into CPS. This funding has been used to increase the number of probation officers across the country by 246.

“I’m delighted that the increase in the number of frontline staff has already seen CPS improve the quality of its practice to record levels.

“The compliance levels for community work alone have doubled, from 43 percent in 2009 to a consistent result of over 80 percent during the last six months – an outstanding achievement.”

New work practices were introduced following the February 2009 report by the Auditor-General into the management of parole.

Until recently, CPS staff in Blenheim worked across two sites. The new centre means the 29 staff responsible for managing around 650 community based sentences and orders at any one time can now work together in one location.

“Centres such as this play an important role in creating safer communities,” Ms Collins said.

Ms Collins acknowledged the justice sector partners, social agencies and service providers that work alongside CPS. “Your work contributes to the Government’s vision of a better and safer New Zealand.”
