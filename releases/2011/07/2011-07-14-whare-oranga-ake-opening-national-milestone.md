Whare Oranga Ake opening a national milestone

Associate Corrections Minister Dr Pita Sharples says the openings, today and tomorrow, of the first two Whare Oranga Ake, are a milestone for New Zealand’s approach to law and order.

“I believe this unique institution is going to revolutionise our society, and reform the way New Zealand, and the world, reintegrates offenders into our communities,” said Dr Sharples.

“Whare Oranga Ake are founded on the Maori values of manaakitanga, kotahitanga, rangatiratanga, whanaungatanga and wairuatanga. They address three critical areas: healing, vocation and community support,” he said.

“The critical difference with Whare Oranga Ake is bringing the family and the community into the picture to take responsibility for reintegrating offenders.

“If a prisoner really has changed inside, if they’ve given up drink or drugs, or if they’ve renounced violence, for example, then they will leave prison as a new person. If that change is to last, their family and the wider community need to get to know this new person, and make changes in their own expectations and relationships,” said Dr Sharples.

“If New Zealanders want reoffending to reduce, we must not turn our back on these men and women. We need to help them find work, to support their families, to get them involved in sports and recreation, and perhaps further education.

“We as communities and whanau must be active in the process of revival and change - and Whare Oranga Ake provide an opportunity to get involved,” said Dr Sharples.
