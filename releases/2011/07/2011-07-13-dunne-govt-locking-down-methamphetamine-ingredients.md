The Misuse of Drugs Amendment Bill will restrict the availability of the main precursor substances used to make the Class A drug methamphetamine, Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne says.

Speaking at its second reading in Parliament last night, Mr Dunne said the bill would “close off the source of domestic methamphetamine precursor substances”.

“This cannot wait. Methamphetamine is the only illegal stimulant drug commonly manufactured in our country, and we have high rates of use by international standards,” he said.

He said the Bill would reclassify ephedrine, and in particular pseudoephedrine, as Class B2 controlled drugs, removing over-the-counter pharmacy access to pseudoephedrine and making it a prescription-only medicine.

He said this will make it more difficult for criminal manufacturers to get the ingredients they seek, while allowing it to be used as a medicine for those who need it.

Reclassification as a Class B2 drug would also allow Customs and Police increased powers to clamp down on supply.

He said the changes were in the context of updating the country’s drug legislation to meet the challenges and issues faced today.
