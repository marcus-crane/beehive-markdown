The National Infrastructure Plan shows the Government will invest over $17 billion in infrastructure in the next four years, supporting thousands of jobs and setting a platform for growth, Infrastructure Minister Bill English says

"Central government will invest $7.6 billion on social assets like schools, hospitals, state houses and prisons over the next four years, $6.5 billion on roads and about $1.5 billion each on broadband and rail," Mr English says.

"In addition we've set aside $5.5 billion to rebuild Canterbury and state-owned enterprises are spending billions more upgrading their own assets.

"The plan shows New Zealand's infrastructure is generally improving, with less red tape, more major investment in the roading, rail, telecommunications and electricity networks and specific projects to support the Rugby World Cup.

"New Zealand faces some major challenges, including rebuilding Canterbury, but we remain committed to investment throughout the country and are continuing to look for new projects that lift productivity and growth.

"However we must manage our large asset base better and ensure future investment goes into areas that deliver the greatest benefits to the economy.

"Government assets are forecast to grow by $34 billion to $258 billion by 2015. Extending the mixed ownership model is one of a number of initiatives that will ensure government capital is allocated to where it is needed most.

"The National Infrastructure Plan is another step in that direction. It sets out the Government's 20-year infrastructure strategy, future challenges and the Government's priorities over the next three years. Those priorities are:

1\. Working with stakeholders to rebuild Canterbury infrastructure.

2\. Providing a comprehensive approach to investment in Auckland that is fair to all New Zealanders and helps implement the Government's responsibilities through the Auckland spatial plan.

3\. Improving the management of government-owned social infrastructure assets, such as prisons, hospitals and schools.

4\. Focusing transport investment on supporting exports through projects like the Roads of National Significance and better rail links to ports.

5\. Improving the Government's ability to monitor performance across all infrastructure sectors.

"On coming into office, the Government moved immediately to unclog our economic arteries by boosting investment in productive infrastructure and improving the regulatory environment," Mr English says.

"We've invested heavily in the last three Budgets in infrastructure like schools and ultra fast broadband - alongside record investments in our electricity and State Highway networks.

"We've also improved the way the Government plans, consents and finances infrastructure by reforming the Resource Management Act, improving spending disciplines and making greater use of public-private partnerships.

"The National Infrastructure Plan delivers on our promise to ensure stakeholders have a better sense of the Government's intentions across a range of sectors so they can make their own decisions to meet future demand," Mr English says.

The next National Infrastructure Plan will be produced in three years. The latest plan can be viewed online at [www.infrastructure.govt.nz/plan/2011](http://www.infrastructure.govt.nz/plan/2011).
