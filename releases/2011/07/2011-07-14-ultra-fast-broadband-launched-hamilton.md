Fibre-optic cable has been deployed to the first Hamilton business today as part of the Government’s ultra-fast broadband (UFB) Initiative.

"Stainless Design is the first of some 4,000 Hamilton businesses that will have the opportunity to benefit from improved broadband speeds at competitive prices as they are deployed and progressively connected over the next few years," Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce says.

Under the UFB initiative Ultra-fast Broadband Limited (UBL) is contracted to roll out fibre-optic cable to around 163,000 premises in Hamilton, Tauranga, Wanganui, New Plymouth, Hawera and Tokoroa.

"Ultra-fast broadband provides opportunities for businesses to work in new ways, schools to connect students to resources around the globe and for specialist medical expertise to be available in more places through technologies like high-definition video conferencing.

"Because we’re delivering fibre to the door, ultra-fast speeds will also be available at home, driving increased connectivity and access to new media and applications.

"The fibre-optic network will be open to retailers on equal terms, boosting market competition.

“Wholesale prices will be as low as half the price of current offerings for business services and residential customers will enjoy a vastly improved service for as much as they currently pay, or less,” Mr Joyce says.

The Hamilton deployment includes Te Awamutu and Cambridge and will connect a combined population of more than 200,000, including about 4,000 businesses, some 650 medical centres and 63 schools.

The complete UBL deal will connect 12 per cent of New Zealand’s population and is supported by a Crown contribution in excess of $200 million. It will be completed over a five year period.

The roll out in Tauranga and Wanganui will start in the coming weeks.

Overall the $1.5 billion Ultra-fast Broadband Initiative will see 75 per cent of New Zealanders able to access speeds of 100Mbps or more before 2020.
