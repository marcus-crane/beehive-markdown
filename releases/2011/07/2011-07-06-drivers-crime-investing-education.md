Education Minister Anne Tolley says that Government investment in early childhood education and parenting programmes has made a significant contribution to the progress made in the Drivers of Crime strategy.

“All children deserve the best possible start to their education, and to be engaged in learning, which is why Budget 2011 invested an additional $550 million in ECE over the next four years,” says Mrs Tolley.

“We are targeting funding at some of our youngest New Zealanders, who we know will benefit the most from ECE but are currently the least likely to take part.

“Funding of $91.8 million in Budget 2010 is going towards participation projects around the country which will create an extra 3500 places for Maori, Pasifika and low-income families who are under-represented in ECE.

“We have also invested $60 million in the Positive Behaviour for Learning plan, which provides proactive support for parents, teachers and schools, to help engage students and lift achievement.

“15,000 parents in at-risk families will be supported to build more positive relationships with their children, staff from 400 schools will receive training in how to promote positive behaviour and lift student engagement, and more than 7000 teachers will be trained in effective classroom management.

“By keeping students engaged in education, and making sure they have reading, writing and maths skills, we can give them opportunities to lead successful lives away from crime.”
