Education Minister Anne Tolley will attend the East Asia Summit of education ministers in Bali and will sign an education cooperation agreement in Jakarta on a trip to Indonesia from July 13 – 19.

The trip will be used to promote education cooperation, and discuss how New Zealand and the Asian region can work more closely together.

“The summit of education ministers will provide us with a great opportunity to  promote the reputation of New Zealand’s world-leading, innovative and high-quality education system," says Mrs Tolley.

“It will also allow us to be part of education projects around the region which promote the exchange of policy, best practice and quality.”

The summit will also be attended by education ministers from Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Burma, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia, China, Japan, India, and the Republic of Korea.
