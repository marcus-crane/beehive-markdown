Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced her final decisions on the review of schools to strengthen education provision in the South Dunedin area. 

The reorganisation of primary schools for years 1 – 8 children will see the formation of two new merged schools, and will provide an extra $1.8 million in Education Development Initiative funding to help transition students and raise achievement for primary education in South Dunedin. 

College Street School, Caversham School, and Calton Hill School will merge to become one full primary school on the site of the present Caversham School, with a second campus at Calton Hill. The operation of the second campus will be reviewed in two years.

A second merger will take place between Macandrew Intermediate and Forbury Schools to form one full primary school. This school will be located at the Macandrew Intermediate School site.

“The continuing decline in student numbers in the area has seen all five schools experience a reduction in funding,” says Mrs Tolley.

“I’m confident these changes will strengthen education in South Dunedin, and will provide security to families that the new schools will be sustainable in the decades ahead.

“I want to thank the school boards and communities who have participated in the consultation on the future of schooling in South Dunedin. The feedback has been extremely valuable in making my final decision.

“Having visited both Macandrew Intermediate and Forbury School recently, I am certain that the Macandrew site provides much better facilities for children. There is a wider range of teaching spaces, including a refurbished school hall and technology facilities. The site will also be able to accommodate other services such as social workers and health professionals, and with some property work it will be an excellent school for the younger children who will soon be attending.

“I will be appointing boards of trustees to the merged schools shortly, including members of the five original school boards, to guide the school communities through this time of change.

“The Ministry will work closely with schools to ensure a smooth transition for students.”

It is expected the changes to schooling in South Dunedin will be in place for the 2012 school year.
