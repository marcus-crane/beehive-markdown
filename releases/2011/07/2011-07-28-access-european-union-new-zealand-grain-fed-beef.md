The European Union has agreed to allow New Zealand access to a quota for grain-fed high quality beef, Trade Minister Tim Groser announced today.

“New Zealand has been approved to join a list of countries able to access an annual quota of 20,000 tonnes tariff-free (going up to 45,000 tonnes in 2012), which is administered by the EU.”

“New Zealand has acquired in more recent years a well-deserved reputation for high quality pasture-fed and grain-finished beef. It is important that industry is able to pursue all avenues to access high-value markets and to promote growth in this sector”, Mr Groser said.  

“This additional access is therefore very welcome and will be good news for the sector. Not only does this allow New Zealand to offer a wider product range to European consumers, it indicates that New Zealand can add value to our more traditional beef exports”.

“From my discussions with New Zealand companies it is clear that we can be competitive in the higher-priced high quality area, not just manufacturing beef which traditionally has gone to the North American market. In the long-term, I see a bright future for New Zealand high quality beef production. This agreement, which has taken some time to negotiate, is absolutely a step in the right direction”.
