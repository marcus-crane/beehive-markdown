Prime Minister John Key has announced that His Majesty King Tupou V of Tonga will arrive in New Zealand today for a five-day visit.

“New Zealand enjoys a strong and friendly relationship with Tonga, with deep ties at a personal level and frequent contact between our Ministers and officials,” Mr Key says.

“It is an honour to welcome His Majesty King Tupou V to New Zealand and I look forward to meeting him on Tuesday as part of his official programme.

“Tonga was one of the first countries to offer support following the earthquakes in Canterbury. The Tongan Government and Red Cross have provided more than $650,000 to various earthquake fundraisers, and the Tongan community has also made a number of private donations.

“This generosity reflects the strong bond between our two countries and the concern felt in Tonga for the people of Christchurch and the Canterbury region,” Mr Key says.

As part of his visit King Tupou V will visit Linton Army Camp and the National War Memorial in Wellington, and will receive an official state welcome at Government House.

King Tupou V will return to Tonga on 6 July.
