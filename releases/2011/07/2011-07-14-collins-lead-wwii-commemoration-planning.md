Veterans’ Affairs Minister Judith Collins will prepare a Cabinet paper on how the Government honours the service of veterans at further WWII 70th anniversary commemorations.

“New Zealand owes the peace and freedom we enjoy today to the courage and sacrifice of our service veterans,” Ms Collins said.

“It is very important that we honour those veterans who served during WWII, and give them whatever help we can to attend significant commemorations overseas.

“The Cabinet paper will look at how we can help veterans get to the rest of the 70th anniversary commemorations with the support they need, be that a family member or helper.

“Given that many WWII veterans are in their 90s and not able to undertake extensive overseas travel, the paper will also explore what can be done here in New Zealand to commemorate significant WWII battles.”

Ms Collins will be consulting with the Ministers of Defence, Culture and Heritage, and Foreign Affairs, along with groups representing veterans in the preparation of the paper.

Work on the paper will begin immediately. Ms Collins hopes to present it to Cabinet in September.
