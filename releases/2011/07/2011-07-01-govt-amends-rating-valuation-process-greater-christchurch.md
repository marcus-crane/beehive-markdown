The rating valuation systems for two Canterbury councils have been changed from 30 June 2011 following the devastating earthquakes that have struck the region, Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson said today.

The next general revaluation for Christchurch City Council has been extended to 1 December 2013 and 1 December 2012 for Waimakariri District Council. The July 2012 date for Selwyn District Council remains unchanged.

Government legislation also amends the circumstances for altering rating values between general revaluations.

That means owners of homes that have been demolished - or are scheduled to be demolished - will only be required to pay rates on the land itself.

This allows councils to continue to maintain a working rating valuation system, and ensure they have the necessary rates income to provide essential services.

This process will not affect the Government's offers of purchase to property owners in the designated residential red zone.

"This is a critical period in the recovery of greater Christchurch. We need to keep resources focused on getting services and processes back to normal, rather than determining interim value changes to partially damaged properties," Mr Williamson says.

"This legislation is a practical measure that will offer assurance to councils around funding, and property owners concerned about how the rating valuations system will be applied in the short term," Mr Williamson says.
