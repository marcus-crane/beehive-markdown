Changes to the makeup of the New Zealand Fire Service Commission Board have been announced by Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy today.

Former Deputy Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Wyatt Creech, moves from Deputy Chair to the Chair of the Board. Mr Creech succeeds Dame Margaret Bazley, Chair for the past 12 years, whose term expires on 31 July 2011.

Mr Creech was a minister for nine years. He is an experienced corporate director and has been a member of the Fire Commission since September 2009.

“Mr Creech has significant experience in economic management, business and finance issues."

Current Commission Board member, David McFarlane QSM, has been appointed Deputy Chair.

David McFarlane served as the Chief Fire Officer of the Renwick District and has been a volunteer firefighter for over 35 years. He is a former President of the United Fire Brigades’ Association and has been honoured for his strong contribution to the voluntary sector and community.

Former Treasury Deputy Secretary, Angela Hauk-Willis from Kapiti becomes a new board member.

Angela Hauk-Willis has considerable experience in public sector management and administration. She was a Treasury Deputy Secretary for 12 years where she led major organisational change. She is also a member of the Independent Police Conduct Authority.

Mr Guy paid tribute to Dame Margaret for her contribution over 12 years.

“Dame Margaret has been a huge asset with her work ethic and strong experience across the public sector. She has played a major role in modernising the Fire Service and has always been a strong supporter of volunteer firefighters.”

All appointments commence on 1 August 2011. The appointments of Mr Creech and Mr McFarlane are for the remainder of their terms to 30 September 2012. Angela Hauk-Willis’ term is for three years concluding on 31 July 2014.
