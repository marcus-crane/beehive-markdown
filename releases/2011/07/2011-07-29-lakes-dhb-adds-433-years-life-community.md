Health Minister Tony Ryall has congratulated the Lakes District Health Board for achieving 100 per cent in the ‘Better Help for Smokers to Quit’ preventive health target, in the last quarter.

The national preventive health target is that 90 per cent of hospitalised smokers get advice and support to quit, and Lakes is the first DHB to achieve 100 per cent for a quarter.

Mr Ryall presented the team with a special certificate during a visit to Rotorua Hospital this morning and said, “In the last three months, 1154 smokers were admitted to Lakes DHB hospitals, and every single one of them was offered brief advice to quit.

"Research shows that advice from a health professional plus ongoing support such as nicotine replacement therapy, doubles the chance of a successful quit attempt. And these numbers equate to 433 years of life added back to this community."

One average, people who smoke will die 15 years younger than non-smokers.

The ‘Better Help for Smokers to Quit’ preventive health target was introduced as one of six Government health targets in 2009. As well as hospital patients, we are also counting the number of GP patients who are encouraged to quit, and we are part way through a programme lifting the excise tax on tobacco products.

“This is more than just another box-ticking exercise, it’s about saving lives,” Mr Ryall said.
