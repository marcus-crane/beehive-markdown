Minister of Local Government Rodney Hide today announced the appointment of Anne Carter as a new member of the Local Government Commission.

“Ms Carter is an experienced former public servant with particular focus on strategy development, policy formation, and implementation of government programmes at both a national and local level,” Mr Hide said.

“She was the Deputy Secretary of Local Government and Community at the Department of Internal Affairs between 2004 and 2010. During this time she played a key role in co-ordinating the Auckland Governance reforms. Most recently she was the Executive Director of the Pike River Royal Commission.

“Ms Carter’s extensive experience in local and national government issues will be of great value to the Local Government Commission. Ms Carter also meets the statutory requirement for one Local Government Commission member to have knowledge of tikanga Māori. Ms Carter is of Ngāti Kahungunu descent.

“Ms Carter succeeds outgoing member Gwen Bull and will commence her three year term on 1 August 2011,” Mr Hide said.

*The Local Government Commission is an independent statutory body established under the Local Government Act 2002.  Its main roles are to make decisions about the structure and boundaries of local government and the representation arrangements for local authorities.*
