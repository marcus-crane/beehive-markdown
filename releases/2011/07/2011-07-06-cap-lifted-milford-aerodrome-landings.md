The cap intended to be placed on aircraft landings at Milford Aerodrome will be removed and concession applications reactivated for affected operators, Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson announced today.

The concept of a cap was introduced under the Fiordland National Park Management Plan in 2007 as a means of managing the accumulative adverse effects of aircraft activity.

Using the limit established in the Park Plan, DOC ran a competitively contested allocation process for those wishing to land at Milford.

As a result, a number of operators who had historically used Milford Aerodrome missed out on gaining concessions, which could have put their businesses at risk.

Ms Wilkinson says the decision to remove the cap means DOC can reconsider applications, allowing all aircraft activity to now be properly managed with a focus on mitigating their effects.

“An arbitrary cap on landings is a blunt instrument that unfortunately could have put air operators out of business, without actually addressing the impacts of the activity on the environment,” Ms Wilkinson says.

“It was also unnecessary, as the weather acts as a natural cap.

“Records show flight landings have not reached 9000 for the past nine years, as the weather means aircraft can only fly on roughly 200-250 days each year.

“DOC will now work with the tourism and local aviation industry on the best ways to reduce noise levels, including developing a code of management and monitoring regime.

“Milford Sound is known as one of New Zealand's most iconic tourism destinations – recognised for its grandeur and natural beauty. It attracts over 500,000 visitors per year.

“We want to support the tourism industry and by removing the cap DOC is in a better position to work with all operators to ensure the values that make Milford Sound special are protected.”
