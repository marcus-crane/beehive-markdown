William Peet has been appointed to the new civilian role of Chief Operating Officer of the New Zealand Defence Force, Defence Minister Wayne Mapp announced today.

“The creation of this position expands the expertise of the NZDF’s Executive Leadership Team,” Dr Mapp said.

The new role in the leadership structure was promulgated in last year’s Defence White Paper.

“Mr Peet will be an important driver of the reforms taking place in the Defence Force. He will make an essential contribution in achieving the Government’s priorities for the NZDF in a period of considerable change.

“This is an outstanding appointment. He has significant experience in leading, planning and managing change in large complex settings,” Dr Mapp said.

Mr Peet has recently been a consultant for the New Zealand Aid Programme in Afghanistan.

He spent most of his earlier career in railways, including 13 years as a senior executive with the New Zealand Railways Corporation, Tranz Rail, and Toll New Zealand.

Mr Peet has been appointed for five years and will take up the position in August.

The Chief Operating Officer is equal in status to Vice-Chief of Defence Force. The VCDF will continue to hold primary responsibility for the military functions of the NZDF.
