Prime Minister John Key today announced he will be visiting the United States later this month and will meet President Barack Obama in Washington DC.

The visit will take place from 18 to 22 July, and will include a full two-day programme in Washington DC as well as time in San Francisco and Los Angeles.

The meeting with President Obama is scheduled for Friday 22 July local time (Saturday NZ time).

“The bilateral relationship with the United States is one of New Zealand’s most important,” says Mr Key. “The relationship has improved over recent years, and I hope the visit will further strengthen ties.”

“Issues that I anticipate will be canvassed in Washington DC include the global and US economic outlook, the bilateral relationship, trade, and other Asia-Pacific regional issues,” says Mr Key.

The visit to Washington DC will also include a range of other meetings with US Government agencies, a speech to the United States Chamber of Commerce, and other events. 

The full schedules for the Washington DC and the West Coast legs of the visit are still being finalised.
