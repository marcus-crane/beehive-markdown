Health Minister Tony Ryall says the Fifth Annual Report of the Perinatal and Maternal Mortality Review committee (2009) confirms that maternity services are performing well, but improvements are needed.

"While today's report states our perinatal mortality rate is comparable to rates reported in Australia and the UK, New Zealand can do better.

"The government is delivering on its plan to improve maternity services, and today I am launching key parts of the new maternity quality and safety programme.

"This is the result of two years of collaborative work by a wide cross section of health professionals in maternity services. The programme will improve communication, teamwork and the quality of maternity care for New Zealand women.

"For the first time, the Perinatal and Maternal Mortality Review Committee data collection included information about factors that may have contributed to a perinatal related death and it reports that nearly 14% of these deaths in 2009 were potentially avoidable.

"Each one of these cases is a tragedy and the government is determined that the public health service can do better.

"I remain concerned about the high rate of maternal mortality in 2009, especially the high rates of maternal suicide and flu related deaths.

"Budget 2011 delivered an additional $54 million for extra WellChild visits and improved communication between midwives and doctors caring for pregnant women, and WellChild nurses. This is expected to make a difference by offering more support to new mothers who are facing mental health problems

"The results also highlight the additional risk from influenza faced by pregnant women. The Government made the flu vaccine free for pregnant women during the outbreak in 2009, which undoubtedly assisted to reduce the illness rates in pregnant women, but despite this we had several deaths.

"I have requested all appropriate health professional colleges to respond to the results and recommendations of the PMMRC. The Health Quality and Safety Commission will take a lead in responding to the report.

"Clearly some things need to change - that’s what the Government’s maternity quality and safety programme is about. We are determined to improve the services new parents and babies receive.

"When a baby or mother dies, it is devastating for everyone involved – we want the best systems in place to protect the safety of mothers and babies – and that’s what we are doing. Today’s report highlights why this work is so important."
