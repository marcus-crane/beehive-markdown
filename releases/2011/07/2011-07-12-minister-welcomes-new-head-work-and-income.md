Social Development Minister Paula Bennett is pleased to welcome Janet Grossman as the new head of Work and Income.

Janet is taking up the role as Ministry of Social Development Deputy Chief Executive at a significant point in time.

“Work and Income have faced an extraordinarily big job since the 2009 recession and continue to work hard to help beneficiaries,” says Ms Bennett

“This is a big job and I’m confident Janet will quickly prove a valuable asset for Work and Income,” says Ms Bennett.

Originally from the United States, Janet has lived in the UK for the past decade, gaining high-level experience in the public and private sectors.

Most recently she was Director of Strategy and Execution for the Northern European Division of IT company Computer Sciences Corporation.

In the public sector, Janet was the Chief Operating Officer for the Pensions Service within the Department of Work and Pensions.

The Service had over 10,000 staff and expenditure of £60 billion.

“We’re fortunate to gain Janet’s skills and experience as we work to reduce unemployment and improve the economic well-being of all New Zealanders.”

“Her experience demonstrates that she has the skills and qualities required to lead this important part of the Ministry and I look forward to working with her.”
