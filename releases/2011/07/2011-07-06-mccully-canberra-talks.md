The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Murray McCully, is making a one day visit to Canberra to hold talks with his Australian counterpart, Kevin Rudd.

“With New Zealand hosting the 40th annual Pacific Islands Forum meeting in Auckland in September the visit to Canberra is timely,” said Mr McCully.

“Our discussions will focus on the Forum meeting and related Pacific issues, and co-ordination of aid delivery,” he said.

“A major theme at this year’s Forum is how to turn the Pacific region’s potential into prosperity and identify ways we can work together to bring about lasting improvements to the lives of Pacific people,” Mr McCully said.

“Australia certainly shares this view so we welcome Minister Rudd’s perspective on ways to lift economic performance in the Pacific” he said.

The Minister departs New Zealand tonight and returns tomorrow evening.
