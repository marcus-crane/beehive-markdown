Small Business Minister Maurice Williamson has presented Phil and Janette Hall, owners of the Kiwi Ideas Company, the Supreme Award at the ANZ Flying Start Business Awards in Wellington today.

The Masterton company won over the judges and 500 other entries with a business plan to market their patented brand of scratch and fog resistant safety goggles, Safe Eyes.

The $60,000 prize package from Business.govt.nz includes $30,000 cash provided by ANZ, social media and website design provided by hairyLemon, legal advice provided by Lane Neave, advertising and editorial provided by NZBusiness Magazine, and training provided by Stellaris.

“The Kiwi Ideas Company impressed the judges with an excellent business plan outlining how they intend to take their products further into the world market,” Mr Williamson said.

“Their drive and ambition should be an inspiration to all small business owners.”

Auckland’s Jeff Broad of Autogrow Systems Ltd won the $10,000 ANZ exporter prize, with his greenhouse control system judged to have the best export potential. A further 16 businesses were awarded $3,000 regional prize packages.
