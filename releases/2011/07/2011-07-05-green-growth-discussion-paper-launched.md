New Zealand needs to consider how it leverages off its clean green brand in global markets and how new technologies can be developed to reduce environmental impacts, Environment Minister Nick Smith and Acting Minister for Economic Development David Carter say.

The Ministers today launched the Advisory Group on Green Growth's discussion paper in Wellington. The eight-member Advisory Group was announced by the Government in January to ensure the Government receives the best advice on green growth initiatives.

“There is significant work occurring internationally on green growth, green jobs, and clean technology. We need to ensure Government policy helps New Zealand take up the opportunities,” Dr Smith said.

“New Zealand has a strong heritage of innovative policies that support green growth like the ITQ system in fisheries, the ETS to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and schemes that enable the cap and trading of nutrients into water catchments. This work is about identifying future policy that will support business innovation and technologies that will grow the economy as well as improve the environment.”

Mr Carter said: “This is another part of the Government's plan to build a faster growing economy. The world is looking for products and services that have lower environmental impacts and we want New Zealand to be well placed to take up these opportunities.

“This discussion paper draws on green growth work from the OECD and seeks input on how Government can help businesses transition to a low-carbon economy. We encourage businesses to engage with the Advisory Group to support its report to Government in December,” the Ministers said.
