Victims of serious crime and sexual violence will be able to apply for additional support and services from today.

Justice Minister Simon Power said the five additional entitlements take the total number of Offender Levy-funded services to 13.

“These additional services are thanks to the $50 Offender Levy being collected more quickly than anticipated,” Mr Power said.

The levy is automatically imposed on all convicted offenders at sentencing.

“The levy was initially forecast to collect $13.6 million for victims in its first four years, but that’s been revised to $15.9 million after the levy collected $3 million in its first 10 months, almost a million more than forecast.”

The new entitlements, which come into effect today, include:

• Expanded financial assistance of up to $1,000 for victims attending justice- related meetings (such as restorative justice meetings, coronial hearings, and meetings with court-based victims advisers).

• Financial assistance for families whose loved ones have been killed through a criminal act that is not homicide (such as dangerous driving causing death, or careless use of a firearm). This includes up to 30 trauma counselling sessions, and discretionary grant of up to $3,000.

• A court attendance allowance of $100 a day for both victims of sexual violence and their unpaid support person.

• A means-tested emergency grant of up to $2,000 for economically disadvantaged victims of a serious crime who require special assistance (such as emergency accommodation, new security locks, trauma counselling, and relocation costs) but have no income to provide for their needs.

“A priority for this Government has been to improve the justice system for those who find themselves in it through no fault of their own. Having 13 entitlements for victims funded through the Offender Levy is an important part of that.”

July 1 also marks the establishment of the new Victims Centre within the Ministry of Justice.

The centre provides oversight of victims’ rights, services, and resources across government agencies. It will provide information to people working directly with victims of crime and help government and community agencies to better co-ordinate their services.

“One of the centre’s first tasks will be to develop a Victims Code which will clearly define the standard of service that victims can expect to receive from government agencies,” Mr Power said.
