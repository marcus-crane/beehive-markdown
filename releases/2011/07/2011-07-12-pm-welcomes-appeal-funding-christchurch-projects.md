Prime Minister John Key today welcomed the announcement that Christchurch businesses, community groups and children are set to receive funding in the latest round of disbursements from the Government’s Christchurch Earthquake Appeal.

“Since the Appeal was set up in February, people from around the country and the world have dug deep to help Christchurch recover. That generosity has given the Appeal the opportunity to assist a wide variety of worthy projects which will help make a difference to Christchurch.

“Today’s announcement brings a boost to so many Christchurch residents, and reinforces the message that Christchurch is focusing on its future.”

The Appeal’s projects include accommodation for community organisations, small businesses and CBD retailers; assistance for Women’s Refuge; an arts programme for school pupils; and a community facility for children in the eastern suburbs.

Details for each of the projects are being worked through. Final agreements will cover the way the money will be paid, the work to be done, and the accountability of those spending the donated money.

The Christchurch Earthquake Appeal is the Government’s official, global fundraiser for the recovery in Christchurch and the Canterbury region. Since it was launched in February, over $90 million in total has been donated and pledged to the Appeal.
