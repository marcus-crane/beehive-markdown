**Leaky Homes Financial Assistance Package available from 29 July 2011**

The Government’s leaky homes Financial Assistance Package will be available from tomorrow, Friday 29 July, Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson said today.

Under the package, qualifying homeowners will receive a 25 per cent contribution from the Government and may receive 25 per cent from their local council. The contributions will be based on actual repair costs.

Qualifying claimants will also need to demonstrate they can pay their share of the repair cost.

“Now that all parties have agreed to the financial assistance package we will see more leaky homes fixed rather than homeowners spending thousands of dollars in costly litigation,” Mr Williamson says.

“I am proud that this Government has been able to deliver owners of leaky homes a positive, alternative way of getting their home fixed so they can move on with their lives.”

Homeowners who want to know whether they qualify for the package should visit the Department of Building and Housing website at [www.leakyhomes.govt.nz](http://www.leakyhomes.govt.nz/).
