Thousands of tonnes of used disposable nappies in Wellington are to be composted rather than going to landfill as a consequence of an innovative Kiwi business supported by the Government, Environment Minister Nick Smith announced today.

“Disposable nappies are very convenient for busy modern families but people are concerned about the impact of waste on the environment. This innovation enables parents to enjoy the convenience without getting the environmental guilts,” Dr Smith said.

EnviroComp uses a purpose built ‘HotRot’ composting plant to breakdown disposable nappy waste into a safe, odourless compost. It began in 2009 at its site in Balcairn, North Canterbury and is now expanding the business to Wellington with a new plant being built in the Hutt Valley.

“The Government’s Waste Minimisation Fund is about supporting this sort of green growth business. We were pleased to fund a feasibility study in 2010 and are now contributing a $700,000 grant for the Wellington plant,” Dr Smith said.

“New Zealand should be very proud of this new composting technology for disposable nappies. It shows that Kiwi ingenuity is able to develop world-leading practical ideas that fit with our clean, green brand.”

“It is estimated there are 17,500 babies aged under two and a half in the Wellington region wearing disposable nappies producing 6600 tonnes of waste each year. The aim is to divert 1000 tonnes of this waste every year into the new composting facility.

“This nappy composting enterprise is consistent with the Government’s Bluegreen agenda of developing new businesses that improve our environmental management.”
