New Zealand is committed to working closely with government, private sector, and community partners in Niue to help realise the island’s full tourism potential, Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced.

Mr McCully was in Niue on Saturday as part of the 2011 Pacific Mission.

“Niue’s relative isolation and population size are challenges for economic development, but the country’s natural beauty and unique environment provide significant tourism opportunities”, Mr McCully said.

“With attractions like whale watching, diving, caving and hiking, Niue’s tourism market differs from other Pacific destinations and offers a special experience for adventure seeking travellers.”

“New Zealand is pleased to be contributing both expertise and infrastructure to support growth in this sector.  Tourism benefits not just airlines and accommodation providers. There is real value and potential for the local community both in terms of employment and associated commercial opportunities in tourism services”, the Minister said,

“New Zealand will invest NZ$15 million over three years for a tourism development strategy designed to equip Niue with the essential infrastructure and management systems needed to cement the island as a boutique tourism destination, Mr McCully said.

“Our support for tourism in Niue has already contributed to a new visitor’s centre and the redevelopment of the Matavai Resort, assistance for private sector tourism operators, and support for reliable international air services.”

“The benefits of developing increased promotion of Niue as a tourist destination are already evident, with increasing demands for flights and occupancy at the Matavai Resort at almost full capacity over the high season this year”, the Minister said.

Niue was the final destination on the five day Pacific Mission that also saw Mr McCully travel to Tonga, Samoa and the Cook Islands.
