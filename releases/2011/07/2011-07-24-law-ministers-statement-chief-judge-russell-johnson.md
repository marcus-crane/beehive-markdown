Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson, Justice Minister Simon Power and Courts Minister Georgina Te Heuheu have all expressed their shock and sorrow at the death of Chief Judge Russell Johnson, who led the District Court for the last six years.

“Chief Judge Russell Johnson was an outstanding leader for what is the largest court in Australasia and the frontline of our justice system,” Mr Finlayson said. “Most recently his leadership was evident in the support he provided to judges and the courts community in Christchurch following February's earthquake.”

“Chief Judge Johnson worked constructively with the Government to improve the operation of the District Court,” Mr Power said. “He made valuable contributions to the current criminal procedure reform programme and the development of a new District Court operating model in Auckland.”

“A Chief Judge has huge administrative responsibilities but Russell Johnson was every bit a team player,” Mrs Te Heuheu said. “Quite often he would sit in District Courts in every corner of New Zealand to cover for judges who were unavailable for some reason.”

On behalf of the government, the three ministers expressed their sadness and extended their sympathy to his wife Margaret, their family, and all the District Court Judges who will be keenly feeling this loss.
