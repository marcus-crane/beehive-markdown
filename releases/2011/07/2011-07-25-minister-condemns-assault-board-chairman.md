Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson has condemned the brutal assault endured by Waikato Conservation Board Chairman Arthur Hinds at the Tairua Community Hall on the weekend.

Mr Hinds is currently leading a private landowner 1080 operation at Whenuakite, which includes his own property, another private property and some conservation land.

He was arriving at a community-led meeting about marine protection on the Coromandel when he was allegedly attacked by anti-1080 activists outside the hall.

The assault has been reported to police.

Ms Wilkinson says the incident is not the first and the anti-1080 movement on the Coromandel was growing increasingly violent.

“1080 is an emotive issue for some people and they are entitled to their views, but they have no right to physically attack members of the community who only wish to protect our bush and wildlife from predators.

“Anti-1080 activists on the Coromandel have a history of intimidating and threatening DOC staff.

“Arthur works hard to promote conservation issues in Waikato and I doubt the actions of a few cowards will deter him.

“The individuals involved in this attack will be rightly dealt with by the police but the community also needs to stand up and send a strong message condemning this atrocious behaviour.”
