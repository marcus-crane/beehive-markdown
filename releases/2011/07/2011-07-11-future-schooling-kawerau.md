Education Minister Anne Tolley says the reorganisation of schools in Kawerau will bring a much brighter future for education in the town, and raise achievement levels for students.

“The decisions announced today, including some changes as a result of community feedback during consultation, will provide certainty for students, schools and communities,” says Mrs Tolley.

“The viability of some schools could have been at risk in the long-term due to falling rolls and the resulting reduction in funding, and I am confident that the decisions made will allow a much more effective education for students.”

• Kawerau North, Kawerau Central, and Putauaki Primary Schools will merge on the Putauaki School site, to become a year 1-8 primary school, with the possibility of becoming a year 1-6 school in the future. As part of this process, at least $1.4 million in funding will be made available to support the transition of students and raise student achievement.

• A Māori immersion kura will be established on the site of Kawerau North School, catering for year 1-8 students. The kura is expected to begin the new school year with 60 enrolled students.

• Kawerau South School will remain as a year 1-6 primary school.

The changes will be made in time for the new school year in 2012, and the Ministry will work closely with schools to ensure a smooth transition for students to their new schools.

“After receiving valuable feedback I have decided that more consultation needs to be held on the future of Kawerau Intermediate School and Kawerau College,” says Mrs Tolley.

“This consultation will focus on the possible establishment of a new school, with a year 7-10 campus and a year 11-13 campus on one site.

“Details of the consultation on senior schooling in the town will be announced soon, with any resulting changes taking place in 2013.”
