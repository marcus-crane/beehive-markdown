Prime Minister John Key is shocked and saddened at the latest terrorist attacks on the Indian city of Mumbai.

More than 20 people were killed and many more injured in the three bombings which happened simultaneously in Wednesday’s rush hour.

Mr Key has only recently returned from India and, while in Mumbai, he paid tribute to the people who were killed in the November 2008 terrorist attacks.

“Signing the condolence book at the Taj Palace Hotel was an emotional experience. The 2008 attacks were a terrifying experience with devastating consequences.

“These good and kind people did not deserve to be targeted by terrorists again. The people responsible for these cowardly attacks against civilians deserve nothing but contempt.

“I join with other world leaders in condemning the perpetrators while sending Prime Minister Singh and the people of Mumbai my heartfelt condolences.”
