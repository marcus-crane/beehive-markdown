Wellington lawyer Alan Ritchie has been appointed Deputy Judicial Conduct Commissioner for a term of five years, Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson announced today.

Mr Ritchie was admitted as a Barrister and Solicitor in 1971. He practiced with Spencer and Ritchie in Ashburton and Chapman Tripp Sheffield and Young in Wellington for 12 years. He has been a Consultant to the New Zealand Law Society since 2008 and was the CEO and Executive Director from 1985 to 2008. He is also a member of the New Zealand Parole Board and has previously stood in for a Judicial Conduct Commissioner.

The role of Judicial Conduct Commissioner was established by the Judicial Conduct Commissioner and Judicial Conduct Panel Act 2004. The position of Deputy Judicial Conduct Commissioner was established in 2010.

The current Judicial Conduct Commissioner is Sir David Gascoigne DCNZM CBE.

The Commissioner is the first avenue for all complaints about Judges. The Commissioner carries out preliminary examination of complaints to determine whether a complaint will be dismissed or referred to the relevant Head of Bench, or is serious enough to warrant an investigation by a Judicial Conduct Panel. The Deputy Judicial Conduct Commissioner carries out these functions in relation to matters where the Judicial Conduct Commissioner is absent from office, incapacitated, or has determined he has a conflict of interest.
