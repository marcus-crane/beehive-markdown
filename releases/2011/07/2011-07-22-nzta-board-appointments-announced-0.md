Transport Minister Steven Joyce today announced two new appointments and two reappointments to the Board of the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA).

New Board member Adrienne Young-Cooper has been appointed for the period 1 August 2011 to 30 April 2014.

“Adrienne Young-Cooper has in-depth knowledge of the transport sector and more than 25 years’ governance experience, as well as an impressive background in urban development and Auckland local government. She will be a valuable addition to the NZTA Board,” says Mr Joyce.

Ms Young-Cooper is based in Auckland and is a certified resource management commissioner, professional company director and town planner. She currently holds a number of directorships, including Deputy Chair of Housing New Zealand Corporation, Director of Solid Energy New Zealand Ltd, Deputy Chair of Auckland Waterfront Development Agency Ltd (Waterfront Auckland) and Hobsonville Land Company Ltd. She has previously been a member of the Maritime New Zealand Board and was Deputy Chair of the Auckland Regional Transport Authority.

Current Board member Patsy Reddy has been newly appointed as Deputy Chair for the period 1 August 2011 to 30 September 2012.

“Patsy Reddy has been a strong contributor since she joined the NZTA Board in October last year. Her governance experience and work with iwi are important skills for the Board, and I am sure she will make an excellent contribution in the Deputy Chair role.”

Mr Joyce also announced the reappointment of Board members Alick Shaw until 30 April 2014 and Bryan Jackson until 31 October 2012.

Two others, Deputy Chair Garry Moore and member Christine Caughey, retired from the Board on 30 June 2011.

“I want to acknowledge the fine work of Garry Moore and Christine Caughey during their time on the NZTA Board. They have been members since the NZTA was established on 1 August 2008, and Garry was a member of the Establishment Board for the NZTA. They have demonstrated great leadership of the organisation and I wish both of them all the best for their future endeavours.”
