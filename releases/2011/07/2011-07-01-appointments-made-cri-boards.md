Science and Innovation Minister Wayne Mapp has announced new appointments and reappointments to the boards of Crown research institutes, effective today.

“New Zealand needs more from its science and innovation system. Through last year’s CRI Taskforce recommendations we gave the Crown research institutes a new sense of drive and purpose.

“They are now much more aligned with their sectors, ensuring that their work is fully utilised for New Zealand’s wider benefit.

“Now that the Government is devolving core funding to CRIs, getting the right directors has never been more important. In this year’s appointment round we have freshened the membership and expanded the skillsets around the CRI board tables.

“There is an ongoing focus on appointing a mix of directors to the boards – combining the experience of proven governance professionals with new talent and their ideas,” the Minister said.

There are 12 new appointments this year, including a chair. Two current directors have been promoted to Deputy Chair of their boards. \[See full list below]

“I would like to acknowledge the contribution of the former chair of IRL, Keith McConnell, and thank the new chair, deputy chairs and directors for agreeing to serve on the various boards,” Dr Mapp said.

**New chair**

Michael Ludbrook has been appointed chair of Industrial Research Ltd, succeeding Keith McConnell. Mr Ludbrook is a Te Puke-based chartered accountant, experienced director and management consultant, specialising in assisting clients with major strategic change, planning, and organisation improvement initiatives. He has considerable experience in most business disciplines, gained as a chief executive in the Australasian transport industry and the New Zealand electricity and health industries. In addition to his consulting assignments, Mr Ludbrook holds, or has held, a number of directorships and Community Trust positions, notably as a former chair of the Waikato District Health Board. Mr Ludbrook is a highly experienced governance and business professional with the depth of experience required to lead a company through a period of change.
