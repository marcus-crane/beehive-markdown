Justice Minister Simon Power leaves today for the triennial meeting of Commonwealth Law Ministers in Sydney.

The meeting is being hosted by Australian Attorney-General Robert McClelland and is expected to be attended by representatives of more than 50 Commonwealth countries.

“I’m looking forward to discussing a range of issues with my Commonwealth counterparts, including crime prevention, access to justice, and measures to enhance democracy,” Mr Power said.

“This meeting is important because it enables the Government to exchange its views on matters of common concern, as well as strengthening links with our Commonwealth counterparts.”

Mr Power will be accompanied by the Acting Secretary for Justice, Andrew Bridgman. He returns to New Zealand on Thursday.
