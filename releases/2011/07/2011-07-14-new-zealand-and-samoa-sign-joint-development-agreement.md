Foreign Minister Murray McCully and Samoan Prime Minister Hon Tuilaepa have today signed an agreement which sets out the priorities for New Zealand’s aid and development effort in Samoa.

“The Joint Commitment for Development that New Zealand and Samoa have entered into will make our aid programme in Samoa more targeted and will establish improved shared accountability for our development efforts,” Mr McCully said.

“New Zealand’s aid budget for Samoa will total more than NZ$23 million in the coming year, inclusive of NZ$6.6 million through regional assistance. It is critical that we are focusing our efforts in the areas that will deliver sustainable economic development and enhance the lives of many Samoan people.”

“Key features of New Zealand’s aid programme in Samoa are tourism and the development of the private sector, including the renewable energy and agriculture sectors. We will also make major investments in basic education, skills training, and health,” the Minister said.

“As part of New Zealand's commitment to the private sector in Samoa, we will provide up to NZ$4 million over five years to the Samoa Business Enterprise Centre.”

“The Samoa Business Enterprise Centre provides training, advice and financial assistance to small business and a recent independent assessment found that for every $1 invested in the centre, $3 in value was returned to the Samoan economy.”

“Discussions on our progress towards the mutually agreed goals set out in the Joint Commitment for Development will be held annually,” Mr McCully said.

Mr McCully is in Samoa as part of a four-country Pacific Mission. The delegation returns to New Zealand on 16 July.
