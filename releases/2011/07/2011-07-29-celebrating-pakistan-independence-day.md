The Minister for  Ethnic Affairs, Hekia Parata, is encouraging Kiwis to help celebrate the 64th Pakistan Independence Day celebration tomorrow.

The celebration, which is being held at  Auckland Auckland Girls Grammar, brings together the local Pakistani community to mark the 64th anniversary of the creation of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. 

According to the 2006 Census, there are 2,049 Pakistani people living in New Zealand.  The majority of the Pakistani community live in Auckland. 

“This community is growing as many skilled migrants settle here and make a valuable contribution to our economic development,’ Ms Parata says

“New Zealand's relationship with Pakistan is based strongly on sporting, educational and cultural links. 

“Trade is also an important aspect of this relationship with exports to Pakistan of around $93 million in 2009.  We also imported around $61 million from Pakistan in that same year’’

New Zealand also provides humanitarian aid to Pakistan.  In 2010, we contributed $4 million flood relief assistance for through UNICEF and other agencies; $500,000 flood relief assistance through UNHCR in 2007, and $2.25 million to various agencies following the 2005 earthquake.

“New Zealand’s relationship with Pakistan still has room to grow, with agriculture and education links of particular importance. 

“New Zealanders are involved in the development of Pakistan’s dairy industry and many Pakistani students are choosing New Zealand as a place to study.’’
