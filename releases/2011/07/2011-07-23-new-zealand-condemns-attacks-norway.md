Acting Prime Minister Bill English has condemned the twin attacks that are reported to have killed at least 80 people in Norway and left many more injured.

“I’m shocked and saddened at the news of the bombing and shootings,” Mr English says. “New Zealand joins with other countries in condemning these attacks on innocent people. Our thoughts and condolences are with the people of Norway at this time.”

A bomb blast ripped through the government district of central Oslo earlier today and a gunman later opened fire on young people at a youth camp on a nearby island.

“At this stage, there are no indications that any New Zealanders have been caught up in either incident. There are 61 New Zealanders registered as being in Norway and our embassy in The Hague, which is accredited to Norway, is in the process of making contact with them to confirm their wellbeing.

“In the meantime, we advise them to follow instructions issued by the local authorities and exercise a high degree of security awareness at this time,” Mr English says.
