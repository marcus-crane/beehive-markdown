Owners of leaky homes can get their homes fixed faster following the third reading of the Weathertight Homes Resolution Services (Financial Assistance Package) Bill in Parliament today, Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson says.

Under the $1 billion package, qualifying home owners will receive a 25 per cent contribution from the Government and may receive 25 per cent from their local council. The contributions will be based on actual repair costs.

“Help has been a long time coming but this Government has stepped up to deliver home owners this financial assistance package,” Mr Williamson says.

“I believe this is a fair solution that will assist many leaky home owners to get their homes fixed so they can move on with their lives.”

The package is voluntary and offers an additional option to the current Weathertight Homes Resolution Service. Home owners who discover they have a leaky home must lodge a claim within 10 years of the completion of building work to access the financial assistance package.

“I would urge home owners close to the 10-year limit to ‘stop the clock' by lodging a claim with the Department of Building and Housing now.”
