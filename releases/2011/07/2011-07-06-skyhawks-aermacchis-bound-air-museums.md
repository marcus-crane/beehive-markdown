A further six New Zealand aviation museums are to receive retired Air Force fighter jets, Defence Minister Wayne Mapp announced today.

The last three of nine Skyhawks earmarked for museums will be sent to:

• New Zealand Warbirds Association (Ardmore)

• Ashburton Aviation Museum

• Warbirds over Wanaka.

Three of the 16 Aermacchi jet trainers will also go on display at museums:

• Air Force Museum (Christchurch)

• George Hood Aviation Museum (Masterton)

• Museum of Transport and Technology (MOTAT, Auckland).

“These are aircraft with a proud service record,” Dr Mapp said.

“In their day the two fleets were key assets of the Royal New Zealand Air Force. Now they are a central part of our aviation history.

“Over the years, in various ways they have touched the lives of thousands of New Zealanders. Now they will be on display around the country for the enjoyment and education of future generations.

“They will be significant drawcards everywhere,” he said.

New homes for the other six Skyhawks have already been announced:

• Air Force Museum (two)

• MoTAT

• Classic Flyers NZ (Tauranga)

• Aviation Heritage Centre (Blenheim)

• Royal Australian Navy Fleet Air Arm Museum (Nowra, New South Wales).

The United States origin of the Skyhawks generates an obligation for routine approval from the US Department of State before the aircraft can be moved to the museums from their current location at the Woodbourne Air Force base.

The remaining aircraft in both fleets are on the market.
