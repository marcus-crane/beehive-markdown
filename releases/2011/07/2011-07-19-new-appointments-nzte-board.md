Economic Development Minister David Carter today welcomed the appointments of Karen Fistonich and Robin Hapi to the New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Board.

Mr Carter also announced the reappointment of Board Chair, Jon Mayson.

Karen Fistonich is currently Chairperson, and a longstanding member of the Villa Maria Estate Board.  She has considerable experience in the wine industry and has been involved in the development of two specialist vineyard companies.

She is also a member of the New Zealand Global Women network which encourages women into senior and leadership roles.

Robin Hapi has extensive experience in the fisheries industry and has held the roles of Chairman of Aotearoa Fisheries Ltd and Board Chair of Sealord Group since 2007.

He was previously CEO of the former Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission, and is currently Chair of BERL, a Commissioner for the Tertiary Education Commission, and Deputy Chair of the Council of Te Wānanga-o-Raukawa.

“Both Karen and Robin have considerable expertise in New Zealand’s primary export industries and I am confident they will make excellent contributions to the work of NZTE,” Mr Carter says.

“I would like to thank outgoing members Craig Ellison and Lorraine Witten for their service to the Board.  As longstanding Board members, they have made a solid contribution to trade promotion and economic development.”
