The next steps in progressing the Trans-Tasman Single Economic Market will be on the agenda when Finance Minister Bill English meets Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer Wayne Swan this week.

The ministers meet in Wellington on Thursday, before they share their views on the economic outlook for Australasia in speeches to a Trans-Tasman Business Circle lunch in the city.

“I’m looking forward to again catching up with Treasurer Swan to discuss a number of issues of mutual interest to New Zealand and Australia,” Mr English says. “Australia is our closest international and economic partner – it remains our largest export market and an important source of investment.

“I am keen to discuss next steps in the Single Economic Market agenda, and I would like to hear Mr Swan’s perspectives on the impact of the global economic situation on Australia and its economic outlook.

“At the same time, I’ll update him on our Canterbury earthquake recovery programme and, more broadly, outline our programme for building faster economic growth and getting back to budget surplus.”

Mr English and Mr Swan will also meet a group of New Zealand company chief executives to discuss how the Trans-Tasman economic partnership can be further strengthened.
