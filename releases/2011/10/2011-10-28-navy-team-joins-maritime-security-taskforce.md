New Zealand is sending five Navy personnel to join Australian forces fighting terrorism and piracy in the Indian Ocean, said Defence Minister Wayne Mapp.

“Threats to maritime security are a growing international problem and we must play our part in the international response,” said Dr Mapp.

“Terrorism, drug smuggling, people smuggling and piracy impact on security, trade and other economic activities of all nations.”

The New Zealander sailors will join the Combined Task Force 150

(CTF 150) – an international coalition force conducting maritime security operations across two million square miles of the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Oman.

“We have worked with the Australians many times before and this deployment is an excellent opportunity to improve inter-operability between our two navies,” said Dr Mapp.

CTF 150 is one of three missions within the Coalition Maritime Forces, a US-led coalition force. Earlier this year a Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) officer commanded CTF 151, a counter-piracy operation. Two other New Zealanders were also on this mission.

Captain Lance Cook, Royal New Zealand Navy, will be Deputy Commander of CTF 150 under an Australian commander. Another Navy officer will join him at the United States naval facility in Bahrain for four months from early December.

A three-person boat crew will join the Australian frigate HMAS Melbourne early next year for a six-month deployment.
