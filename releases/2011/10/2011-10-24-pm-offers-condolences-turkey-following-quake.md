Prime Minister John Key has today extended condolences on behalf of the Government and people of New Zealand to Turkey, following the devastating 7.2 magnitude earthquake in Van Province.

“New Zealanders know all too well the suffering and destruction major earthquakes can cause, and our sympathies are with those who are dealing with the aftermath of yesterday’s earthquake,” says Mr Key.

“New Zealand stands by ready to assist Turkey as it moves to recover from this event, and that offer has been made directly to Turkish authorities by the New Zealand Embassy in Ankara.”

Turkish authorities have confirmed 85 people have died as a result of the quake, with a further 400 injured. No New Zealanders are reported to be involved at this stage and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has no New Zealanders registered as being in Van Province.
