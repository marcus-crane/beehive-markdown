A survey showing New Zealanders are feeling safer is a tribute to the hard work and professionalism of Police, Police Minister Judith Collins said.

The latest trust and confidence survey results released by NZ Police show public confidence in Police has increased from 75 percent in 2009/10 to 77 percent in 2010/11.

The survey also shows an increase in people's sense of safety in their neighbourhoods and town centres.

The percentage of people who feel “totally positive” about safety in their neighbourhoods during the day has increased from 91 percent in 2008/09 to 93 percent in 2010/11.

Those who feel totally positive in their neighbourhoods at night has increased from 66 to 72 percent over the same period. The proportion of people who feel totally positive in their city or town after dark has increased from 45 percent to 53 percent.

“The Police are our first line of defence against crime. Over the past three years they have stepped up the pressure on criminals and worked more closely with communities to prevent crime from happening,” Ms Collins said.

“The hard work and professionalism of the 12,000 men and women serving with our Police is paying off. Trust and confidence in Police continues to grow because people can see the difference Police are making in their communities.

“This survey follows new crime statistics showing recorded crime has dropped 7 percent per head of population in the year to 30 June 2011.

“The numbers paint a very clear picture of a country where crime is in retreat, where criminals are not tolerated and where law abiding people feel safer at all hours of the day and night thanks to the great work of the New Zealand Police.”

The research, conducted by Gravitas Research & Strategy Ltd since 2008, shows public confidence in Police has increased every year from 69 percent in 2008/9 to 77 percent in 2010/11. Approximately 10,000 people are interviewed annually for the survey.
