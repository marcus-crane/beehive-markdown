The Minister of Defence, Wayne Mapp, has announced moves to develop a new advanced pilot training capability for the RNZAF. This will include new advanced trainer aircraft.

“In future pilots will train on fast and manoeuvrable aircraft which provide much more rigorous and realistic training. This will prepare them effectively for the demanding military flying they will be called upon to perform in service,” said Dr Mapp.

“The upgraded P3 Orion and C-130 Hercules aircraft and the NH90 helicopter are frontline military aircraft that are routinely flown well beyond normal civil parameters.

“Currently advanced pilot training is done using King Air B200s. These twin-engine civilian planes are limited in the power, manoeuvrability and cockpit visibility needed for training at this level.

“They are also not equipped with the modern generation electronic instruments, communications and situational awareness aids that are important features of our new and upgraded aircraft and helicopters.” 

Dr Mapp said last year’s Defence White Paper was clear that pilot training needs to match the full range of operational demands made on aircrew.

“A Request for Information from industry has been released today, covering provision of suitable aircraft as well as different training options including the use of simulators.”

“The Government is open to either leasing or purchasing aircraft, and innovative ways of managing the support and operation of new aircraft. We will be encouraging industry to work with the RNZAF to introduce this new training capability as quickly as possible.

“The project exemplifies the Government’s openness to working with industry to develop innovative solutions that deliver better services more efficiently.”

Dr Mapp noted the King Air fleet would still be needed for multi-engine and continuation training and utility transport tasks. A project to upgrade or replace the current King Airs, for which the lease expires at the end of June next year, is underway.
