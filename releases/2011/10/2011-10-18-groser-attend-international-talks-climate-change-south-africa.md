Tim Groser, Minister Responsible for International Climate Change Negotiations, leaves New Zealand today to attend a climate change meeting in South Africa.

In Stellenbosch, Mr Groser will attend informal Ministerial consultations on 20 – 21 October 2011 laying further groundwork for the United Nations climate change conference in Durban in December.

“Recent climate change negotiations in Panama highlighted the challenges we will face in Durban."

“Countries have differing views on the future of the Kyoto Protocol following the end of the first period of developed country emissions reduction commitments in December 2012. Those countries prepared to take further commitments under the Kyoto Protocol account for only 16% of global emissions, and will only do so in the context of a comprehensive outcome involving all major emitters.”

“This year we’ll be working for an agreement covering at least 80% of global emissions, to give us a fighting chance of securing the level of collective ambition required to keep on track to stabilise the world’s temperature increase to two-degrees Celsius or less.”

Following the consultations, Mr Groser will hold bilateral discussions with South African Trade Minister Dr Rob Davies.
