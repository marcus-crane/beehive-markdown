The Minister of Defence, Wayne Mapp, today launched the new Defence Capability Plan.

“This plan sets out how Defence will carry out the Defence White Paper strategies over the next decade,” said Dr Mapp.

“It will guide our decisions on shaping frontline units and on the equipment and capability they will have. It takes into account affordability, resources and defence priorities”.

“The plan is not just a list of projects and equipment. Capability for the Defence Force is about transporting and sustaining a deployable Defence Force here and overseas. It is about using modern technology to give the entire defence force a common operating picture. And it is about ensuring our men and women in uniform are equipped to meet all the challenges they face, from combat through to disaster relief.”

The plan includes new projects covering the next decade, including upgrading or replacing the Seasprite helicopters, a systems upgrade for the ANZAC frigates, a Special Forces Battle Training facility, and a land transport capability programme.

“An important project is a new pilot training capability, including finding advanced training aircraft to replace the current King Air B200s,” said Dr Mapp.

There are also plans for network-enabled systems which are interoperable across the Defence Force and multinationally.

Dr Mapp said the plan signals good opportunities for local industry.

“Industry is a key partner in delivering new and upgraded equipment, and in maintaining it. We already work closely with a number of companies, and there will be many more opportunities for industry, particularly in infrastructure and information technology projects.”

He said the projects in the Capability Plan could be funded for the next ten years from accumulated depreciation, with no need for extra capital. Any increase in costs would be met by reallocating existing resources within Defence.
