A New Zealand Defence Force C-130 has arrived in Tuvalu this afternoon to deliver New Zealand Red Cross supplies and personnel to address severe water shortages, Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced.

“Tuvalu has declared a state of emergency relating to water shortages in the capital, Funafuti, and a number of outer islands,” Mr McCully said.

“A New Zealand Defence Force C-130 left this morning to take supplies and personnel to Tuvalu. The supplies include two desalination units as well as water containers.

“Two Ministry of Foreign Affairs staff on board, including our Wellington-based High Commissioner, will remain in Tuvalu to help assess needs on the ground.

“New Zealand will be working with partners and other donors to consider the best medium-to-long-term response options.”
