The Acting Minister of Energy and Resources, Hekia Parata, today welcomed the launch of a special project that will see the homes of many Pacific Island people in Wellington and Dunedin made warmer and healthier.

The Pacific Peoples Healthier Homes project aims to reduce respiratory illness rates in Pacific Island people, by insulating homes at little cost to the homeowner.

The programme is being run by the Pacific Peoples Wellbeing Trust and is part of Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart, the Government’s insulation and heating programme.

A thousand Pacific Island homes in Wellington and 100 in Dunedin will be targeted under the agreement – the first of its kind to specifically target the insulation of Pacific Island homes. The programme will be delivered by Wellington-based company Home&dry.

Regional Public Health has contributed $200,000 to the project. Further funding contributions are expected from other organisations and groups, with an interest in the health and wellbeing of the Pacific Island community, to top up the subsidy offered by the Government.

“I applaud the Trust for taking the initiative with this project. Warm houses lower the risk of people getting sick – and that is especially important for the young, the elderly and people with respiratory illnesses such as asthma,” said Ms Parata, at today's launch in Porirua.

The Government is investing $347 million in Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart over four years to provide insulation and efficient heating for New Zealand homes. More than 120,000 homes throughout the country have already been insulated.

“The Government’s funding commitment reflects the many benefits that insulated homes deliver, including reduced energy costs and health benefits.

“Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart special co-funding projects make insulating more affordable for groups, communities or regions that have some specific need for example a health issue, and priority will be given to people in this situation and those with a low income,” said Ms Parata.

Anyone whose home was built before 2000 is eligible for funding towards insulation and efficient heating under the programme.

“I hope that potential funders will be inspired to take similar action to the Pacific Peoples Wellbeing Trust, so that community groups in other regions can also benefit from warmer and drier homes,'' said Ms Parata.

 

**Background Info**

The Government will contribute 60 per cent of the insulation cost for households with Community Service Card (CSC) holders and 33 per cent for non CSC holders. The householders will contribute 10 per cent of the cost, and the Pacific Peoples Healthier Homes project will provide the rest.

Anyone of Pacific Island descent can apply. Priority will be given to those on a low income and with health needs. For more information about the Government’s insulation programme Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart see [www.energywise.govt.nz](http://www.energywise.govt.nz)
