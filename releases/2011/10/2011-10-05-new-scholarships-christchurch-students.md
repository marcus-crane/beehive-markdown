Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced $1 million of funding for new scholarship awards for Year 13 Christchurch students whose plans for tertiary study may have been affected by the recent earthquakes.

The Canterbury Earthquake Scholarships will provide $2,000 each year for three years of study for 160 students.

“This additional financial support will help students take on tertiary study after what has been a traumatic time,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Students showed great resilience following the February earthquake, with many having to share school sites and go to school in shifts, and these scholarships will ease the burden for some whose families have been affected financially.

“The application process was developed along with schools and communities. Schools will be working with students to complete their applications, while the students can nominate community members to speak in favour of their application.

“I have also told NZQA to ensure that the number of scholarships for high-achieving students is maintained at the same level as previous years.”

The new scholarships will be available to students who are enrolled and studying at Year 13 at any Canterbury secondary school, including state, private and integrated schools in Christchurch, Waimakariri and Selwyn. Successful students can then enrol for 2012 in a course of tertiary study for one year or longer.

The Ministry is contacting schools with further information on how students can apply for the scholarships.
