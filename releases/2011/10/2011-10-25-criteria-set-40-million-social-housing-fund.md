Housing Minister Phil Heatley says social housing providers wanting access to the Government’s $40 million Social Housing Fund can now apply.

The access criteria for four new sub-funds, put in place to support the development of more social and affordable housing, are being released today.

The four funds are:

Growth fund – Pūtea Whakatipu

Māori fund – Pūtea Māori

Niche fund – Pūtea Kaupapa Motuhake

Rural fund – Pūtea Taiwhenua

"These funds are part of Government moves to significantly increase the volume of social and affordable housing that’s provided by other, non-Government organisations," says Housing Minister Phil Heatley.

The funds will be distributed through a considered tender approach by the Social Housing Unit (SHU), Te Wāhanga Kāinga Pāpori. The SHU was set up as a semi-autonomous unit within the Department of Building and Housing in July this year.

"This is an exciting opportunity," says Mr Heatley.

"Providers of niche, social and affordable housing can now see the criteria they must meet to access funding. Although similar to the previous Housing Innovation Fund (HIF), the criteria were simplified, and a number of bureaucratic processes removed, to ensure that maximum building gain can be wrung out of every dollar."

"This drive to increase the pool of social and affordable housing coincides with Housing New Zealand’s current push to significantly upgrade their old housing stock, better use large sections, and ensure state housing is available for those most in need," says Mr Heatley.

The SHU will also be active in the supply of Crown land to social housing providers and, where appropriate, any surplus state housing stock. The aim is to give providers the leverage they need to significantly grow their ability to provide affordable housing.

"We want to ensure the Government’s investment delivers the greatest possible increase in the volume of niche, affordable and social housing," Mr Heatley says.
