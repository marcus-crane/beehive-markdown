Foreign Minister, Murray McCully, has announced New Zealand will provide $250,000 to support the Turkish Red Crescent’s humanitarian response to the devastating quake in the Van Province of Turkey.

“The quake which struck Turkey on 23 October has caused terrible loss of life and widespread damage. At this stage more than 400 people have died and more than 1000 have been injured,” Murray McCully said.

“New Zealand offered assistance immediately following the earthquake, and the $250,000 announced today will help provide shelter and humanitarian assistance to those left homeless and the injured. “

“Shelter has been identified as one of the most critical needs and our contribution will assist the Turkish Red Crescent to rapidly procure and distribute shelter materials and other essential supplies to 10,000 households,” he said.

“We in New Zealand know first-hand the suffering and damage which earthquakes can cause, and greatly appreciated the offers of support from the international community following the Christchurch earthquakes.”

“We will remain in contact with the Turkish authorities to see if there is other support or assistance we can provide as the people of Van Province come to terms with this disaster,” Murray McCully said.
