Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson has turned down a recommendation to assign the name Te Kōhua Peak to an unnamed peak located between The Remarkables and Hector Mountains in Central Otago.

The recommendation was made by the New Zealand Geographic Board Ngā Pou Taunaha o Aotearoa following a proposal by a member of the public and after an extended public consultation process.

“This process has highlighted a number of unnamed geographic features in the area, and generated a number of different potential names, which had varying levels of support amongst the local authority, local iwi and the community,” Mr Williamson said.

“As such I have invited the Board to consider working with the Central Otago District Council and Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu on a possible set of proposals for names of geographic features in the area.”

Any proposals resulting from this would then be considered formally by the Board as required by the process set out in the New Zealand Geographic Board Act 2008.  This includes publicly notifying proposals and consulting with the public.
