Prime Minister John Key today congratulated the All Blacks following their superb victory in the Rugby World Cup final at Eden Park.

“The All Blacks have achieved the ultimate in world rugby - they have won the Rugby World Cup. It is an achievement built on courage, determination, grit and great teamwork.

“These are all values that New Zealanders hold highly and I know Kiwis will be very proud of their team - they are deserving world champions.”

The All Blacks secured the Rugby World Cup with a nail-biting 8-7 victory over France. It is New Zealand’s second title, coming 24 years after the first in 1987.

Mr Key attended the match and said the atmosphere at Eden Park was fantastic from kick-off until long after the final whistle.

“The Rugby World Cup has featured great crowds throughout the six-week long tournament and the final was no different. Fans from both sides ensured the game was played in an atmosphere of great spirit - and we got the perfect ending New Zealanders have long hoped for.

“Congratulations to Richie McCaw, Graham Henry and all of the squad, coaches, support staff and members of the All Blacks family. You have all worked so hard to achieve this and you deserve it.”

Mr Key said New Zealanders had lived up to the ‘stadium of four million’ tag and been good hosts throughout the Rugby World Cup - making it a tournament to remember for so many.

“Congratulations to the All Blacks for a wonderful achievement.”
