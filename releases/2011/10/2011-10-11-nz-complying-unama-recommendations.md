New Zealand has welcomed the release of the UNAMA report on detainees in Afghanistan.

“We have checked our procedures since we became aware of this report in early September and are confident that we have robust systems in place,” said Dr Mapp.

“New Zealand has a legal officer at the NATO/ISAF headquarters in Kabul to ensure that proper monitoring occurs,” said Dr Mapp.

“The key point from this report and its recommendations to contributing nations is that the United Nations wants us to stay in Afghanistan and continue to train the people we are working with in professional and humane conduct of their duties.

“This is the most important thing we can do to increase respect for the rule of law in Afghanistan,” he said.

“New Zealand is working with its Afghan partner, the Afghan National Police Crisis Response Unit, to ensure that detainees are not transferred to facilities where they might be tortured,” said Dr Mapp.

“We have no information that any persons arrested by the CRU have been tortured,” said Dr Mapp.

“It is my understanding that no-one arrested by the CRU has been detained by the National Directorate of Security Department 90/124 as alleged by Keith Locke.”

The NATO/ISAF team have been working with the Ministry of the Interior to ensure people arrested by partnered units are treated in accordance with international law.

The New Zealand Defence Force already have a process whereby only the Chief of Defence Force can authorise the transfer of a detainee to any other authority in Afghanistan. He will not authorise such a transfer if there is any credible evidence that the person is likely to be tortured.

“We would rigorously monitor the wellbeing of a person transferred to any Afghan authority,” said Dr Mapp.

Dr Mapp said New Zealand forces have taken only one detainee since 2009 and he is held in a joint US/Afghan facility – the UNAMA report only relates to Afghan Government facilities.

“This detainee says he has been well treated and is monitored regularly,” said Dr Mapp.

Dr Mapp said he will review an NZDF report on the NZSAS role in transferring detainees to Afghan authorities in light of the UNAMA report before releasing it.”
