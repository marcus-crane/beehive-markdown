A Bill to modernise management of the Defence Force was introduced to Parliament today by Defence Minister Wayne Mapp.

“The Defence White Paper identified amendments to the Defence Act 1990 that would improve defence management, and realise efficiencies,” said Dr Mapp.

“These changes to the Defence Act 1990 will sit alongside the Defence Capability Plan to position the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) for the challenges of operating in today’s highly-integrated and high-tech military environment.”

The Defence Amendment Bill changes the way the Chief of Defence Force (CDF) is appointed and managed and gives CDF more authority to directly manage the Navy, Army and Air Force. 

“The Bill also proposes that the Defence Force and the Ministry of Defence collaborate more on managing defence capability,” said Dr Mapp.

Another key change in the bill will make it easer for Defence to appoint personnel who have been discharged from military service into positions in the civilian staff. 

“The changes introduced by the Bill will enable the NZDF and the Ministry of Defence to work more effectively,” said the Minister. “This will allow resources to be refocused towards the frontline and the capability outlined in the Defence White Paper.”

Dr Mapp said he expected that Parliament would consider the Bill next year.
