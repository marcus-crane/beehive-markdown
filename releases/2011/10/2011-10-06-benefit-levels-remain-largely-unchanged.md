Social Development Minister Paula Bennett says the number of people on benefits remains high, though thousands still find work every month.

“Last month more than 6,700 people cancelled their benefit because they found a job and I congratulate every one of them,” says Ms Bennett.

“While total benefit numbers remain high, the Unemployment Benefit is now at its lowest since July 2009.”

At the end of September there were 55,661 unemployment beneficiaries.

“Job hunting isn’t easy, but it’s fair to say that if you’re not looking, you won’t find a job and the expectation is simply to be available and looking for work.”

Last month more than 4,000 people went off the Unemployment Benefit, into jobs and more than 2,200 young people left welfare for work.

“In the month of September, we saw 351 fewer young people on the Unemployment Benefit, which is really good to see,” says Ms Bennett.

The overall number of people on welfare rose by less than 0.1% or 141 people in September to 328,496.
