Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced that communities and the education sector in Canterbury are to have the opportunity to take part in consultation on the future of education in the area following the recent earthquakes.

The feedback received will contribute to a draft Education Renewal Plan for greater Christchurch.

“Our challenge is to develop a bold and creative plan for the future of the education network,” says Mrs Tolley.

“It must meet the needs of students and families, and be responsive to the changing environment, to ensure that the delivery of education in the decades ahead is the best it can possibly be.”

The Ministry of Education will be inviting representatives from the education sector, community members and business leaders to a series of meetings to provide the chance to discuss options and give feedback.

The wider community, including students, parents, teachers and employers, is also being encouraged to take part and provide valuable feedback at http://shapingeducation.minedu.govt.nz

The consultation will run until 13 November, following which the Ministry will analyse submissions before reporting back to Cabinet.

This will then contribute to a draft Education Renewal Plan which is scheduled to be released for widespread community consultation in the new year.

The Ministry of Education is working with the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) on rebuilding greater Christchurch and its surrounds, and supporting the welfare of its residents. For more information visit www.cera.govt.nz
