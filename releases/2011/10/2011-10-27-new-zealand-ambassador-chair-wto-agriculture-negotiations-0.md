Trade Minister Tim Groser announced today that there is a consensus among World Trade Organisation members to appoint New Zealand’s WTO Ambassador, John Adank, as the new chair of the WTO Doha Round agriculture negotiations.

Mr Adank is expected to be formally elected Chair at the next meeting of the Special Session of the Committee on Agriculture.

“The Doha negotiations are facing grave challenges. Ten years of effort have not been able to bridge differences. At a Ministerial Conference in Geneva in mid-December the membership will have to determine the best way forward”, Mr Groser said. “But there have been very important gains, especially in agriculture, and it is essential that these are protected as we move ahead.”

Mr Adank will be the fourth successive New Zealander to chair the agriculture negotiations, succeeding Dr David Walker who returned to New Zealand earlier in the year to take up the role of Deputy Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

“New Zealand is pleased to be able to make a further important contribution to the WTO process and I wish Mr Adank the best of luck”, Mr Groser said.
