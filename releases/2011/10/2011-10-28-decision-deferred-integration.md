Education Minister Anne Tolley says a decision on the integration of Wanganui Collegiate School into the state system has been deferred until August 2012.

“I need to be satisfied that the school is able to meet the strict criteria to be allowed to integrate," says Mrs Tolley.

“I am aware of the importance of the school to the Wanganui and wider region, and in the meantime I have agreed that financial assistance can be provided should the school need it, but under certain conditions.

“I have also directed the Ministry to appoint a Crown monitor to work with the Board of Trustees in an oversight role, to keep a close watch on Crown funding and financial management.”
