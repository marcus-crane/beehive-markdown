Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson is urging people to have their say on a joint discussion document seeking views on limited variations to the Retirement Villages Code of Practice.

The document, Potential variations to the Retirement Villages Code of Practice 2008, was released today by the Department of Building and Housing and the Retirement Commission.

Consultation will be open from Monday, 10 October until Monday, 21 November.

“I am pleased to be able to work with the Retirement Commissioner on these important issues,” Mr Williamson said.

“I encourage all retirement village residents, their families and retirement village operators to have their say.”

Part one of the consultation, from the Retirement Commissioner, asks for views on the three sets of proposed variations from:

- The Association of Residents of Retirement Villages (Auckland Region)
- The Retirement Villages Association
- The Department of Building and Housing

Part two is a discussion document from the Department of Building and Housing, which asks for views on the issues discussed and the wording proposed by the Department.
