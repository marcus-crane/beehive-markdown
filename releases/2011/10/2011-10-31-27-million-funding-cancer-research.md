Health Minister Tony Ryall and the Minister for Science and Innovation Dr Wayne Mapp have announced funding for three cancer research projects.

Studies of bowel cancer, palliative care and prostate cancer will be undertaken by researchers at Auckland and Massey universities over the next three years.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says, "This research will build our knowledge of the incidence and impact of these particular cancers in New Zealand, and how health professionals from primary care through to specialists work together delivering treatment.”

An Auckland University team has been given $1 million to study patient outcomes from colorectal cancer. Massey University researchers will use their $800,000 grant to look at more efficient palliative care for cancer patients.

The third grant, of $900,000 will fund a study of screening programmes for prostate cancer by an Auckland University team based at the Waikato Clinical School.

Minister of Science and Innovation Dr Wayne Mapp says, "We have excellent scientists and researchers working to build up our knowledge of cancer.

“This funding has the potential to deliver benefits to all New Zealanders.”
