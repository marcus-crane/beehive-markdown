Minister for the Environment Nick Smith today announced that The Great TV Take Back campaign netted 28,000 unwanted TVs for recycling – far exceeding the Government’s expectations.

The Great TV Take Back, run by The Warehouse and supported by the Government’s Waste Minimisation Fund, invited New Zealanders to drop off old TVs in store for free recycling. The TVs collected will be recycled by companies with sound recycling credentials and monitored by the Ministry for the Environment.

“I am thrilled so many New Zealanders have chosen to recycle their old or unwanted TVs. In doing so we have stopped 450 tonnes of harmful material going to landfill, including 70 tonnes of lead, more than 230 tonnes of glass and 10 tonnes of copper,” Dr Smith said.

“Out of the 28,000 TVs that were taken to The Warehouse stores, 6000 were collected in Christchurch.  Cantabrians really took advantage of the opportunity to recycle their old TVs – many that were damaged in the earthquakes.

“The Great TV Take Back was a pilot campaign and is part of a wider Government programme to provide recycling solutions for electronic waste. This includes the Government sponsored eCycle network – a nationwide network of e-waste collection and dismantling depots.

“The Government has also made a request for proposals to other electrical retailers to join with this programme and provide opportunities for recycling electronic waste, particularly TVs. We hope The Warehouse partnership is just one of many from the electronic sector as the TV waste problem is huge and will require many such initiatives.”

“The Government intends to progress a similar product stewardship approach to Australia to address e-waste issues in New Zealand.  The intention is that further work on this will be undertaken over the next three years.”  

Expressions of Interest for the wider TV Take Back programme are now being received and will close on 21 October 2011.
