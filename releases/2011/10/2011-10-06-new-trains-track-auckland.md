Transport Minister Steven Joyce has today welcomed the signing by Auckland Transport of a purchase contract for 57 new electric trains just weeks after the government sealed a rail funding and ownership deal with the region.

“This is another key milestone on our way to delivering a real step change in commuter rail travel in the region,” he says.

“We are on track for these new electric trains to start coming into service from the end of 2013.”

“The difference between the new modern units to be supplied by Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles SA (CAF) and the current rolling stock will be dramatic.”

The design will be based on rolling stock supplied for the Heathrow Express in England and will replace the diesel units and diesel locomotive hauled rolling stock.

The government’s rail funding package consists of a $500 million loan to Auckland transport on concessionary terms and an additional grant of up to $90 million.

Mr Joyce says the package has enabled the purchase contract to be signed for 19 extra trains, 50 percent more than previously proposed.

“We are working in partnership with the region to bring Aucklanders frequent, fast, reliable, all-electric train services,” he says.

“This contract will also mean new jobs for New Zealand workers and a significant skills transfer to the local staff who will provide the maintenance services.”

Minister Joyce says while the region will own the trains and their depot, the Crown through KiwiRail will retain ownership of below ground assets including track, signals and power supply. KiwiRail will also continue to provide, maintain and renew rail network infrastructure and provide network services such as traction, signalling and train control.

“The government has also invested $1.1 billion in the redevelopment and electrification of Auckland’s metro rail network to bring it up to a functional and reliable standard. This will ensure the entire system works well. We need investment in tracks as well as trains.

“Signalling, civil bridge and traction work are all going well. The most visual sign of electrification, the overhead wires and masts that will power the network, are also now appearing on the lines.

“Combined with integrated ticketing and efficient station operation, the purchase of these new trains will allow for major passenger growth and a much better experience for Auckland train commuters,” says Mr Joyce.
