Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson today announced the appointment of The Hon Sir Hugh Williams to the New Zealand Registered Architects Board.

Sir Hugh, a retired high court judge, was an outstanding candidate who will bring value to the Board.

“Sir Hugh retains a strong desire to contribute his legal skills to the public and has a long standing interest in architecture. He also has an excellent understanding of the Board’s role and relationship with the New Zealand Institute of Architects,” Mr Williamson says.

Ms Anna-Marie Chin, the NZIA nomination, has also been reappointed to the Board.

Both three-year terms will begin from today.
