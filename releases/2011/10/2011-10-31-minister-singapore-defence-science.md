Dr Wayne Mapp is travelling to Singapore today to represent New Zealand at the 40th anniversary of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA).

Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand are the partners in the FPDA – the second oldest military agreement after NATO.

“This multilateral security framework is a tribute to the commitment of these countries, and a comment on the value of long-standing and stable security agreements in these ever-changing times,” said Dr Mapp.

The FPDA Defence Ministers’ meeting coincides with a major military exercise (Exercise Bersama Lima 11) being conducted by the FPDA nations, around Singapore and Malaysia.

“Our participation in these exercises is part of our contribution to regional peace and security,” said Dr Mapp.

As Minister of Science and Innovation, Dr Mapp will be the guest of honour at the Singapore Polytech graduation ceremony. New Zealand’s Massey University runs a Bachelor of Food Technology programme based at the Polytech.

“This course trains graduates to take a leading role in the local food processing and manufacturing industries,” said Dr Mapp.

“Asia is now the largest destination for exports of NZ food and beverage taking 40% of all food and beverage exports.”

The Minister returns to New Zealand on Friday.
