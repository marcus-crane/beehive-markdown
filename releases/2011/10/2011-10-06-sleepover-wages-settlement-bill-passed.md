Health Minister Tony Ryall has welcomed Parliament's unanimous support for the Sleepover Wages (Settlement) Bill, passed today under urgency.

"This Bill resolves a dispute that dates from 2007 and sets in place a responsible and affordable framework for employers and employees in the health and disability sector," Mr Ryall says.

"And it ensures that some of the most vulnerable people continue to receive quality care in the community, while addressing the recent decision made by the Court of Appeal and the Employment Court in relation Idea Services Limited V Phillip William Dickson."

The Government is committing $27.5m to assist Crown funded employers in the health and disability sector to settle valid back wage claims and up to $90m over three years to support employers phase in the minimum wage for employees who work sleepovers.

The legislation was passed with amendments that will improve the operation of the Bill unanimously recommended by the Health Select Committee.
