Economic Development Minister David Carter today launched the Food and Beverage Information Project, the most comprehensive analysis of New Zealand’s F&B industry ever undertaken.

“The food and beverage industry accounts for more than half of our total exports and employs one in five New Zealanders, directly or indirectly. Full knowledge of the industry and its performance internationally is key to lifting export growth,” says Mr Carter.

The reports released today cover beverages, processed foods, meat, dairy, produce, seafood and nutraceuticals and foods for health. Further reports analyse global markets, provide an industry guide for investors and look in-depth at the Singapore market.

“New Zealand’s reputation as a trusted producer of high-quality food and beverages is our success story. This project will give businesses, investors and policymakers the information they need to enhance this reputation even further.”

Mr Carter says the research identifies both strengths and weaknesses and provides potential strategic directions for each sector.

“This will stimulate thinking and enable government and industry to work together to resolve issues and drive export growth.

“The world needs food, and it’s common sense that this is produced in the most suitable locations by the most efficient producers. New Zealand has a clear advantage in quality food production, and this project will help strengthen our position,” says Mr Carter.

The project will run for five years, updated annually, and new reports and market information will be added.
