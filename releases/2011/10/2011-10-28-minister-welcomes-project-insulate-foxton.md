Acting Minister of Energy and Resources, Hekia Parata, today welcomed a project to insulate all of the homes in central Foxton as part of the Government’s Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart programme.

‘Warm Up Foxton’ is being led by New Zealand company Autex Industries Ltd, in partnership with PowerShed Ltd and the Horowhenua District Council. Their additional funding contribution means that up to 1300 Foxton households could get their homes insulated at little or no cost.

“Insulating houses has a huge positive impact on people’s health and comfort and it’s great to see private companies investing in the well-being of a local community,” says Ms Parata.

The Government has committed $347 million to Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart over four years to provide insulation and efficient heating for New Zealand homes.

Over 130,000 homes throughout New Zealand have been retrofitted since the Warm Up New Zealand Heat Smart programme began in 2009.

Community trusts, charities, health organisations and some private companies have contributed an additional $30 million over the last two years for Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart projects that target a specific community or group, often those most in need.

“I commend these organisations for their commitment to this programme. Investing in insulation delivers benefits not just for the person living in the house, but also the wider community through reduced pressure on the health system, less time off work and school, and the creation of local jobs,” says Ms Parata.

Foxton residents in Residential Zone 1 whose homes were built before 2000 are eligible for the project. The project funding, added to the government grants, means it is free for people with a Community Services Card, and all other residents will be subsidised by up to 70% of the cost.

The project was launched today by Hon Nathan Guy on behalf of Ms Parata.
