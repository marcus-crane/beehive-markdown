Prime Minister John Key today officially opened Christchurch’s Restart project in Cashel Mall, the first part of the city’s red zone now open for business.

“A total of 27 businesses have opened today, including the flagship Ballantynes department store, which is great news for Cantabrians and for retailers who are determined to get their businesses up and running,” says Mr Key.

“This is an important step in re-opening the CBD red zone to residents and retailers alike, and gives more certainty to people as they look to the future of this great city.”

Restart is an initiative to give temporary container accommodation to displaced businesses.

“The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) has done a fantastic job getting Cashel Mall ready in time for the start of New Zealand Cup and Show week,” says Mr Key.

The Restart the Heart Trust was given a $3.36 million interest-free loan from the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal to fund the project.

The Christchurch Earthquake Appeal is the Government’s official, global fundraiser for the recovery effort in Christchurch and the Canterbury region. The Appeal has reached nearly $100 million in pledged and received funds.
