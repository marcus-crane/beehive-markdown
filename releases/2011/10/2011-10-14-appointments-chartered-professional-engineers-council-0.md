Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson today announced the appointment of Jane Nees to the Chartered Professional Engineers Council.

Ms Nees takes up her appointment today for a three year term as the new consumer representative.

Current chairman Graham Shaw has also been reappointed for a five year term and the Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand (IPENZ) nomination, Roly Frost, has been reappointed for two years.

Ms Nees is a Bay of Plenty Regional councillor and is on the Bay of Plenty Regional Transport Committee.

“Ms Nees will be a welcome addition to the Council. She demonstrated a clear understanding of the role of consumer representative and her responsibilities associated with a statutory appointment,’’ Mr Williamson says.

“Mr Shaw is an extremely capable chair and under his leadership, the Council has developed a clear sense of its purpose and role. It is a pleasure to welcome him back for a further term.”

Mr Frost has wide experience in the civil, structural and geotechnical engineering fields.

Mr Williamson thanked departing member Mrs Hazel Armstrong for her good work and dedication over the past years.
