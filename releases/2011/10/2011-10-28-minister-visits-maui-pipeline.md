The Acting Minister of Energy and Resources, Hekia Parata, today visited the site of the gas leak on the Maui pipeline, just north of New Plymouth.

Vector has been working around the clock, rotating crews, since the early hours of Tuesday morning to fix a section of the pipe, which had ruptured along the seam.

The affected section has been removed, and work is continuing on fitting the new section, with testing at each stage.

Vector advise, if progress continues at the current rate, they hope to have gas supply fully restored by late Sunday.

"The Vector crews working on site are doing a brilliant job,'' says Ms Parata.

"It is really challenging terrain at the site, and the weather has been difficult, but the crews have worked tirelessly.''

Due to the continued conservation efforts from all gas users, a further 1,000 customers have had their gas supply restored today. These customers include small industry, larger hotels, shopping malls and commercial buildings.

Gas retailers are in the process of notifying their customers, advising that they may begin using gas, by phone or text message.

Customers not contacted by their gas retailer must not use gas. Everyone using gas (residential users, Band 5 essential services, Band 6, and now Band 4 once instructed by retailers) must continue to use it frugally.

"Those users who are able to use gas should conserve their usage as much as possible and use electricity if that is available. That way we will be able to continue supplying gas to those essential users who need it,'' says Ms Parata.

"I want to thank all users whose discipline has meant that we have had the spare capacity to restore other customers. We need to continue our conservation efforts until supply has been fully restored," says Ms Parata.
