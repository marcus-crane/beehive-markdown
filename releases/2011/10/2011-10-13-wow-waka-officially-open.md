"Wow factor, that’s what Māori culture promised to deliver to support the nation’s hosting of Rugby World Cup 2011" said Māori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples when the official opening of Waka Māori took place earlier this evening.

“Waka Māori will take the Maori cultural contribution to RWC 2011 to another exciting level.

"The Opening Ceremony for Rugby World Cup was an incredible statement to the world of who Maori are, as peoples, and as a nation.

"The UK-based Telegraph said that 'what \[we] have is something of huge worth: a defining cultural pivot around which the whole event could spin' and that their London Olympics people may envy.

“Waka Māori is a potent symbol, one that has the ability to cut through to people in this complex global market place. It is a spectacular piece of architecture and a bold statement that clearly differentiates Tamaki Makaurau and Aotearoa New Zealand from other places” said Dr Sharples.

"I think it's safe to say that Aotearoa New Zealand has made many unique and lasting memories upon the world during RWC 2011".

Over the next ten days there will be tens of thousands of visitors to the Auckland waterfront. Those visitors will see a programme of distinctive Māori events, put together by Māori from all over New Zealand and hosted by the tangata whenua of Tamaki Makaurau, Ngati Whatua.

There will be a daily programme of performance artists, as well as the artisans village, a fascinating exhibition on the history of Māori rugby and a breathtaking 3D animation show produced by animation whiz- Ian Taylor.
