Claims made on Radio New Zealand’s Morning Report and repeated by Labour’s education spokesperson about Ministry of Education Student Achievement Practitioners are completely false, says Education Minister Anne Tolley.

The practitioners have been appointed to help schools put plans in place to accelerate student progress and lift student achievement, as the Government addresses the fact that one in five children are not gaining the reading, writing and maths skills that they need.

Of the 46 practitioners, 43 have worked as primary or secondary teachers or principals, three have worked in the tertiary sector, all have a wide range of experience in the education sector, and all practitioners hold tertiary qualifications, including three with doctorates.

“A principal, who is a Labour candidate, stated this morning on Radio NZ that he has a Ministry achievement practitioner working in his school,” says Mrs Tolley.

“This is not true.

“The report then went on to claim that a former dental nurse, ex-policeman and a principal who had been suspended were among the practitioners.

“Again, all of these claims are completely false, and the Ministry has made an official complaint to Radio NZ.

“Labour’s education spokesperson saw fit to repeat these false claims in a media release this afternoon.

“While others are playing politics with children, the Government will continue to stay focused on lifting student achievement, and we will not be distracted by false accusations about the people who are trying to make a difference for students and schools who need extra support.”
