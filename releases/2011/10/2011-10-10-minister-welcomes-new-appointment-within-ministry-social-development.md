Social Development Minister Paula Bennett welcomes the appointment of Murray Edridge as the new head of Family and Community Services.

“Mr Edridge has worked with community organisations for many years and is a well liked and highly respected leader in the sector,” says Ms Bennett.

“He has a big job ahead of him, but his experience, leadership skills and talent will stand him in good stead,” she said.

Mr Edridge has a long history of volunteer work and an accomplished career, most recently running the highly regarded community organisation Barnardos.

As a champion of the Green Paper on Vulnerable Children, Mr Edridge is facilitating debate about how we better protect children in New Zealand.

“As I welcome Mr Edridge to his new role, it is with sadness that I farewell the retiring head of Family and Community Services Richard Wood,” says Ms Bennett.

Richard Wood retires in December and Murray Edridge takes up the role early next year.

“Mr Wood has been an amazing public servant who has a well deserved reputation as a straight talking supporter of the community social sector.”

Family and Community Services has an annual spend of around $138 million and contracting for over 1000 community organisations.
