Tariana Turia, Minister of Disability Issues, is delighted that her original intention to appoint a full time Disability Rights Commissioner to protect and promote the rights of disabled peoples has been upheld with a new bill introduced to Parliament.

"In late 2009 I began advocating for a dedicated Disability Commissioner in the Human Rights Commission to promote and protect the rights of disabled people."

“Then last October I announced my determination to appoint a full-time Disability Rights Commissioner who would promote, protect and monitor the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities"

“And just over a month ago we officially welcomed Paul Gibson into the role, as a part-time Human Rights Commissioner responsible for disability issues.

But the thinking was that we would always achieve fulltime status for the position and the Human Rights Amendment Bill will do this.

“Disabled persons and the disability sector have always believed in the importance of an independent monitoring role as helping to make the difference in achieving an inclusive society"..

"The appointment of a dedicated fulltime Disability Commission in the Human Rights Commission, along with a protection and monitoring role for the Office of the Ombudsmen and resourcing the Convention Coalition to monitor the rights of disabled people, advances our commitment to disability issues, and I appreciate the support of the Minister of Justice in introducing the legislation to do so".
