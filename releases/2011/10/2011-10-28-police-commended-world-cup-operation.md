Police Minister Judith Collins today praised the Police security operation during the 2011 Rugby World Cup, saying Police had done an outstanding job of ensuring the safety of tens of thousands of fans.

The Police operation, which involved around 1300 staff from throughout the country during the Cup, began to wind down after the Wellington street parade for the All Blacks on Wednesday.

“The Police did an outstanding job of maintaining order and keeping people safe during what was one of the largest Police operations in this country’s history,” Ms Collins said.

“Three years of meticulous planning, and a great deal of professionalism and commitment by all involved, resulted in a tournament that was virtually trouble-free.

“Only around 55 arrests were made during the Cup campaign, which is extremely low considering the large numbers of visitors in New Zealand and significant numbers of fans who took part in festivities in public places around the country.

“During the Cup we saw our Police maintaining a strong, highly visible but friendly presence at events, and dealing with incidents quickly and effectively.

“Police have received a lot of compliments about their positive, Kiwi-style policing approach to the World Cup. This really is what sets our Police apart.”
