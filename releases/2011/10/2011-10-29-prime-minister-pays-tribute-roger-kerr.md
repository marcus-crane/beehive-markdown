Prime Minister John Key has paid tribute to Business Roundtable executive director Roger Kerr, who died last night in Wellington.

“Roger made a significant contribution to New Zealand business, public policy and the wider economy over several decades,” says Mr Key.

“He was a man of integrity and energy, who was not afraid to debate important issues passionately and often controversially.  But he did it calmly and focused on the issues at hand, rather than making the debates personal.

“While I did not always agree with Roger’s views on economic policy, I have always shared his driving aspiration for New Zealand to build a stronger economy based on a vibrant business sector. That’s what Roger was all about over so many years.

“Roger’s services to business were recognised earlier this year when he received the honour of Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit.

“He will leave a significant gap in the New Zealand business and financial community. Despite his illness, he continued to provide his characteristically forthright views through newspaper columns and blogs as recently as this week.

“My thoughts are with Roger’s wife Catherine and his family at this sad time,” says Mr Key.
