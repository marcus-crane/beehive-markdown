Each of the New Zealand Gallantry Awards announced today represents an act of great courage by a New Zealand soldier, said Defence Minister Wayne Mapp.

“These men have all served bravely in the face of danger in Afghanistan. Their individual actions helped save the lives of their comrades in action,” said Dr Mapp.

“The deaths of two NZ SAS troopers in little more than a month are a stark reminder of the dangers of the mission, and the courage needed to overcome them.”

Three of the awards relate to acts of bravery during the insurgent attack in Bamiyan province last August which killed Lieutenant Tim O’Donnell.

Corporal Albert Henry Moore of the Royal Zealand Infantry Regiment has been awarded the New Zealand Gallantry Star – an award for gallantry second only to the Victoria Cross.

“Corporal Moore’s decisive leadership and courage were an inspiration to all around him. His cool head in a crisis was crucial to resolving the situation without further casualties,” said Dr Mapp.

Lance-Corporal Allister Donald Baker from the same regiment and Corporal Matthew John Ball from the Royal New Zealand Corps of Signals have both been awarded the New Zealand Gallantry Decoration.

“They were both in the Humvee vehicle hit by the IED and acted with courage and resolution despite their wounds.”

The New Zealand Gallantry Medal has been awarded to Warrant Officer Class Two Denis Joachim Wanihi of the Royal New Zealand Army Logistic Regiment, for a number of actions he took during his mission to Afghanistan in 2010.

“His sustained gallantry in defusing mines shows his qualities in the face of danger,” said Dr Mapp.

“These are the highest awards presented to New Zealand service personnel. I join the rest of the country in saluting these brave soldiers for their actions, which are a credit to the Army and to New Zealand.”
