The Acting Minister of Energy and Resources, Hekia Parata, today launched a project on the East Coast that will see 2,000 homes in the Gisborne and Tairawhiti region insulated over the next two years.

The $5 million special project extends the Eastland Community Trust’s Healthy Homes project to improve the health and wellbeing of people on the East Coast.

The Trust has already completed 1,800 homes and is now investing a further $2 million to complete an additional 2,000 homes. The project targets families on a low income, particularly those with health needs.

The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) is contributing $3 million through the Government’s Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart programme.

“I applaud the Trust for taking the initiative with this project. Improving insulation in old houses has been shown to have a significant impact on the health of the householder,’’ says Ms Parata.

“Warm homes lower the risk of people getting sick – and that is especially important for those at risk - the young, the elderly and people with respiratory illnesses such as asthma.’’

The Government is investing $347 million in Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart over four years to provide insulation and efficient heating for New Zealand homes.

Anyone who has a home built before 2000 is eligible for 33 per cent off the cost of installing ceiling and under-floor insulation up to a maximum of $1300. Community Service Card holders can get 60 per cent off the cost of installing insulation.

Close to 130,000 homes throughout New Zealand have been retrofitted since the Warm Up New Zealand Heat Smart programme began in 2009.

“Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart special projects make insulating more affordable for groups, communities or regions that have some specific need, for example a health issue, a low decile community or a remote regional location.

“Working together with partners, who provide additional funding, makes insulating more accessible for those who really need it and will benefit the most,'' says Ms Parata.

“Energy efficiency is a focus for the Government, along with renewables, the exploration of our natural resources and the pricing of carbon as we manage our environmental responsibilities and realise our economic opportunities.''
