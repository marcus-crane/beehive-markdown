New Zealand’s best researchers have been awarded $53.8 million in Marsden Fund grants, Science and Innovation Minister Wayne Mapp announced today.

“The winning Marsden Fund projects have been selected on the basis of scientific excellence,” Dr Mapp said. “The 88 successful applications range from new therapies for cancer and chronic inflammation to better communication technology.

“This announcement underpins the deep commitment the Government has across the entire science spectrum – from discovery through to support for business research.

“Over the past three years, we have invested $178.8 million through the Marsden Fund. This is a 31% increase on the three years prior. In practical terms, that is an extra $42 million invested in cutting edge research,” said Dr Mapp.

Thirty-two recipients have been awarded Fast-Start grants for outstanding post-doctoral and early-career researchers that are worth up to $115,000 a year for three years.

The balance of the grants went to researchers later in their careers, and are worth up to $330,000 a year for three years.

Overall, 107 Principal Investigators and 146 Associate Investigators benefit from this funding, ranging from postgraduate students and post-doctoral researchers through to New Zealand’s most eminent scientists.

“Across the three-year funding cycle, we are supporting several hundred outstanding scientists and researchers at any given time at different stages of their research,” said Dr Mapp.

The Marsden Fund is administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand. Recipients are selected by specialist independent panels covering the range of science disciplines.
