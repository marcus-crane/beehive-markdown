Transport Minister Steven Joyce says while this year’s road toll is at a record low to date, there is no room for complacency on the roads this long weekend.

To date this year, 220 people have died on the roads.  This time last year the toll was 297.  The rolling 12 month total is 298 which is the first time it has been under 300 since 1952.

Mr Joyce says while the low toll is encouraging, there’s still a lot of work to do to reduce the level of death and injury on our roads.

“We must not forget that a large number of people are still killed and injured every year and long weekends can be a particularly dangerous times on our roads.”

Last year 8 people died and 125 were injured on our roads during Labour weekend.

“While the government is working hard to improve road safety through the Safer Journeys action plan, all New Zealander’s have a responsibility for safety on the roads,” says Mr Joyce.

“Police will be lowering the speed tolerance again, sending a clear message that speed limits are not targets. Please drive to the conditions and allow plenty of space between your vehicle and any in front, in case you need to stop suddenly.

“Plan your trip if you’re travelling long distances, and if you’re feeling tired, please take a break or change drivers. We currently have one of our lowest road tolls in many years. Let’s all do what we can to ensure it stays this way.

“Enjoy the break but please take care to ensure your own safety, as well as that of your passengers and other road users.”

The official holiday period for begins at 4.00pm Friday 21 October and ends at 6.00 am on Tuesday 25 October. Information on historic road toll statistics and the Safer Journeys strategy is available on the Ministry of Transport’s website: [www.transport.govt.nz](http://www.transport.govt.nz/).
