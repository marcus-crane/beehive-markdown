Environment Minister Nick Smith today announced more than $1 million in funding for six projects across the country and the accreditation of a new product stewardship scheme.

This includes $593,000 from the Government’s Community Environment Fund to support communities in cleaning up their freshwater and $449,000 from the Government’s Waste Minimisation Fund to support three innovative projects to reduce waste.

“The Government’s support of these three waste minimisation projects means that productive uses can be found for waste products – like oil and glass – that might otherwise end up being discarded and harming our environment,” Dr Smith said.

“Allied Concrete will receive $190,000 to install machinery that adds recycled glass into residential grade concrete. This process reduces the use of sand needed to make concrete, while using waste glass.

“South Westland Rubbish Removals will receive $140,000 to set up a glass recycling depot in Franz Josef. The company will sort and ship glass collected in Franz Josef and Fox Glacier to a new Greymouth hub ready to be transported to Auckland for recycling. The project will divert 750 tonnes of glass from landfill in the next three years.

“To tackle packaging waste, the Upper Clutha Recycling and Environmental Society Inc will receive $118,750 to develop and deliver information that will help consumers and businesses make smart packaging choices.”

The Government is also funding three projects through the Community Environment Fund to help communities clean up waterways.

Landcare Trust will receive $135,000 for the Community Catchment Action Plan for Lake Ngaroto in the Waikato.

“This community-led project is working to improve the water quality of the lake and surrounding wetland. Action plans are being developed for farms around Lake Ngaroto and the whole community is working together to clean it up,” Dr Smith said.

“Landcare Trust will also receive $120,000 to support the development of an online nationwide community of volunteers knowledgeable about wetland restoration. This will help communities actively monitor changes in wetland conditions and gauge the success of restoration projects.”

Landcare Research will also develop an online tool with $38,000 from the Government to help people identify and provide information on freshwater invertebrates.

“I am also pleased to announce the accreditation of the Recovery of Oil Saves the Environment product stewardship scheme,” Dr Smith said.

“Christchurch-based ROSE NZ collects used oil from all over New Zealand, including the Chatham and Stewart Islands. Once treated, the oil will be used as a fuel to make bitumen and asphalt by companies like Fulton Hogan. I commend ROSE NZ for ensuring waste oil is used in an innovative and practical way stopping it from being poured down drains.”
