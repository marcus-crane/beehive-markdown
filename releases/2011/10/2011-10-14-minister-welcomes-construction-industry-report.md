Building and Construction Minister Williamson has today welcomed a PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report into the construction industry.

The report: Valuing the role of Construction in the New Zealand economy, was commissioned by the Construction Strategy Group (CSG) and launched by Mr Williamson at a CSG meeting in Auckland today.

The report highlights the key role the construction sector has played in the economic growth of the country and focuses on how Government and industry can achieve more economic growth by removing red tape and lifting the industry’s skills.

“There are many things the sector can do to improve career pathways and make businesses more productive and profitable,” Mr Williamson says.

The Government has partnered with the sector through the Productivity Partnership to help fix some of the problems.

“The Partnership aims to lift productivity in the sector by 20% by 2020. This will add around $3 billion to GDP. When you see these sorts of figures, it’s easy to see how important the sector is.”
