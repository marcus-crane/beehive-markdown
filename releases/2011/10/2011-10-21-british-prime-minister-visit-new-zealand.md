British Prime Minister David Cameron will visit New Zealand next week, Prime Minister John Key announced today.

“I am delighted to be able to welcome David Cameron to New Zealand. His visit gives us an opportunity to demonstrate the strength and maturity of the relationship between the United Kingdom and New Zealand,” Mr Key said.

Mr Cameron will visit New Zealand before attending the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth. His programme will include a formal bilateral meeting with Mr Key, a short visit to Christchurch, and other events which will be advised in coming days.

Mr Key said he was looking forward to having Mr Cameron in New Zealand for what would be an important visit.

“The relationship between New Zealand and the United Kingdom is a very deep one – it is one of our oldest and closest,” Mr Key said.

“We have strong ties between our people and businesses, and a shared outlook on international affairs. This visit will give us an opportunity to celebrate those historical ties and give momentum to the modern relationship which reaches far and wide.”

Mr Key said he looked forward to discussing a wide range of regional and global issues with Mr Cameron, including the economic situation in Europe and around the world.

Further details of Mr Cameron’s visit will be released closer to his arrival next week.
