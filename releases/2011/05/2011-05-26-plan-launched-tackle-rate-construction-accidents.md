Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson has today launched a new plan aimed at bringing down the high injury and fatality rates in the construction industry over the next three years.

“Construction is New Zealand’s sixth biggest industry and in the last five years 54 workers have died on construction sites in this country,” Ms Wilkinson says.

“Working with machinery, heavy materials and at height can be dangerous, but it is simply not good enough that some of these workers are exposed to unacceptable hazards.

“We know that the leading cause of death in the sector is falls from height and this is an area that comes under particular focus in this plan.

“It sets out a range of targeted interventions including increasing training for safe working at heights, reviewing guidance and improving relationships between construction companies, the Government, unions and stakeholders.

“Alongside this work the Department of Labour will have a harm reduction campaign under way shortly focusing on falls from height.

“With the huge rebuild ahead of us in Canterbury, it’s also essential that the industry leads from the front in advocating hazard management.

“In that regard I welcome the newly formed Construction Safety Council, also launched today. Their vision of ‘health and safety is worth the effort’ is something we all should strive to put at the forefront of our business planning.”

The Construction Sector Action Plan is part of the National Action Agenda – which focuses on driving down the death and injury rate in New Zealand workplaces in five key sectors where the most harm is occurring.

They are construction, agriculture, forestry, manufacturing and fishing.

The Construction Sector Action Plan has been developed by the Department of Labour, ACC and the newly formed Construction Safety Council in consultation with stakeholders in the construction sector. It is the first of the five plans to be released.
