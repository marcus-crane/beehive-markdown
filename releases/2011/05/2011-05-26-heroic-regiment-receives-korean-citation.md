The presentation of the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation to veterans of 16 Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery, will ensure the bravery shown by the unit during the Korean War is not forgotten, Veterans’ Affairs Minister Judith Collins said today.

The Hon Sung Choon Park, the Republic of Korea’s Minister of Patriots and Veterans Affairs, today personally presented the unit citation insignia to each of the veterans in attendance at Linton Military Camp.

He also presented a copy of the citation to Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Boggs, Commanding Officer of 16 Field Regiment. The citation recognised the regiment’s service and heroism between December 1950 and November 1951 during the Korean War.

“The Regiment had a prominent role in the Battle of Kap’yong in April 1951, when the gunners fired more than 10,000 rounds as part of the provision of fire support for units in the 27th Commonwealth Brigade. They achieved this while being under heavy fire from the enemy,” Ms Collins said.

“Currently-serving personnel of 16 Field Regiment will also be able to wear the insignia, which ensures that the heroism and bravery shown by the regiment during the Korean War will not be forgotten.”

Ms Collins also held bilateral discussions with Minister Park at Linton Camp.

“New Zealand and the Republic of Korea have a special relationship that began on the battlefield more than 60 years ago,” Ms Collins said.

“Minister Park has personally travelled to New Zealand to present the citation to the Regiment, which is a sign of the close relationship that has developed between our two countries.”
