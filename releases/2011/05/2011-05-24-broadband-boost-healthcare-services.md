Healthcare services will make huge gains thanks to the government’s ultra fast broadband (UFB) initiative. The UFB will make the transfer of information and services much simpler and faster, says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

The government has today awarded the final two contracts for the roll out of ultra fast broadband around New Zealand and the award last month of a contract for the roll out of broadband in rural areas.

Steven Joyce, the Minister for Communications and Information Technology, says the government has prioritised healthcare centres for the roll out.

“We know that this technology will transform healthcare in this country, so we’ve committed to providing access to all registered healthcare centres by the end of 2015.”

While some larger hospitals currently use fibre, overall very few health premises have access.  The government’s plans will see more than 6,000 health premises able to access broadband speeds of 100 Mbps plus.

Mr Ryall says the uses for ultra fast broadband in the health sector are endless.

“The UFB will give medical practitioners anywhere in New Zealand access to the world’s leading research and specialists, without leaving their own practice.

“Tele-health technologies will allow patients to self-monitor their health at home with appropriate medical oversight – including the ability for doctors to inspect visually with high-definition, two-way teleconferencing. 

“Another enormous benefit will be the ability to email MRI scan in seconds, rather than relying on a courier, which will save precious time and money and, ultimately, lives,” says Mr Ryall.
