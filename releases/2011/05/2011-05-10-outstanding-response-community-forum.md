Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has applauded the many applications received for membership of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Community Forum.

“We’ve had 230 applications from community and special interest groups, and individuals, which underlines Canterbury’s special community spirit,” Mr Brownlee said.

“The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act stipulates that I appoint at least 20 members to the community forum.  The number and quality of applications suggests the final group will be rather larger than that required by the legislation, which is great.”

The community forum will be made up of mainly non-elected people who will provide the Minister with information and advice in relation to the recovery and redevelopment of Canterbury following September and February’s devastating earthquakes.

“I’m working with the team at the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority \[CERA] to identify a representative group, at which point we’ll make formal appointments,” Mr Brownlee said.

“I will also tomorrow hold the first of regular meetings with elected members of Canterbury local government, including community boards, so that they are kept fully up to date with what CERA is doing.”

CERA is responsible for rebuilding greater Christchurch and its surrounds, and supporting the welfare of its residents.  For more information visit [www.cera.govt.nz](http://www.cera.govt.nz)
