Two new, practical Guides for diagnosing and fixing leaky homes will benefit architects, designers, councils and homeowners, Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson said today.

The documents: Weathertightness: Guide to the Diagnosis of Leaky Buildings and Weathertightness: Guide to Remediation Design, provide clear, authoritative and practical advice about how to assess repair leaky buildings in the most cost-effective way.

The documents were developed by the Department of Building and Housing with extensive input from experts in the building sector. The Remediation Guide has been published in partnership with BRANZ, while the New Zealand Institute of Building Surveyors is providing further training to practitioners to complement the new documents.

“These Guides represent another step in the Government’s efforts to solve the leaky homes problem and ensure weathertight homes for New Zealanders,” Mr Williamson said.

“The government is focussed on ensuring cost-effective repairs are provided, reducing the future risk of failure and restoring the confidence of homeowners in the quality of their homes.”

The publication of the Guides coincides with the progress of the Weathertight Homes Resolution Services (Financial Assistance Package) Amendment Bill through Parliament.
