Youth Affairs Minister Paula Bennett welcomes the 2011 Youth Week theme for young New Zealanders to ‘Step Up, Be Heard, and Take Responsibility’.

Youth Week runs from 21 to 29 May 2011.

“Youth Week is about young people stepping up to the challenges before them and taking responsibility for their own futures,” says Ms Bennett.

Youth events include a ‘Glow Party’ in Timaru, Police Bluelight Disco in Clendon, a music recording session with TYLA Trust in Auckland, Beatbox workshop in Coromandel, Masterchef in Gisborne and sports events across the country.

The Ministry of Youth Development has appointed a Youth General Manager for the week; 21 year old, Canterbury University Student, Emma Hinge.

“I plan to meet with Emma and discuss youth issues and her role of taking the helm of the Ministry of Youth Development for the week,” says Ms Bennett.

Emma Hinge says, “I’m buzzing about being chosen to be the Youth GM, I’m really looking forward to the coming week, meeting the Minister and hearing her plans for the youth portfolio”.
