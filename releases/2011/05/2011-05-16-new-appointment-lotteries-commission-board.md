Internal Affairs Minister Hon Nathan Guy has announced the appointment of Tony Mossman as a Member of the New Zealand Lotteries Commission Board.

“Mr Mossman is a Havelock North-based chartered accountant and Director. His accounting skills and long involvement in community work will be an asset to the work of the Lotteries Commission.

“I want to thank Chris Curley who has now finished his term on the Commission.

"The government's aim is to maximise the return to the community from the proceeds of gambling while minimising any associated harm. Good management of the Lotteries business means more funding for valuable projects in our communities."

The Lotteries Commission's function is to provide governance of the Lotteries business - such as Lotto, Lotto Strike, Daily Keno and Instant Kiwi - in order to raise money for the community through lottery games.

Distributing the funds raised by the Lotteries Commission is the responsibility of a separate entity, the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board.

Other current members of the Board are the Presiding Member, Judy Kirk of Taupo, Deputy Presiding Member, Dr Richard Janes of Wellington, Miranda Burdon of Auckland and Richard Holden of Christchurch.

The appointment is effective from 16 May 2011.
