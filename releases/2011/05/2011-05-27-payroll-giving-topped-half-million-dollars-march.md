Payroll Giving donations of $546,000 in March were the highest monthly total recorded since the scheme began 18 months ago, with the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal clearly convincing people to give more generously than ever, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne announced today.

“It is very clear that the March figures were hugely boosted by New Zealanders supporting the Appeal, and finding that Payroll Giving is a simple and efficient mechanism to allow them to do that,” he said.

The March donations came from more than 5100 donors, well up from the average 1400 to 1700 donors using the scheme over the previous six months.

Payroll Giving has averaged about $129,000 a month since its inception in January last year, but has really taken off this year with $159,000 in January and $162,000 in February. The previous highest monthly total was $209,000 in December last year.

“The scheme is growing as New Zealanders become more aware of its existence and how simple it is,” Mr Dunne said.

Mr Dunne said people had also donated $80,000 of their accumulated tax credit for this year to the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal.

“That has provided a double-win for a very worthy cause,” he said.

Payroll giving is available to all employers who file their Employer Monthly Schedules to Inland Revenue electronically and is completely voluntary.
