The Minister of Ethnic Affairs, Hekia Parata, is encouraging people to participate in the EthnicA conference which starts in Wellington on Friday.

Ms Parata is one of the guest speakers at the conference along with the Chair of the Federation of Ethnic Communities’ Council of Australia Pino Migliorino, the President of the Chinese Association Steven Young, Multicultural Framework Advocate Pancha Narayanan and Wellington Mayor Celia Wade-Brown.

“EthnicA is a great opportunity to bring Maori and ethnic communities closer together to work towards a stronger, more prosperous nation,’’ Ms Parata says.

“New Zealand’s ethnic communities are vibrant and have diverse cultures, ideas and ways of thinking that can benefit all of us.’’

The Government is committed to realising the benefits of ethnic diversity.  The Government’s priorities for ethnic communities include maximising ethnic people's networks and skills for domestic economic gain, and maintaining New Zealand’s reputation as a harmonious country. 

“This event will play a vital role in achieving these priorities by forming connections between government agencies, Non Government Organisations, ethnic, Maori and mainstream communities,’’ Ms Parata says.

“These connections will allow us to tap into each others’ knowledge, skills and experiences.''

“EthnicA will also enable us to explore the challenges of building a safe, cohesive and prosperous society from a range of perspectives.’’

During the conference you will have the opportunity to hear advice from a number of business leaders.

“These people will pass on their experiences on how to communicate better with government agencies, and how to build sustainable community organisations.  In the current global economic climate, it is a welcome and timely discussion.’’

The conference is being held at Te Wharewaka o Poneke, 15 Jervois Quay, Taranaki Street, Wellington. It will run from 12.30pm to 6.00pm on Friday 6 May and Saturday 7 May, 2011.
