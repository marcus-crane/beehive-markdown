Education Minister Anne Tolley says an Education Review Office report on the implementation of National Standards is extremely encouraging and shows primary and intermediate schools are continuing to make great progress.

“Lifting the reading, writing and maths skills for our children is an absolute priority for the Government, and National Standards are already making a difference for students and parents,” says Mrs Tolley.

“This ERO report, which gathered data from 237 schools in terms three and four in 2010, shows marked improvements from the previous two terms.

“Overall, ninety per cent of schools were either well-prepared or had preparation underway to work with National Standards, up from eighty per cent in the report covering terms one and two.

“Well-prepared schools increased from 19 per cent to 37 per cent, which is very encouraging given that the data was collected towards the end of the first year of a three-year implementation.

“ERO found that the schools which were doing well had strong professional leadership and carried out robust self-reviews.

“Conversely, leadership capability and lack of assessment processes were factors in the ten per cent of schools which were not prepared.

“There was an increase in the level of understanding among principals, teachers and trustees – and they will continue to receive training in implementing the Standards.

“ERO also recommended that schools work more closely in clusters to share best practice, and this is something that the Government is looking to support further.”
