Education Minister Anne Tolley has officially launched the Canterbury Tertiary College Trades Academy, which is offering vocational trades and technology training to up to 144 students as part of the Government’s Youth Guarantee.

14 local secondary schools are working in partnership with Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology (CPIT) and employers to enable 16 and 17 year olds to earn NCEA credits and a tertiary qualification, free of charge, while gaining practical skills.

“This Trades Academy acts as a bridge between school, tertiary education, apprenticeships and employment for young people at risk of disengaging from education and skills training,” says Mrs Tolley.

“It provides students with vocational pathways, allowing them to share their time between school and CPIT, and offers trades training in carpentry, mechanical engineering, the motor industry and electrical engineering.

“Since the February earthquake, further programmes in masonry trades, plasterboarding, and painting and decorating have been added to help meet the expected trades demands in the region.

“These young people will see huge benefits, as will employers and the economy.

“Students who were at risk of dropping out of education will now be better prepared to take up apprenticeships, enter the workplace, or go on to further study.

“Eight Trades Academies are opening around the country this year, and the Canterbury Tertiary College deserves huge credit for being at the forefront of this innovative approach.

“Additional Government investment of $66.5 million over four years in Budget 2011 has ensured that 4000 places will be available in Trades Academies by 2014, with four academies set to open next year, and a further five new academies to be established.”
