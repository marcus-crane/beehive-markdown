Prime Minister John Key today announced that the Queen has approved the appointment of Lieutenant General Jerry Mateparae, Governor-General Designate, as an Additional Knight Grand Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit and as an Additional Companion of the Queen’s Service Order.

Lieutenant General Mateparae’s formal title from now until the time he is sworn in as Governor-General is Lieutenant General Sir Jerry Mateparae.

“These appointments recognise Sir Jerry’s leadership, mana and dedicated service to his country. He is an outstanding New Zealander, and will bring all these qualities to his term as Governor-General,” says Mr Key.

“These appointments are an important step in the process of becoming the next Governor-General, because when he takes office, Sir Jerry will also become Chancellor and Principal Knight Grand Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, and Principal Companion of the Queen’s Service Order. “

Sir Jerry will be sworn in as Governor-General on 31 August 2011.
