A successful bid by a Manuka honey industry consortium for Primary Growth Partnership funding is a sign the industry has the potential to grow significantly, says Agriculture Minister David Carter.

The Primary Growth Partnership (PGP) is to fund half of a $1.7 million research programme proposed by the consortium to increase the reliability of supply and volume of medical grade Manuka honey.

Mr Carter has welcomed the approval of the proposal which lifts the total government-industry commitment to PGP programmes to $477 million over 18 months.  The Government has contributed more than $218 million.

“The Government’s investment in this latest proposal is what the PGP is all about – a commitment to significantly boost economic growth through research and innovation right across the primary sector.

“I congratulate this consortium on meeting the robust approval process and I wish it every success in its bid to expand into a billion-dollar industry.”

Mr Carter says the nine programmes approved for PGP investment since 2009 represent the largest investment by Government in primary sector innovation in decades.
