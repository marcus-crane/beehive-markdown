A new on-line service will allow Licensed Building Practitioners to register their skills and expertise on the internet, Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson said today.

As part of the Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP) Scheme, an on-line service has been launched through the Department of Building and Housing website at www.dbh.govt.nz/lbp where licensed building practitioners can register online, edit their profiles and update their skills and expertise.

This database will double as a tool for consumers to check if practitioners are licensed and to obtain the latest information about them.

“The public needs to have confidence in the building industry and in the quality of their work, especially given the rebuilding being undertaken in Christchurch,” Mr Williamson said.

Already 8300 licences have been issued, and the scheme on track to hit the target of 14,000 by March 2012.

“My goal is to ensure the public are confident that licensed building practitioners are competent, and that homes and buildings are designed and built right first time,” Mr Williamson said.
