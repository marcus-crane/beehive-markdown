The Government and the Green Party today signed an agreed work programme to improve management of New Zealand’s contaminated sites.

“We have a nasty legacy of contaminated sites from old mines, gas works, timber treatment yards, livestock dips, and chemical works. The Government and the Greens agree that we need better laws, more open information, and a more consistent approach to management and clean up,” Dr Smith said.

The agreement, signed by Environment Minister Nick Smith and Green Party spokesperson for the Environment (Toxics) Catherine Delahunty, is an addition to the formal Memorandum of Understanding between the National and Green Parties signed on 8 April 2009 which covers home insulation, regulation of New Zealand natural health products, the New Zealand cycleway, and animal pest control. The addition to the MoU has been agreed by Party leaders.

 

Specific initiatives on the work programme include:

- $15.2 million Government contribution to clean-up and stabilise the Tui Mine tailings dam.
- An independent review of viability of extending the National Environment Standard to also protect environmental values.
- Development of an information management software system for regional councils to document contaminated sites.
- Compilation of a register of national priority contaminated sites.
- Reviewing law around legal obligation to report and liability for clean-up of contaminated sites.

“This work is underpinned by agreement on two important principles.  The costs of clean-up should wherever possible be paid by the polluter, and the public has a right to know what sites are contaminated and pose a risk to our environment. 

“This is an ambitious work programme on which we want to consult with councils and the community.  Our goal is a safer and cleaner New Zealand,” Dr Smith said.
