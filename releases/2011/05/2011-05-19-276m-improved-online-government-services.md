New Budget funding of $27.6 million over the next two years for igovt services will help deliver better public services more efficiently.

“The igovt services provide an easy and secure way of accessing government services online and proving identity,” Internal Affairs Minister Nathan Guy says.

“Using one log-on means people no longer have to remember multiple details for different sites, and being able to verify identity online saves the hassle of having to show multiple forms of ID to agencies.

“This is the way of the future. It has the potential to deliver quicker and easier services for the public, while saving taxpayer money,” Mr Guy says.

“Without this investment, most government agencies would be forced to develop their own authentication and verification systems. This duplication would be expensive and complicated, and many smaller agencies simply wouldn’t be able to provide online services.

“This is another important step by the Internal Affairs Department to coordinate the use of information and communications technology across government.

“Many government agencies, including the Labour Department, New Zealand Transport Agency, the Police, Internal Affairs Department, and the Auckland and Wellington City Councils, are already using igovt log-ons for various online services.

“An increasing number of agencies are looking to adopt it this year for services such as applying for a new passport or changing electoral roll details. The Internal Affairs Department has entered into negotiations with New Zealand Post to expand the use of igovt services.”
