Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has held the second of regular briefings with local elected representatives to discuss progress on recovery.

Mr Brownlee and his colleagues from the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) last night updated community board members and other local body officials on the progress of land assessment, the alliance programme to fix horizontal infrastructure, EQC and Fletcher Construction work on post quake assessments and repairs, and CERA's overall recovery strategy.

"These are proving to be valuable sessions for those managing the recovery, and, from the feedback I've been getting, for local leaders who rely on up to date information to relay back to back to their communities.

"Our commitment to consultation with Canterbury's communities is very real," Mr Brownlee said.

CERA is responsible for rebuilding greater Christchurch and its surrounds, and supporting the welfare of its residents.  For more information visit [www.cera.govt.nz](http://www.cera.govt.nz)
