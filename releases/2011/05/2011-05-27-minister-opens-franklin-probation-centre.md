The new Franklin District Community Probation Service (CPS) centre will be a step forward for management of community offenders in the area, Corrections Minister Judith Collins said.

Ms Collins opened the centre today, which brings the area’s probation staff together under one roof. Previously, they managed offenders out of two locations.

The centre will have a staff of 30, including 16 probation officers. It will provide management of all community based sentences and orders such as home detention, community detention, parole, release conditions from prison, supervision, intensive supervision and community work.

“Centres such as this one play an important role in creating safer communities,” Ms Collins said.

“They deal with a wide range of offenders, from those who might be experiencing the corrections system for the first time and are serving a community sentence, to those who are more familiar with the system.

“They ensure reintegration back into civilian life goes smoothly by building connections to offenders’ families, community groups and agencies that help manage the transition.

“It’s vital that we do a good job of managing these offenders. That is why the Government has injected $256 million into CPS to increase the number of probation officers across the country by 246.

“I’m delighted to say that the increase in the number of frontline staff has already seen CPS improve the quality of its practice to record levels.”

Ms Collins acknowledged the justice sector partners, social agencies and service providers that work alongside CPS. “Your work contributes to the Government’s vision of a better and safer New Zealand.”
