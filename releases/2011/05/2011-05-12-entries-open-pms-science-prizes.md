Entries open next Monday for one of New Zealand’s most respected science honours, the 2011 Prime Minister’s Science Prizes. The prizes are being presented for the third year and are worth $1 million.

“These prizes are a vital part of delivering on the Government’s commitment to raising the profile and prestige of science in New Zealand,” Science and Innovation Minister Wayne Mapp said today.

“Celebrating our top scientists and their work motivates people to choose careers in science, and inspires New Zealand scientists working overseas to return home.”

The prizes are:

• The Prime Minister’s Science Prize: $500,000

• The Prime Minister’s Science Media Communication Prize: $100,000

• The Prime Minister’s MacDiarmid Emerging Scientist Prize: $200,000

• The Prime Minister’s Science Teacher Prize: $150,000

• The Prime Minister’s Future Scientist Prize: $50,000

“We are rewarding a range of high achievers in the science sector. They include a young scientist about to embark on their career, an emerging scientist who will be a future leader, and a scientist or team of scientists that has already had a significant impact on New Zealand,” the Minister said.

“It is also vitally important that New Zealand has outstanding science teachers and science communicators, hence the prizes in those areas as well.”

Entries for the first four of the Prime Minister’s Science Prizes open on 16 May and close on 29 July.

The 2011 Future Scientist Prize will be awarded to the Supreme Award recipient from the Royal Society of New Zealand’s “Realise the Dream” competition.
