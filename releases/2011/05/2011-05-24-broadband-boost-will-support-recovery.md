Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says the roll out of ultra fast broadband to Canterbury homes, businesses, schools and healthcare centres will provide a boost to the region and support recovery following the September and February quakes.

His comments follow an announcement today that the government will partner with Enable Networks to rollout ultra fast broadband in the region.

The rollout will start immediately with schools, hospitals and 90 per cent of businesses covered by 2015, and links to all homes completed before 2019.

By partnering with Enable Networks, a council owned company, the government is in a good position to ensure that the rollout of broadband happens alongside the rebuilding of other infrastructure, Mr Brownlee says.

“The government, the council, and Enable Networks will work together to make sure we deliver as much as we can, as quickly as we can to the people and businesses of Christchurch.

“Enable estimates the roll out of 3.5 million metres of fibre optic cable will support 3,500 jobs in Canterbury over the next eight years.

“In the longer term, the UFB network will support high tech jobs and expand business opportunities. Service professionals like accountants, lawyers and advisors will be able to offer their services to national and international markets without leaving the city. There will also be a greater ability for Cantabrians to join in new and emerging industries.

“The investment Enable and the Crown are making in ultra fast broadband for this city could not come at a better time – not only is Canterbury open for business but we’re ready to embrace this cutting edge technology and the opportunities it offers.”

The Christchurch City Council is one of a number of organisations working with the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) on rebuilding greater Christchurch and its surrounds, and supporting the welfare of its residents. For more information visit www.cera.govt.nz
