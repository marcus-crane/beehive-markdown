Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Tariana Turia today announced a new initiative to support community-led development.

The announcement was made on Radio Waatea this morning.

“Community-led development puts communities at the centre of funding decisions and it allows the Government opportunity to invest in communities in a holistic way, rather than merely funding individual organisations and projects. It empowers local communities to generate local solutions to local problems.

“Under the initiative people will work together to identify shared issues and concerns and to find locally relevant solutions to meet the needs within their community. There is an emphasis on developing local leadership and building capacity at the broad local level,” says Mrs Turia.

To fund the initiative $1.5 million a year will be transferred from the Community Organisation Grants Scheme (COGS) for the new emphasis on community led development.

“One of my priorities for the Community and Voluntary Sector is structuring for effectiveness. This move to enable more significant and effectve longer-term investment in community development reflects that priority.”
