State Services Minister Tony Ryall has today announced that Learning State will be the new industry training organisation for local government.

From 1 April 2011, the Local Government Industry Training Organisation (LGITO) ceased operating and Learning State, the industry training organisation for the public sector, began providing industry training services to local government.

‘New Zealanders are right to expect high levels of service and professionalism from local and central government. Learning State will now help local authority employees develop their skills to strengthen the level of service to ratepayers,’ Tony Ryall said.

‘Learning State will arrange training for staff who work in local authorities in areas such as mediation, compliance, and business administration.

"This reflects Government’s objective to lift the quality of public services delivered at all levels," Tony Ryall said.

Learning State is the public sector industry training organisation. Formerly part of the State Services Commission, it was created as a separate Crown company on 1 July 2010. It currently sets skills and qualifications standards for more than 4,000 public sector employees from over 50 central government agencies.
