The latest results of the Government's Health Targets show 99 per cent of patients ready for cancer radiation treatment are starting that treatment within the world gold standard of four weeks.

The target was six weeks until the start of this year, when it was shortened to four weeks.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says, "Four weeks is the gold standard worldwide for starting cancer radiation treatment. From January to March, 99 per cent of patients started their cancer radiation treatment within four weeks and 100 per cent started within six weeks.

"Right in the middle of the period we had the Canterbury earthquake, which makes this result even more impressive. It's a tribute to the DHBs, and the South Island regional cancer centres in particular.

"Only three or four years ago, some patients were waiting up to 15 weeks to start their radiation treatment and many had to travel to Australia," Mr Ryall says.

National highlights for the quarter three 2010/11 health targets include:

• An increase to 89 per cent of emergency department patients admitted, discharged or treated within 6 hours.

• Immunisation coverage for two year olds increased to 89 percent, against a July target of 90 percent.

• Diabetes and cardiovascular services remain steady at 73 percent.

• 99 percent of patients received their cancer treatment within four weeks of their first specialist assessment.

• There was a four percent increase to 74 percent of smokers receiving help and advice to quit smoking.

• Elective surgery was two per cent above planned figures, which is 1545 more elective operations.

"The big increases in elective surgery will continue. Budget 2011 has delivered a further $68 million over four years for elective surgery," Mr Ryall says.

“That will build on an already impressive base. DHBs are now performing an extra 20,000 operations a year or 400 extra operations a week compared to 2008.

“Elective surgery improves the quality of a person's life – as do shorter waiting times for that surgery. We want District Health Boards to continue to help more people and to help them faster,” Mr Ryall says.
