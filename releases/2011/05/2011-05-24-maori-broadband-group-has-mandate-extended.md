The mandate of Nga Pu Waea, the Maori working group on rural broadband, is to be extended to include the UFB network, the Government announced today.

Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples and Minister for Communications and InformationTechnology Steven Joyce made the announcement, together with a name change to the National Maori Broadband Working Group, as the outcome of the UFB tender was announced.

“Broadband as a driver of Maori development has huge potential, and this Broadband Working Party will have a very important role with its extended mandate,” said Dr Sharples.

"Nga Pu Waea will represent and facilitate the development of Maori interests in both RBI and UFB, including investment and partnering opportunities, coverage and connectivity as well as trade training and employment services," he said.

Mr Joyce says the government’s broadband plans are about ensuring all New Zealanders, including Maori, have access to cutting edge technology and the advances it can bring.

"The working group is designed to ensure Maori can maximize those opportunities and that Maori views are represented as the rollout progresses,” he said.

"The Working Group, representing a range of Maori working in the ICT sector, and iwi and economic leaders, will work with the government and its broadband partners.

“Representatives from all partner companies will be required to meet every two months with the Working Group, and together they will report every six months to me and Dr Sharples.”
