A financial assistance package for leaky home owners is a step closer with the having its second reading of a Bill in Parliament today, Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson says.

Under the Weathertight Homes Resolution Services (Financial Assistance Package) Amendment Bill, eligible homeowners will receive a 25 percent contribution from the Government and may receive 25 percent from their local council to repair their leaky home.

“The financial assistance package will ensure more time and money is spent repairing leaky homes instead of disputing the problem,” Mr Williamson says.

Leaky home owners who use the scheme must agree not to sue contributing councils and the Crown but can still pursue builders, developers and manufacturers of defective products.

Full details of the package will be announced after the supporting legislation has progressed through Parliament.

“Meantime I would urge home owners close to the 10-year limit on lodging claims to ‘stop the clock' by lodging a claim with the Department of Building and Housing now. Assuming the claim is eligible they can choose the financial assistance package when it becomes operational," Mr Williamson says.
