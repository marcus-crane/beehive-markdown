Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has welcomed today's announcement by the State Services Commissioner that the permanent chief executive of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) will be Roger Sutton.

Mr Sutton is presently chief executive of Canterbury electricity lines company Orion Networks.

"I want to thank the State Services Commission for the work they've done in the search for a chief executive, and also congratulate Roger on his appointment.

"Roger has been an outstanding leader as Orion Networks’ chief executive, and he has a very keen appreciation of the extent of damage from the earthquakes and need for recovery here in the city.

"I'm sure Roger’s appointment will speed the recovery process.

"I think all Cantabrians, and particularly the residents of Christchurch city, can be confident we have found a chief executive who is more than up to the job."

Mr Sutton will start in mid June.  His transition into the role will be assisted by CERA's interim chief executive, deputy State Services Commissioner John Ombler.

"John Ombler has done an outstanding job over the past six weeks as acting chief executive of CERA," Mr Brownlee said. 

"I'd like to thank John for the very professional way in which he’s gone about the establishment of CERA.

"I know that what he leaves behind will give Roger a very sound base to build upon."

CERA is responsible for rebuilding greater Christchurch and its surrounds, and supporting the welfare of its residents.  For more information visit [www.cera.govt.nz](http://www.cera.govt.nz)
