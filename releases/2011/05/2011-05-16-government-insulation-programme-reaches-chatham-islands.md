The first homes in the Chatham Islands have been insulated under the Government's Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart programme, Acting Minister of Energy and Resources, Hekia Parata, announced today.

“An important part of our $347 million insulation and clean heating programme is that it’s available to homeowners everywhere in New Zealand,’’ Ms Parata says.

“Because of the Chathams remote location, they haven’t had anyone to deliver the scheme until now.

“I’m delighted we can now help Chatham Islanders make their homes warmer, drier and healthier, especially given the windy, damp and cool climate there.’’

The Government is investing $347 million in Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart over four years to retrofit at least 188,000 homes. The scheme is part of a joint initiative with the Green Party of Aotearoa, New Zealand.

Under the Chatham Islands project, Eco Insulation, one of the Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart approved installers, will base itself on the island and offer free assessments to all homeowners.

The Chatham Islands project is being administered by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA). It is being run in conjunction with the Chatham Islands Council, and Environment Canterbury and aims to insulate as many of the 264 occupied homes on the island as possible by the end of summer 2012.

Ms Parata says another benefit of making homes easier and cheaper to heat is that it also helps the Chatham Islands make the most of their energy resources.

“Along with energy efficiency initiatives, like this programme, it’s also important to look at supply. The Chathams have recently added a significant wind energy resource to their energy supply.

“Our Government is focused on renewables, the exploration of our natural resources, energy efficiency and the pricing of carbon as we manage our environmental responsibilities and economic opportunities,'' Ms Parata says.
