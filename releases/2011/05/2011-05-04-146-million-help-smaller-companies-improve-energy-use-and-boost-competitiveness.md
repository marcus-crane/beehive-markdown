Small to medium companies will get financial help to boost competitiveness and reduce costs through energy savings, the Acting Minister of Energy and Resources, Hekia Parata, announced today.

Ms Parata today launched Energising Business, a new programme run by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA). The programme will assist around 180 companies to increase profitability and competitive advantage by helping them invest in energy efficiency.

“Improved energy use has enormous benefits for business – reduced costs, improved productivity and a stronger brand and reputation. This programme will help many smaller businesses – which are the lifeblood of our economy – realise these benefits. The findings and the successes will be shared to help others build stronger, more resilient businesses through smart energy use,” Ms Parata says.

The Government is investing $1.46 million in the programme, which is expected to deliver nearly $2 million in energy savings to participating businesses each year.

Under the programme, companies spending less than $300,000 a year will get 33% of the cost of identifying and implementing energy-saving initiatives, up to a maximum of $30,000 per project.

Organisations with energy management expertise have been contracted to deliver the programme, targeting different technologies and business types across the country.

“No small business is like another, and Energising Business reflects that. EECA has partnered with experienced energy experts, and organisations with strong regional business links, to deliver a service that will best meet diverse companies’ needs,” Ms Parata says.

The first Energising Business programme to launch is the Employers’ and Manufacturers’ Association (Northern) EcoSmart Business programme run in partnership with Auckland City Council. The programme will be launched tonight.

As well as general energy efficiency support for small to medium companies, Energising Business will target EECA’s priority business sectors: food production and tourism. Further programmes targeting key sectors and regions will be rolled out in coming weeks.
