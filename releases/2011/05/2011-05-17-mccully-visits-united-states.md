Foreign Minister Murray McCully is travelling to the United States today to meet with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other Obama Administration officials.

“The signing of the Wellington Declaration last November reaffirmed the strength of the New Zealand-US relationship,” Mr McCully said.

“I will meet with Secretary Clinton as part of our on-going dialogue with the United States on current issues, including Afghanistan, cooperation in the Pacific and developments in the Middle East.”

“The visit also gives me an opportunity to extend our appreciation to the United States for the extremely prompt and generous support offered to New Zealand in the aftermath of the Christchurch earthquake,” said Mr McCully.

Mr McCully will meet with other US officials and Members of Congress, including Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, Senator John McCain, Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides, Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell and National Security Council East Asia Pacific Senior Director Danny Russel.

He will deliver an address to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) on the New Zealand-US relationship in the Pacific.
