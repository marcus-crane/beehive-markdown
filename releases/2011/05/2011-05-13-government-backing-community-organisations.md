Community organisations will get more support today from the Community Response Fund says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.   

Around $14 million has been allocated in round six of the CRF.

“We created this fund to help organisations keep delivering services to families through tough financial times and it’s done just that,” said Ms Bennett. 

In this final round, 345 organisations receive grants totalling $13.9 million. 

“We listen to those working in the community and know many are still affected by the economic recession, which was made worse by a series of recent natural disasters.”

Since the Fund opened in June 2009, more than $55 million has been paid out to 694 community organisations, some of which received multiple grants.

“Largely, funding has gone to providers dealing with budgeting, family violence, early intervention, families under stress and vulnerable children.”

The Fund is Government’s response to the extra pressure the recession put on community-based providers of critical social services, including increased in demand for services or loss of funding due to the financial crisis.
