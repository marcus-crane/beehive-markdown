Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee and Education Minister Anne Tolley have announced that full pre-earthquake operational funding for Christchurch schools is to be extended until the end of the year.

“This will provide certainty and stability for schools in Christchurch until the end of 2011,” says Gerry Brownlee.

“It means schools in Christchurch will continue to receive full funding for the number of pupils they had before February’s earthquake.”

So far, 4060 students have returned to Christchurch, 992 have moved within the city and 5103 are still enrolled in schools around New Zealand.

“Double-funding will also continue, with schools around the country still being resourced for enrolling Christchurch students,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Schools in the city are doing a fantastic job, many of them in challenging circumstances, and this funding decision comes on top of the guarantee to protect existing teacher numbers until the end of the year.”

The Ministry of Education is one of a number of government ministries and departments working with the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) on rebuilding greater Christchurch and its surrounds, and supporting the welfare of its residents.  For more information visit www.cera.govt.nz
