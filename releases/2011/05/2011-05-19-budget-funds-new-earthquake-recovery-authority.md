The new Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) will receive $25.5 million of funding over two years, Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says.

“This funding is purely to set up the new authority. The Government will also spend about $8.8 billion over the next few years to help Canterbury rebuild through the Earthquake Commission, ACC, meeting costs of residential property damage, rebuilding infrastructure such as roads and essential water systems, and welfare support,” Mr Brownlee says.

CERA was established in March as a stand-alone government department to provide an effective, timely, and coordinated recovery effort following the two devastating earthquakes in Canterbury.

“The Government is committed to rebuilding greater Christchurch and we will continue to support the region to make this happen over the coming weeks, months and years,” Mr Brownlee says.

“This new authority is an important step towards restoring the social, economic, cultural, and environmental well-being of Canterbury.”

CERA has been provided $25 million in new funding. This does not include central government funding for the rebuild of Christchurch.

CERA has also received $500,000 in reprioritised funding from Vote Economic Development to reflect the transfer of functions from the Ministry of Economic Development to CERA.

Once fully operational, CERA will prepare a budget for funding in later years for consideration by Cabinet.
