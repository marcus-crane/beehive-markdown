The spotlight’s back on New Zealand music with the launch today of New Zealand Music Month says Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman.

‘’New Zealand Music Month is in its 11th year, and over that period home-grown music has gone from strength to strength. NZ On Air’s contribution to funding locally produced music has helped put more New Zealand music on our airwaves,’’ Dr Coleman says.

‘’In late 2001, just over 11 percent of music played on commercial radio was Kiwi-made. Today it’s around 18 percent. New Zealand Music Month has helped drive that success. We are hearing more locally produced music on our airwaves and that has helped raise the profile of many artists and bands.

‘’The New Zealand Music Commission’s support of New Zealand Music Month has been pivotal in ensuring that the best of Kiwi music is on offer in May. It’s a great opportunity to celebrate our many talented musicians.

‘’There’s a feast of local talent on display around the country this month, so I encourage Kiwis to tune-in to hear some of the best New Zealand sounds on offer.’’
