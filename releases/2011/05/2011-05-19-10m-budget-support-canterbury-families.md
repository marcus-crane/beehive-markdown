Budget 2011 provides an extra $10 million to support Cantabrians rebuilding their lives and communities after the earthquake, Social Development Minister Paula Bennett says.

“This funding will go to local agencies to support Canterbury families as they deal with the impact of the earthquake and move forward.”

The cash injection will support counselling services, assist non-government organisations’ case management, co-ordinate services for families and support additional community-based services for those affected by the earthquakes.

“We’re effectively extending the Government support provided to community-based social services after last year’s earthquake,” Ms Bennett says.

“It is important to have well coordinated services on the ground as Christchurch recovers and the Government is committed to making this happen.

“Non-government agencies like Relationship Services provided essential help after the earthquake and they are still needed, so we’re continuing to support them.” 

The $10 million in support will be drawn from funding set aside for the Community Response Contingency.
