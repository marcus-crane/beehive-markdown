Public consultation is now underway on the proposed changes to the give way rule.

Transport Minister Steven Joyce says changing the give way rules for turning vehicles is part of the Government's 10-year *Safer Journeys* road safety strategy.

"Our current give way rules for turning vehicles are confusing and out of step with the rest of the world," says Mr Joyce.

"Research shows changing the rules could reduce relevant intersection crashes by seven percent."

Currently if you are turning left you have to give way to right turning traffic coming towards you. This change would reverse this so the left turning vehicle would have right of way in this situation.

Changes are also planned to the rule for T-intersections. This rule applies when there are conflicting right-turns at a T-intersection. Currently, the right-turning vehicle on the terminating road (the base of the ‘T’) has priority over the right-turning vehicle on the through road (the top of the ‘T’). The change will require traffic from an uncontrolled terminating road to give way to traffic on a through road.

An extensive education campaign would be carried out to ensure drivers are aware of the new rules before any changes come into force.

The NZ Transport Agency is now consulting on proposals to amend the Land Transport Road User Rule which includes the changes to give way rules as well as changes that would clarify existing road rules and improve school bus safety.  Any changes will come into force early next year.
