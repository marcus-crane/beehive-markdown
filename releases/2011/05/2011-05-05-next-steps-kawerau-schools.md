Education Minister Anne Tolley has made a decision on the future of schooling in Kawerau, following a second round of consultation.

“Following extensive consultation with schools and the community, I believe a number of changes need to be made to ensure that students in the area have access to the best possible education,” says Mrs Tolley.

“These changes will strengthen the quality of education for the young people of Kawerau, which has been at risk due to viability issues such as roll decline.”

The reorganisation will:

• Change Kawerau South School to a Year 1 – 8 school

• Merge Putauaki School, Kawerau North School and Kawerau Central School on the Putauaki School site with Putauaki School being the continuing Year 1-8 school

• Close Kawerau Intermediate School

• Retain Kawerau College, without relocating the Teen Parent Unit

A decision on the possible establishment of a designated character Years 1 – 13 Māori language immersion school, which has a separate process, will be made soon.

“The changes to the structure of schooling in Kawerau were taken after careful consideration of the consultation reports and advice from the Ministry, and I’m confident that students will have greater educational opportunities as a result,” says Mrs Tolley.

The boards of all Kawerau schools now have 28 days in which to make any additional comments.

A final decision will be announced soon after this, with any changes to Kawerau schools to be implemented from term one, 2012.
