Trade Minister Tim Groser will tomorrow welcome India’s Minister of Commerce and Industry, Anand Sharma to New Zealand at the invitation of the New Zealand Government.

Mr Sharma will be accompanied by a large business delegation, members of whom will be meeting the New Zealand business community.

During his two-day visit Mr Sharma will meet the Prime Minister, the Trade Minister and Agriculture Minister David Carter.

Mr Groser welcomes the visit as an excellent opportunity to advance links with India, particularly the free trade agreement negotiations underway between the two countries.

“We place a very high priority on strengthening the relationship with India. Our two-way merchandise trade was worth over $1.2 billion in 2010 and India is an increasingly important source of tourists and students coming to New Zealand, but there is potential to do more,” Mr Groser said.

“The free trade agreement is an exciting prospect”, he continued. “It will provide a framework for our trade and economic links to reach that potential. The more open access and investment flows that can come from the FTA will be of benefit to businesses in both countries.”

Mr Sharma will be the guest of honour with Mr Groser at events jointly organised by the India New Zealand Business Council (INZBC, working with Export NZ, the NZIIA, Auckland City and Auckland Chamber of Commerce) and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) in Auckland and Wellington.

“The interaction between the Indian delegation and their New Zealand counterparts will provide a strong complement to Mr Sharma’s visit. It will allow our businesspeople to build their relationships and discuss the significant commercial opportunities that exist between New Zealand and India,” Mr Groser said.
