The Minister of Ethnic Affairs, Hekia Parata, is encouraging Kiwis to celebrate tomorrow’s World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development.

‘’New Zealand is rich in cultural diversity and World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development is a reminder for Kiwis to participate in, and learn about new cultures,’’ Ms Parata says.

New Zealand is becoming more ethnically diverse.  Between 2001 and 2006 our ethnic population increased by more than a third.  By 2021 it is estimated that almost 18 per cent of our population will comprise of ethnic people.

“New Zealand is a wonderful place to live for new settlers and it is important that we embrace new cultures and see the real value that diversity brings to our social, cultural, and economic understanding of the world.”

“It is imperative that we respond to ethnic diversity in order to be successful in the future.

Ms Parata says gaining a better understanding of different cultures can be as easy as introducing yourself to your neighbour.

“There are a number of cultural events held throughout the year that people can participate in to learn new cultures, such as Chinese New Year celebrations and Diwali festivals,” says Ms Parata.

“But learning about new cultures does not need to be events based – it can be as simple as talking to a neighbour.’’
