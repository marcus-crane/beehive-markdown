Changes to the Gas and Electrical Certification scheme will save consumers money, the Acting Minister of Energy and Resources, Hekia Parata, and the Minister for Building and Construction, Maurice Williamson announced today.

The savings are the result of a review of the scheme to ensure that certification for gas and electrical work practices are effective, efficient and safe.

The review found the scheme is working well but there could be some administrative changes to improve effectiveness and reduce costs.

“Where tradespeople have previously had to fill out a prescribed certificate for which the consumer pays a fee, they can now provide installation information on an invoice or a separate form, giving them more flexibility in their business practices,’’ says Ms Parata.

“This won’t mean any reduction in safety. The safe use and supply of gas and electricity is everyone’s concern – New Zealanders use these energy sources every day.”

Minister Williamson says the changes will benefit consumers.

“Consumers will no longer have to pay $25 for gas certificates and $6 for electrical certificates. This will save consumers around $2.4 million each year,’’ Mr Williamson says.

Other changes will include a new requirement for high-risk installation work to be reported to the Ministry of Economic Development, which will complement the Ministry’s existing energy safety role.

The changes will come into effect on April 1, 2013 for gas certification and on July 1, 2013 for electrical certification.

The Electrical Workers Registration Board, and the Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Board will continue to undertake regular competency audits of tradespeople and to encourage compliance with the changes.

The Ministry of Economic Development, through Energy Safety, will continue to perform safety audits.
