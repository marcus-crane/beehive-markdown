New Zealand’s next Consul-General in Hong Kong will be Robert Kaiwai, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today. Resident in Hong Kong, the Consul General is also cross-accredited to Macau.

“New Zealand and Hong Kong enjoy a strong and constructive relationship. Hong Kong is an important trade and economic partner of New Zealand, and as regional trading economies with like-minded views on the benefits of free trade we have much in common,” Mr McCully said.

“Recent highpoints in our relationship include the signing of a Double Tax Agreement on 1 December 2010 and the entry into force of the Closer Economic Partnership on 1 January 2011. Completion of an Investment Protocol in the next two years, combined with strong and growing visitor numbers and growing trade, provides further opportunities to drive the relationship forward,” Mr McCully said.

Hong Kong is our 10th largest export market with two-way trade totalling $978 million for the year to February 2011. It is a major regional financial centre.

“As Consul-General, Mr Kaiwai will lead New Zealand’s presence in Hong Kong, with a significant role in forging and maintaining a strong relationship in this special administrative region” Mr McCully said.

Mr Kaiwai is currently serving as High Commissioner in Tarawa and Ambassador to Palau, Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. Previously, he has held various senior roles including Deputy Director in the Middle East and Africa Division, and has been seconded to the Ministry for the Environment leading a senior policy team developing New Zealand’s climate change policy.

Mr Kaiwai takes up his assignment in December 2011, replacing Adele Bryant.

Note: Since its handover to the People’s Republic of China in 1997, Hong Kong has been a Special Administrative Region.
