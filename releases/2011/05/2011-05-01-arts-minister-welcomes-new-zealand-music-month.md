Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson today welcomed the beginning of the 11th New Zealand Music Month, saying it was a great way to sample from the full range of local music offerings with events nationwide.

“New Zealand musicians are consistently recognised on the international stage,” Mr Finlayson said, “from contemporary acts at the annual SXSW music fair in Austin, Texas to the NZSO performing in Vienna.”

“We can take advantage of the fact we have thriving live music scenes across many genres right on our door-steps during May.”

“New Zealand Music Month is an excellent opportunity to get out of the house and see our world class musicians in their natural environment – whether that is Auckland’s Aotea Centre or Karangahape Road, the Wellington Opera House or Cuba Street, or elsewhere throughout the country.”

New Zealand Music Month runs for all of May, and is promoted by the New Zealand Music Commission.
