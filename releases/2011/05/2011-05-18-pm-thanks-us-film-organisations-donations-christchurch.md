Prime Minister John Key today thanked three of the world’s major motion picture organisations for their generous donations to the Government’s Christchurch Earthquake Appeal.

James Cameron’s Lightstorm Entertainment and Fox Filmed Entertainment, co-chaired by Jim Gianopulos and Tom Rothman, have collectively donated USD $1 million (NZD $1.26 million) towards the Appeal.

Warner Brothers, through Warner Bros. Video Ltd and Warner Bros Entertainment Australia Pty Limited, has donated USD $500,000 (NZD $633,557) to the Appeal.

“Fox Filmed Entertainment, Lightstorm Entertainment and Warner Brothers have all developed deep ties with New Zealand over the years, and their support for Christchurch as the city recovers from two earthquakes is warmly welcomed.

“The support for Christchurch from individuals, charities, businesses and governments from around the world has been phenomenal,” says Mr Key.

“It is particularly heartening to see overseas organisations with connections to New Zealand act on that bond and throw their weight behind the recovery and rebuilding effort.”

The Christchurch Earthquake Appeal is the New Zealand Government’s official, global fundraiser for the recovery effort for the city and the Canterbury region.

Launched by Mr Key on February 27, the Appeal has generated over $70 million in funds raised and pledged to support the regeneration of Christchurch’s community infrastructure.
