Commerce Minister Simon Power today announced the re-appointment of six members of the Standards Council.

The Standards Council is a Crown entity, which through Standards New Zealand develops, adopts, and publishes New Zealand standards. It has up to 12 members.

Mr Power said Richard Gibbons, John Hannah, Sharon Kletchko, Vivian Kloosterman, Vaughan Renner, and Michael Wallsmannsberger have been re-appointed for one-year terms.

“These re-appointments provide the Standards Council with continuity of expertise and experience, allowing the new chair to develop a robust succession plan,” Mr Power said.

“I am confident these members will maintain the council’s culture of diligence and industry-interest.”
