Associate Minister of Education Rodney Hide today announced the three high quality private consortia, shortlisted by the Ministry of Education, for the first school property public private partnership (PPP) in New Zealand

Expressions of interest were called for in April and, following a robust selection process, the following consortia have been selected to proceed to the next stage of the tendering process.

- Building Futures Group (construction: Mainzeal; designer: Warren and Mahoney; facilities management: PAE)
- Future Education (construction: Arrow; designer: Jasmax; facilities management: Spotless Facility Services)
- Learning Infrastructure Partners (lead construction: Hawkins; designer: ASC and PPA architects; facilities management: Programmed Facility Management

“We are in the fortunate position of having three very strong consortia, all with experience in the education sector, keen to partner with the Government to provide long-term property solutions that will support education at Hobsonville Point,” Mr Hide said.

“A PPP ties together the design and construction of the property with its maintenance for 25 years, forcing people to think about what makes sense in the longer term.  This also allows schools and boards to focus on student learning and achievement, without the added responsibility of managing the property.

“I’m confident the three selected consortia are up to the task of creating world class facilities for 21st century learners,” Mr Hide said.

The three consortia will now proceed through an interactive tendering process and final bids will be submitted in September this year.

The new primary school is scheduled to open at the start of 2013, with the secondary school due to open at the start of 2014.
