Foreign Minister Murray McCully starts a visit to Japan and Indonesia tonight for bilateral discussions on regional economic events, the TPP free trade agreement, and regional security issues.

He has been invited by the President of the Nikkei Inc News Group to speak at the Nikkei Conference in Tokyo on “The future of Asia.”

It is the first time a member of the New Zealander government has been asked to present to this forum which represents a host of ASEAN political and business leaders. Also presenting will the Prime Minister of Malaysia, the deputy Prime Minister of Vietnam, Singapore’s Minister mentor, Lee Kuan Yew, and the ASEAN Secretary General.

Mr McCully will hold a bilateral meeting with the Japanese Foreign Minister Takeaki  Matsumoto, also meet former Foreign Ministers Maehara and Nakasone, as well as members of the Japanese Diet.

“During my discussions in Tokyo with Foreign Minister Matsumoto I will be encouraging Japan to progress its economic reform agenda and undertake negotiations towards a bilateral free trade agreement,” he said.

"We will also discuss disaster management and reconstruction efforts from the earthquakes both countries suffered. I will also take the opportunity to discuss the 2019 Rugby World Cup with Japan’s Rugby Football Union chairman Tatsuro Yabe,” said Mr McCully.

On the way to Japan the Minister will stop in Bali to attend the meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement of Foreign Ministers.  “This will be a useful opportunity to meet counter-parts from Africa and Central America where New Zealand has limited diplomatic representation,” said Mr McCully.

The Minister is out of the country for six days.
