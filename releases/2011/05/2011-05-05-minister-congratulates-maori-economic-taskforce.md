Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples praised the work of the Maori Economic Taskforce today, at a Maori Economic Summit where the results of the Taskforce’s work were reported back to the people.

Speaking to around 200 Maori business and community leaders, Dr Sharples said that, in his first year in office, the country faced a global economic crisis.

“I was worried. History taught us that Māori were devastated during the Great Depression of the 1930s and suffered terrible outcomes during the recession of the 1980s-90s,” he said.

“The Māori Economic Summit I convened in 2009 prepared us to respond to the recession by looking at ways to grow the Māori economy and create employment.

“When I formed the Taskforce out of the Summit, I gave it a two-year timeframe and set three goals:

- to support Māori through the recession;
- to look at strategic opportunities beyond the recession; and
- to embrace kaupapa Māori in all that we do.”

Dr Sharples listed the results of the Taskforce’s work, including more than 450 community garden projects, 1800 training or job placements, business networking and iwi collaboration projects, resource publications, international marketing, and promoting research and innovation.

“These developments led to immediate outcomes that have supported whānau through the recession,” he said. “They have also laid a foundation for the long term growth of Māori business, work force and communities.

“Māori and Iwi are now recognised as playing an important role in the New Zealand economy. Furthermore we are valued as Māori, and the work of the Taskforce has contributed to this recognition.”

Dr Sharples said a business delegation he led to China showed the value of Maori culture in business and economic development.

“By sharing the similarities in our cultures as Māori and Chinese, and re-connecting our links as brothers and sisters from ancient history, we were able to build new relationships, and enhance existing ones, with many Chinese leaders in politics, business and local communities,” said Dr Sharples.

“Today is a day to celebrate the achievements of the Taskforce and to work out together how best to build on those achievements.

“What is positive for Māori will be positive for all New Zealanders,” he said.
