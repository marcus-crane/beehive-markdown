Budget 2011 delivers significant investment to lift achievement in schools and keep students engaged to gain worthwhile qualifications, Education Minister Anne Tolley says.

“Budget 2011 invests an extra $1.3 billion in operating funding and $109 million in capital for education, of which $621.2 million is for schooling,” she says.

“This includes an increase in operational funding for schools of 2.92 per cent – that’s $118.1 million over four years, as we focus on giving every New Zealand student the chance to succeed.

“We are targeting funding at initiatives that are already seeing positive results, to make a good system even better.”

Budget 2011 highlights for schools include:

- A 2.92 per cent - or $118.1 million – increase in new operational funding for schools over four years to allow for rises in costs.
- $66.5 million over four years in new funding for the wider Youth Guarantee to keep 16 and 17 year olds engaged in education and training. This will provide up to five new Trades Academies and eight new Service Academies.
- $77.9 million over four years for roll growth.
- $59.7 million in new operating and capital funding over four years for school property, and $60 million over four years will be reprioritised to build kura and upgrade existing school buildings.
- $16.7 million to support moderation and resources for teachers using National Standards, and to establish school cluster networks to share best practice for the implementation of Standards.
- $51.5 million over four years for the School Network Upgrade Project, as we continue to build the infrastructure to support ultra-fast broadband in schools.
- An additional $6.1 million over four years for Alternative Education from July 2011, to increase places and provide specialist professional learning and development for staff.
- $4 million over three years to provide an additional 72 teachers to support more than 600 students who are hearing and/or vision impaired.
- $4 million more over four years to provide increased professional development and mentoring for boards of trustees.

“These Budget 2011 initiatives will support school leadership and management, help schools to work together more effectively and allow schools to share knowledge about effective teaching and learning,” Mrs Tolley says.

“In turn, this will support the Government’s priorities to lift achievement levels for all students, and to help schools retain and engage students in education and training.”
