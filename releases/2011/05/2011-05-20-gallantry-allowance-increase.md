The rate at which the War Disablement Pension Gallantry Allowance is paid will increase from 9 June 2011, Minister of Veterans' Affairs Judith Collins announced today.

The allowance is paid to veterans who receive a War Disablement Pension and have one of the gallantry decorations listed in the War Pensions Act 1954. The decorations are:

 The Victoria Cross

 The Conspicuous Gallantry Medal (Flying)

 The Conspicuous Gallantry Medal (Navy)

 The Distinguished Conduct Medal

 The Distinguished Flying Cross

 The Distinguished Flying Medal

 The Distinguished Service Cross

 The Distinguished Service Medal

 The Distinguished Service Order

 The Military Cross

 The Military Medal

The increase fulfils a Government promise to increase the allowance to $30 a week. Currently, the allowance is $10.49 a week.

“The Government believes the present allowance is inadequate. We have taken this step to increase the allowance as it is important to recognise those who have shown great courage in the service of their country,” Ms Collins said.

There are currently 105 recipients of the allowance.
