Defence Minister Wayne Mapp is representing New Zealand at ceremonies marking the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Crete this weekend.

The Minister and Chief of Defence Force Lieutenant General Rhys Jones will attend a commemoration service and wreath-laying at the Crete/New Zealand monument in Galatas village tonight (7pm in Crete).

“The Battle of Crete was New Zealand’s first major battle of World War 2, and the first major battle led by New Zealand commanders,” Dr Mapp said.

“It has special resonance for New Zealanders. Today, we remember the extraordinary bravery of those who fell here.” \[Full speech for tonight below]

Tomorrow Dr Mapp will attend a similar ceremony at the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery at Souda Bay and on Sunday services will be held at the German War Cemetery at Maleme and at Maleme Airport.

Dr Mapp returns to New Zealand next Wednesday.

Speech in Galatas at the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Crete

“Today we commemorate the battles in and around Maleme and Galatas. This sector saw the most intense fighting in the Battle of Crete, and the most decisive.

“This was a fight largely between members of the 2nd New Zealand Division, and elite German mountain soldiers and paratroopers. Today, the Battle of Crete has special resonance for New Zealanders - a resonance almost equal to the Gallipoli campaign of 26 years earlier, on the other side of the Aegean. Both were bloody campaigns, and both involved the bulk of New Zealand’s deployed forces. But unlike Gallipoli, the Battle of Crete was a near-run affair.

As military historian Professor Glyn Harper has written:

‘\[on Crete] a scratch force made up largely of New Zealanders and Australians came tantalisingly close to inflicting Germany’s first land defeat in the war. It was a tragedy and serious defeat for the allies, but only by the narrowest of margins.’

“This was New Zealand’s first major battle of World War 2, and the first major battle led by New Zealand commanders. It was also the most severe test faced by the Wehrmacht, which had hitherto occupied most of Europe virtually unopposed.

“As the German commander of the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Parachute Regiment later said:

‘The Battle of Crete was to prove the overture to … Stalingrad, and El Alamein. For the first time there had stood against us a brave and relentless opponent on a battleground which favoured him.’

“The defence of Galatas on 25 May was particularly bitter and bloody. Despite tenacious resistance, the crushing weight of the German attack - and their control of the skies - forced the allies back, and sparked panic. Here, then- Colonel Howard Kippenberger made his famous appeal to “Stand for New Zealand! Stand every man who is a soldier!”

“At 8pm, the New Zealand forces fixed bayonets and counter-attacked with fury, charging through Galatas, yelling the Maori haka, and inflicting great enemy losses.

“A young Second Lieutenant Sandy Thomas led his platoon to the town centre, only to be badly wounded. Lying in the street, the future Major-General drove his men forward, still firing at German soldiers perched on roof tops.

“The recapture of Galatas was one of the Allies’ finest feats of arms on Crete. But despite the victory, Galatas was the first of a series of rearguard actions. Most famous is the 28th Maori Battalion’s bayonet charge at “42nd Street”, on the Chania-Souda Bay road. With Australian support, the battalion routed the opposing force, buying valuable time for the retreat.

“These historic events are part of the fabric of our societies. They represent an ANZAC and a Commonwealth tradition of sacrifice in the cause of freedom - a tradition expressed today in Afghanistan and other theatres of conflict.

“The cost of the Battle for Crete was high for both sides. There were 1751 Commonwealth soldiers killed or died of wounds, including 671 New Zealanders. The Royal Navy lost more than 2000 sailors in operations around Crete. Over 3000 German soldiers were killed in this Pyrrhic victory.

“This is also a time to remember the heroic sacrifices made by the Cretan population. With no training and limited equipment, you defended your homeland with the utmost bravery. Your ordeal continued after the Allies’ defeat, with four years of occupation and fierce resistance. The many Allied troops who evaded capture were sheltered and protected by the people of Crete, who paid a terrible price for this, and for their continuing resistance.

“From this struggle, a permanent bond of friendship was forged between Greece and the nations that fought to defend this island.

“The New Zealand Government encouraged Greek migration to New Zealand after the war. This led to the blending of Kiwi and Greek families. In New Zealand’s 2006 Census 2547 people identified themselves as Greek. The Greek community is particularly strong in Wellington, Chania’s sister city.

“It is for good reason that one of the New Zealand groups here for the 70th commemoration has named itself the Enduring Legacy tour. As they have observed:

‘By returning to Crete at this time, with the veterans, we want to affirm that our forefathers did not fight and die in vain. They fought for values that our two countries share between us and which continue to be at the centre of our lives.’

“In New Zealand there is a Maori saying: ‘Ko tō tātou toa, he toa o ngā tupuna’. Our courage is inherited from our ancestors. Today we honour our ancestors, and remember their extraordinary bravery 70 years ago.”
