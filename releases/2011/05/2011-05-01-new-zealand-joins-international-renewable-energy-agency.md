Acting Minister of Energy and Resources Hekia Parata welcomes New Zealand’s membership of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). 

IRENA is an international organisation dedicated to facilitating the rapid development and deployment of renewable energy worldwide.

New Zealand is already one of the world’s leading countries in renewable energy. Last year 74 per cent of New Zealand's electricity came from renewable sources. The Government has a target of 90 per cent by 2025.

"Renewables and energy efficiency are a big part of our energy picture. We are a world leader in geothermal energy. Our rivers and lakes have long provided hydro-electricity and our wind resources are world class,� Ms Parata says.

"By joining this new organisation New Zealand has the opportunity to contribute to international efforts to increase the deployment of renewable energy technologies and drive down their costs."

The International Renewable Energy Agency, which is based in Abu Dhabi, will work in close collaboration with other international bodies including the International Energy Agency (IEA).

It will have a strong focus on capacity building in developing countries, including Pacific Island states.

New Zealand ratified the IRENA statute in January 2011 and was accepted as a member in April 2011. The IRENA Statute became binding from today, May 1, making New Zealand a full member of the organisation.

"The Government is focused on renewables, the exploration of our natural resources, energy efficiency and the pricing of carbon as we manage our environmental responsibilities and economic opportunities,'' Ms Parata says.

"New Zealand's membership of IRENA is another example of the balanced approach our Government is taking to building a sustainable energy and resources future."
