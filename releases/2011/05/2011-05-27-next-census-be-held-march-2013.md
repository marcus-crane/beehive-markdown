The next New Zealand Census of Population and Dwellings will be held in March 2013, Statistics Minister Maurice Williamson announced today.

The 2011 Census was postponed after Christchurch’s 22 February earthquake.

"The 2011 Census could not have been successfully completed given the national state of emergency and the probable impact on census results," Mr Williamson said.

"The census provides critical information for the Government and is a goldmine for researchers, councils, community groups and iwi trying to plan.”

There are major benefits to holding a census in 2013, including being able to revise the electoral boundaries and hold a Māori electoral option ahead of a 2014 General Election. Population data can also be updated.

Mr Williamson said the Government and Statistics NZ had considered holding the census in March 2012, however it was agreed the time period was too short to ensure the census could be planned accurately.

"Statistics New Zealand will now begin planning and work on the 2013 Census," Mr Williamson said.
