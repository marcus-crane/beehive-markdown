Housing Minister Phil Heatley has announced the latest round of Housing Innovation Fund (HIF) application successes.

Funding for the projects based in Hamilton, Flaxmere and Hastings will result in 12 new properties for New Zealanders on low to moderate incomes, or with special housing needs says Mr Heatley.

Successful applications include one made under the Māori Demonstration Partnership (MDP), which will result in a house with 11 bedrooms to be used as affordable rentals for families and kaumatua.

Te Taiwhenua O Heretaunga is building the property in Flaxmere, Hastings. It will have communal living, laundry and kitchen areas. It will also provide an holistic Kaupapa Maori independent living service.

The total value of this project is $1,927,348. Te Taiwhenua O Heretaunga will provide $963,674, which will be matched with HIF funding.

The region will also benefit from a $1.85 million dollar innovative project by the Whatever it Takes Trust (WIT).  The Trust will be contributing $1,370,000 and receive $480,000 from HIF funding.

The Trust will build a 10-bedroom transitional facility and three two-bedroom units on sites in Napier and Hastings. The properties will be used as affordable rental housing for low income people who experience mental illness, and as a transitional facility service run by the Trust.

"These homes will benefit people with disabilities who wish to rent their own home and who receive Ministry of Health-funded Supported Living services," says Mr Heatley.

In Hamilton Accessible Properties will build seven accessible rental units, made up of three housing complexes of self contained flats. Accessible Properties will contribute $1,273,000 to the project and receive $1,200,000 from HIF funding.

"Working with third sector providers of social and niche housing has proven to be successful time and time again, it is a recipe that has repeatedly delivered up to three times the amount of housing the Government could deliver on its own," Mr Heatley said.

The total amount allocated to HIF projects so far this year is $6.4 million. A total of $20 million was set aside in the last budget for 2010/2011 funding.
