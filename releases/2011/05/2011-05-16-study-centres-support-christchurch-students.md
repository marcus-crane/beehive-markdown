Education Minister Anne Tolley says new study centres are providing extra support for Christchurch students whose schools are still affected by the February earthquake.

The centres provide a supervised place for students to study, and are aimed at students at colleges which have been temporarily relocated to another site or are co-located with another school because of earthquake damage.

“This is something that students and their parents will welcome,” says Mrs Tolley.

“The extra assistance will help students overcome any disruption to their studies caused by the earthquake, and will especially be of use to students studying NCEA.

“Schools which are currently sharing sites are having to work in morning or afternoon shifts, and these study centres provide students with a good learning environment before or after their allocated time at school.

“The centres will be staffed by trained and registered teachers, focussing on students in years 11, 12 and 13, giving young people a place to go to do their homework, study for tests, or seek extra help from trained teachers.”

The centres are available to all students.

Below are venues, opening times, and the name of the school supervising each centre.
