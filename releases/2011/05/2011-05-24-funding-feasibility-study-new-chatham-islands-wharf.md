$160,000 for a new feasibility study will help evaluate options for the Waitangi wharf in the Chatham Islands, says Internal Affairs Minister Nathan Guy.

“The Waitangi Wharf is the lifeblood of these islands, connecting over 600 local residents with the mainland and supporting important trade in fisheries and agriculture.

“The wharf is in poor condition and is being eroded by ‘concrete cancer’. In time it may become unusable, having a major impact on the community there.

“The Chatham Islands contributes around $200 million to the New Zealand economy, largely through farming and fishing, which is why the Government is making this initial investment.

”I've been working on this issue over the last year with Government Ministers and the Mayor Mr Alfred Preece. The study will help us assess the problems with the current wharf, develop a business case and consider options for the future.

“The Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust will also be contributing $40,000 towards the cost of this investigation,” says Mr Guy.
