Health Minister Tony Ryall has today opened Tauranga Hospital's Building 50 – the final stage of Bay of Plenty District Health Board's multi-million dollar building and refurbishment project.

The DHB has invested $157.3 million into the project with $25 million for Building 50.

"The Government is strongly committed to protecting and growing our public health services, despite the difficult economic times, says Mr Ryall.

"We have now invested an additional $1.5 billion into health services over three budgets."

Building 50 (formerly known as the East Wing) now houses an extended and upgraded Medical Day Stay Ward and Endoscopy Unit on the ground floor – and ICU and Coronary Care Units on the first floor which are both now doubled in size.

Services will be relocated into Building 50 on 14 June.

"BOP staff should be proud for completing this multi million dollar project on time and on budget," says Mr Ryall.

The Health Minister also announced that the Government has just given sign-off for the final design of the $65 million Whakatane Hospital development. Site works for the new hospital are already underway.

Mr Ryall visited Tauranga Hospital's new integrated operations centre – a new and improved 'mission control' which will run ED and hospital services more efficiently and responsively.

And he awarded nursing staff in Tauranga's Ward 3A for being the first ward in New Zealand to fully put into practice all modules of the Releasing Time to Care – Productive Ward quality improvement programme.

"State of the art buildings and technology are very important, but just two ingredients for a world class health service. I am pleased to see BOP DHB nurses are now spending significantly more time face to face with their patients as a result of their quality improvement programme."
