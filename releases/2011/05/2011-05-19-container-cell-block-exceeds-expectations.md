The first prison unit built of recycled shipping containers in New Zealand has outperformed expectations in its first year of operation, Corrections Minister Judith Collins said today.

The unit at Rimutaka Prison was opened last June and is housing 60 prisoners in double-bunked cells.

It was built in response to a projected shortage of prison beds due to a lack of planning by the previous Government. The container cell block, along with expanded use of double-bunking averted the capacity crisis.

“I’m very pleased that the unit is outperforming all expectations,” Ms Collins said.

“The unit was constructed much quicker and 30 percent cheaper than comparable, traditionally built units.

“In its first year of operation, the number of incidents within the container unit has been significantly lower than in comparable units.

“There have been no incidents involving drugs, alcohol, cellphones or weapons and there have been no assaults on staff. This is attributable to the secure design of the unit and good management and vigilance by Corrections staff.

“The maintenance costs for the unit are 34 percent lower than expected and vandalism is extremely low.”

Ms Collins said that speculation by critics of the container cells that they would create “tin shanties and slum prisons” had proven unfounded and ill-informed.

“The container units are among the best prisoner accommodation in the Corrections estate.”

The Department will now conduct a performance evaluation of the unit to assess how containers might be used at other prisons.
