Environment Minister Nick Smith today launched the Love NZ recycling initiative in Wellington to coincide with Rugby World Cup 2011.

“The Rugby World Cup is the biggest event New Zealand has hosted. This Love NZ campaign is about recycling thousands of tonnes of glass, plastic and paper that would otherwise go to landfill and showing our 85,000 international guests that we care for our environment.  This is about turning a potential risk from large volumes of waste into an opportunity to reinforce our clean, green brand," Dr Smith said.

"This initiative in Wellington involves an additional 50 permanent public recycling bins around high profile sites. There will also be temporary bin hire during the tournament for the Wellington Stadium and fanzones. This is part of a nationwide programme of 340 permanent bins and 1700 temporary bins in 25 centres around New Zealand.

"The strength of this recycling initiative is that it has Government, local authorities and industry working together in preparation for the Rugby World Cup. The Government is committing $2 million to the project from the Waste Minimisation Fund and the Glass Packaging Forum is committing an additional $500,000 to support councils like Wellington City in preparing environmentally for the Rugby World Cup.

"Wellington has a proud record of environmental leadership on public transport, Zealandia, support for wind farms, and its new wheelie bin kerbside recycling service beginning on 16 May.  I commend the Wellington City Council for building on this leadership by joining this Love NZ campaign.

“I am also delighted at the increased support from industry for the Love NZ Brand that will enable TV commercials, billboards, adshels and mobile advertising supporting the message of recycling.

“This campaign is about more than just the Rugby World Cup. New Zealanders have made a real culture shift over the past two decades with recycling at home, but we now need to take the next step and make it the norm when we are out and about around town. Our aim is to leave a legacy after the Rugby World Cup of good quality public recycling bins and a new mindset of public place recycling.”
