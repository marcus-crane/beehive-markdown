Associate Minister of Education Rodney Hide today announced the allocation of $22.8 million in funding under the ‘*Success For All – Every School, Every Child’* initiative to upgrade existing special schools and satellite units, and create new satellites around the country. 

“Launched in October 2010, *‘Success For All’* is about schools supporting all children whatever their needs.  This one-off funding will help realise the vision of *‘Success For All’* which is to develop a more inclusive education system,” Mr Hide said. 

“The main focus of this funding is to address space deficiencies at special school base sites and their satellite units at mainstream schools – 15 special school base sites and 14 satellite units will receive funding as part of this one-off programme.  This is in addition to the regular property funding programmes for which special schools are eligible.

“The schools will work with the Ministry of Education to determine the best local solution that will optimise students’ integration and learning in a mainstream setting.  In most cases this will mean expanding satellite units or establishing new ones.  

“I have first hand experience of the contribution special schools make to the students and their families.  This funding will help to ensure the property at these facilities supports the good work going on at these schools,” Mr Hide said.

*\*\*The assessment of special schools took place prior to the 22 February Christchurch earthquake.  One special school base site and one satellite unit in Christchurch have qualified for funding in this one–off programme.  This money will be held by the Ministry until a full assessment of the damage at affected schools has been completed and the highest needs within the Christchurch special schools network have been identified.*
