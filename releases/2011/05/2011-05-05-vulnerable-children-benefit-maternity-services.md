Extra funding for Wellchild services will make a real difference by focusing on first time mothers says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

The $21.3 million for Wellchild services are part of a $54.5 million package announced by Health Minister Tony Ryall today.

“First time mothers and their babies will benefit from extra help and support, particularly for those who are finding it tough” says Ms Bennett.

“I’m especially supportive of this initiative because I believe it will make a real difference to vulnerable children in at-risk families.”

The National Government continues to fund child-centred initiatives like the Never Ever Shake a Baby Campaign, Social Workers in Hospitals, the NGO First Response, Home for Life and Supported Teen Parent Homes.

“This is another example of how this Government is focussed on what matters and helping those who need it most.”

“It’s vital we put funding into the services that work and that make a real difference, especially for our children who deserve every opportunity and every protection possible,” says Ms Bennett.
