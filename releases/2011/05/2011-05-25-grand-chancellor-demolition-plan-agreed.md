Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has this morning announced a phased demolition of the Hotel Grand Chancellor will begin in the next few weeks.

"This will be the largest demolition ever carried out in New Zealand," Mr Brownlee said.

"It’s also hugely symbolic for the people of Christchurch that the recovery process is well underway.

"It’s very important to get these big demolition jobs going because the sooner these buildings are down the faster we can move to reopen areas and get on with rebuilding.

"As the hotel comes down in height it will mean that safer access will gradually be possible to nearby buildings and streets."

However, given the size and nature of the job, complete demolition could take up to a year.

"I’m aware this is a long and slow process, but it needs to be managed very carefully to ensure the safety of the workers involved and reduce risk to neighbouring buildings."

Mr Brownlee says Fletcher Construction has been chosen as the preferred contractor after a thorough tender process.

"In agreement with the owner of the Grand Chancellor, the work will be managed by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA)," Mr Brownlee said.

Before demolition work begins, some further work will be done to reinforce the interior of the hotel.  This will allow the retrieval of property guests were forced to leave behind on 22 February.

"We've been fortunate that some extraordinarily skilled work done just after the earthquake allowed the hotel to be stabilised and prevented its immediate collapse.  That meant we could explore the best way to bring the building down with the least impact on the surrounding area.

"I’d like to acknowledge the Grand Chancellor's owner, Grand Hotels International, for their cooperation in developing this solution.  This is a good outcome for Christchurch," Mr Brownlee said.

CERA is responsible for rebuilding greater Christchurch and its surrounds, and supporting the welfare of its residents.  For more information visit [www.cera.govt.nz](http://www.cera.govt.nz)
