Civil Defence Minister John Carter has met with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon. Both are attending the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction in Geneva this week.

The pair met after Mr Carter took part in a question and answer session called “Invest Today for a Safer Tomorrow – Increased Investment in Local Action”. The session was moderated by BBC journalist and broadcaster Zeinab Badawi.

Secretary-General Ki-Moon and Mr Carter discussed the upcoming Rugby World Cup, and Mr Carter presented the Secretary-General with a New Zealand Rugby World Cup badge.

While delivering New Zealand's national statement to the conference, Mr Carter expressed his sorrow at the lives lost from around the world in the 22 February earthquake in Christchurch. He also thanked the many countries and people who generously gave aid and assistance at the time.

Mr Carter also hosted a lunch for representatives of the countries who sent official assistance, such as Urban Search and Rescue and Disaster Victim Identification, and met with Margareta Wahlstrom, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction before returning home.
