Transport Minister Steven Joyce has today released an action plan outlining the government’s next steps on road safety.

The *Safer Journeys Action Plan 2011-12* builds on legislation that received its final reading in Parliament last week, which focuses on improving the safety of young and high-risk drivers. 

The plan was released at the global launch of the United Nations’ Decade of Action for Road Safety. New Zealand was the first country today to launch the Decade as part of a series of events in cities across the world. 

Mr Joyce says the action plan continues the ‘safe system’ approach set out in the *Safer Journeys* strategy. 

“This is an across the board approach to road safety which means we’re looking at all aspects of the roading system – road users, roads, vehicles and speed.”

Actions in the plan include:

- Implement the young drivers package as passed by Parliament, including a tougher restricted license test (February 2012), increased minimum driving age (August 2011) and a zero blood alcohol limit (August 2011).
- Investigate maximum time limits for learner and restricted licences.
- Implementing the high risk drivers package as passed by Parliament, including alcohol interlocks (mid 2012), a zero blood alcohol limit for repeat drink drivers (mid 2012) and a doubling of penalties for dangerous driving causing death.
- Strengthen motorcycle license testing.
- Research on the impact of drivers under the influence of drugs and ways to combat drug-impaired drivers.
- Further safety improvements on high risk roads in both urban and rural areas.
- Rebalance speeding penalties in favour of demerit points, rather than fines.
- Encouraging the use of child restraints.

Mr Joyce says while a lot of progress has been made on road safety in recent years, there’s still a long way to go.

“Research and experience tells us that progressing these actions and implementing the legislation passed last week over the next two years can add to the improvements we’ve already made and help reduce New Zealand’s road toll.

“While there is a lot of work for the government to do, we need everybody to play a part to truly achieve a Safe System. This means road users as well as road builders, local government as well as central government. Everyone has a responsibility for road safety.”
