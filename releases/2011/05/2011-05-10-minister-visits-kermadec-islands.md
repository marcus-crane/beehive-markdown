Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson will join volunteers and artists from the Pew Charitable Trust aboard the HMNZS Otago today on a resupply mission to the Kermadec Islands.

“The Kermadec Islands are an amazing conservation haven and DOC works hard to preserve them,” Ms Wilkinson says.

“Raoul Island, where DOC staff are based, was struck by Cyclone Bune on March 28 and this resupply mission will enable repair work to be carried out on damaged buildings.

“Electrical work is also going to be undertaken in preparation for the installation of a solar power system at the base.

“I’m looking forward to seeing for myself the work DOC has been undertaking and the impact it is having on native flora and fauna.”

DOC and volunteers have been working hard to eradicate Mysore thorn, which can smother the native forest. There are 113 plants that are native to the islands and 35 bird species that inhabit them.

Rats, mice, feral cats and dogs that were threatening the Kermadec’s unique birdlife have also been eradicated. As a result Kermadec petrels and Kermadec parakeets, that were breeding only on outer islands, are now breeding on Raoul Island again.
