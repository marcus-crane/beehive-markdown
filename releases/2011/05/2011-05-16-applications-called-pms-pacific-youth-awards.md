Pacific Island Affairs Minister Georgina te Heuheu is calling on young Pacific people to apply for the Prime Minister's Pacific Youth Awards, which recognise creativity, leadership, innovation and inspiration.

"I'm asking them to put aside any shyness and put themselves forward for these important awards.

“And I am also encouraging Pacific people to nominate worthy peers who deserve to be recognised for their skills and talents, and contribution to their community.”

The Prime Minister's Pacific Youth Awards were first offered last year with the three winners qualifying for prizes including $6000-worth of tuition at the University of Auckland, a Cogita Business Systems-sponsored inspiring and educational trip overseas to work on community-based projects, and a paid internship at WETA workshop. This year there is a fourth award on offer - aeronautical engineering training provided by the Air New Zealand Aviation Institute.

Mrs te Heuheu says today's young Pacific people were a fast-growing segment of the population, who would increasingly make their presence felt.

"I'm delighted we are able to nurture the potential of young Pacific people through these Awards. Every society needs to nurture the next generation. This is one way for us to recognise and reward some of our future leaders," says Mrs te Heuheu.

Entries open today and close on 4 July 2011. The winners of the awards will be announced 10 August 2011.
