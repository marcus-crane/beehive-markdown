Helen Cull QC has been appointed as Deputy Chief Commissioner of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC), says Transport Minister Steven Joyce.

The appointment is for a 5 year term starting on 16 May.

“I am pleased to appoint someone of Helen Cull’s calibre to the Deputy Chief Commissioner role,” says Mr Joyce.

“Helen has considerable expertise in leading government inquiries across a range of sectors, has held a number of governance roles, and has in-depth knowledge of administrative law principles as they apply to TAIC. She will bring a very strong set of skills and experience to the Commission.

“I also want to acknowledge outgoing Deputy Chief Commissioner Pauline Winter, whose 9 year term on the Commission concluded in April.

“Pauline Winter’s knowledge and experience of good corporate governance has been much valued, and she has been a strong ambassador for the Commission both within New Zealand and overseas. I thank her for her 9 years of dedication and service to the TAIC.”
