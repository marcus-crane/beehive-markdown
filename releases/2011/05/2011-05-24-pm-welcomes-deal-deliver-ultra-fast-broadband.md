Prime Minister John Key today welcomed the announcement of a deal with two further providers to deliver ultra fast broadband to New Zealanders.

“The announcement today marks a major step in meeting one of our main 2008 election promises,” says Mr Key.

“The ultra fast broadband initiative is a key part of the Government’s economic growth plan. Ultra fast broadband is the way of the future.”

“The Government has reached agreement with Enable Networks to roll out fibre across Christchurch and Rangiora, and with Telecom across Auckland, the eastern and lower North Island and most of the South Island.

“This follows up the previous agreements with WEL Networks and Northpower, and completes the agreements we need to meet our promise to roll out fibre to 75 per cent of urban areas in New Zealand.

“Ultra fast broadband speeds delivered via these public private partnerships will revolutionise the way many businesses, schools, healthcare providers and communities operate. It will help overcome the tyranny of distance with the rest of the world, and new applications and ways of doing things will be developed.

“The rollout will start immediately with schools and healthcare facilities.

“Rural areas are also covered, with the Rural Broadband Initiative complementing the UFB plan by rolling out much faster broadband to rural communities.”
