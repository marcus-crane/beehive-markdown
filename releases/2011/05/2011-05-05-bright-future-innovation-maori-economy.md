Minister of Science and Innovation Wayne Mapp has welcomed the Maori Economy, Science and Innovation report released today by Maori Affairs Minister Pita Sharples.

“It highlights how an improved Maori science and innovation system could bring significant economic and social benefits,” Dr Mapp said.

“This report is a timely economic forecast of New Zealand’s future over the next 50 years if investment in science and innovation is better aligned to the needs of the Maori economy.

“One of its key findings is that, with better alignment, New Zealand could benefit from an additional $12 billion per annum in GDP from the Maori economy by 2060. This would also create 150,000 additional jobs, many in professional and skilled occupations.”

The BERL report was commissioned by Dr Sharples’ Maori Economic Taskforce and released at the Maori Economic Summit 2011.

The Minister said that work under way across the Ministry of Science and Innovation (MSI) and the Ministry’s predecessor agencies over the past three years has started to unlock the innovation potential of Maori knowledge, resources and people.

“The reform of the science and innovation system has made CRIs more responsive to Maori needs. The Vision Matauranga policy has been woven across all science funding priorities and MSI has been working very closely with iwi to develop robust iwi-led R&D strategies,” the Minister said.

“I congratulate Dr Sharples’ taskforce in highlighting the importance for all to work together to better align science and innovation investment with the needs of the Maori economy.

“I look forward to MSI and Te Puni Kokiri working across government and with iwi and Maori to deliver greater value to the Maori asset base and Maori economy, for the benefit of all New Zealanders."
