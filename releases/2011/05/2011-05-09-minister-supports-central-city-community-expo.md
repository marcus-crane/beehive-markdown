Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has commended Christchurch City Council on organising this weekend’s community expo ‘Share an Idea’ for people to give their views on the re-development of Christchurch’s central city. 

Mr Brownlee will be speaking at the expo at the CBS Arena at 10.30am on Saturday 14 May. 

The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) is working closely alongside the council in the development of a central city recovery plan.

“This expo is a great initiative to ensure that the people of Canterbury have a strong voice when it comes to the creation of their re-developed central city.

“The ideas that are shared this weekend will also be taken into account by CERA when planning the broader future of Christchurch,” Mr Brownlee said.

“This weekend will be one of a number of opportunities for Canterbury people to have their say on how the region should be rebuilt and revitalised. 

“CERA is absolutely committed to listening to the people that live here in restoring the social, economic, cultural and environmental well-being of the region.”

Later this year, the council will present CERA with their plan for redevelopment of the central city.  This will be integrated with the overall recovery strategy for Canterbury.

CERA, which was established by the Government to co-ordinate and lead the recovery work after the September 2010 and February 2011 earthquakes, is supporting a range of organisations in making well co-ordinated and timely decisions.  For more information visit [www.cera.govt.nz](http://www.cera.govt.nz)
