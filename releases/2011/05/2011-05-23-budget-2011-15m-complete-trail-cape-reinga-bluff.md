The Department of Conservation will receive $1.5 million in Budget 2011 to help the Te Araroa Trust substantially complete the Te Araroa Trail Long Pathway from Cape Reinga to Bluff, Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson says.

The funding has been reprioritised from Vote Tourism and will enable the Trust to substantially complete a number of  sections of the trail totaling 244km.

“The trail will be refined and improved over time, but the progress that the grant makes possible will be sufficient for the Te Araroa Trust to consider opening the trail towards the end of this year,” Ms Wilkinson says.

“New Zealanders and visitors from all around the world will be able to stretch their legs and put this public trail through the nation to the test in the coming 2011/12 summer season.

“The new funding and the opening of the trail will provide a boost to many of our small towns and regional economies, providing another attraction for tourists that will encourage them to spend more time in our stunning country.

“The Te Araroa Trail complements the New Zealand Cycle Trail, cementing us as an outdoors tourism destination while also providing greater opportunities for New Zealanders to get out and enjoy our conservation estate."
