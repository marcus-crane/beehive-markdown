Customs Minister Maurice Williamson has congratulated the New Zealand Customs Service for five major drug seizures so far this month.

“Great work by Customs officers has resulted in numerous arrests, these drugs are now off our streets and away from our families,” Mr Williamson said.

Customs officers seized 18 kgs of dimethylltryphamine (DMT), the largest seizure on record of the rarely seen class A drug after it was detected in a package at the Auckland mail centre.

Wellington Customs officers found 1.2 litres of the class B controlled drug gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) – also known as a ‘date rape’ drug because it can render a victim unconscious and produce memory loss – smuggled in nail polish bottles in two packages sent from the United States.

A package from Thailand containing 3 kgs of ephedrine was also intercepted.

In Christchurch, Customs caught a man returning from Thailand with pseudoephedrine in his shoes and bag. His companion was carrying more in her luggage. The total weight of pseudoephedrine was 217 grams.

In the ongoing fight against P, at the end of the first quarter of this calendar year, Customs has made 220 interceptions of pseudoephedrine or ephedrine with a potential yield of between 48 and 67 kgs of methamphetamine (‘P’) removing around $27 million dollars of potential harm from New Zealand.

“Customs is helping secure our borders to the benefit of all New Zealanders.”

“It sends a clear message to people that if you attempt to bring illegal drugs into our country – you will get caught.”
