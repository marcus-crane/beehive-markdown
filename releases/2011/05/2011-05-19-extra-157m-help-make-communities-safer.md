The justice sector is to receive $157 million in new funding over the next two years in Budget 2011 to ensure access to justice and increase public safety, Justice Minister Simon Power says.

“Making our communities safer and improving the justice system for those who are in it through no fault of their own have been key priorities for this Government, and the new money demonstrates that commitment.

“The fact that Justice is the only sector besides health and education to receive new money in Budget 2011 demonstrates how important the Government views the sector,” Mr Power says.

“However, the administration of justice is not immune from cost pressures, which is part of the reason Justice sector ministers are overseeing big changes to improve performance and reduce volumes and costs.

“Reforms in train include ensuring legal aid quality and sustainability, criminal procedure modernisation, and changes to improve Police, Courts, and Corrections services.”

In Budget 2011, the Justice sector receives $150.1 million operating funding and $6.9 million capital funding over two years for policy priorities and essential services.

The major areas of new spending include:

- &gt;$34.1 million in 2010/11 and $69.4 million in 2011/12 to address funding shortfalls in legal aid while the Government progresses proposals to address sustainability of the legal aid system.
- $4 million in 2011/12 to address a funding shortfall for Community Law Centres.
- $22.5 million over two years and a capital injection of $3.2 million to meet the increased demand and associated costs for the supervision and conduct of Crown prosecutions.
- $8.3 million over two years for increased capacity and capability for investigating and prosecuting complex or serious crime.
- $1 million in 2011/12 for the constitutional review, which is part of the confidence and supply agreement with the Māori Party.

“Justice sector ministers will continue to implement a programme of reforms to deliver a world class, affordable justice system,” Mr Power says.
