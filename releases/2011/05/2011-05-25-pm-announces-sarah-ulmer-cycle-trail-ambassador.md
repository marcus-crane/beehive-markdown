Prime Minister John Key today announced that Olympic Gold medallist Sarah Ulmer has signed up as an ambassador for Nga Haerenga, the New Zealand Cycle Trail project (NZCT).

Mr Key told delegates and media at tourism conference TRENZ in Queenstown that he was delighted Ms Ulmer would front the promotion of the NZCT project.

“Sarah Ulmer’s sporting achievements and her passion for cycling, fitness and health make her an inspiring ambassador for the Cycle Trail.

“We already have one Great Ride open - the St James Cycle Trail - and 17 others are due to be opened in the near future. It is important to build the Cycle Trail brand to a point where both domestic and international visitors feel inspired to experience these Great Rides,” says Mr Key.

Sarah Ulmer is one of New Zealand’s most recognised sports personalities. She became the first New Zealander to win an Olympic cycling gold when she won the women’s individual pursuit in Athens in 2004. She also won the pursuit gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in 1998 and 2002.

Ms Ulmer says the NZCT will offer a wonderful range of cycling experiences for visitors to enjoy.

“Supporting this project brings together my own passion for cycling with my strong desire to encourage people from all walks of like to get out, get active and explore the outstanding range of cycling experiences New Zealand has to offer.

“There is something pretty special and unique about exploring a country on two wheels and having access to some of New Zealand’s most spectacular scenery,” says Ms Ulmer.
