Social Development Minister Paula Bennett is delighted to announce the appointment of Dr Russell Wills as Children’s Commissioner.

Dr Wills is the Head of Paediatrics at Hawke’s Bay DHB and has a strong clinical background as well as a history of advocating for children.

He will take up the role of part time Children’s Commissioner and continue part time as a paediatrician, remaining strongly connected to the community.

“As a practising community paediatrician Dr Wills brings his expertise and ongoing connection with real families on the front line,” says Ms Bennett.

A Deputy Commissioner will expand the reach of the office of the Children’s Commissioner and provide extra support to Dr Wills.

Dr Wills is experienced in dealing with child poverty, child abuse and severe behaviour disturbance and works with struggling families daily.

“He understands the issue New Zealand families are facing because he sees it every day, it’s that real-world connection that makes a dual role the right option,” says Ms Bennett.

“The role of Children’s Commissioner is hugely important, particularly given this Government’s focus on protecting vulnerable children and Dr Wills’ leadership and clinical strength will enhance that role,” says Ms Bennett.

Ms Bennett thanked outgoing commissioner John Angus for his unfailing commitment to children and young people.

"Dr Angus has been a passionate advocate for the rights of children, and has given 100 percent to the role,” she said.

Dr Wills takes up the position from July this year.

The new Children’s Commissioner will be paid a reduced salary, offsetting travel costs from his home in Hastings which will be included in the terms and conditions of appointment.
