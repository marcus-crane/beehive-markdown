New Zealand’s best young scientists and engineers now have the chance to kick-start their careers in some of New Zealand’s most innovative businesses.

The Government will fund up to 50 internships worth $1.7 million for post-graduate students to undertake research and development (R&D) in businesses, Minister of Science and Innovation Wayne Mapp announced today.

“New Zealand’s future innovators will get a head start in their careers as we enable them to acquire and refine their technical skills in a commercial research environment.

“In return, businesses will get access to smart, fresh minds to contribute to new products, processes and services,” Dr Mapp said.

“The Government is building better connections and increased collaboration between the science and business communities. These internships contribute to this goal.”

The programme is administered by the Ministry of Science and Innovation. It supports businesses to employ post-graduate science, technology and engineering students by providing up to $30,000 plus GST per person towards a post-graduate salary for up to six months.

The programme is open to all businesses, both large and small, as long as R&D is at the centre of their growth strategies.

Eligible students are those in the top 20 per cent of their class in university engineering and science faculties. They must be in post-graduate programmes (master’s and doctoral students) and will have either completed a degree before 1 January 2012 or have graduated within the last six months and not be employed.
