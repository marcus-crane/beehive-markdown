Prime Minister John Key has announced that the date for a by-election in Te Tai Tokerau will be Saturday 25 June, 2011.

The by-election follows the impending resignation of Independent MP Hone Harawira.

“I have been advised that, since Mr Harawira’s resignation takes effect from the close of 20 May, it is appropriate to now set a date for the by-election,” says Mr Key.

“The by-election Writ day will be Wednesday 25 May. The last day for candidate nominations to be received will be Tuesday 31 May and the last day for the return of the Writ will be Thursday 14 July.”
