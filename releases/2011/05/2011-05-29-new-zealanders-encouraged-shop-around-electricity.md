A new campaign, beginning today, encourages New Zealanders to shop around for electricity, says Acting Minister of Energy and Resources Hekia Parata.

The Electricity Authority’s campaign provides consumers with information about switching electricity suppliers, the ease of switching and the potential savings that can be made from switching.

“The campaign is about consumers taking control of their electricity bill by encouraging them to shop around for the best prices,” says Ms Parata.

“It is the result of a major review of the electricity market in 2009 which found that residential consumers could make significant savings by switching to the cheapest available retailer.

“There are some sizeable ‘quick wins’ available to consumers, which they can find out about from www.whatsmynumber.org.nz. It only takes a few minutes to get an estimate of your potential savings,” says Ms Parata.

“The average annual saving for households switching to the cheapest retail option in their area was estimated to be $150 last year – nationally that would equate to savings of $240 million.''

Ms Parata says the Government is committed to improving choice for electricity consumers, and helping them put competitive pressure on electricity retailers to provide better value for money.

The Government has budgeted up to $15 million over three years to achieve this.

Up to $4.5 million will be spent by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs to upgrade and promote the Consumer Powerswitch website and up to $10.5 million will be used by the Electricity Authority to develop and administer programmes to facilitate switching.

“Many Kiwi families are concerned about managing their cost of living - power switching to get the best deal for their electricity will help them manage a core component of their everyday costs,'' Ms Parata says.
