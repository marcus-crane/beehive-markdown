Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples and Minister for Communications and Information Technology Steven Joyce today announced the establishment of a Maori Working Group to help steer the rollout of the government's Rural Broadband Initiative (RBI).

“The National Maori RBI Working Group, called Nga Pu Waea, will advise on Maori interests and development opportunities in broadband, and work to ensure that marae, kohanga, kura, wananga, iwi runanga and Maori health and social service providers benefit from the roll-out of broadband into rural areas,” says Dr Sharples.

“As well as connections to the broadband networks that will be made available through the RBI, benefits could include training and employment for Maori as the network is built, business opportunities to leverage the RBI infrastructure and extend faster broadband services to other uses and communities.

“Nga Pu Waea grew out of a submission by the Maori Economic Taskforce on the Government’s Rural Broadband Initiative. It’s about taking every opportunity to strengthen Maori participation in developing this nation.”

Mr Joyce says the Rural Broadband Initiative is about ensuring rural communities, including Maori communities, do not miss out on the promise of the digital age.

"The economic development potential for Maori communities under the RBI is significant.  The working group is designed to ensure Maori can maximize those opportunities and that Maori views are represented as the initiative progresses.

"The Working Group, representing a range of Maori working in the ICT sector, and iwi and economic leaders, will work with Vodafone, Telecom and the Government.

“Telecom and Vodafone representatives will be required to meet every two months with the Working Group, and together they will report every six months to me and Dr Sharples.

“The Working Group will also be represented on the National Advisory Committee overseeing the RBI, and if it proves successful, we could consider extending its mandate to other ICT projects.”

**Questions and Answers**

**1. Why was Ngā Pū Waea, the National Māori RBI Working Group established?**

The joint venture provider contract for the delivery of the Rural Broadband Initiative (RBI) included some specific requirements for Telecom and Vodafone to undertake ongoing stakeholder engagement, including engagement with Māori stakeholders at regional and national levels.

As part of these requirements this group will engage with the RBI partners Telecom and Vodafone. The establishment of this working group will enhance meaningful and appropriate Māori participation in the RBI.

**2. What is the role of Ngā Pū Waea?**

The role of Ngā Pū Waea is to provide advice to the joint venture provider about:

• options for maximising coverage and connectivity to marae, wānanga, kura, kōhanga, rūnanga, and other Māori organisations through RBI

• trade training programmes and employment opportunities for Māori through the RBI

• relationship brokerage with Māori at community, regional and national levels to support, among other things, economic development opportunities (including investment opportunities), land access and the use of existing infrastructure for the RBI

• emerging issues identified during engagement with Māori

**3. Who are the members of Ngā Pū Waea?**

The membership comprises representatives from Māori ICT interests, including te Huarahi Tika Trust, Te Pūtahi Paoho, and the Māori Economic Taskforce. The seven members are:

1\. Jeremy Gardiner

2\. Daphne Luke

3\. Mavis Mullins

4\. Haami Piripi

5\. Antony Royal

6\. Tūwhakairiora Williams

7\. Richard Orzecki

**4. How were the members of Ngā Pū Waea appointed?**

The members were appointed by the Minister of Māori Affairs, in consultation with Minister of Communications and Information Technology. The seven members were appointed as they collectively have the following skills: experience in Māori economic development through information and communication technology; understanding the dynamics of Māori society; understanding of information and communication technology industry dynamics; experience in commercial governance; and relationship management.

**5. How long will the Working Group operate?**

Ngā Pū Waea will undertake the above functions for the duration of the RBI contract. This is anticipated to be six years. The members of the Working Group have been appointed for a three year term. Members will be eligible for reappointment for one further term.

**6. What is the Rural Broadband Initiative?**

On 20 April, the Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Hon Steven Joyce, announced that contract negotiations have been completed with Telecom and Vodafone for the Rural Broadband Initiative (RBI). The RBI will deliver on the Government’s commitment to provide faster, better and more affordable broadband services for rural New Zealanders.

Telecom and Vodafone has been contracted to provide broadband access with peak speeds of at least 5 Mbps to 86% of rural houses and businesses. The implementation of the RBI contract will be undertaken over a six year period, and will require major infrastructure development, including the construction of 154 new cell phone towers and the upgrading of 380 existing towers.

**7. How will the RBI benefit Māori?**

The RBI provides improved broadband services to rural Maori households, marae, wānanga, kura, kōhanga, rūnanga and other Māori organisations in rural communities:

• Approximately 480 marae will be covered by Telecom’s DSL service at more than 5Mbps, 44 of which will have access to DSL services for the first time;

• Approximately 100 marae will be able to choose to connect existing Telecom fibre or new RBI funded fibre to the premise;

• Approximately 65% of marae will be covered by Vodafone’s minimum 5Mbps broadband service;

• Approximately 88% of marae will have mobile coverage.

RBI may also provide other opportunities for Māori through training programmes and employment and investment opportunities.

**8. How is the Working Group funded?**

The Working Group will be funded by the Māori Economic Taskforce.
