The Government will invest $4 million over the next four years in Be. Accessible, Disability Issues Minister Tariana Turia says.

“Be. Accessible is an exciting and innovative social change campaign that aims to influence the attitudes and behaviours of New Zealanders so we can each play our part in creating a truly accessible nation.

“It will inspire and enable businesses, individuals and organisations to step up to the economic and social opportunity to improve accessibility for people with disabilities,” Mrs Turia says.

It also delivers on a key initiative of the Ministerial Committee on Disability Issues, chaired by Mrs Turia, to promote mobility and access for disabled people.

Be. Accessible has been developed in partnership with Auckland District Health Board, Auckland Council and AUT University, as well as many others in the public, private and disability sectors.

“This Government’s investment in Be. Accessible builds on the work already done in preparation for the Rugby World Cup 2011.”

Be. Accessible will assess key locations in the 12 host cities in the lead up to the event.

A critical success factor in accessible tourism is having consistent, reliable and high quality information on the accessibility of services and buildings.

“Rugby could prove to be an important catalyst for one of the most ambitious and important social campaigns in New Zealand,” Mrs Turia says.

“Our vision is that in not too many years the world will look to New Zealand as the model nation for accessibility and as the country that values the diversity and inclusion of all people.”
