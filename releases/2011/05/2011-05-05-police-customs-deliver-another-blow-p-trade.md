The seizure of 67.6kg of precursor drugs in Auckland this week was the result of great investigative work by Police and Customs, Minister of Police Judith Collins and Minister of Customs Maurice Williamson said today.

Three people have been arrested following the seizure in a combined Auckland Police metro drug squad and New Zealand Customs operation this week.

The haul of ContacNT capsules – one of the precursor drugs for the manufacture of methamphetamine – is the largest so far this year. Police estimate that these precursor drugs could have been used to make up to 20kg of methamphetamine.

“Criminals who rely on illegal imports of precursor drugs to manufacture methamphetamine have been dealt a serious blow,” Ms Collins said.

“This seizure demonstrates that the great investigative work by Police and Customs is effective at intercepting these drugs before they can reach the streets and cause so much harm.

“Police and Customs are serious about cutting the supply of methamphetamine and bringing those responsible for this vile business to account. I would like to congratulate all staff involved in this highly successful operation.”

Customs Minister Maurice Williamson praised the work of New Zealand Customs in the operation.

"The great work and co-operation between our Police and Customs has given us another success story in the fight against crime," Mr Williamson said.

"Getting nearly 70kg of ContacNT off our streets makes our communities safer and sends a clear message to people that if you embark in such lawlessness, you will get caught."

Police estimate that had the precursor drugs been converted into methamphetamine and distributed in the community, it would have caused between $5.2 and $8 million in social harm.

Prime Minister John Key said this week action by the Government was making “great progress” in disrupting methamphetamine supply chains.
