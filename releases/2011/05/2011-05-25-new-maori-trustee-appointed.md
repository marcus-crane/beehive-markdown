Jamie Tuuta will be appointed as the new Māori Trustee, the Minister of Māori Affairs, Hon Dr Pita Sharples announced today.

The appointment will be for a five year term starting on 19 August 2011.

“Jamie Tuuta is an outstanding example of a new generation of Māori leaders.  I am delighted to be able to appoint him as Māori Trustee”, says Dr Sharples.

“I am confident that Jamie Tuuta will ensure that the Māori Trustee plays a key role in the growing Māori economy.”

Jamie Tuuta has had significant governance roles in Māori organisations, including being Chair of Parininihi ki Waitotara since 2005.  He will be resigning from most of his current roles prior to taking up his appointment as Māori Trustee.

Dr Sharples thanked the current Māori Trustee, John Paki, for his contribution in the role over many years.  “John Paki has demonstrated a real commitment to advancing Māori interests during his years as Māori Trustee,” Dr Sharples says.  “I want to thank him for that service, and in particular for managing the transition of the Māori Trustee to become a stand alone organisation”.
