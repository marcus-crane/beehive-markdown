The Government has approved a $40 million-plus project at Waikato Hospital, that will create up to 100 construction jobs in Hamilton.

Health Minister Tony Ryall announced the approval during a visit to Waikato Hospital this afternoon.

Mr Ryall says, "The new building development will streamline and consolidate services for older people and those receiving rehabilitation support.

"This is about building for the future and providing much better service for older New Zealanders and their families.

"The DHB has budgeted just under $42 million for the design and build of what will be a centre of excellence for older persons' health care and rehabilitation services."

The number of over-65s in Waikato is expected to increase from just over 40,000 to just over 80,000 in the next 15 years.

Mr Ryall says, "Waikato's current Older Persons and Rehabilitation Service is spread over several locations, it is inefficient, and will not be able to cope with the increasing demand."

"The existing 40 dedicated treatment and rehabilitation beds is around half the number of beds as similar DHBs.

"The new building will have an extra 50 assessment treatment and rehab beds, as well as bringing the acute stroke beds, Under-65 rehab beds, psycho-geriatric beds, outpatients and support offices all into the one location."

The project is being funded from DHB resources.

"There is a lot happening around the country where services are being improved for older New Zealanders.

"And in the recent Budget, we announced $40 million over four years for residential dementia services, and another

$4 million for additional respite care for full-time carers of people with dementia.

"This Government is committed to improving health and care services for older people," Mr Ryall says.
