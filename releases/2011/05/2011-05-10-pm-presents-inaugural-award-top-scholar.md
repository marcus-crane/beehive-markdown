Christ’s College student David Bellamy is the inaugural winner of the Prime Minister’s Award for Academic Excellence.

Prime Minister John Key presented the award at the Top Scholar Award ceremony at Government House today. The Prime Minister’s Award recognises the highest-achieving student in the annual Scholarship exams.

“David’s achievement is absolutely outstanding. He was just 16 when he sat the Scholarship exams, and is a Premier Scholarship Award winner and the Top Scholar in Chemistry,” says Mr Key

In addition, David achieved six Outstanding Scholarships in English, Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics with Calculus, Statistics and Modelling, and Physics.

“Not only did David achieve superb results academically, he also contributed hugely to cultural life at Christ’s College, having lead roles in several productions and festivals and competing in theatre sports and debating,” says Mr Key.

“David’s achievements across a number of fields show how far ambition and a desire to succeed can enrich a student’s life and set them on a strong path to future success.”

David is currently studying Health Sciences at the University of Otago.
