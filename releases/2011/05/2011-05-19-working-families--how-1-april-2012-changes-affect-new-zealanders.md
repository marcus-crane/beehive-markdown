**1.  Low income one-child family**

Lisa is a sole parent. She earns $30,000 a year and has a 10-year-old child. She currently receives $148.04 a week in Working for Families tax credits. From 1 April 2012, this will go up to $152.64 a week – an increase of $4.60. 

**2.  High income four-child family**

Matt and Sarah's family income is $125,000 per year – right near the top of the WFF scale for a four-child family. They have four children aged 11, 13, 14 and 16. Matt and Sarah currently receive $38.62 a week in WFF tax credits. From 1 July 2012, as a result of the slightly lower abatement threshold, a slightly faster abatement rate and the fact there is no inflation increase in the FTC rate for 16-18 year olds, they will receive $25.96 a week – a reduction of $12.66.

**3.  Low income three-child family**

Michael and Kiri's combined family income is $40,000 a year. They have three children aged 10, 13 and 16. They currently receive $280.76 a week in WFF tax credits. From 1 April 2012, this will go up to $284.88 a week – an increase of $4.12.

They currently receive $54.72 a week in WFF tax credits. From 1 April 2012, as a result of the slightly lower abatement threshold and a slightly faster abatement rate, they will receive $50.90 a week – a reduction of $3.82.

**7.  Higher income three-child family**

From 1 April 2012, as a result of the slightly lower abatement threshold and a slightly faster abatement rate, they will receive $21.30 a week – a reduction of $6.15.

**8.**  **Minimum wage four-child family**

Jenny and Peter have four children aged 7, 9, 11 and 14. Jenny is not working and Peter earns just over $27,000 a year, which is about the minimum wage. Jenny and Peter currently receive $346.61 a week in WFF tax credits. From 1 July 2012, this will go up to $360.79 a week – an increase of $14.18.

**9.  Higher income two-child family**

Chris is a sole parent. He earns $90,000 a year and has two children aged 11 and 16. His income is right near the top of the WFF scale for a two-child family. Chris currently receives $18.66 a week in WFF tax credits. From 1 April 2012, as a result of the slightly lower abatement threshold, a slightly faster abatement rate and the fact that there is no inflation increase in the Family Tax Credit (FTC) rate for 16-18 year olds, Chris will receive $7.12 a week – a reduction of $11.54. 

**NOTE:** All examples assume family income remains constant and that 16-18 year old children do not leave school or training to take up work, leave home or go on a benefit, all of which would end their eligibility for Working for Families.
