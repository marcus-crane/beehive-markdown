Civil Defence Minister John Carter today launched the new *Turtle Safe DVD*, an earthquake safety resource for preschool children that illustrates the right actions to take when an earthquake happens.

Messages are aimed at providing children with clear, easy to remember instructions on what they should do to keep safe when an earthquake happens to protect themselves - “*Just like a turtle tucked up in bed*”.

“It‘s really important that children know instinctively what to do” said Mr Carter.  “I encourage teachers and caregivers to watch the DVD and hold practice drills with the children in their care so they are familiar with what they should do when an earthquake occurs.

“I also encourage talking to children about earthquakes which helps reduce fear and anxiety, and provides opportunities for children to ask questions and express their feelings by talking or drawing”, Mr Carter said.

The new Turtle Safe DVD is a joint project from the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management and the Auckland Council.  From next week, it will be sent to over 6000 early childcare centres and playgroups throughout the country. It will also be available online at [www.getthru.govt.nz](http://www.getthru.govt.nz)

“Civil Defence is about educating people of all ages about what to do in an emergency, right down to pre-schoolers”, says Clive Manley, Manager, Civil Defence and Emergency Management for the Auckland Council.

“Kids are a great way to get the message to the parents and the DVD is in a format that the little ones will understand and hopefully remember.“

Children and staff from the Henderson Edukids early childcare centre who participated in the filming of the new DVD were among the guests at the launch.
