Prime Minister John Key will travel to Australia next month to take up an invitation from Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard to be the first New Zealand Prime Minister to address the Australian Parliament.

“The invitation to address the Australian Parliament in Canberra was made by Prime Minister Gillard when I met her during her visit in March to attend the Christchurch earthquake memorial service,” says Mr Key.

The visit will take place from 19 to 21 June. The programme is yet to be finalised but will also include a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Gillard and talks with the Cabinet.

“I am very much looking forward to reciprocating Prime Minister Gillard’s historic address to the New Zealand Parliament in February by addressing the Australian Parliament.

“I am grateful for this rare opportunity, which I will use to reinforce the strong trans-Tasman links that bind our two countries so closely together,” says Mr Key.

The address will take place on Monday, 20 June. That evening Mr Key will fly to Sydney to attend a private charity fundraising gala dinner organised by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

“The money raised from this charity event will go towards the Government’s Christchurch Earthquake Appeal,” says Mr Key. “I appreciate the efforts of the bank and Chief Executive Officer Ralph Norris in organising this event, and I am sure it will be very successful.”

More details of the visit will be released in due course.
