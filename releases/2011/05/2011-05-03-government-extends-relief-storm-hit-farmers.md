Agriculture Minister David Carter has announced that farmers hit by the severe storm in Hawke’s Bay are to get assistance from the Government.

Pasture loss and damage to farm infrastructure is serious enough to declare a medium-level adverse event in the area, triggering government relief measures.

"Having seen the slips and flooding damage first-hand at the weekend, I discussed with MAF the level of assistance available and it was agreed a medium-level response was necessary," says Mr Carter.

"Whole hillsides have collapsed in places, with some of the hardest hit coastal farms having lost up to 60 percent of soil on paddocks. It is likely to be spring/summer before permanent fences can be erected.

"Assistance will come through Enhanced Taskforce Green for the initial clean up, along with funding for the East Coast Rural Support Trust to assist farmers under stress, and with practical help such as feeding and moving stock. Welfare support and farm management advice is also available.

"Many of these farms have had a hard time through successive droughts and will now have significant costs to restore farm infrastructure. They will also have issues with feeding stock in the medium term until pasture covers returns."

Mr Carter is urging farmers who need assistance or advice to talk to the East Coast Rural Support Trust.
