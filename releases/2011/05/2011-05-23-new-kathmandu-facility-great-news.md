Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says he’s encouraged and delighted with today’s news that listed Australasian outdoor clothing and equipment company Kathmandu Holdings will build a new national distribution centre in Christchurch.

“I note the board of Kathmandu looked at other options, including Auckland, and chose Christchurch,” Mr Brownlee said.

“This is a major vote of confidence in the region as a business hub, and will I’m sure be a signal to other businesses that Christchurch’s longevity is secure and the future is positive.

“Christchurch is my home town and I sense a real air of optimism in the region at the moment.

“My team at the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) are working closely with business groups and they too are reporting strong signals of future growth.”

CERA is responsible for rebuilding greater Christchurch and its surrounds, and supporting the welfare of its residents. For more information visit www.cera.govt.nz
