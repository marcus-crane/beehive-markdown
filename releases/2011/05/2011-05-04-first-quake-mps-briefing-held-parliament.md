Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has held the first of regular meetings of the cross-party MPs’ forum established under the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act.

“I’d like to thank all those who attended last night’s meeting at the Beehive, it was a genial and constructive session,” Mr Brownlee said.

Among topics discussed were nominations for the community forum.

“I’m confident the cross party forum will be a useful sounding board for major issues which affect all those with an interest in seeing Christchurch and its surrounding towns rebuilt swiftly and to the highest possible standard,” Mr Brownlee said.

The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) is responsible for rebuilding greater Christchurch and its surrounds and supporting the welfare of its residents.  For more information visit [www.cera.govt.nz](http://www.cera.govt.nz)
