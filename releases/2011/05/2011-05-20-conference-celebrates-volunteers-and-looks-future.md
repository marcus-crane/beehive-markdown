Associate Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector Hekia Parata says next week’s Volunteering New Zealand Conference will recognise the efforts of ordinary Kiwis who have gone out of their way to help others, and look at ways the sector can be better utilised in the future.

This year marks the 10th anniversary of International Year of the Volunteer – established by the United Nations in 2001 and supported by New Zealand. 

The International Year of the Volunteer recognises the enduring contributions of ordinary citizens who rise to action in times of natural disaster, community need, and national unity.

This year is one of the most significant in New Zealand’s volunteering history.

Volunteers played a crucial role during the Christchurch earthquake and will play an important role when New Zealand hosts the Rugby World Cup here later this year.

“Volunteers are a nation’s lifeblood. Many hands and hearts helped Christchurch in the hours, days, and months after the February quake,” Ms Parata says.

“The conference will give us an opportunity to reflect back on the volunteering experience in Christchurch and look at a long term strategy for activating volunteers in times of need.’’

The conference will feature key speakers;

- Mark Solomon, the Chair of Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu, who provided leadership and coordination of the Maori response in the poorest areas of Christchurch.
- Susan Ellis, an international speaker from the Unites States who specialises in strengthening volunteer movements.
- Sam Johnson, who led the Volunteer Student Army in Christchurch.
- Brendon Ward, who will organise 5000 volunteers for the Rugby World Cup.

“Today’s volunteers are many and varied – with new and innovative approaches using social media networks and technology to be effective in the service of communities. The future of volunteering has never looked so exciting,’’ Ms Parata says.

The Volunteering New Zealand Conference will be held in Wellington’s Town Hall on May 23/24.
