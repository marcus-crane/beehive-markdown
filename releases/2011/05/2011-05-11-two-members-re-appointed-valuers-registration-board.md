Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson today announced the reappointment of Ken Taylor and Phillip Curnow to the Valuers Registration Board (VRB).

The Valuers Registration Board (VRB) is an independent statutory body administered by Land Information New Zealand (LINZ). The VRB oversees the registration of valuers and investigates complaints.

Mr Curnow is a highly experienced valuer who provides considerable urban commercial and industrial property expertise to the VRB, and was nominated by the New Zealand Institute of Valuers.

Mr Taylor is a very experienced valuer based in Alexandra who has expertise in, and knowledge of, South Island rural valuation practices.

"I am pleased that Mr Curnow and Mr Taylor will continue to serve on the VRB. Both are highly experienced valuers who bring a wealth of expertise to the board, which will help maintain New Zealanders’ confidence in registered valuers,” says Mr Williamson.
