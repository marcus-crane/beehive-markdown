Health Minister Tony Ryall will represent New Zealand at two key international health forums during May.

Mr Ryall will attend the annual Commonwealth Health Ministers' Meeting in Geneva on May 15 - which this year focuses on non-communicable diseases.

That category of disease – which includes cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes - cause an estimated 35 million deaths worldwide each year.

"In New Zealand an increasing amount of expertise and resource is being channelled to the prevention and management of these diseases. This enables people to preserve their health and independence for longer.

Tony Ryall will also lead New Zealand's delegation on the opening days of the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the World Health Organisation, which starts in Geneva on May 16.

En route to Switzerland, Mr Ryall will meet with leading health and state sector experts in the UK and in France, including senior OECD officials.
