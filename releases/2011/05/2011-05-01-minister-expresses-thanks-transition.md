Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has today offered his thanks to those who’ve led the response to the February 22 earthquake, following the lifting of the National State of Emergency at midnight.

“I wish to express my gratitude to Civil Defence National Controller John Hamilton. Mr Hamilton has brought a level of professionalism to the response that has stood us in good stead for a transition out of the state of emergency.

“I also wish to acknowledge assistant National Controller Steve Brazier and the group of very dedicated people who’ve given their all for the citizens of Christchurch and its surrounding towns.

“I’m especially pleased that critical members of the Civil Defence team have been providing guidance on transitioning to the recovery phase under the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA), and that some of that team will remain with CERA in the weeks and months ahead to ensure a smooth transition.

“Finally I’d like to acknowledge the work of CERA’s interim chief executive John Ombler. Mr Ombler has made great progress over a brief period in establishing CERA and I’m confident he and his team are ready to pick up the reigns from the Civil Defence Emergency Management team and continue rebuilding Christchurch,� Mr Brownlee said.
