Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman today welcomed the launch of NZ On Air’s new funding programme which will support a greater range of New Zealand music.

The Making Tracks scheme will contribute $2 million a year towards funding 200 single track recordings and 200 music videos a year. It replaces three previous funding schemes that were album based and funded 50 recording projects and 170 music videos a year. Making Tracks opens for applications in June.

‘’This sea-change in music funding will see more Kiwi artists sharing the funding pool which will lead to greater diversity in funded music,’’ Dr Coleman says.

‘’The new scheme is also contemporary and adapts to the changing music environment. The impact of digital media is changing listening habits with more people listening to singles. Making Tracks acknowledges there are more media platforms for music and it creates more opportunities for aspiring artists.’’

Artists can receive up to three grants a year with up to $10,000 per song: up to $4,000 to record the work and $6,000 to make a music video to back up the release of that song.

The new scheme follows a review commissioned by NZ On Air to assess the state of the domestic music industry, its funding support and audience demand. More details on Making Tracks are available from: www.nzonair.govt.nz
