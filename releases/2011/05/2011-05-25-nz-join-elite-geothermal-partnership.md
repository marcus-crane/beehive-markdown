New Zealand is to seek membership of the International Partnership for Geothermal Technology (IPGT), Science and Innovation Minister Wayne Mapp announced today.

“This is an exciting opportunity. Geothermal energy is one of New Zealand’s most important renewable energy resources. Geothermal electricity generation has grown to 13 percent of total generation in 2010,” Dr Mapp said.

“There are many benefits to membership of this elite grouping. New Zealand has much to gain from the extra opportunities for geothermal research collaboration and involvement in major international research programmes.

"The IPGT in turn has much to gain from the expertise and capability of New Zealand scientists and industry," he said.

Established in August 2008, the IPGT seeks to develop advanced, cost-effective geothermal energy technologies through international research co-operation.

New Zealand scientists and geothermal industry members will join their colleagues from the United States, Australia, Switzerland and Iceland to progress advanced geothermal technologies.

The Ministry of Science and Innovation will lead New Zealand’s involvement in the initiative, the Minister said
