Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce has this afternoon expressed grave concern for the staff and students of Kings Education, a private training establishment located on the third floor of the collapsed CTV Building.

Kings Education is an international education private training establishment with students from a number of countries around the world.

Mr Joyce has spoken with Kings Education Director John Ryder to offer any additional support the government can give.

“I've also spoken with the Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully who assures me that foreign affairs staff in Christchurch are in close contact with embassies and consulates.”

Mr Joyce says Kings Education is working with Police and other authorities on the ground to try and ascertain the whereabouts of those who are unaccounted for. 

“While there are a number of missing students thought to be in the CTV Building we cannot discount the chance that some students will be safe elsewhere. 

“If anyone has any information about students from the college, please contact the Police urgently.

“This is a very sad day for the families concerned, the countries who have students at Kings Education involved, the New Zealand international education community and the country as a whole.

“Our thoughts are with all of those who been affected by this tragedy,” says Mr Joyce.
