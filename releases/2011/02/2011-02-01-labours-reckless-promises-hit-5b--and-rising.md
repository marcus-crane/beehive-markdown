The annual cost of Labour’s spending promises is $5 billion and climbing – and Phil Goff still can’t explain how he will pay for them, Finance Minister Bill English says.

“Every time he opens his mouth, Goff confirms that Labour’s borrow and hope recipe would add hundreds of millions of dollars more to Government borrowing. That would saddle New Zealand with more debt to foreigners, which would have to be paid back with interest.

“It would almost certainly lead to a credit ratings downgrade for New Zealand, pushing up interest rates for Kiwi families and businesses, and costing jobs.”

Following his $1.3 billion promise last week to make the first $5000 of annual income tax free – including for the wealthiest New Zealanders - Goff yesterday confirmed Labour would borrow another $400 million to increase already sharply higher spending on early childhood education.

“Taken with Labour’s other expensive promises, including $250 million a year to remove GST from fresh fruit and vegetables and borrowing another $2 billion a year to invest in the NZ Super Fund, Goff’s wish list now amounts to more than $5 billion a year,” Mr English says.

“Almost all of that money will all have to be borrowed, unless Labour has secret plans to raise taxes on middle-income earners.

“It will stick in the craw of many New Zealand families, who are being careful with their money and paying down debt, that Labour is promising to do exactly the opposite with taxpayers’ money. It is nothing short of reckless.

“At least Goff has done New Zealanders a service so early in election year. He has clearly contrasted Labour’s recipe of loose spending, more borrowing and higher taxes with the Government’s responsible programme to bring debt under control, promote savings and get the economy growing faster.”
