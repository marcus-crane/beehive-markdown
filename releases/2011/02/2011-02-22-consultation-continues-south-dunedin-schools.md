Education Minister Anne Tolley has invited parents and teachers in the South Dunedin community to have their say in a second round of consultation about the future of South Dunedin schooling.

“I want to thank the boards of the six schools and their communities for their constructive feedback in the first consultation round,” says Mrs Tolley.

“I have considered all the feedback and I would now like the boards to consult their communities on the revised options.

“These options relate to five of the South Dunedin schools, as I have decided that St Clair School will be retained in its current form, as a Year 1-6 primary school.”

Falling school rolls have been a concern for a number of years, with a drop of almost 20 percent in the number of students in South Dunedin primary schools between 2000 and 2010. Roll decline can lead to reduced funding, reduced staffing and fewer educational options for students.

“We want to strengthen education for all South Dunedin students and ensure a viable, sustainable network of schools,” says Mrs Tolley.

The options for consultation are:

Caversham, College Street and Calton Hill Schools:

Merge Caversham, College Street and Calton Hill Schools. The options for a merger are:

• a Year 1-6 primary school on the Caversham site

• a Year 1-8 primary school on the Caversham site

• a Year 1-6 primary school on the Caversham site, with a second campus on the Calton Hill School site

• a Year 1-8 primary school on the Caversham site, with a second campus on the Calton Hill School site

Macandrew Intermediate School and Forbury School:

• Merge Macandrew Intermediate and Forbury Schools as a Year 1–8 school on the Macandrew Intermediate School site.

• Close Macandrew Intermediate School and retain Forbury School as a Year 1-8 school on its current site.

“Continued community involvement in this process will be crucial in developing the best education opportunities for students in South Dunedin,” says Mrs Tolley.

Local Ministry of Education staff will provide support to the school boards and communities throughout the process. Submissions close on 22 March 2011 and the aim is to implement changes from Term One, 2012.
