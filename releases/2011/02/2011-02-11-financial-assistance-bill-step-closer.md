A Bill set to provide a financial assistance package for owners of leaky homes is a step closer with the Bill’s progress through the select committee process, Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson says.

The Weathertight Homes Resolution Service (Financial Assistance Package) Amendment Bill had its first reading in the House on December 9 before being referred to the Local Government and Environment Select Committee.

Now submissions to the Bill are due to close next Friday 18 February.

Under the Bill, the Government will contribute 25% of the cost of repairing a leaky home and local authorities will also pay 25% if they had signed off the original work.

“The Government’s Weathertight Homes Financial Assistance Package will reduce the time and money wasted in disputes so that more money goes to actually repairing leaky homes,” Mr Williamson says.

The proposed package is voluntary and in addition to the current disputes and litigation process.

Submissions on the Weathertight Homes Resolution Services (Financial Assistance Package) Amendment Bill can be made online at [www.parliament.nz](http://www.parliament.nz) or in writing to:
