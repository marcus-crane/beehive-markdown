Foreign Minister Murray McCully this morning confirmed that there are now 300 international search and rescue personnel in Christchurch, from four international contributors, working alongside New Zealanders to boost rescue efforts following the devastating earthquake.

Support from the United States is due to arrive overnight and from the United Kingdom tomorrow morning, boosting the number of search and rescue personnel by 130.

"We welcome Australia’s announcement that a field hospital is on its way and will arrive this afternoon. The field hospital will provide an additional 75 beds and relieve pressures created by the 150 beds out of commission at Christchurch Hospital. It will be staffed by some of the Australian medical personnel already on the ground and New Zealand medical personnel," says Mr McCully.

"We are most grateful for all the international specialist search and rescue contributions. Everything that we can do at this critical time will increase our chances of rescuing people.

"We are deeply appreciative of the generous offers of assistance we are still receiving, and we continue to assess those offers based on the needs on the ground," says Mr McCully.
