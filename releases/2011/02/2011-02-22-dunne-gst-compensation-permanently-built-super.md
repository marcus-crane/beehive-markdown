A Grey Power claim that the Government has ended compensation built into their superannuation for last year’s rise in GST is wrong as the compensation is there to stay, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today.

“The compensation given to superannuitants when the GST rise came in on 1 October last year was both immediate and permanent. It is now built into their payments and will remain so through further adjustments as they occur,” Mr Dunne said.

“At the time of the rise in GST, the Government committed to the compensation never running out or expiring as it would be built into future adjustments to superannuation, including in the CPI adjustment on 1 April this year."

Mr Dunne said superannuitants had had substantial rises in the past two years.

The total married rate for NZ Superannuation, after tax, has increased from $879.60 on 30 September 2008, to $1022.12 on 1 October 2010.

“That's an increase of $142.52 a fortnight – or 16.2% in just two years, with another CPI adjustment to come on 1 April this year,” Mr Dunne said.

“Very few wage and salary workers will have received such a big increase.”
