A new report by the Environment Ministry on dioxin emissions shows New Zealand is making significant progress in reducing our exposure to these toxic chemicals, Environment Minister Nick Smith says.

“Dioxins are among the most toxic chemicals known and are associated with cancer, skin diseases, and immunity and reproductive disorders. This report shows the amount being emitted to atmosphere has halved in the last 10 years,” Dr Smith said.

“This progress on reducing dioxins in the air is due to successful regulations controlling burning at landfills, waste incinerators and toughened vehicle emission standards. The uncontrolled burning of plastics was a major source and that has been largely eliminated.

“This reduction in dioxin released in the air is backed up by measurements in people and food. Dioxin levels in breast milk dropped 40% over the 10 year period to 2010 to one of the lowest levels internationally. Studies show that New Zealand’s dioxin levels in food are between half and one-fifth that of Europe and North America and well below World Health Organisation standards.

“This reduction is good news for the health of New Zealanders, the environment and our important food exporting industries. The greatest exposure to humans is from eating meat, dairy products and fish. Less dioxin in the atmosphere means less getting into the food chain and means our food exports match up to New Zealand’s clean, green brand.

“The report identifies real challenges in measuring sources of dioxin and revises a number of earlier estimates based on more comprehensive data. The Government is less concerned about dioxins being properly disposed of on land as the impact on people is significantly less compared to dioxins in the air and water.

“We are committed to the global effort to reduce exposure to toxic chemicals and to meeting our reporting requirements under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. This report confirms New Zealand is making positive progress on better managing the environment and reducing exposure to toxic chemicals.”
