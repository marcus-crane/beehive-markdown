Minister of Foreign Affairs Murray McCully today welcomed the restraint shown by all sides in the demonstrations currently taking place in Cairo and other major cities in Egypt.

"The Egyptian people have expressed their deep-seated desire for change and we are encouraged that it seems to be happening peacefully," he said.

Following President Mubarak’s announcement this morning to step down as President in September's elections, Mr McCully commented: "The President’s announcement is an opportunity for all Egyptians to make a new beginning together."

"There are now opportunities for thorough reform and it is positive to see the President indicating that this will happen," Mr McCully said.
