The number of 18-25 year olds studying at tertiary level has increased markedly since 2008, according to Tertiary Education Commission figures

The number of Equivalent Full Time Students (EFTS) aged 18 - 25 years engaged in formal tertiary study increased by 15,648 (13.5%) between 2008 and 2010.

Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce says this supports employment statistics released yesterday showing the number of 15-24 year olds who are NEET (Not in Education Employment or Training) has fallen from 10.5% to 9.8%, with 13,200 additional young people in the education system compared to the previous year.

Yesterday's NEET statistics showed 6,900 more 15-24 year olds engaged in formal tertiary study than one year ago.

Mr Joyce says the government is focussed on giving our young people the right opportunities to gain – at a level that suits them – world-class skills and knowledge that will get them ahead in life, and boost New Zealand’s economy along the way. 

“That’s why we’re investing in more places across the tertiary system than ever before.

“As well as having more people in training we are committed to getting better results by ensuring that both providers and students are performing as well as they can. We are continuing to introduce measures that will help to lift results across the board.”
