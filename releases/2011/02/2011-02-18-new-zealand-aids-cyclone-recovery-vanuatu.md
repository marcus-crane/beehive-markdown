New Zealand will provide $50,000 to support the recovery effort in Vanuatu following Cyclone Vania, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"Cyclone Vania hit Vanuatu in late January. High winds and heavy rains caused damage to food crops, and there are also concerns around sanitation, shelter, and communication links.

"The cyclone compounded the impact of volcanic activity in 2009 and a drought in 2010. Vanuatu has also recently been affected by Cyclone Yasi.

"New Zealand will provide up to $50,000 to the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) in Vanuatu, to help with the repair of water supply systems in Tafea Province.

"ADRA is a non-Government organisation that has been involved in a number of disaster recovery efforts. It is well positioned to assist with the repair of water supply infrastructure and will work with the Government of Vanuatu’s Department of Rural Water Supply.

"We are currently only halfway through the cyclone season and it is important that we help our Pacific neighbours to recover rapidly from natural disasters so they are well positioned to deal with any future events," Mr McCully said.
