After tax wages are continuing to rise faster than prices, reflecting the benefits of the income tax cuts last year and ongoing wage rises.

“We do understand that times still remain challenging for many New Zealanders. What really matters for them is whether their wages are rising faster than the cost of living,” Finance Minister Bill English says.

“While we don’t know everyone’s individual circumstances, average after-tax wages have increased 16 per cent and consumer prices have gone up 6 per cent since September 2008.

“That means even after taking account of the one-off rise in GST on 1 October and other consumer price rises, real after-tax earnings have now grown 10 per cent in that time.

“That’s a big improvement on the meagre 4 per cent total growth over the previous nine years,” Mr English says.

The figures use data on average weekly ordinary time earnings (per full-time employee) from Statistics New Zealand’s Quarterly Employment Survey issued last week – the official series used to calculate the wage floor for New Zealand Superannuation. They then incorporate the effects of inflation and the prevailing income tax rates on those average wages.

“They give a true picture of changes in New Zealanders’ spending power,” Mr English says. “The latest results completely refute Phil Goff’s claim that workers are going backwards. In fact, after taking account of inflation and tax, average workers are doing considerably better than they did under Labour.

“It was quite staggering that during a time of economic prosperity around the world between 1999 and 2008, New Zealanders’ real after-tax earnings improved by just 4 per cent over that entire period.

“Growth came from all the wrong places – such as government spending, excessive debt and ballooning house prices – and hard-working Kiwi families paid the price through meagre take-home pay increases.”
