The welfare centre in Hagley park will close this evening says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

“The welfare centre at Burnside High remains open, with the new addition of Cowles Stadium which is open now and Pioneer Stadium which will be open from 6 o’clock this evening,” says Ms Bennett.

With rain forecast over the next few days, the decision has been made to move everyone from Hagley Park to the other, more suitable buildings.

“People are being shifted by bus out of Hagley Park to other welfare centres,” says Ms Bennett.

The 0800 779997 Government helpline has now taken more than 7,000 calls.

It will remain open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
