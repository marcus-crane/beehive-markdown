Investment in primary sector innovation has reached new levels with the announcement today of $107 million of government-industry funding of Primary Growth Partnership (PGP) proposals.

This takes the total government-industry spend to more than $475 million over 16 months.

Agriculture and Forestry Minister David Carter and Fisheries Minister Phil Heatley have welcomed the approval of proposals for the aquaculture and wildfish harvesting industries. Mr Carter also welcomed acceptance of a timber proposal.

“The Government’s total investment so far of almost $218 million to PGP programmes demonstrates its firm commitment to lifting economic growth through primary sector innovation,” says Mr Carter.

The three proposals approved will:

- Support the development of a new wildfish harvesting technology that will allow more precise catches and allow fish to be delivered to export markets fresher and in better condition;
- Transform New Zealand’s Aquaculture industry by selectively breeding high value green shell mussels; and
- Contribute $2.5m to finding viable alternatives to methyl bromide in pest control in log exports.

Mr Carter says the latest proposals continue the impressive response by the primary sector to PGP since it was launched in September 2009.

“In just 16 months, the Partnership has delivered close to half a billion dollars of investment in our world-leading primary, forestry and food sectors. With further rounds of applications in the pipeline, this figure looks set to keep growing in line with the Government’s ambitions for PGP,” Mr Carter says.

Mr Heatley says the first successful proposals from the fisheries sector are a very important addition to the Partnership.

“Fisheries is a billion-dollar industry for New Zealand and these successful proposals put it on a strong footing with our other major primary sector exporters.

“The proposals have the potential to significantly expand the sector’s earning capacity, sustainability and use in line with the industry goals set out in the Fisheries 2030 strategy,” Mr Heatley says.
