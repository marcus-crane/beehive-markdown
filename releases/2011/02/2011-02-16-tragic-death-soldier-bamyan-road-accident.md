Defence Minister Wayne Mapp has expressed his deepest sympathies to the family of Private Kirifi Mila, who was killed in a road accident yesterday on patrol in Bamyan province, Afghanistan. He was serving with the New Zealand Defence Force Provincial Reconstruction Team.

“Private Mila was killed, and three other members of the patrol injured, when their vehicle rolled off the road and down a steep bank, “ Dr Mapp said.

“This is tragic news. The life of every New Zealand soldier is precious, not only to their own family but to the wider Defence family and the country they serve.

“Service in Afghanistan is hard. The roads are narrow and dangerous. Every day our people encounter significant risk, not only through the actions of insurgents.

“Private Mila was a fine member of the Defence Force who has served his country well, and has now paid the ultimate price while doing his duty.

“At this time we should all reflect on the price of his service.

“I also extend my sincere condolences to those injured in the accident and their families.

“The injured, and all the families involved, will have the support they need in the days ahead,” the Minister said.
