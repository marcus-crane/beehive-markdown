Health Minister Tony Ryall and Associate Health Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman today welcomed confirmation the new Northern eating disorder service is up and running and providing much needed treatment to seriously unwell patients in the region.

‘’The Government said it would provide more eating disorder services and we’re delivering on that promise,’’ Mr Ryall says.

‘’The new service means seriously ill people can now access residential treatment in the northern region when previously there was next to no treatment available.’’

Auckland DHB contracted Challenge Trust to establish a nine-bed residential facility and a day clinic for 12 patients in Parnell.

Dr Coleman says the service is being funded through an extra $26 million in mental health funding to improve eating disorder services across the country.

‘’It shows the additional funding is doing exactly what it was intended for – improving frontline eating disorder services.’’

‘’Knowing the service will soon be operating at capacity and providing the treatment and support people need in a home-like environment is very encouraging. It’s a great step in tackling a problem that often affects not just the person experiencing it, but their family as well.’’

Mr Ryall says patients from Northland south to Taranaki and Tairawhiti DHBs are eligible to use the services.
