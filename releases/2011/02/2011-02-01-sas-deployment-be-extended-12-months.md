Cabinet has decided to extend the deployment of the New Zealand SAS task force in Kabul for a further 12 months from April, but with about half the number of personnel, Prime Minister John Key announced today.

“The deployment will be of a much smaller contingent of approximately 35 personnel,” says Mr Key. “This compares to approximately 70 now.”

“They will focus primarily on partnering with the Afghan Crisis Response Unit and ensuring the work they have been carrying out to bring that unit to a high operational standard is completed. This is the main reason for the extension of the deployment.

“As is currently the case, New Zealand will retain full command of this deployment.

“In making this decision, I have been assured by the Chief of Defence Force that any Rugby World Cup commitments would not be compromised by a smaller contingent continuing to be based in Afghanistan.

“I cannot comment in further detail on the specifics of the continued deployment, but as has been the case in the past, the Government may comment from time to time on operations when it is in the public interest to do so.”
