Emergency Payments to Cantabrians affected by the earthquake have topped one million dollars says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

So far, 6,267 Civil Defence payments totalling $1,024,202 have been made.

“The greatest need at the moment is for food, followed by clothing and bedding, it’s those basic human needs for food, warmth and shelter that we’re trying to meet,” says Ms Bennett.

About 55% of payments have been for food, 26% clothing and 11% for bedding. The average payment has been around $165.

“There is a high demand for support during this crisis and our staff are doing everything they can to help people in what are very difficult circumstances,” says Ms Bennett.

Welfare Centres are operating at Burnside High School, Pioneer Stadium and Rangiora Baptist Church. The Cowles Stadium Welfare centre is now closed.

Work and Income sites at Ashburton, Hornby, Rangioa, Kaiapoi and Riccarton are open today until 4 pm.

These sites are open for emergency assistance only.

“We would still encourage people in need, to call the Government helpline first to take the strain off those few Work and Income offices,” says Ms Bennett.

“Work and Income staff from around the rest of the country are manning that helpline 24 hours a day and have taken more than 34,000 calls so far,” says Ms Bennett.

“They will continue to do what they can to assist people in need around the clock,” says Ms Bennett.
