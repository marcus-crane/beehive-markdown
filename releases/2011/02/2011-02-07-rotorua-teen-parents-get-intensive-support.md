Social Development Minister today opened Te Whare Kaupapa Awhina, a new supported home for teenage parents in Rotorua.

“The National-led Government is placing a real priority on vulnerable teen parents, to ensure they get the right support,” says Ms Bennett.

Te Whare Kaupapa Awhina is one of seven new Supported Houses being established this year under new government funding from Budget 2010.

Other homes are in Auckland, Manukau, Christchurch, Hastings, Gisborne and Whangarei, all areas with high teenage birth rates.

“We’ve put fifteen million dollars into teen parents, which is the biggest social development investment in teen parent services, because we think it’s vital,” says Ms Bennett.

Supported homes for teen parents will provide 24/7 supervision with trained staff, social workers and support workers and volunteers.

Teen parents will receive parenting, budgeting and life skills and help to make plans for their future in education or work.

“The idea is to ensure these young parents are equipped to be independent, good parents and the support continues once they leave the home to ensure they get off to the right start,” says Ms Bennett.

Other teen parent initiatives include:

• Extra social workers in hospitals

• Extra teen parent intensive case managers

• Parenting support for teen dads
