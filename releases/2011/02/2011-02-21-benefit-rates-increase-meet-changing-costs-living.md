Social Development Minister Paula Bennett says benefit and superannuation payments will increase for more than one million New Zealanders from April.

“We’ve locked the Annual General Adjustment into legislation to give some certainty and to ensure payments keep pace with rising costs,” says Ms Bennett.

Main benefits, Superannuation and Student Allowance rates will all increase from April 1 to reflect increases to the Consumer Price Index.

Main benefits will increase by 3.75% from 1 April 2010 to 1 April 2011, this includes the GST compensation component of 2.02% added in 1 October 2010.

“The percentage increase will be slightly higher for married couples receiving NZ Superannuation,” says Ms Bennett.

Married rates will increase by 6.85%.

This ensures married rates continue to equal 66% of the average net wage.

The net rate paid to couples receiving NZ Superannuation will rise by just over $22 a week.
