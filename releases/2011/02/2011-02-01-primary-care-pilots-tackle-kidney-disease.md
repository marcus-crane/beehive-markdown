Four district health boards (DHBs) are testing new ways of treating kidney disease.

Two centres will use one approach, which is a world-class new electronic decision support tool for general practitioners, to improve detection and management of kidney disease.

The second approach also involves general practitioners, and sees specialists working alongside primary care teams managing high risk kidney patients in the community.

The four centres involved are:

- Northland DHB
- Langimalie Health Centre (a Tongan focused clinic in Auckland)
- Hawkes Bay DHB
- Southlink in Southern DHB.

Three related projects will also add to the evidence base, the successful Horowhenua Kidney Health project, and an established programme in Auckland DHB and a new programme just launched in Waikato DHB.

Kidney failure has a major impact on individuals, their family and the health system. Chronic kidney disease does not give any warning symptoms until the kidneys are failing, when it can cause fatigue, loss of appetite, anaemia and general ill health.

Three of the four demonstration sites are now running and the fourth will be underway by mid-February.

It is expected that the projects will lead to similar programmes being rolled out throughout the country.
