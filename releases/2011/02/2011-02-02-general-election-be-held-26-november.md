The 2011 General Election will take place on Saturday 26 November, Prime Minister John Key announced today.

“I believe it is in the country’s best interests to know the date of the General Election early in election year,” says Mr Key.

“It creates certainty for New Zealanders and allows people to plan accordingly. This is particularly true this year when the Rugby World Cup, the third largest sporting event in the world, is being hosted by New Zealand.

“Last night I rang the Governor-General to advise him of the election date,” says Mr Key.

The Government’s intention is that the House will rise on Thursday 6 October, and Parliament will be dissolved on 20 October. Writ day will follow on Wednesday, 26 October, and nomination day will be Tuesday 1 November.
