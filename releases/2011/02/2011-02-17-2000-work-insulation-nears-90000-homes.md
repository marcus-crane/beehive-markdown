The roll out of the government's home insulation and clean heating programme, Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart, is nearing 90,000 homes while keeping about 2000 kiwis in full time employment, Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee says.

The latest figures show 88,920 New Zealand households have been retrofitted with insulation and/or a new efficient heating since the programme started in July 2009.

Despite the hot summer weather 4,515 houses were insulated in December and January, demonstrating continued strong interest in the scheme at a time of year when demand can taper.

“The scheme continues to remain popular – it’s improving quality of life for recipients and providing solid employment for installers,” Mr Brownlee said.

“Homeowners are thinking ahead by getting their homes insulated during the summer months, which is a good idea, as demand tends to increase as winter nears.”

The government is investing $347 million in the programme over four years to retrofit at least 188,000 homes with insulation and clean heating devices. It is estimated the scheme has resulted in around 2000 full time jobs.

Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart is a result of the National government/Green Party Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2009 to work on common policy.

**Background**

Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart is operated by EECA, the Energy Efficiency Conservation Authority. It contracts private sector service providers to insulate homes.

Government funding is available to help insulate homes, and install clean and efficient heating.

Homeowners with houses built before 2000 are eligible for 33 per cent of the cost of installing ceiling and under floor insulation, to a maximum of $1,300.

Once insulation is up to standard, homeowners can get $500 towards a clean, efficient heating system.

There are higher levels of funding for Community Services Card holders. For more information, visit www.energywise.govt.nz.

EECA’s latest research surveyed 500 people who had had their houses retrofitted under the Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart scheme. Highlights included:

• 94 per cent of people were either satisfied or very satisfied with their experience of the programme

• 91 per cent of people said they had seen an improvement in their home’s warmth since having their insulation installed

• 18 per cent specifically attributed improvement in their health down to the insulation being installed
