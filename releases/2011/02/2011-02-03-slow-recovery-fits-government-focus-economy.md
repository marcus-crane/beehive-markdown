The number of people officially unemployed has risen in the last quarter, says Social Development and Employment Minister Paula Bennett.

The Statistics New Zealand rate, which includes those aged 15 years and over seeking one or more hours work a week, has increased from 6.4% to 6.8%.

“We are still very much in a slow recovery, making the Government’s push towards investment to create sustainable jobs vital,” says Ms Bennett.

There was a 0.3 percent increase in full time employment. Part time employment has fallen by 2.8%.

Statistics New Zealand figures show 27,000 jobs were created in 2010.

"Ideally the rate would be dropping, but it's not uncommon to see a rise the rate at this time of year and last Decemeber quarter it was 7.4%," says Ms Bennett.

“The road to recovery is a bumpy one, employers have boosted working hours before hiring new staff, but they’re indicating they’ll take on more staff this year,” says Ms Bennett.

“It’s clear the 90-day trial is vital to give employers that extra bit of confidence to be able to employ new people on in this environment,” says Ms Bennett.

The number of young people in work has risen by more than 5,400 over the last year and the number of young people who are NEET (Not in Education Employment or Training) has fallen from 10.5% to 9.8%.

The Youth Unemployment rate fell from 18.4% to 16.8% over 2010.

“What we’re also seeing is more young people staying in education or returning to do more study, which makes sense,” says Ms Bennett.

The Maori unemployment rate fell from 16.2% to 15.5% in the December quarter.

Pacific Youth unemployment rates fell from 29.8% to 27.2% over the same period.

New Zealand’s 6.8% unemployment rate compares to UK (7.8%), Australia (5.0%) and Ireland (13.9%).
