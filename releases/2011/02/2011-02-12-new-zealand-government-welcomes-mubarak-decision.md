Foreign Minister Murray McCully says the New Zealand Government welcomes the decision by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to step aside, opening the door to a transition process that will still hold many challenges.

"The decision by President Mubarak to step aside will create the conditions for a peaceful and substantial transition. Hopefully this will enable a shift from protest and confrontation, to dialogue and cooperation. The stability of Egypt and the Middle East region depends upon this.

"We hope that the military, to whom power is now entrusted, will act with restraint and show respect for the wishes of the Egyptian people. The changes that have occurred in the past day are truly significant, but many challenges now lie ahead if we are to see a peaceful transition in Egypt and stability within the region," Mr McCully said.
