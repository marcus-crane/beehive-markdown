Brigadier Tim Keating has been appointed New Zealand’s Chief of Army, replacing Lieutenant General Rhys Jones who became Chief of Defence Force last month.

Brigadier Keating will be promoted to Major General when he begins his three-year term tomorrow. He is currently serving as Chief of Staff at Defence Headquarters, and was previously Deputy Chief of Army.

Announcing the appointment today, Defence Minister Wayne Mapp said that Brigadier Keating has an outstanding service record in the Army.

“He is an exceptionally able and highly-experienced officer who has demonstrated excellent leadership skills during his career.

“He has a very strong record of operational leadership. His command appointments in recent years have included the 2nd Land Force Group at Linton, a rotation of the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Afghanistan, the Officer Cadet School at Waiouru and the NZSAS at Papakura.

“His role as Chief of Army will require leadership at the highest levels. The tempo of our overseas operations will draw heavily on his considerable operational experience.

“He will also make a substantial contribution as the Defence Force implements last year’s White Paper and prepares for the security challenges of the coming decades.

“I congratulate him on his appointment. I am very confident he will have a successful term of office,” the Minister said.
