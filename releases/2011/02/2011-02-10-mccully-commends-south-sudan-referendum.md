Foreign Minister Murray McCully has welcomed the peaceful conclusion of the referendum on the independence of South Sudan.

“The successful completion of the referendum is a very significant achievement and development in Africa’s political landscape,” Mr McCully says.

“It is an important step towards the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed between North and South in 2005. With 98.8% of the population voting for independence, the people of South Sudan have clearly expressed their desire for an independent state.

“New Zealand commends the Governments in both Khartoum and Juba on their commitment to ensuring the referendum was credible and peaceful, and we welcome the Government in Khartoum’s announcement that it will respect the outcome of the referendum.

“After fifty years of devastating conflict between North and South in which more than two million people have died, commitment to a lasting peace is essential.

“Many challenges remain and I encourage all parties to work together constructively to address these. New Zealand fully supports a peaceful transition to independence in South Sudan,” Mr McCully says.

New Zealand currently contributes peacekeepers to the United Nations Mission to South Sudan (UNMIS).

South Sudan is expected to become independent on 9 July.
