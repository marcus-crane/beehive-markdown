The Government has increased the minimum wage from $12.75 to $13, Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson announced today.

The training and new entrants’ minimum wages will increase from $10.20 to $10.40.

“This Government’s focus when reviewing the minimum wage over this term has centred on the need to protect jobs while ensuring a fair wage.

“Since being elected, we have raised the minimum wage by $1 – which equates to $40 a week,” Ms Wilkinson says.

“The 25c increase in conjunction with last year’s tax cuts ensures that workers on the minimum wage have maintained the buying power of their wages.

“Taking a careful and balanced approach has helped prevent workers from being priced out of the market.

“The Government is intent on boosting jobs and creating an environment that is conducive to economic growth.”

The new minimum wage rate will come into effect on April 1, 2011.
