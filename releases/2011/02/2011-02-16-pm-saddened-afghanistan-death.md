Prime Minister John Key is shocked and saddened to hear of the death of a New Zealand soldier in Afghanistan yesterday.

Private Kirifi Mila was killed in a vehicle accident and three others were injured, one seriously.

One other soldier was seriously injured and has undergone surgery after being evacuated to Bagram.

The accident happened in the north east of Bamyan province when the Humvee that the four members of the Provincial Reconstruction Team were travelling in, rolled down a 30 metre cliff.

Mr Key says, “This is a tragic accident and my heart goes out to the family of Private Mila. Our Defence Force in Afghanistan is operating in a dangerous and difficult environment in order to help the Afghan people.

“To have one of our own die in a road crash is heart-breaking news.”

The men were on a routine patrol at the time of the crash.

Private Mila’s next of kin have been notified.
