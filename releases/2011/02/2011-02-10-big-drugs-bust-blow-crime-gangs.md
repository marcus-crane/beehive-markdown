Police Minister Judith Collins today congratulated Police on a major drugs operation which dismantled a significant North Island methamphetamine supply chain and resulted in scores of arrests.

Today’s Police operation, codenamed Operation Stamp, saw Police swoop on addresses throughout the North Island. The operation involved around 150 Police staff across five Policing districts.

Thirty people were arrested and 29 vehicles, over $120,000 in cash, firearms, computers, drugs and drug precursors were seized. A clan lab was located in Murupara.

“Today is a bad day to be a criminal drug dealer," Ms Collins said.

"This operation shows that the New Zealand Police are serious about cutting the supply of methamphetamine and bringing those responsible for making and selling this destructive drug to account.

“Hundreds of Police staff were involved in this operation. I would like to thank and congratulate each and every one of them for their part in dismantling a supply chain that would have brought so much misery to our communities.

“The actions of Police will have a significant impact on the supply of methamphetamine. Not only will this mean less crime and fewer victims, but it will slow the pipeline of money that is the lifeblood of organised crime.

“The number of gangs involved shows they are putting aside their differences and working together in what is a highly lucrative, but evil drugs franchise.

“I’m confident the outstanding work by Police it will send a strong message to the criminal gangs that if they deal in methamphetamine, they will be caught and they will pay en extremely heavy price.”

The National Government has introduced a raft of new policies aimed at tackling criminal gangs and the drugs trade.

Last year Police and Customs seized 30.4kg of methamphetamine, or “P”, an increase of 46 percent over 2009 when 20.8kg was seized.

In addition, $36.5 million in criminal assets have been seized under a tough new forfeiture law.
