Minister for the Environment Nick Smith today announced that an application to extend Queenstown Airport is to be considered by the Environment Court.

“I have decided this application is nationally significant and the most appropriate authority to hear and consider it is the Environment Court,” Dr Smith said.

The application to the Environment Protection Authority from the Queenstown Airport Corporation is to alter the airport to include 19.1 hectares of land owned by Remarkables Park Limited. The alteration is sought for the purpose of servicing the anticipated growth in the number and size of aircraft using the airport in the next 30 years.

“Queenstown is a place of national significance and the airport is the gateway to an iconic region of New Zealand that is growing as a tourist destination. That is why I have accepted that it is a nationally significant application,” Dr Smith said.

“I have carefully considered the options for the application under the Resource Management Act to refer it to a Board of Inquiry or directly to the Environment Court. I consider that with the Environment Court already considering applications relating to rezoning and timing of flights allowed in and out of the airport, the most sensible way forward is for this application to be considered in the same forum.

“Directing this application to the Environment Court will give a fair opportunity for all parties to express their view, ensure the matter is considered with the other issues over Queenstown Airport while also ensuring decisions are reached in a timely way.”
