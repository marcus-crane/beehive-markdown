Education Minister Anne Tolley has praised Canterbury teachers and principals for their resilience and positive attitude following the recent earthquake.

"I met with the principals, teachers and board chairs of some of the worst affected schools while in Christchurch today," says Mrs Tolley.

"I was heartened by their determination to get students back into school, or some form of learning, as soon as circumstances allow.

"The overwhelming message was that they want to do all they can to provide flexible options to give students an education and some kind of certainty in their lives.

"But the enormity of this task shouldn't be underestimated, with over 10,000 students affected at the schools with major damage.

"We will continue to work together and support schools in any way we can.

"Schools in Christchurch City are closed until further notice, but boards with minimal damage who believe they can reopen soon should contact the Ministry for support and guidance.

"I'm advised that 37 schools and 52 ECE services in the Selwyn and Waimakariri District were planning to reopen today, and more are planning to open as the week goes on."

Parents should contact their school for information, and go to the Ministry website, www.minedu.govt.nz, for constant updates on reopening schools.

"I'd also like to thank the schools around New Zealand who have enrolled Christchurch students at this difficult time," says Mrs Tolley.

"They can be assured that they will receive support and resourcing."
