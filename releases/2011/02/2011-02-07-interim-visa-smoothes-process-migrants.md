New interim visas which benefit migrants, employers and foreign students come into effect today.

‘’Previously there have been issues with people having their immigration status lapse while waiting for a visa to be processed,’’ says Immigration Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman.

‘’The new interim visas means that if they have an application in with Immigration New Zealand, they are still legally allowed to remain in the country on the terms of their original visa while that application is being processed.

‘’Of course this provides certainty for the individual involved, but it also works for their employer, as an applicant is allowed to work legally while the paperwork is completed.’’

Interim visas for fee-paying foreign students allow them to continue studying when applying for visas to further their studies. The validity of police and medical certificates is also being extended from two years to three years.

Dr Coleman says these changes will smooth the enrolment process for education providers and help boost the $2 billion a year export education market. In 2009/10 Immigration New Zealand approved nearly 94,000 student visa applications, of which 65,500 were from full fee-paying international students.

Interim visas are part of the new Immigration Act which came into effect last November.
