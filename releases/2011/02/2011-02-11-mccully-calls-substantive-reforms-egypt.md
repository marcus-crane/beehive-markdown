Minister of Foreign Affairs Murray McCully says a spirit of restraint and moderation will be needed from both the Government and protesters in Egypt if there is to be a constructive ending to the current impasse.

“Clearly substantive and meaningful reforms are required if the administration is to meet the legitimate expectations of the Egyptian people. Equally clearly, that process needs to commence with sufficient commitment to diffuse current tensions.

“It is not yet apparent how today's speech from the President will contribute to that process. But it is already clear that many of the protesters will continue to call for more reform, more quickly.

“We join others in urging the Egyptian leadership to listen and respond, and the protesters to pursue their objectives through means that are non-violent and constructive,” said Mr McCully.

New Zealanders still in Egypt should exercise extreme caution over the next few days given the prospect of continued protests.
