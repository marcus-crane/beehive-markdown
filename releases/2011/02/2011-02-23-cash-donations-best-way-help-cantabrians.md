Cash donations are the best way to support people affected by the 6.3 magnitude earthquake that hit Canterbury yesterday, Civil Defence Minister John Carter says.

Mr Carter says offers of support from donations of money are the quickest and easiest way to help organisations on the ground get exactly what they need.

"That way, affected people can make their own choices about putting their lives back together. What’s more, money spent locally helps the local economy at a crucial time," Mr Carter says.

"If you have goods to offer, rather than cash, it will be some time before the logistics to handle this will be available.

"Staff need to focus solely to saving lives and protecting the public at this stage. Down the track, if there’s a need for specific goods to be donated, we will make a public call," he says.

Businesses wanting to offer expertise, and people wanting to volunteer, are asked to please wait and not send staff and resources, or go to Christchurch themselves. When local authorities have a clear idea of what is needed and are in a position to manage goods and volunteers they will advise publicly what is needed and where.
