The arrival of hundreds of farmers over the weekend to help in Christchurch is a huge boost to the earthquake cleanup, says Agriculture Minister David Carter.

“Federated Farmers is doing an excellent job of rallying farmers from as far away as the central North Island, Dunedin and the West Coast to pitch in and help with this mammoth task. 

“Today, 800 volunteers headed to New Brighton to shovel silt from properties and to help clear sections.  They are all using their own gear and many want to stay as long as the job takes.

“Farmers have seen Christchurch rally to help when rural Canterbury has suffered snows and floods in the past.  They would want to be there now to lend a helping hand in the city.   

“I thank Federated Farmers and New Zealand Young Farmers for stepping up so quickly to assist. 

“I also acknowledge the many rural companies throughout New Zealand that have given so generously with services and donations in Christchurch’s time of real need,” says Mr Carter.
