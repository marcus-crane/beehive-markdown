One of our priorities is checking on the elderly, disabled and vulnerable Cantabrians who may be alone and distressed says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

So far 5,333 calls have been made and of those, Work and Income staff have managed to get hold of 1,344 people.

“Because we just can’t get around the city physically yet, phoning those who are vulnerable in the first instance is a matter of urgency,” says Ms Bennett.

Of those contacted so far, two people required emergency help, 11 needed home visits, 24 were referred to Welfare Centres and the rest either were going to stay with family and friends or were fine where they were.

“One elderly gentleman in his eighties had suffered injuries in a fall. He said he didn’t want to be a ‘bother’ to anyone, but obviously we arranged to get him to a doctor,” says Ms Bennett.

“Many others are distressed, scared and needing comfort and reassurance, so our staff are doing their best to provide that,” says Ms Bennett.

Staff will continue making calls, attempting to connect with more than 14,500 people on a priority list.

A new Welfare Centre will be operating from the Rangiora Baptist Church from 8pm tonight and can take up to 350 people.

Welfare Centres are already operating in Burnside High School, Cowles Stadium and Pioneer Stadium.

The Government helpline is 0800 79997 and anyone needing assistance should call this number.
