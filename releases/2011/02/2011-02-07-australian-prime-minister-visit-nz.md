Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard will visit New Zealand on 15 and 16 February, Prime Minister John Key announced today.

“I am pleased to be able to welcome Julia Gillard to New Zealand on her first visit as Prime Minister,” says Mr Key.

“I believe her visit will strengthen the already strong partnership between New Zealand and Australia, and will continue a long-standing tradition of regular contact between the prime ministers of our two countries.

“The New Zealand Government will use the opportunity to push with Australia for further progress on a Single Economic Market. The benefits for both countries of a Single Economic Market include enhanced productivity, reduced costs of doing business and greater opportunities for innovation.

“We want to make doing business easier, no matter what side of the Tasman firms are operating from.

“Included in the programme is an address on the 16th by Prime Minister Gillard to Members of the House of Representatives in the debating chamber - the first foreign leader to do so. This will be a highlight of the visit and underscores the special and unique relationship that exists between the two countries.”

Other highlights of the two-day programme include an official welcome to Parliament, bilateral talks between the two Prime Ministers, an official luncheon at Parliament and an address to a business luncheon in Auckland, as well as a school visit.
