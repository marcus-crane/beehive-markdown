Police Minister Judith Collins and Customs Minister Maurice Williamson today congratulated Police and Customs officers for their role in making 2010 an “awful year” for methamphetamine dealers.

Police and Customs seized 30.4 kg of methamphetamine, or “P”, during 2010, an increase of 46 percent over 2009 when 20.8kg was seized. The seized drugs have an estimated street value of $30 million.

Many of these seizures were the result of nationally co-ordinated investigations targeting organised crime.

“2010 was a year those who make and sell methamphetamine on our streets would rather forget,” Ms Collins said.

“Armed with new powers to intercept gang communications and seize property from criminals, Police stepped up their efforts to reduce the amount of methamphetamine available in the community.

“These seizures show they have done an outstanding job. Their good work in reducing the amount of methamphetamine available weakens the criminal gangs that sell the drug and reduces crime in the community.

“I would like to thank and congratulate Police and their Customs colleagues for making 2010 an awful year for those who make and sell methamphetamine. I hope 2011 is an even worse year for drug dealers.”

Mr Williamson said hard work and good intelligence-gathering by Customs officers has resulted in Customs seizing just under 1 tonne (967 kg) of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine - the main precursors used to make methamphetamine.

“The interception of methamphetamine precursors is evidence of Customs' vital role in protecting New Zealand society against the war on drugs.”

Many of the precursors originated from China. Recently, Mr Williamson and Police Commissioner Howard Broad signed agreements with Chinese authorities to ensure both countries work together to combat the importation of drugs used in the making of methamphetamine.

“This co-operation with China gives us another powerful tool to stop the scourge of P,” Mr Williamson said.
