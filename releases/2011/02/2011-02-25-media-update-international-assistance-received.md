Minister of Foreign Affairs Murray McCully today welcomed specialist personnel from China who arrived in New Zealand this morning to strengthen the rescue and recovery operation following the devastating earthquake.

"We are very grateful for the contribution provided by our friends from China, the US, and the UK who have arrived in the past 12 hours. Each will provide a valuable boost to the efforts by New Zealand and international rescue workers in Christchurch," says Mr McCully.

This will bring the total international search and rescue personnel in New Zealand to over 350 from seven international contributors.

"The Government continues to receive generous offers of specialist assistance from our international partners. These offers are under constant assessment based on the needs on the ground," says Mr McCully.
