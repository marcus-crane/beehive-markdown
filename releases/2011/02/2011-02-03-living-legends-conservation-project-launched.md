Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson joined rugby icons including Sir Brian Lochore and Tane Norton today to launch the ‘Living Legends’ conservation project at AMI Stadium in Christchurch.

Living Legends is a community conservation initiative that is managing 17 native tree planting projects throughout New Zealand during Rugby World Cup 2011.

“Living Legends is a fantastic opportunity for New Zealanders and visitors to contribute to enhancing New Zealand’s environment, and leave a lasting treasure in some of our most iconic natural areas,” says Ms Wilkinson.

“Each planting will take place on public conservation land and will be at least 2-5 hectares per site.

“We want to see 5,000 trees planted at each of the 17 sites this year, with plans to increase that to 10,000 each site by the end of the project in 2015.”

Every planting event will be dedicated to a rugby legend representing most New Zealand provincial rugby unions.

Living Legends is a partnership with DOC, Project Crimson, The Tindall Foundation and Meridian.

In addition to the larger planting events, each local rugby legend will be invited to a dedication ceremony where a tree will be planted at their home rugby club, in their honour.
