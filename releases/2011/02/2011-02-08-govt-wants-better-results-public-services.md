Prime Minister John Key today outlined the Government’s intention to focus on building better results from public services, to get better value for money for taxpayers and improved outcomes for the New Zealanders who rely on those services.

In his Statement to Parliament, Mr Key laid out two of the National-led Government’s main goals: building the foundations for a stronger economy, and building better results from public services.

“The aspirations of New Zealanders rest on these two platforms,” Mr Key says.

“Two weeks ago I delivered a speech focused solely on the economy - on our plan for real enduring growth to provide the jobs, improved incomes and better living standards that Kiwis desire and deserve.

“Today I have outlined our second key focus – getting better results from our public services to improve the lives and wellbeing of New Zealanders, to help solve social problems in our country, and to lift the prospects of the next generation.”

Mr Key says New Zealanders expect a world-class health service, an education service that delivers for every child, a strong and effective justice system and social services that protect our most vulnerable, while also providing opportunities to succeed.

“A lot of money was thrown at these areas by the Labour Government but they achieved few, if any, resulting gains. We have made significant progress, for example in health, but some services are failing those who need them most,” Mr Key says.

“I am determined to turn this around. The National-led Government will be clear about our priorities – we will scale up what works, and get rid of what doesn’t.

“We will bring a special focus to improving the results of public services for vulnerable children.

“We will also look to make changes to the benefit system in response to the advice of the Welfare Working Group.

“Welfare reform is not just about financial outcomes – it’s about improving the lives of a large group of New Zealanders whose exclusion from paid work diminishes their quality of life and the quality of their children’s lives.

“This Government is not prepared to leave those people behind.”

Mr Key says work will also progress work this year to build greater value for money in the Government’s own bureaucratic machine.

“We’ve been moving resources to the front-line but, while we’ve made significant progress, the public service is still a long way from being a lean and efficient organisation,” Mr Key says.

“The Government machine still consists of more than 80 Crown Entities each with their own Board, 38 departments, more than 70 portfolios, and more than 60 separate Budget Votes.

“We are looking at further reforms to streamline and improve the performance of the Government bureaucracy.

“This year, and in the years that follow, you should expect to see more back-office savings initiatives, further restraint in terms of core government administration positions, and more consolidation of agencies and functions.

“My Statement to Parliament sets out a wide-ranging, ambitious programme for New Zealand, to build the brighter future Kiwis deserve.

“The Government will be working hard to build a stronger economy and to get better results from the public services for New Zealanders,” Mr Key says.
