Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson today announced the appointment of Diane Morcom as a new member of the Remuneration Authority.

The Authority is responsible for setting the rates of pay and allowances for MPs, Ministers, the Judiciary and local authority members.

Ms Morcom is taking the role left by the former Chair of the Authority, Michael Wintringham. John Errington, a member of the Authority, was appointed as Chair in November last year.

Ms Wilkinson says as a former Secretary of the Cabinet, and with an extensive background in the public service, Ms Morcom brings valuable experience to the role.

“Ms Morcom has worked in senior positions in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the State Services Commission and the Cabinet.

This puts her in good stead for the role.

“She has a full understanding of remuneration systems at all levels and I wish her well in this small, but important team.”

Ms Morcom’s term will expire on 30 June 2013.
