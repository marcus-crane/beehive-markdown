Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy is welcoming the official launch of the new Department of Internal Affairs today, now incorporating the National Library and Archives New Zealand.

“This is an important step towards delivering better value and quality public services for New Zealanders.

“The National Library and Archives New Zealand are iconic institutions and I believe they have a bright future. They now have the opportunity to deliver greater results together.

“The Office of Community and Voluntary Sector and the Government Chief Information Officer also become part of the new Department from today.

“In my opinion the Department of Internal Affairs is well organised and able to exceed expectations. For users it is very much business as usual.

“Internal Affairs is New Zealand’s oldest Government department, dating back to 1840. In recent years it has expanded its capability to become a well respected and trusted provider of government functions.

“I look forward to continuing to work closely with the National Librarian and Chief Archivist, once these positions are appointed in the next few weeks.

“I want to thank all the staff who have worked on this integration very professionally. There is a real determination to maximise the benefits of this move and build a strong future for these institutions.”

Mr Guy has attended various functions with staff today to mark the start of the new Department.
