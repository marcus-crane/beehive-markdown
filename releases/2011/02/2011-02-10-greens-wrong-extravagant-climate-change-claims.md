Claims by Russell Norman in a media release today that the Government is not planning to reduce emissions with its proposed 2050 target are just plain wrong, Climate Change Minister Nick Smith says.

“Dr Norman says the 50% reduction by 2050 is meaningless and actually amounts to an increase because of the distinction in the detailed consultation paper of base line being a gross figure and the target in 2050 being a net figure,” Dr Smith said.

“He claims the difference between 1990 net emissions and 1990 gross emissions was 31 million tonnes when the difference is less than one million tonnes. Ironically if we use the net 1990 figure the 2050 target would actually be greater and less stringent.

“New Zealand’s emissions in 1990 were 60.9 million tonnes gross and 61.7 million tonnes net under the agreed Kyoto Protocol rules. The target for a 50% reduction by 2050 would increase from 30.4 million tonnes to 30.8 million tonnes by changing the 1990 baseline from gross to net or make the target 1% easier.

“Many countries have chosen to publicly present their emission reduction targets relative to current emissions rather than 1990 emissions or relative to baseline increases because it makes them look better. This Government has consistently played with a straight bat and based its 2020 and 2050 targets relative to the international standard practice of 1990 baselines even though this has not looked as good.

“The reason for presenting the long-term 2050 target as net, but on a gross baseline, is because that is the basis of the accounting and reporting rules of the Kyoto Protocol and the standard used by every other country in reporting.

“Dr Norman needs to apologise. It is the Green Party not the Government that is being tricky, misleading and mischievous. Climate change is too important an issue for these sorts of political games. The Government’s plan amounts to genuine emissions reductions.”
