Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson welcomed today's report of the Maori Affairs Select Committee on the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Bill and announced the Government would be strengthening the Bill’s process for recognising customary marine title by providing Parliamentary scrutiny.

“I have paid close attention to the submissions on the Marine and Coastal Area Bill and have attended numerous public meetings in recent months,” Mr Finlayson said. “A number of people have raised concerns about recognising customary marine title by way of Order in Council."

“I will be recommending the House amends the Bill to require any recognition of customary title through negotiated agreement be given effect through legislation.

“This means that every such agreement will be subject to full Parliamentary and public scrutiny. This will dispel any concerns about future governments doing shoddy deals.”

The Select Committee report attaches a number of technical recommendations to improve the Bill. It is my intention to incorporate these into the Bill at the Committee of the Whole House stage.”
