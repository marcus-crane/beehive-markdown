Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced that up to 4000 young people will be retained in education and skills training in the year ahead instead of dropping out of the system, as a result of the Youth Guarantee and wider Government initiatives.

“The Youth Guarantee, Trades Academies and Service Academies are making a huge difference to the lives of thousands of Kiwi students and their families,” says Mrs Tolley.

“These 16 and 17 year olds are ambitious to gain qualifications and practical skills, but are more motivated outside the mainstream schooling system.

“By bringing schools, tertiary institutions and employers together, these young people are being given the opportunity to reach their potential, as we focus on a smoother transition between secondary schooling, vocational training and employment.

“I’m delighted we are over-delivering with the Youth Guarantee. Budget 2010 invested $48.1 million over four years to raise the number of places to 2500, but the actual number of places will be just under 2700.

“That means more young people will be able to re-engage with learning and gain valuable skills in a range of vocational courses free of charge at 35 private training establishments and polytechnics across the country.

Courses include Automotive Engineering, Tourism and Travel, Business Administration, Carpentry and Beauty and Hairdressing.

“In addition, eight Trades Academies are opening this year, with school students earning NCEA credits and a tertiary qualification, while gaining practical skills in the workplace.

“We have also expanded the number of Service Academies to 19, giving a military-focused programme to young people at risk of disengaging from education, while allowing them to work towards NCEA qualifications.

“For too long, teenagers who don’t fit within the system have been lost to education. We are ensuring that the system is more flexible, so that every youngster is given the opportunity to succeed.”
