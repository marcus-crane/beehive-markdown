The Government has welcomed offers of help from New Zealand’s business community to the Christchurch earthquake recovery effort, Finance Minister Bill English says.

“I joined the Prime Minister today in a conference call with the chief executives of Business New Zealand’s major companies group – representing most of New Zealand’s largest businesses.

“The Government is already mounting a huge rescue and recovery effort in Canterbury and we welcome the support and constructive ideas from the business leaders.

“Many of their companies have offices and staff in Christchurch and they are already providing considerable assistance to people throughout the city.

“Businesses have already stepped up with donations and offers of support for employees. The Government deeply appreciates the extra offers of help we’re now getting from many companies to help the people and businesses of Christchurch.

“As the Prime Minister said this morning, officials are working on a range of options for a Government business assistance package.

“Before we do that, and to ensure that the Government’s response is effective and well targeted, we’ll work with community and business leaders in Christchurch to confirm their most urgent requirements.”
