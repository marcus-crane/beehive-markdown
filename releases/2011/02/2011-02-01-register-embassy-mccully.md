Minister of Foreign Affairs Murray McCully is advising New Zealanders wanting to depart from Cairo, Egypt to ensure they register their names on the list being maintained by Cairo embassy officials.

“While email is not operating in Cairo, telephone services are still operating. An up-to-date understanding of the numbers of New Zealanders still wanting to leave Cairo is essential for the Government to make sensible decisions regarding the best means of assistance.

"Our Embassy in Cairo yesterday indicated that 30 New Zealanders were attempting to leave. Some of these were waiting at the airport. Our embassy staff were at the airport all day to offer assistance. Only four from that list departed on commercial flights on Monday (overnight New Zealand time). Several more with bookings were bumped by airlines under circumstances that we are looking into.

“I am concerned that there is still too much variation in numbers being reported to the Embassy and ask that all New Zealanders attempting to leave Cairo lodge their details with the Embassy.

“The Government has developed a range of options to assist, depending on the number of New Zealanders wanting to leave and any change in circumstances on the ground. The Government will make decisions to activate one of the options for a special flight if it becomes apparent that commercial flight options do not suffice.

"The environment in Cairo will obviously be affected, for better or worse, by events around the large public march being planned for Wednesday. We will be monitoring that situation carefully,” says Mr McCully.
