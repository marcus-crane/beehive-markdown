Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson has delivered the first reading of the Crown Pastoral Land (Rent for Pastoral Leases) Amendment Bill today, which will ensure that leases on crown pastoral land are fairer.

The Bill has already received wide-spread support from South Island high country farmers.

“The present rent system, which is based on land value, is both unworkable and has often created unnecessary conflict between Crown and lessees, Mr Williamson says.

Under the Bill, leases will be subject to what’s known as “earning capacity rents” and based on an objective calculation of how much a farmer is able to produce on the land.

“We developed this legislation in consultation with lease-holders and farm managers, as well as an independent peer review panel, and in consultation with environmental groups,” Mr Williamson says.

The Bill has been referred to the Primary Production Select Committee.
