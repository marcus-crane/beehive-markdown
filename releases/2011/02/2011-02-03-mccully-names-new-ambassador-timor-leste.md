The next New Zealand Ambassador to Timor-Leste (East Timor) will be career diplomat Tony Fautua, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

“New Zealand has been a committed friend of Timor-Leste since before its independence in 2002. We have been a significant part of both international security deployments there and have been represented in every United Nations mission in Timor-Leste,” Mr McCully said.

“New Zealand continues to maintain an infantry platoon in Timor-Leste as part of the International Stabilisation Force and has 10 police officers working within the United Nations Mission in Timor-Leste. We also manage a $9.5 million aid programme in Timor-Leste.

“As the country becomes progressively more secure, Timor-Leste’s needs are changing. Direct provision of security by other countries must be supplemented with training and other forms of assistance for the Timor-Leste police and military. The development needs are enormous, too with Timor-Leste remaining one of the world’s poorest countries.

“New Zealand will continue to support Timor-Leste as it moves into this important new phase in its development,” Mr McCully said.

Tony Fautua currently works in the Asia Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. His former postings have been in Washington, New York, Niue and Bougainville. He replaces current Ambassador Tim McIvor, who will be returning to Wellington.
