New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to the Cook Islands will be the Minister of Civil Defence, Hon John Carter, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"New Zealand and the Cook Islands enjoy a special relationship based on historical, constitutional, and strong people to people links.

"The Cooks have been self-governing in free association with New Zealand since 1965 and all Cook Islanders are New Zealand citizens. Accordingly, this underlines the closeness of the bilateral relationship," says Mr McCully.

"New Zealand development assistance to the Cook Islands has increased significantly over the past two years and has been refocused on sustainable economic development including support for activities such as waste management that maintain the integrity of Cook Islands reputation as a tourism destination.

"I am confident that John Carter - who enjoys a long association with the Cook Islands - will take a strong leadership role in managing this relationship at a very important time in its history," Mr McCully says.

John Carter has been the National Party MP for the Bay of Islands and subsequent Northland Electorate since 1987. His current Ministerial portfolios include Civil Defence, Senior Citizens, Racing and Associate Minister for Local Government.

John Carter will take up his appointment in August 2011, replacing current High Commissioner Linda Te Puni.
