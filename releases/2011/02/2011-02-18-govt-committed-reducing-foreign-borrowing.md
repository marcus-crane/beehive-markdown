Government financial statements for the six months ending December 31, show the cash deficit heading towards a record $15.6 billion in the current financial year, Finance Minister Bill English says.

The statements show revenue and spending broadly in line with forecasts in the Half-Year Update.

“However with the cash deficit already sitting at a record $13.2 billion and set to rise to $15.6 billion by June 30 – adding to New Zealand's already large stock of foreign debt - there is no room for complacency," Mr English says.

"This Government has borrowed heavily to support the economy and jobs during the recession and the early stages of recovery, but that kind of borrowing cannot continue indefinitely.

“New Zealand as a whole needs to save more, spend less and reduce its heavy reliance on foreign debt – and the Government is a crucial player in this.

“By playing its part in lifting national savings, this Government will help to keep interest rates low and build faster, ongoing economic growth.

"We are committed to managing the Government’s finances responsibly on behalf of taxpayers and that is why we have outlined plans to reduce the rate of new spending and get back to budget surplus as soon as possible.

"You'll see more policies aimed at tilting the economy towards savings and investment in Budget 2011."

While the accounts were broadly in line with the Half-Year Update, tax revenue was still about $1.3 billion behind Budget 2010 forecasts.

"This result reflects the relatively flat economy in the latter part of 2010 and reinforces the need for sound fiscal management," Mr English says.
