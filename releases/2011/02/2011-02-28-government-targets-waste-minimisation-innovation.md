Environment Minister Nick Smith today announced the final six Auckland projects from 2010/11 to receive funding from the Waste Minimisation Fund.

“Supporting these projects is a practical way the Government can encourage New Zealanders to reuse, recycle, recover and decrease the amount of waste going to our landfills,” Dr Smith said.

“Croxley Stationary has been granted $45,800 to investigate turning waste toner from printers into asphalt and bitumen in New Zealand. This could divert as much as 15 tonnes of waste residue toner a year away from landfill and into roads. International research has shown toner can increase the quality of bitumen and asphalt.

“Transpacific Technical Services will receive $182,000 for a programme to eliminate polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), most commonly found in old electrical equipment, from New Zealand. This project will ensure PCBs are safely disposed of rather than dumped into landfills.

“Sulo Talbot Limited is to receive up to $141,000 to investigate technologies that will see discarded plastic milk and cleaning product bottles transformed into high value items like mobile garbage bins and recycling crates. 

“Environmental Concrete Disposal Limited’s Solid Foundations project will reuse waste liquid concrete by turning it into concrete blocks.  This uses a concrete product that would normally be sent to landfill.  I am pleased to announce that this company will receive $173,000 to support this project. 

“Konzept Business Solutions Limited will use the $58,000 they have been awarded to investigate establishing a New Zealand industry to recover wood dust and plastic waste for production into Wood Plastic Composite.  Internationally Wood Plastic Composite is used to make a number of products including moulded decking. 

“Auckland Drum Sustainability Services Limited will receive $198,500 to commission a new plastics recycling and washing plant to convert ‘hard to recycle’ HDPE plastic scrap (number 2 plastics) into material reusable within New Zealand.  These recycled drums will replace imported virgin plastic polymer in a range of existing products.”
