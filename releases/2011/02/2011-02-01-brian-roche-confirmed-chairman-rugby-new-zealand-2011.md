**Joint statement with the New Zealand Rugby Union**

Brian Roche, who is the current Acting Chairman of Rugby New Zealand (RNZ) 2011 Ltd, the organisation responsible for the delivery of Rugby World Cup 2011, has been confirmed as the organisation’s Chairman.

Due to ill health, former Chairman Jock Hobbs resigned from the Board in December 2010.

The appointment has been confirmed by the two shareholders, the New Zealand Government and the New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU).

Mr Roche, who is also CEO of New Zealand Post, was appointed Acting Chairman of RNZ 2011 in May last year following Jock Hobbs’ initial health concerns.

Jock Hobbs continues to receive treatment and media are asked to respect his and the Hobbs family’s privacy at this time.
