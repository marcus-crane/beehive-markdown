Education Minister Anne Tolley has welcomed the decision by school principals to ratify the Secondary Principals’ Collective Agreement (SPCA), and has congratulated all of the parties involved.

“The 2011-2013 SPCA is a very good settlement for secondary principals and the Government,” says Mrs Tolley.

“It provides an improved career structure for principals based on professional criteria and service.

“New Zealand’s secondary principals now have clear incentives to keep developing their professional knowledge and leadership, both within their own school and across schooling clusters.

“I want to congratulate the advocates from the Secondary Principals’ Association of New Zealand, the PPTA and the Ministry of Education for reaching this very successful outcome.

“This decision comes after pay settlements for primary teachers and primary principals, and I urge the PPTA to return to the bargaining table to resume pay talks for secondary teachers.”

The SPCA, which came into effect from 17 February 2011 and expires on 29 March 2013, covers principals in all state and state-integrated secondary schools.
