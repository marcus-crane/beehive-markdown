Minister of Foreign Affairs, Murray McCully today extended New Zealand’s sympathies to US Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano following the fatal shooting of a United States immigration and customs enforcement agent this week in Mexico.

Secretary Napolitano will therefore be unable to attend the fourth US-NZ Partnership Forum in Christchurch from 20-22 February, as announced earlier this week.

"Secretary Napolitano confirmed earlier today that she will be unable to come to Christchurch as scheduled due to commitments arising from the fatal shooting.

"I have conveyed New Zealand’s sympathies and extended an open invitation to Secretary Napolitano to visit New Zealand and expressed our hope that she is able to reschedule her travel soon.

"The New Zealand Government is already working closely with the US on issues such as counterterrorism and response to natural disasters. We are looking to do more together in the Pacific region, on border security and ensuring the smooth flow of trade between the US and New Zealand," Mr McCully says.
