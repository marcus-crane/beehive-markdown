Minister of Foreign Affairs Murray McCully has expressed deep concern over reports that journalists in Egypt have been targeted by some pro-government elements.

“It is critical during this highly unstable period that clear information on events is able to be shared not only with Egyptians but all who care for the well being and future of Egypt.

“Reports that foreign journalists, including New Zealanders, have been targeted is extremely concerning and directly violates fundamental freedoms,” says Mr McCully.

New Zealand cameraman Olaf Wiig who was in Cairo as part of a Fox News team was among those injured during protests in central Cairo on Wednesday Mr Wiig was admitted to hospital overnight under military guard. Following medical care, the New Zealand Embassy facilitated his release from hospital and subsequently from detention by Egyptian military authorities.

Mr Wiig is now safely back in London.

“The treatment of Mr Wiig is a matter of considerable concern for the New Zealand Government. We will be making our views known to the Egyptian Authorities,” Mr McCully said.

“We want to see a return to peace and stability in Egypt. I believe that sentiment is shared by the people of Egypt but harassment and violent actions to stem media freedom will only exacerbate tensions and fears.

“We call on all sides to work quickly towards a peaceful political resolution of the current crisis,” says Mr McCully.
