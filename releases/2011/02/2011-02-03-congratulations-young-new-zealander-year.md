Minister of Youth Affairs Paula Bennett is delighted to congratulate the winner of the Young New Zealander of the Year award, Jamie Fenton.

“Jamie is an impressive seventeen year-old with the motivation and aspiration to achieve, marking her out as a leader of the future,” says Ms Bennett.

“This young woman chairs the youth subcommittee at her local council, plays lead violin in the Taranaki Youth Orchestra and was a stand out at school, passing School C at the age of eight,” says Ms Bennett.

The New Zealander of the Year Awards, held last night in Auckland encompass five categories including the Young New Zealander of the year.

Minister Bennett accepted the award on Jamie’s behalf as she was unable to be there on the night.

“It was an honour to meet Jamie’s family and celebrate her achievements, she and the other finalists are an inspiration to young new Zealanders,” says Ms Bennett.
