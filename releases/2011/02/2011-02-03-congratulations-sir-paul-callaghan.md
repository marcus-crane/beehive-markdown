The choice of top New Zealand scientist Sir Paul Callaghan as New Zealander of the Year is a highly-deserved honour, Science and Innovation Minister Wayne Mapp said today.

“Sir Paul is an exceptional New Zealander. He has achieved high international recognition and honours in his field.

“His stature as a scientist and researcher has been matched by very few people worldwide, let alone in New Zealand.

“His commitment to the very highest standards of work in his chosen field of nanotechnology and magnetic resonance is matched by his deep attachment to and pride in his country.

“Sir Paul has said that New Zealand is a stimulating and exciting place to live and work. Over many years he has made an outstanding personal contribution to New Zealand through his work and is a role model to keep young scientists here and make their own contributions to our country’s success.

“On behalf of the Government I congratulate him on this honour and thank him for his services to New Zealand.”
