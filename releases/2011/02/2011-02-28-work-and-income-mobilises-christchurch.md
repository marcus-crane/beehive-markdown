Work and Income has seven mobile vans going directly to people in the hardest hit suburbs of Christchurch says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

“These vans allow Work and Income to provide help directly to people in the suburbs, who may not be able to access transport,” says Ms Bennett.

”Social workers will join Work and Income staff in the vans to provide advice and support as well as financial assistance,” says Ms Bennett.

Seven Work and Income sites are now open at locations around the city.

Sites at Ashburton, Hornby, Rangiora, Kaiapoi and Riccarton have been open since Wednesday. With a further two sites opening today in Shirley (203-205 Hills Road) and Linwood (154 Aldwins Road).

“Work and Income staff are coping well, but people who can should call the Government helpline before going into a service centre,” says Ms Bennett.

By 10am this morning over 17,000 Civil Defence payments had been made, with more than $2.7 million paid out.
