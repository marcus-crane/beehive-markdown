Disability Issues Minister Tariana Turia is welcoming the historic delivery of the Treaty of Waitangi Day celebrations in New Zealand’s three official languages –te reo Maori, English and New Zealand Sign Language.

“Waitangi Day is a very important day in New Zealand for the very first time more than 7,000 deaf New Zealanders will be able to follow and understand the proceedings in New Zealand Sign Language.”

“This will be achieved through the use of a tri-lingual interpreter, conversant with New Zealand Sign Language, te reo Maori and English,” says Mrs Turia.

“Language is important for any culture and to be able to see and hear your language on such a significant day for all New Zealanders is something that we should all feel proud about.

“I hope this will encourage the more frequent use of New Zealand Sign Language interpreters at official occasions,” says Mrs Turia.

“I would like to thank the Waitangi National Trust for making New Zealand Sign Language an integral part of the Waitangi celebrations.”

New Zealand Sign Language was made New Zealand’s third official language in 2006 with the passing of the New Zealand Sign Language Act.
