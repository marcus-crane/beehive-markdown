New Zealand’s major livestock production industries are committed to high animal welfare standards through encouraging voluntary compliance and targeted enforcement action, says Agriculture Minister David Carter.

Mr Carter attended the inaugural meeting of the Animal Welfare Primary Sector Chief Executives’ Forum last night and endorsed a national plan recognising that everyone must take responsibility for the welfare of animals.

“New Zealand has a good reputation for animal welfare but we cannot rest on our laurels and it is important we safeguard that reputation with a robust compliance and enforcement plan,” says Mr Carter.

“While the Government plays a key role in setting standards, we rely on the livestock production industries to help ensure these standards are met and last night’s meeting showed that everyone is on the same page.”

Work is already well underway on the animal welfare compliance and enforcement plan, involving representatives from major industries and agencies working mainly with production animals.

“The level of work already being undertaken, from on-farm action to animal welfare training and industry-based schemes is impressive.  The Forum is designed to provide production sector oversight and direction for these initiatives,” says Mr Carter.
