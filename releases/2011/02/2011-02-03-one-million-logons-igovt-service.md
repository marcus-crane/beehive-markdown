Use of the igovt logon service passed a significant milestone when it was used for the one millionth time last week, says Internal Affairs Minister Nathan Guy.

“The use of this innovative service has increased massively over the last six months. There are already 174,289 unique logons created and this number is likely to keep growing.

“The igovt service allows users to provide one logon to access a number of participating provider's online services. This means people no longer have to remember multiple details for different services, saving time and hassle.

“NZTA, Police, Internal Affairs, and the Auckland and Wellington City Councils are among the agencies now using igovt logons for various online services.

“A large number of Government agencies are looking to integrate the igovt logon this year, including passport renewals and change of electoral enrolment details.”

The Department of Internal Affairs recently announced it has entered into negotiations with the New Zealand Post Group to expand the use of igovt services.

Additional information:

• Number of agencies using igovt services: 12

• Number of services available through igovt services: 24

• Total number of igovt logons created (including Jan): 174,289
