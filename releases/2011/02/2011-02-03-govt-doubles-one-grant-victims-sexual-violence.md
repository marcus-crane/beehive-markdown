The discretionary grant for victims of sexual violence has been increased from $250 to $500, Justice Minister Simon Power announced today.

The grant helps victims of sexual violence cover one-off costs associated with offending, such as repairing locks, replacing items of clothing taken for forensic evidence, or providing temporary accommodation.

The grant was introduced in January last year as part of a package of initiatives for victims of serious crime which are funded by the $50 offender levy.

“Since introducing the grant it’s become clear that more needs to be done in this area, which is why we’ve doubled it,” Mr Power said.

“I don't pretend for a second that anything we do will take away the pain of victims' loss or injury, but I'm confident this grant will help reduce financial stress and help victims of sexual violence recover more quickly.”

Victim Support, which provides support and assistance to victims of sexual violence, administer the grant. People who are interested in applying for it can contact Victim Support directly on 0800 VICTIM (0800 842 846).

The $50 offender levy also pays for a new court support service for victims of sexual violence. By June next year there will be 18 sexual violence advisers providing individualised case management and support for victims operating across the country.
