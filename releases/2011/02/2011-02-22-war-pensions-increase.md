The rate at which the War Disablement Pension and Veterans’ Pension are paid will increase from 1 April as part of the annual cost of living adjustment, Minister of Veterans' Affairs Judith Collins said today.

The War Disablement Pension and Veterans’ Pension will increase 3.75% from 1 April. This rise reflects increases to the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

“The increase in the rate of the War Disablement Pension and Veterans' Pension helps to compensate veterans for the rise in living costs,” Ms Collins said.

Examples of the increases are:

- A veteran on a 100% War Disablement Pension will now receive a tax-free payment of $199.05 per week, in addition to the Veterans’ Pension which is paid at the same rate as NZ Superannuation, or any other assistance such as a living alone or disability allowance.
- A veteran over 60 with a severe disability may receive up to $350.34 per week in addition to the Veterans’ Pension and/or other allowances.

All war pension payments are tax free and paid in addition to employment income or other financial assistance such as NZ Superannuation or the Veterans’ Pension.

Other pensions and allowances, such as the Surviving Spouse’s Pension, a Travelling Allowance, Clothing Allowance, Attendant’s Allowance and War Bursaries are also available in addition to the War Disablement Pension and the Veterans’ Pension.

A schedule of war pensions and allowances is attached.
