A volunteer army of Christchurch students is stepping up to help people in Christchurch and we’re backing them with funding says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

“Just as they did after last September’s earthquake, students led by Sam Johnson are swinging into action and it’s truly humbling to see,” says Paula Bennett.

Funding of $20,000 has been approved for the student clean up.

The money will help pay for equipment like wheelbarrows and shovels so they can continue with cleaning up liquefaction, clearing driveways and helping residents with basic labouring work. 

“I met with Sam and his team last year when we helped out with $5,000 for equipment and pizzas to keep them going, this time the work is even harder and we need them even more,” says Ms Bennett.

“What we saw last time round was a group of genuine, willing, hard-working  students who gave locals practical help as well as a real morale boost,” says Ms Bennett.

“Residents were just so appreciative of the help and were so amazed at the willingness young people showed to get stuck in to what is hard work to assist others,” says Ms Bennett.

The students are organising themselves through social networking site Facebook: [http://www.facebook.com/StudentVolunteerArmy](http://www.facebook.com/StudentVolunteerArmy)
