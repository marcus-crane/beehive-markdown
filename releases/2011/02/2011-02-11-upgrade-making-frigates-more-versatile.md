The second phase of a $58 million project to upgrade systems aboard the Navy frigates Te Kaha and Te Mana has begun, Defence Minister Wayne Mapp said today.

“Our Navy works closely with other countries and is a valued international partner in our region’s security arrangements.

“This upgrade in our frigates’ capability will improve the performance and extend the range of conditions in which they are effective,” he said.

The Minister said that design and manufacturing contracts have been awarded to Siemens (NZ) Ltd, Noske-Kaeser NZ Ltd, Australian Marine Technologies Pty Ltd, and ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems Australia.

“The ANZAC Platform Systems Upgrade (PSU) contracts will allow the Navy to leverage off the technology developments that have been made over the past 20 years,” the Minister said.

The contracts awarded are for the upgrade of the Integrated Platform Management System (IPMS) and the Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning (HVAC) system on board the ships. The upgraded IPMS will provide improved control and monitoring systems and will enable the introduction of more automation.

The upgrade of the HVAC system will reduce the effects of temperature on the performance and availability of a number of key systems, as well as improving conditions for the crew.

The ANZAC frigates are the mainstay of the Navy’s combat force, and have a range of over 7000 nautical miles. They are armed with a five-inch gun, torpedoes, air defence missiles and close-in weapons systems for self-defence.

The frigates also carry a SH2G Seasprite helicopter armed with air-to-surface missiles, making these ships the sharp end of New Zealand’s maritime defences.

The upgrade work will be carried out in New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and Germany.
