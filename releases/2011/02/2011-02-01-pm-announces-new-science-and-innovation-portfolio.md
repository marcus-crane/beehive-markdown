Prime Minister John Key today announced the appointment of Wayne Mapp as Minister of Science and Innovation, replacing Dr Mapp’s former portfolio of Research, Science and Technology.

Mr Key attended an event this morning at Victoria University to mark the new Ministry of Science and Innovation’s first day of operation.

Dr Mapp’s appointment comes after the merger of the Foundation for, and the Ministry of, Research, Science and Technology. The Ministry of Science and Innovation will assume the responsibilities of both agencies, and will also oversee the Crown Research Institutes.

“Dr Mapp has put a lot of energy into his research, science and technology portfolio over the past two years,” says Mr Key. “It’s only fitting he should oversee the formation of the Science and Innovation Ministry and its increased focus on maximising the benefits of science to the economy.”
