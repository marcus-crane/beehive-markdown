Defence Minister Wayne Mapp and his Australian counterpart Stephen Smith will meet in Wellington tomorrow to discuss defence and security issues in the region.

Mr Smith arrives in Wellington tonight and will return to Canberra after the meeting.

“I look forward to welcoming Mr Smith to New Zealand on his first visit as Minister for Defence,” Dr Mapp said today.

“Australia is our closest defence and security partner. Both nations have a vested interest in promoting security and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.

“Working together we can be a more powerful influence than each country working in isolation.

“We will be taking a pragmatic approach to ensuring that our defence ties, which go back to the First World War almost 100 years ago, remain relevant for the security challenges we face together today,” the Minister said.

He said that progress has been made in establishing a Pacific-focused Ready Response Force, which could be a useful springboard for increased co-operation between the two countries’ sea and air capabilities.

Other issues for discussion include improving bilateral engagement structures, establishing greater strategic exchange between the two countries, and cost efficiencies for both Defence Forces through greater co-operation.

Joint Press Conference

The Ministers will hold a joint press conference in the Beehive Theatrette at 1pm on Thursday 10 February.
