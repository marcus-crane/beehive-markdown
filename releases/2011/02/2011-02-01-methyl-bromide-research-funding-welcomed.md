Environment Minister Nick Smith today welcomed the announcement of $2.5 million under the Primary Growth Partnership for applied research into reducing the impact and eventual replacement of the fumigant methyl bromide.

“Methyl bromide is an ozone-depleting chemical, a powerful greenhouse gas and a toxic chemical that it is currently required at ports to meet phytosanitary requirements of importing countries for New Zealand timber exports worth $3 billion a year,” Dr Smith said.

“We need to find better ways of meeting these phytosanitary requirements with less environmental risk by either recapturing the methyl bromide or developing a replacement.

“This research initiative from the forest industry is to be welcomed and shows a genuine commitment to reducing environmental harm. This Government-industry partnership of up to $2.5 million over five years involving both public and private funds is a wise investment into improving the environmental sustainability of one of our critical export industries.

“The work by Parliament’s Environment Select Committee and by the Environmental Risk Management Authority in response to public concern at Port Nelson over methyl bromide called for such research to be advanced. It is good that this message from the community has been heeded and that steps are being taken to address these concerns.”

"My hope from this research programme is that we will be able to significantly reduce the environmental harm from the use of methyl bromide by 2015."
