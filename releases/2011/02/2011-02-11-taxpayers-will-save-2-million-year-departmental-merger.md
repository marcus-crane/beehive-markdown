The Minister Responsible for the National Library, Archives New Zealand and Internal Affairs has rubbished claims by Labour MP Grant Robertson that the integration of the three departments will save only $165,000 a year, putting the correct figure at closer to $2 million.

“Mr Robertson is using outdated figures,” says Mr Guy.

“The Government invested a one-off $2.5 million in the integration, and from next year onwards savings will be around $2 million annually.

“The integration has been an important step towards delivering better value and quality public services for New Zealanders.

“In the future frontline services to the public will improve as expertise and back office functions are shared.”
