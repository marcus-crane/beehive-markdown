The Government's billion-dollar-plus extra investment in health is delivering returns for New Zealanders, with the country's childhood immunisation rate now at a record level.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says, "The number of Kiwi children fully immunised by their second birthday has risen from 73 per cent in 2007 to just over 88 per cent.

"According to the Ministry of Health, the number of Maori children who are fully immunised at the age of two has jumped nearly 14 per cent to 85 per cent in the past two years.

"The immunisation rate among Pacific children has also increased nearly 14 per cent, to 91 per cent.

"Immunisation rates in Auckland have risen dramatically, around 20 per cent over the past two years.

"New Zealand's immunisation rates for children have been languishing for a long time, so it is pleasing to see such progress in this important public health programme."

Immunisation is important providing individual protection. It can also provide protection in the wider population by reducing the incidence of diseases which stops them spreading to vulnerable people.

Mr Ryall thanked the GP clinics, community groups and DHBs working to improve immunisation rates.
