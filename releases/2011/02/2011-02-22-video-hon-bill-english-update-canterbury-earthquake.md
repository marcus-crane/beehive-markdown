Cabinet has just met for the second time today to discuss the earthquake in Canterbury.

In the last few hours the scale of destruction has become increasingly apparent. As the Prime Minister has said it is now likely that today will go down in history as one of New Zealand's darkest days.

I've just got off the phone with the Prime Minister who has been on the ground and he tells me Christchurch is a scene of utter devastation.

We've had an initial indication from officials that 65 people are dead and indications are that could rise.

I'd like to assure you Government agencies are doing everything they can to help the people of Canterbury.

There is a major search and rescue effort underway, medical staff are treating the injured, and welfare centres have been set up for those in need of emergency shelter.

Police and Defence Force staff are helping clear the central city while emergency services staff are putting out fires and trying to locate and free any people trapped in collapsed buildings.

Specialist urban search and rescue teams from Auckland and Palmerston North will be on the ground in the next hour to assist their Christchurch colleagues.

Work will continue through the night.

An Australian Hercules aircraft is due to arrive in Christchurch overnight carrying Australian urban Search and Rescue personnel and their equipment. This means 250 specialist search and rescue personnel will be on the ground.

In addition to offers of help from the Federal Government of Australia, we have also received offers of help from some State Governments.

The United States Government has made an open offer of help – saying they will provide anything that will assist the rescue efforts. They have resources available in Honolulu, Hawaii.

The United Nations has offered help - they have contacted us, and NZ will identify specific needs.

The European Union has also offered help, as have the Governments of Singapore and Israel.

Discussions are underway with Japan, and we expect more detail later on what might be possible on that front.

As I said, Cabinet met again tonight to receive an update and make some initial decisions around the government's response and support for Canterbury.

One step I've taken as Minister of Finance is **to sign a special approval for emergency spending under the Public Finance Act**. This will enable government agencies to spend extra money as necessary which is not covered by existing appropriations. 

At 11am tomorrow it's our intention to provide an all party briefing to MPs.

Cabinet will meet again tomorrow morning at 9.30am and on Thursday the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Committee will meet again. Its chair the Minister for Earthquake Recovery Gerry Brownlee has cut short a trip to the Middle East and is due back in New Zealand tomorrow night.

In terms of an update on the factual situation on the ground:

- Currently 350 military personnel deployed in Christchurch providing first aid, security and search and rescue. A further 250 are preparing to relieve them.
- Temporary shelters have been set up at Hagley Park, Burnside High School, Addington Raceway. Hagley Park is already at its capacity so if people need emergency shelter we would encourage them to go to one of the other options.
- Christchurch Hospital is operational. An emergency operations centre has been set up at Princess Margaret Hospital. Other South Island hospitals have cleared capacity in anticipation of casualties from Christchurch. In addition, Defence Force personnel are providing medical assistance around the city. Medical staff are being brought in from around New Zealand to assist.
- All schools in the greater Christchurch area will be closed until further notice so damage can be assessed.
- The Air Force is providing transport for the emergency response, one Hercules and one Boeing are in Christchurch and a further Hercules and a Boeing are available.
- Three Navy ships are currently in Lyttelton Harbour, including the HMNZS Canterbury, which is carrying military vehicles and a fourth ship is on its way from Oamaru.
- 100 Singaporean Army engineers are in Christchurch and on standby.
- WINZ has now set up a Govt helpline, the number is **0800 779 997.**
- Phone networks are still suffering from overloading, so I continue to encourage people to text, and only call if absolutely necessary.
- The airport remains closed as damage assessments are completed but we are hopeful it will be able to open tomorrow morning. A final assessment will be made early tomorrow morning.
- There are reports of major damage to roads in the city as well as liquefaction and flooding. Emergency services have asked that people only drive if essential, to prevent the roads becoming gridlocked and emergency services being delayed.
