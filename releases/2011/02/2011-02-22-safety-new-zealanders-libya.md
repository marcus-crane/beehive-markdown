Foreign Minister Murray McCully today says the situation in Libya is of grave concern as political unrest and violence escalates.

"New Zealand supports the right of the Libyan people to peacefully protest and seek greater democratic freedoms. We are receiving reports of the military using heavy weapons and aerial bombardment against protesters. This is deeply disturbing and unacceptable. We call on the government to refrain immediately from the excessive use of force," says Mr McCully.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has now elevated its travel advice to 'extreme risk'. This means New Zealanders should not travel to Libya for any reason and New Zealanders in Libya should leave if it is safe to do so.

"New Zealanders wanting to leave Libya are doing so via commercial flights, and currently this is the most straightforward option. We understand Tripoli airport is open but chaotic," Mr McCully says.

There are currently 25 New Zealanders registered with MFAT as being in Libya.

"In addition to providing assistance to New Zealanders in Libya, we are in discussion with other governments regarding plans to evacuate foreign nationals should this be required.

"The general situation in the Middle East and North Africa remains unstable. We are closely monitoring the situation and all travel advice is under constant review," Mr McCully says.

New Zealanders in, or travelling to, the Middle East or North Africa are encouraged to register their details on the Safetravel website: [www.safetravel.govt.nz](http://www.safetravel.govt.nz)

New Zealanders currently in the region are being advised to:

- avoid all areas where protests and demonstrations may occur as they have the potential to turn violent,
- monitor developments through local media,
- maintain a high level of security awareness in public places and
- adhere to all instructions issued by local authorities.

All New Zealanders travelling overseas should have comprehensive medical and travel insurance policies in place.
