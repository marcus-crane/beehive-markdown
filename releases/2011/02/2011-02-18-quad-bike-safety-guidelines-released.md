New safety guidelines have been released for farmers, their employees and contractors today outlining steps they can take to manage the hazards of quad bikes to avoid injury or death, Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson announced today.

On average 850 people are injured each year riding quad bikes on farms. Five die.

The Guidelines for the Safe Use of Quad Bikes on Farms support the Department of Labour’s Harm Reduction campaign, which aims to reduce the unacceptably high rate of farm accidents involving quad bikes. It is focused on four basic safety steps:

• Wear a helmet

• Ensure riders are trained and experienced

• Choose the right vehicle for the job

• Don’t let kids ride adult quad bikes

Ms Wilkinson says the guidelines provide practical advice about how to stay safe when using a quad bike for work.

“They are very clear about what the Department expects of employers and others who have duties under the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992. Farms are workplaces and farmers have a duty under the Act to keep their workers safe.

“While not law, the guidelines may be used by the Courts to help decide whether or not someone has failed to comply with any provision of the HSE Act.

“If farmers follow the guidelines it is likely they will be able to show that they are doing everything reasonably possible to keep people on their farms safe around quad bikes. Ignoring the guidelines isn't an option.”

The guidelines have been produced in consultation with the agriculture industry and are not only relevant to farmers, but to people involved in forestry activity on farm land, and to the horticulture and viticulture industries.
