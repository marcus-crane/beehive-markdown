Education Minister Anne Tolley has officially launched the Wellington Trades Academy, which will offer vocational trades and technology training to at least 60 students as part of the Government’s Youth Guarantee.

Thirty Wellington schools will work in partnership with the Wellington Institute of Technology and employers to enable students to earn NCEA credits and a tertiary qualification, while gaining practical skills in the workplace.

Trades training will be available in mechanical engineering, construction, plumbing and gasfitting, automotive technology, creative technologies and hospitality.

“This exciting new venture means 16 and 17 year olds who were at risk of dropping out of education will now have the opportunity to earn a qualification while learning practical skills,” says Mrs Tolley.

“They will be better prepared to enter the workplace, take up apprenticeships or go on to further study - so employers and the economy will also benefit.

“I’ve been hugely impressed by the young people at WelTec and their great desire to succeed through their involvement in a Trades Academy.

“WelTec has worked hard to be at the forefront of this innovative approach, with eight Trades Academies opening across New Zealand this year as we give more young people the opportunity to reach their potential, with smoother pathways to employment.”

Over seven hundred students will attend Trades Academies in the year ahead, free of charge, as part of the wider Youth Guarantee, which is aimed at 16 and 17 year olds who are at risk of disengaging from education and skills training.

“We will continue to focus on making the education system more flexible so that it meets the needs of students,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Trades Academies will make a real difference for those young people who are better motivated in a setting outside school.”
