New Zealand’s first-rate marine sector has received another endorsement with confirmation the next class of America’s Cup catamarans will be built in Auckland, says Associate Tourism Minister Jonathan Coleman.

Dr Coleman, at today’s launch of the new AC45 catamaran in Auckland, says the awarding of the contract by America’s Cup management to Warkworth boat builders Core Builders Composites reinforces the marine industry’s world-class reputation.

The AC45 catamarans will be used in the America’s Cup World Series starting later this year.

‘’The contract to build up to 10 catamarans is another accolade for the New Zealand marine industry. It boasts some of the best designers and technicians in the game and the technology is cutting edge.

‘’It has many benefits for our economy, from both an economic development and tourism perspective. The New Zealand marine industry is worth around $1.7 billion and employs over 10,000 people. The sector is aiming to grow to $2.6 billion by 2015 and this contract will help attract further business.

‘’The Government is also playing its part in the marine sector. New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE) has supported the industry at all the major yacht shows internationally and provided support to the industry body and individual industry members in improving capability, productivity and marketing amongst firms.

‘’The Northland region also obtained $2 million through NZTE’s Major Regional Initiative fund, to develop their industry.

‘’Over the past three decades the America’s Cup has helped put New Zealand on the international stage. It generated greater awareness of New Zealand as a tourism destination and a place to do business and today’s launch consolidates the reputation of the New Zealand marine sector.’’

The America’s World Series is the preliminary racing series for the America’s Cup in San Francisco in 2013.
