Over January 6,119 New Zealanders left the benefit because they found work says Social Development and Employment Minister Paula Bennett.

“Every one of those people who put themselves out there in a tough labour market and got themselves a job, deserves recognition,” says Ms Bennett.

In January 3,782 Unemployment Beneficiaries went off welfare into work.

There were 1,849 Maori, 354 Pacific Islanders and 1,943 young people who cancelled benefits because they found jobs in January.

However the number of people on all benefits rose by 0.4% to 354,058.

The number of people on the Unemployment Benefit in January was 68,087, an increase of 1,003.

“The numbers may not be as we’d like, but it is an honest picture. What this Government will not do, is simply transfer people from benefit to benefit to hide the figures,” says Ms Bennett.

By the end of January more than 9,000 young people had gone into a Job Ops position and around 4,500 into Community Max.

“These recessionary measures have been invaluable, providing young people with the skills and experience to remain in work,” says Ms Bennett.

Of those who have completed Job Ops, 90% have not gone back on a benefit and 68% of Community Max ‘graduates’ have stayed off welfare.

“We’d all like to see fewer New Zealanders relying on welfare, that will happen as the economy slowly recovers, but it’s a long haul,” says Ms Bennett.
