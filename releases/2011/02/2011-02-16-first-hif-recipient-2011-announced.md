Auckland based social housing provider, Community of Refuge Trust (CORT) has received $1 million of the $20 million set aside in the last budget for HIF funding.

The HIF was set up to foster collaboration between Government and community organisations to provide more housing for New Zealanders on low to moderate incomes, or with special housing needs.

Mr Heatley says CORT will be matching the $1 million in funding it gets from the HIF, with $1 million of its own money to provide ten one-bedroom affordable rental homes in the Tamaki area.  

CORT will build eight new homes and buy two existing properties for people who experience mental illness.

"HIF awards are focused on housing providers who can match Government funding with their own money. CORT have done this and consequently increased the supply of affordable rental housing in an area of high demand," says Mr Heatley.

"The recommendations of the Housing Shareholders Advisory Group (HSAG) were very clear. The Government needs to work in partnership with others to grow the supply of social housing in New Zealand so together we can help more people," he said.

Currently 16 further projects, including four Maori Demonstration Partnership funded projects, are being developed into funding proposals. The CORT project is the first to be approved from the 2010/2011 funding round. It is expected that the remaining 16 projects will be presented for approval by June this year.
