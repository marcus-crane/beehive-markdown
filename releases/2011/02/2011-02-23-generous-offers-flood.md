New Zealanders are showing incredible generosity towards the people of Christchurch says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

“Many ordinary New Zealanders are also offering to help with accommodation and other support which is much appreciated,” says Ms Bennett.

“Growers from around the country are offering fresh food donations, church groups are donating goods to those in need and Food and Grocery Council members are also working to get donated food to the people of Christchurch,” says Ms Bennett.

All offers of help can be emailed to [earthquakehelp@msd.govt.nz](mailto:earthquakehelp@msd.govt.nz)  which is a central co-ordination point.

The Government helpline is 0800 779997 and that should be used for those people who are in need of assistance.
