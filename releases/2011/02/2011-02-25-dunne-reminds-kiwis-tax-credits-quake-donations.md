Revenue Minister Peter Dunne today reminded New Zealanders that all Christchurch earthquake cash donations over $5 by individuals through approved donee organisations can gain a tax credit, and will be tax deductible when made by companies.

“This is worth being aware of at a time when New Zealanders are giving generously to the people of Christchurch in their hour of need,” Mr Dunne said.

A full list of approved donee organisations can be found at [www.ird.govt.nz/donee-organisations/](http://www.ird.govt.nz/donee-organisations/)

Mr Dunne said that it was also gratifying to see that Australia, as well as supplying invaluable assistance in the actual rescue and recovery operations in Christchurch, has recognised the disaster for donation tax purposes for Australian taxpayers.

“There has been a tremendous amount of support flowing between our two countries in what has been a string of natural disasters on both sides of the Tasman in recent months.

“The help and heart that has gone both ways has indicated how strong the bonds that tie us are, and further strengthened them.

“It is very gratifying to see that the Australian Government has ensured that Australian taxpayers will now be able to claim an income tax deduction for donations to the relief effort in Christchurch,” he said.
