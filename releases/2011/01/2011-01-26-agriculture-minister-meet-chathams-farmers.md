Agriculture Minister David Carter says a broad range of discussion is likely when he meets with Chatham Islands farmers over the next two days.

Mr Carter, Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson and Rangitata MP Jo Goodhew leave today to visit several farms and meet with Federated Farmers, local government representatives and local farmers.

"The islands’ economy is fishing and farming based so there will be plenty to talk about. This will be the first time most Chathams farmers have had the chance to chat about issues with a visiting Agriculture Minister," says Mr Carter.

"With large numbers of livestock exported, shipping is likely to be high on the agenda along with unique challenges that the islands’ sheep and beef farmers face.

"I spend a lot of time travelling the New Zealand mainland to meet with farmers so I welcome this chance to talk to our most isolated primary producers," Mr Carter says.
