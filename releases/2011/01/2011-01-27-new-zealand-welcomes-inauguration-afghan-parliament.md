Foreign Minister Murray McCully has welcomed the understanding reached between the Office of the President and the Afghan Parliament which paved the way for the successful inauguration of the National Assembly of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, 26 January 2011.

“The resumption of the Parliament's important functions in the democratic governance of Afghanistan is a critical step and the New Zealand Government looks forward to working with the Parliament, Afghan authorities and the international community in the months ahead," says Mr McCully.

He commended the spirit of cooperation between the Afghan institutions which is a positive sign of a progressing democracy, and offered encouragement as the executive, legislature and judiciary carry out their respective functions, in accordance with the Afghan Constitution.

New Zealand’s Ambassador to Afghanistan Neville Reilly attended the inauguration ceremony, along with other members of the international community.
