Youth Affairs Minister Paula Bennett and Prime Minister John Key joined 100 young people and their families today to recognise efforts to make positive life changes.

“Some of these young people have been on the edge of trouble, while others have experienced things many adults would find difficult to cope with,” says Ms Bennett.

“But they’ve all decided to forge a brighter future for themselves and we’re recognising that through the Prime Minister’s Youth Programme,” says Ms Bennett.

This week the 100 strong group of 14 to 17 year olds took part in more than 43 activities run by five groups around Auckland, Wellington and Rotorua.

Activities included, climbing the Auckland Harbour Bridge, training with the Warriors and a make-over session with New Zealand’s Next Top Model host Sara Tetro.

Other celebrity mentors involved with the programme included Oliver Driver, Elemeno P, Eroni Clarke and winner of the 2010 New Zealand’s Next Top Model Danielle Hayes.

The PM’s Youth Programme was launched in 2010 and costs $50,000 a year.

So far, 87 per cent of last year’s participants have stayed on the right track. Police in West and South Auckland report contact with only 12 of the 92 past participants.

“Often all it takes is a few steps in the right direction to help a young person make a life lasting change for the better,” says Ms Bennett.

“This programme is an extension of that idea, plus we just think these young people should know we’re proud of them”, says Ms Bennett.
