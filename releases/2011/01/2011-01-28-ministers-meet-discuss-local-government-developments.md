Minister of Local Government Rodney Hide today met with Australia’s Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government Hon Simon Crean to discuss developments in local government both in New Zealand and Australia. 

"Minister Crean was very interested in my work on Auckland Governance and also in what may happen in relation to the structure of local government in the rest of New Zealand," Mr Hide said.

"He was also interested in how central government and local government work together on regional development issues, and we discussed the work that is being done on the Government's input to the Auckland Spatial Plan.

"I was also pleased to have the opportunity to be able to express my gratitude to the Australian Government for the support it showed during the Pike River mine tragedy, which was like a neighbour coming over to help when something tragic happens in your family.

"New Zealand and Australia share a close relationship, which extends to local government.  Meeting with Minister Crean today was a great opportunity for us both to share initiatives and ideas in the area of local government,” Mr Hide said.
