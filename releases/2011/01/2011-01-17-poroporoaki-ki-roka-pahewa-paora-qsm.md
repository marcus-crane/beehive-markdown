E hū rā Whakaari, e tau te kohu o te pōuri ki runga i ō iwi, mai i Tikirau ki ngā Kurī a Whārei, e tangi ana ki a Roka Paora e tīraha ana ki Te Kaha nui a Tiki.

E Te Whānau a Apanui, kua roa te kuia nei e kōrero ana mō koutou,

mai i tōna akoranga i ngā kōrero a Hoani Waititi mō Tamahae rāua ko Rewi, ki āna pukapuka ako i ngā kōrero paki o e wā kāinga, tae noa ki tōna whakapapa i ō koutou tīpuna ki te pukapuka ipurangi ki Te Ara.

Ināianei, mā koutou e kōrero mōna e takoto nei,

mō tōna kaingākau ki te reo o ōna tīpuna,

mo tōna pūmau ki ngā tikanga tuku iho o Te Whānau a Apanui,

mō tōna kaha ki te whakanui i tōna iwi Māori ki ngā iwi o te ao!

E te whaea, e te tohunga kairangi, moe mai rā, moe mai rā, moe mai rā!

Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples joins Te Whanau a Apanui and the many family and friends of Dr Roka Pahewa Paora in mouning her passing.

“Roka Paora was a stalwart of Te Whanau a Apanui tikanga, and a staunch advocate of te reo Maori and education all her adult life,” said Dr Sharples.

“Starting as a teacher in the 1960s, Dr Paora helped Hoani Waititi and others launch the modern renaissance of Maori language in education.

“She was one of the original judges for Te Matatini, the national kapa haka festival which has driven a resurgence in contemporary Maori performing arts.

“She was a prolific writer of classroom resources, a contributor to curricula, an adviser, assessor and examiner in Maori language and tikanga, and editor of two Maori language dictionaries, among many other achievements.

“Last year Mrs Paora was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by Waikato University, in recognition of her outstanding contribution to Maori education.

“Dr Paora was one of the generation of kaumatua, raised among their iwi and speaking Maori as a first language, whose rigour and discipline have helped to maintain the integrity of te reo Maori through its incredible revival of recent years. Her death is a sad loss, but we can all be grateful for her life’s work,” said Dr Sharples.
