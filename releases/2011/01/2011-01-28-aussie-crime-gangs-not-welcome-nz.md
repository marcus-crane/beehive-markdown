Efforts by Australian crime gangs to establish themselves in New Zealand will meet with stiff resistance from Police and the Organised and Financial Crime Agency (OFCANZ), Police Minister Judith Collins said today.

The Rebels MC, Australia’s largest outlaw motorcycle gang with a reported 2000 members, has been looking to expand into New Zealand. The Australian Government considers them a criminal organisation.

New Zealand Police say the gang is involved in serious violence, and the manufacture and trafficking of drugs.

“A very clear message needs to be sent to crime gangs from Australia and elsewhere that they are not welcome in New Zealand,” Ms Collins said.

“Efforts by these gangs to set up shop and begin their criminal activities in New Zealand will meet with a very firm response from Police and OFCANZ who will work with other government agencies.

“Efforts by this Australian gang to gain a foothold on this side of the Tasman underline how crime gangs are now big businesses with connections all around the world.

“It also underlines the importance of the Government’s tough stance on gangs. The Government has given Police new powers to intercept gang communications, dismantle gang fortresses and seize property from criminals.

“Police and OFCANZ have my full support to take whatever steps are necessary under the law to ensure that overseas crime gangs are made to feel as unwelcome as possible.”
