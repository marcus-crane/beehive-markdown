Health Minister Tony Ryall has announced that Emergency Ambulance Call Centres, which take 111 calls are to get extra funding to provide an advanced level of support for over-the-phone triage of emergency calls.

The Government is investing another $700,000 into the ambulance call centres to provide additional clinical advice to call takers and dispatch staff to determine which resources are most appropriate to send to an emergency.

“The result is greater patient safety, and real time clinical support for call takers, dispatchers and on road ambulance personnel.

“The Government is always looking for opportunities to improve essential services. An independent assessment identified the need for more clinical expertise in the call centres," Mr Ryall said.

Staff in this new clinical role will also be able to provide additional assistance, support and mentoring to the call takers.
