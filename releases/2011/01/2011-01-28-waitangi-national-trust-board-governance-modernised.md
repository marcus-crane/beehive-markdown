The governance structure of the Waitangi National Trust Board will be modernised to reflect the cultural and historical importance of the Treaty grounds at Waitangi, Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson and Waitangi National Trust Board Chair Pita Paraone announced today.

The Board was set up in 1932 by Lord and Lady Bledisloe, when they gifted to the people of New Zealand the 506 hectare Waitangi estate which includes the Treaty grounds. Lord Bledisloe was Governor-General at the time.

The Board includes representatives of the families of some of our most significant historical figures such as Hone Heke, Maihi Kawiti, Tāmati Waka Nene, Pomare, James Busby, Archdeacon Henry Williams, and Edward Gibbon Wakefield.

In recognition of the national significance of the Treaty, the grounds and the Trust Board, the Governor-General will become the Honorary Patron, and it is proposed that having two Members of Parliament on the Board would help it to maintain strong links with the elected representatives of New Zealanders.

A Crown Representatives Group will also be established comprising the Prime Minister, the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage and the Minister of Māori Affairs.

The Crown Representatives will not be formal members of the Trust Board but will be a conduit for the exchange of information between the government and the Board in relation to the Board’s activities at Waitangi.

In 1932 the Bledisloes also vested the 550 hectare Waitangi Endowment Forest adjacent to the Waitangi estate in the Crown, which holds it in trust on behalf of the nation. The Bledisloes intended that commercial forestry would provide the Trust Board with an income. The Crown will investigate with the Trust Board whether this intent would be better met by transferring ownership of the forest land to the Trust Board, and will discuss this proposal with local Māori groups before any decisions relating to the land are made.

“Waitangi is the birthplace of this nation,” Mr Finlayson said. “It is fitting that its important heritage status is acknowledged with Arts, Culture and Heritage Ministerial involvement, and that the Trust Board and Crown’s relationship changes to meet the demands of the modern era.”

Trust Board chair Pita Paraone, who also represents the Hone Heke, Maihi Kawiti, Tāmati Waka Nene and Pomare families, said the Board fully supported the changes.

“What these changes do is reinforce Waitangi’s place in our nation’s history,” Mr Paraone said. “The Trust is self funded and maintains this national icon without cost to the people of New Zealand. The changes have the potential to strengthen the financial viability and governance structure of the Trust which will enable us to increasingly place Waitangi, its history and significance, at the heart of being a New Zealander and as an essential experience for overseas visitors.”

The Waitangi National Trust Board Act will be amended to give effect to the changes.
