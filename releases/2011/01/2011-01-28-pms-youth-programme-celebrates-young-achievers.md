Prime Minister John Key today joined in celebrations for the 100 participants in the Prime Minister’s Youth Programme – young people who have made a concerted effort to turn their lives around.

The group of 14- to 17-year-olds were chosen to take part in the week-long programme as a reward for making positive, life-changing choices.

Youth Affairs Minister Paula Bennett also attended the final day of the programme at Waitakere’s Trusts Stadium.

“I’m really proud of the young people who have seized the opportunity to take part in this year’s programme. These are young New Zealanders who have faced challenges, or tough decisions, and have decided to take responsibility for their futures,” says Mr Key.

The participants were nominated by community leaders, including school teachers and youth aid officers, after improving academic performance, or by moving away from anti-social behaviour such as truancy or low-level offending.

“It’s not easy for anyone, of any age, to overcome obstacles. The fact these young people have made choices to overcome those obstacles says a lot about their gutsiness and determination to succeed,” says Mr Key.

This is the second year the programme has been operating, which sees the participants engaging in a number of activities, including mentoring from sports stars and local celebrities.

Participants will benefit from follow-up mentoring for up to three months after the programme winds up this week.
