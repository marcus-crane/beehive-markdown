Associate Tourism Minister Jonathan Coleman has welcomed confirmation China’s biggest carrier will bypass Melbourne and fly a direct Guangzhou- Auckland route.

China Southern Airlines announced last month it was running a three-times-a week service via Melbourne from April this year, but today confirmed it will bypass the Victorian state capital creating a direct route to Auckland.

‘’For the tourism sector it’s an invaluable tool to help grow the rising number of Chinese visitors,’’ Dr Coleman says.

‘’Chinese tourists contribute around $365 million a year to our economy. It’s one of our top five markets for international travellers and it grew by nearly 11 percent last year with 116,000 people visiting New Zealand. Having a direct route from Southern China will help grow that market and increasing tourism is a vital lever in helping to grow our economy.’’

Dr Coleman says the Government actively supported the tourism sector to help promote New Zealand and provided an additional $30 million in Budget 2010 for tourism. This followed an extra $20 million for Tourism New Zealand in 2009.
