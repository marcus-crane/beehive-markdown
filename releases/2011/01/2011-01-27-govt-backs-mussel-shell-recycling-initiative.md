Environment Minister Nick Smith today announced a new initiative to recycle mussel shells in the Nelson-Marlborough region thanks to a Government grant of $200,000 from the Waste Minimisation Fund.

“This initiative to convert 27,000 tonnes of mussel shells into organic feedstock and fertilisers will create jobs and wealth as well as reduce waste going to landfill,” Dr Smith said.

“Environment Sustaining Products Ltd is proposing to build a mussel shell processing plant in the region that will employ approximately six people and convert the waste into high-quality calcium products. Their ambition is to secure a site in coming months and have a plant operating later this year.

“Every time I drive through Havelock and see that huge pile of mussel shell waste I think someone must be able to come up with an economic use for it. I’m delighted Environment Sustaining Products has taken this initiative and that the Government is helping to get the business started.”

The $200,000 grant is from the Waste Minimisation Fund established in 2009 to try and reduce the amount of waste going to landfill. It is one of dozens of grants made by an independent assessment panel under a criteria set by the Minister for the Environment to assist new recycling businesses.

“This grant reflects the Government’s focus of backing smart, new economically viable recycling businesses. It is another practical example of the Government’s Bluegreen approach of encouraging initiatives that have both economic and environmental benefits,” Dr Smith said.
