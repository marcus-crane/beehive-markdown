Commerce Minister Simon Power today announced the appointment of Denise Bowen as a member of the Governing Board of the Joint Accreditation System of Australia and New Zealand (JAS-ANZ).

JAS-ANZ is responsible for overseeing a joint accreditation system that ensures safety and quality, and underpins environmental management schemes. As a trans-Tasman organisation, JAS-ANZ strengthens trade between New Zealand and Australia and other countries.

“Ms Bowen’s extensive experience of working with businesses will help JAS-ANZ encourage wider stakeholder uptake of their services,” Mr Power said.

“In particular, she brings a strong customer focus, due to actively promoting the value of accreditation and certification. Her direct experience in seeking certification to various ISO standards will be valuable to the JAS-ANZ board.”

Ms Bowen will take over from current member Howard Duff on 10 May.

Mr Power thanked Mr Duff for his contribution to the board since 2005.
