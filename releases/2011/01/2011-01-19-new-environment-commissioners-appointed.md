Anne Leijnen has been appointed as an Environment Commissioner and Carron Blom has been appointed as a Deputy Environment Commissioner, Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson announced today.

Ms Leijnen is a resource management consultant and has been a sole practitioner since 1992. She has been involved in facilities planning for the America’s Cup, iwi consultation and relationship management, and developments including the Auckland Vector Arena and CBD design.

Ms Blom’s career developed at the interface between engineering and environmental science. She is currently the Managing Director of Anguillid Consulting Engineers and Scientists, an environmental strategy company she founded.

The Environment Court is constituted in accordance with sections 250 and 254 of the Resource Management Act 1991.

The Environment Court consists of Environment Judges and Environment Commissioners. The Act also provides for the appointment of Alternate Environment Judges and Deputy Environment Commissioners to provide back up for Judges and Commissioners.

The Environment Court considers applications and appeals made under the RMA and has wide ranging jurisdiction under the Act. It also has jurisdiction, less frequently invoked, under the Local Government Act 1974 (road stopping objections), the Public Works Act 1981 (land taking objections), the Historic Places Act 1993 (archaeological sites), the Forests Act 1949 (beech tree felling) and the Transit New Zealand Act 1989 (vehicle access to state highways).

Ms Leinen and Ms Blom have each been appointed for terms of five years.
