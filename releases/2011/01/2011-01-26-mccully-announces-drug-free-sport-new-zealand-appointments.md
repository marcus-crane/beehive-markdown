Sport and Recreation Minister, Murray McCully, today announces the appointment of Michael Heron and Stephen Cottrell to the Drug Free Sport New Zealand board (DFSNZ).

Auckland lawyer Michael Heron is the new Chair of the DFSNZ board taking over from Dr David Gerrard CNZM who has retired after 11 years on the board. Michael Heron is a partner in national legal firm Russell McVeagh, and has considerable experience in sporting legal issues. He has been a member of the DFSNZ board since 2004.

New board appointment, Stephen Cottrell is former General Counsel of the New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU). Mr Cottrell continues to provide strategic advice to the NZRU as well as heading the sports law practice of national law firm Minter Ellison Rudd Watts. Mr Cottrell is a former Wellington and Otago rugby representative. He was also captain of the Cambridge University Rugby team while completing masters’ degrees in law and criminology in England.

Mr McCully thanked departing Chair, Dr David Gerrard for his long-serving commitment to DFSNZ.

“Dr Gerrard’s sporting achievements as a Commonwealth gold medallist and later administrative involvement with seven Olympic and Commonwealth games teams, as an athlete, manager, team doctor and later chef de mission, have brought a wealth of experience to his DFSNZ role,” says Mr McCully.

Two board members have been reappointed to the board; orthopaedic surgeon Stewart Walsh and Christchurch sports medicine specialist Dr Lesley Rumball ONZM.
