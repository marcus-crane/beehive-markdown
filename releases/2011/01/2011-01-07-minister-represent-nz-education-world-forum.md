Education Minister Anne Tolley will travel to London for the Education World Forum 2011 and the British Education Training and Technology (BETT) expo.

Mrs Tolley will attend the Education World Forum 2011 on 10-12 January and the BETT expo on 12-15 January.

She is a keynote speaker at the Forum and will present flagship New Zealand initiatives such as the Youth Guarantee, Trades Academies and National Standards.

“This international ministerial Forum is a chance to discuss future strategies in education and it gives me the chance to meet ministers of education from around the world,” says Mrs Tolley.

“I will also have the opportunity to meet with representatives from the OECD and have arranged for private meetings with some of the lead speakers at the Forum.”

Last year, more than 70 ministers of education attended the Forum, which is being held for the seventh time.

“While in London, I will also take the opportunity to attend the BETT expo. It is an exhibition of information technology used in education and is the largest such event in the world,” says Mrs Tolley.

In addition to the Forum and the BETT expo, Mrs Tolley will also visit the London Grid for Learning to see first-hand the effective use of the ICT resources and services.

“I will also visit a number of schools which work with the London Grid for Learning.”
