Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully has expressed his sincere condolences to the people of Russia on the terrible bomb attack at Domodedovo airport in Moscow yesterday that resulted in serious injuries and tragic loss of life.

Prime Minister John Key will be writing to Russia’s President Medvedev to express condolences on behalf of the government and people of New Zealand at this tragic event.

“It is of great concern that the tragedy appears to have been instigated by terrorist elements,” Mr McCully said.

“The consequences of incidents such as these are far reaching, and are never easy to come to terms with for both citizens and governments alike.”

The New Zealand Embassy in Moscow has been contacting New Zealanders registered with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade as being in Moscow and there are currently no reports of New Zealanders caught up in the blast.
