Minister of Foreign Affairs Murray McCully is advising New Zealanders not to travel to Egypt, and those already there to leave if safe to do so, as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today upgraded its travel advisory to the highest possible category of alert for intending travellers.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is doing what it can to assist those in Egypt to facilitate their departures.

“I spoke to our Ambassador to Egypt Rene Wilson last night who informed me that our embassy is currently closed due to security concerns and embassy staff are operating from the Ambassador’s residence making contact with New Zealanders in the country despite difficulties.

“I urge New Zealanders in Egypt to register their details with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade safetravel website,” said Mr McCully.

Mr McCully expressed his deep concern about the ongoing violence in Egypt and stressed the need for peaceful reform in that country.

“Egypt is at the centre of the Arab world and has long been a force of moderation and leadership in promoting regional peace. Now that same sense of moderation needs to be shown on the streets of Cairo by all parties.

“There is obviously a strong wish among the Egyptian people for a more broadly based government and for greater freedoms and improved economic conditions and this desire needs to be respected by Egypt’s leaders,” said Mr McCully.
