The New Zealand Government has decided to donate NZ$4 million to assist people affected by the devastating floods in Australia, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"Australians are our closest friends and neighbours and we have a history of reciprocal support during natural disasters. We want to help them as much as we can in their time of need,” says Mr McCully.

$3 million of the government's contribution will go to the Queensland Premier’s Flood Relief Fund, and $1 million will go to the Red Cross Victorian Floods Appeal 2011 launched by the Australian Red Cross in partnership with the Victorian Government.

Mr McCully said he was very pleased with the arrangements now completed by the Australian Government to provide for New Zealanders caught up in the floods that are not eligible for the Australian Government Disaster Relief Payment (AGDRP) due to 2001 changes to Australian legislation.

“The ex-gratia payment available to New Zealanders on the same terms as the AGDRP is an excellent outcome and I am grateful for the positive way in which the Australian government has dealt with this issue,” says Mr McCully.

Full details and claim forms are now available on the Australian Government’s Centrelink website.

"The loss of life and property from the flooding is devastating. Whole communities have been inundated. We extend our support to those families, communities and response teams involved in the massive recovery effort.

"New Zealand’s donation will support those people whose lives have been most affected by this disaster and follows the practical support provided by the 15-strong Civil Defence team during the immediate disaster response period in Queensland,” Mr McCully said.
