Trade Minister Tim Groser departs today for Davos, Switzerland to attend an annual meeting of Trade Ministers from member countries of the World Trade Organisation.

The meeting will take place on 29 January, at the same time as the World Economic Forum, and will address remaining obstacles to the conclusion of the WTO Doha Development Round of international trade talks.

“A successful conclusion of these negotiations would give a welcome boost to international trade as the global economy recovers from recession,” Mr Groser said.

“Few countries have more to gain from these negotiations than does New Zealand. It is important that New Zealand continues to be involved at the core of these negotiations and that we contribute with others to bring Doha to a conclusion.”

Around 20 of the WTO’s 153 members are expected to be represented at the meeting. There will also be opportunities for Mr Groser to meet with individual Ministers in order to advance New Zealand’s agenda of free trade agreements.
