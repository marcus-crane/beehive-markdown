Finance Minister Bill English has paid tribute to distinguished businessman Sir Richard Carter, who died last week.

“Sir Richard was one of New Zealand’s most highly respected business leaders and I was saddened to hear of his death,” Mr English says.

“He made a significant contribution to New Zealand business and the flow of tributes in recent days confirms the high regard in which he was held by colleagues.”

Sir Richard was the third generation of a family sawmilling and forestry dynasty. In 1985, he created Carter Holt Harvey – then New Zealand’s fourth largest company.

He was knighted for services to business in 1992; was inducted into the Fairfax New Zealand Business Hall of Fame in 2002; and was named a distinguished fellow by the New Zealand Institute of Directors in 2005 – its highest honour.

“Sir Richard will be sadly missed by those who knew and worked with him and I would like to pass on my sincere condolences to his family,” Mr English says.
