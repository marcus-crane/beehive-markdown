$2 million a year from ACC levies is to be invested in improved motorcycle safety initiatives from a newly formed Advisory Council led by Dr Gareth Morgan, ACC Minister Nick Smith announced today.

“This new initiative is about the Government working with motorcyclists to improve safety, save lives and reduce the costs of accidents,” Dr Smith said.

The Motorcycle Safety Levy Advisory Council members appointed are:

- Gareth Morgan, Chairperson
- Paul Searancke, Deputy Chairperson (Commissioner: Recreation/Leisure of Motorcycling New Zealand)
- Peter McIntosh (President Ulysses Club of NZ Inc)
- Yvonne Forrest (Representative of Women’s International Motorcycle Association)
- Bill Grice (former Chairman of the Motor Industry Association Motorcycle Division)
- Brent Hutchison (President of Wellington branch of Bikers Rights Organisation of NZ)
- Jess Corbett (Representative of Scoot NZ and the NZ Classic Scooter Club)

The Council, which has its inaugural meeting today with Dr Smith, is to be supported by Police, Ministry of Transport and ACC staff and funded from the $30 per year Motorcycle Safety Levy.  All levy funds are dedicated to programmes and projects with administrative costs being met by ACC.

It follows the announcement by Transport Minister Steven Joyce in September last year that the Government is moving to tackle the growing issue of motorcycle and moped safety, including strengthening license tests. 

“We need Government agencies and motorcycle organisations working together to reverse the ugly and deadly trend over the past decade in motorcycle accidents,” Dr Smith said.

Recent statistics include:

- 50 New Zealanders died in motorcycle accidents in 2010, up from 30 in 2000
- 66% increase in motorcycle road toll compares to 24% decrease in overall road toll since 2000
- Motorcyclists make up 3% of registered vehicles but 13% of fatalities
- ACC motorcycle claims have risen from 1072 in 2000 to 4110 in 2010

“Motorcycling is an efficient means of transportation and a popular recreational pursuit but a fatality a week is unacceptable. Motorcyclists are going to need to be more safety conscious, but other road users and road designers are also going to have to change to reduce the motorcycle road toll,” Dr Smith said.

“This initiative is based on international best practise, particularly Victoria, Australia where motorcycle fatalities and serious injuries have reduced by 20% since 2002 when the state government there introduced a specific motorcycle safety levy programme and Council.  If we could achieve likewise, it would save 10 motorcycle fatalities per year.

“I visited the Victoria programme last year with New Zealand motorcycle organisations and learned how investments in motorcycle training, road design improvements, signage and general road user education have made a real difference to safety.

“I want to acknowledge and thank the motorcycle clubs for their constructive engagement in getting the Council established.  Dr Gareth Morgan brings strong economic and management expertise as well as a passion for recreational motorcycling and I thank him for taking on the role as Chair. The goal has to be to maximise the safety gains from this $2 million a year investment.”
