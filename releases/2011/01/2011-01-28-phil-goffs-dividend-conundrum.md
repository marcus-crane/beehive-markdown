Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee says Labour leader Phil Goff’s violent reaction to mixed ownership of State Owned Enterprises has left him promoting a position he recently described as a mistake that drove Labour from office.

“In October 2009 Mr Goff told the Labour Party conference the dividends his government took from the three electricity SOEs, which he called ‘excessive,’ were partly responsible for Labour losing the 2008 election,” Mr Brownlee said.

Asked following his speech why Labour didn’t do anything about soaring power bills while it was in office – bills which rose 72 per cent against inflation of 28 per cent – Mr Goff responded that taking $3.1 billion in dividends from electricity SOEs was “one of the things we got wrong.”

Mr Goff went on to say: “Power bills rose relentlessly and we didn’t fix the system.”

“Phil Goff publicly pledged that Labour would reject big dividends from the electricity SOEs if it got into power,” Mr Brownlee said.

“But on Radio New Zealand this morning – arguing against mixed ownership of those SOEs – he said the $700 million dividends the companies delivered to the Crown last year was now one of the reasons for rejecting any share sales.”

Mr Goff said: "Why would we sell off something that, you know, the power companies for example, is returning $700 million a year to New Zealanders."

“The Labour leader can’t have it both ways,” Mr Brownlee said.

“First the dividends are bad, now they’re good.

“Everyone’s been asking where Labour would find the missing $1.3 billion needed to pay for Phil Goff’s half-baked tax-free zone – it would seem the answer, just like before, is from people’s power bills.”

Mr Brownlee said National stood by its record on electricity reform. Between November 2008 and November 2010 electricity prices have risen just 1.1 per cent in real terms (excluding climate change imposts and GST).

“The National government has delivered the most comprehensive electricity sector reforms in nearly two decades, which are already delivering a more competitive, responsive and responsible electricity sector for the long-term benefit of New Zealand consumers,” Mr Brownlee said.
