Finance Minister Bill English, Economic Development Minister Gerry Brownlee and Environment Minister Nick Smith today announced the establishment of an Advisory Group on Green Growth in enabling New Zealand to grow the economy while enhancing our clean, green brand.

“This new initiative is another part of the Government's plan to build a faster growing economy," Mr English said, announcing the advisory group at the National Party’s Bluegreens forum in Akaroa. 

"We are keen to help businesses – particularly our export industries - leverage New Zealand's clean, green brand, explore and develop new clean technology and move towards a lower carbon-economy.” 

Mr Brownlee and Dr Smith said it was important the Government received the best advice on green growth initiatives and that is why an advisory group had been established.

“This group will look at how we add value to our export industry, ensure smarter uses of technology and innovation – including cleantech – and assist small and medium-sized businesses to become more energy efficient,” Mr Brownlee said.

Dr Smith said: “The concepts of green growth, green jobs and cleantech are attracting international attention with the work of the OECD and the United Nations. This is about New Zealand applying some of our best private sector minds to how we ensure we take up these green growth opportunities to support the Government’s broader economic growth strategy.”

The eight-strong Advisory Group will be chaired by Business New Zealand Chief Executive Phil O’Reilly and includes entrepreneur Melissa Clark-Reynolds, professional director and conservationist Whaimutu Dewes, ZESPRI Chief Executive Lain Jager, businessman Neville Jordan, former Landcare Research Chief Executive Dr Andrew Pearce, Ecologic Foundation Executive Director Guy Salmon, and winemaker and businessman Peter Yealands.

The terms of reference focuses on how Government agencies can help exporters leverage greater value from New Zealand’s clean, green brand, how we can assist the growth of clean technologies, and how we can assist small and medium-size businesses move to a low-carbon economy.

“We have a wide Government programme of initiatives underway on home insulation, pricing carbon emissions, supporting waste reduction and recycling, improving water management and facilitating more renewable energy,” Dr Smith said. “This new advisory group is complementary to this programme in looking specifically at how we leverage stronger and new businesses from the environmental challenges facing New Zealand and the world.”

 

The advisory group will meet regularly this year reporting to the Ministers of Economic Development and the Environment with a final report expected by the end of the year.
