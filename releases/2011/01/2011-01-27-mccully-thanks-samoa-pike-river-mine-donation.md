Minister of Foreign Affairs Murray McCully today expressed thanks to Samoa for its generous donation of $60,000 to the families of miners lost in the Pike River Mine disaster, describing the sum as significant.

“Both now, and following the Canterbury Earthquake, the people of Samoa have made generous and heartfelt contributions to support New Zealand’s recovery. These donations demonstrate the close bonds between our countries, which are particularly appreciated in times of sorrow.

“The warm compassion of the Samoan people will provide some comfort to the Pike River families in their loss,” Mr McCully said.

Prime Minister Tuilaepa handed the donation to New Zealand High Commissioner Nick Hurley in Apia, Samoa last week so that it could be passed on to the Pike River Trust.
