New Zealand’s scientific research in Antarctica and the strength of our scientific ties with the United States are being highlighted by a visit to the continent by Minister of Research, Science and Technology Wayne Mapp.

Dr Mapp flew to Antarctica today to see New Zealand and American scientists in action.

“New Zealand and the US have worked very closely together in Antarctica for more than half a century,” he said.

“This is an important and enduring part of our relationship and has provided many scientific and logistical benefits for both countries.”

During his three-day visit Dr Mapp will tour New Zealand’s Arrival Heights research facility, where scientists take advantage of extremely clear air to measure ozone levels and conduct other atmospheric research.

He will also see Meridian Energy’s Crater Hill Wind Farm, where three wind turbines have been installed to provide both Scott Base and McMurdo Station with electricity. The turbines beat the challenges of both the extreme weather and different electrical systems, and save much of the diesel fuel used to drive the generators.

The Minister will also visit McMurdo Dry Valleys, cold deserts where the environment is similar to Mars. The valleys are at the extreme of where life can exist and are the site of the Long Term Ecological Research project, in which New Zealand is also involved.

Other visits will include the historic huts of explorers Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton and the Cape Royds Adelie penguin colony.

Dr Mapp will return to New Zealand on Friday night.
