Social Development Minister Paula Bennett has today announced an independent inquiry into a serious case of child abuse.

"The discovery of a nine year girl in West Auckland with horrific injuries is one of the worst cases of child abuse I have seen since becoming Minister where the child has lived," says Ms Bennett.

"I have received a final report from Child, Youth and Family's Chief Social Worker and at this stage there appears to be no single glaring failure on the part of any of the agencies involved with the child's family," says Ms Bennett.

"However, I believe elements of this unusual case warrant further investigation.

As such I have appointed former Ombudsman Mel Smith to lead the inquiry, beginning immediately and reporting back by end of March," says Ms Bennett.

The inquiry will investigate matters including the extent to which the numerous agencies involved with this family shared information and whether agencies were sufficiently child-focused.

"Every available resource was provided in this case, including some of our most expensive and trusted intervention models for at-risk families, yet a child suffered appalling abuse and I want to know why," says Ms Bennett.

Draft Terms of Reference of Ministerial Inquiry led by Mel Smith

1\. Whether the multiple agencies and individuals involved in the family in the lead-up to her abuse took all appropriate actions to ensure her safety

2\. If these individuals and agencies were sufficiently child-centred in their actions and approach to this case

3\. Whether all these individuals and agencies collaborated effectively

4\. Whether the individuals and agencies involved in the case shared information effectively or not? If not, why not? And did the individuals have a clear understanding of the law around information sharing?

5\. If any changes to the processes and legislative framework are required to ensure open and appropriate information sharing about children judged to be at risk of child abuse or neglect.

6\. Any other matters you might identify that you believe should be brought to my attention.
