Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples says today’s Human Rights Commission report on Treaty issues and race relations in 2010 is a great reminder of how much was achieved in just the last twelve months.

“The Government’s support for the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the visit of the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the launch of a constitutional review, the introduction of the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Bill, the Maori Statutory Board to advise the Auckland Council, and a huge acceleration in Treaty settlement negotiations are just a few of the highlights on a long list of achievements in the report,” said Dr Sharples.

“A year ago, the Maori flag was flown for the first time over Parliament and government buildings; the Waitangi Tribunal issued a number of important reports, an aquaculture settlement worth $97 million was enacted, and Aotearoa Fisheries issued a first dividend of $8.5 million to shareholders.

“The most striking thing about this report is seeing many pieces of a jigsaw coming together, to build up the big picture of a future for our nation that is based on Treaty relationships,” said Dr Sharples.

“A graph in the report shows a rise in the number of Treaty settlement milestones reached over the past few years, from eight in 2006-7 under Labour, to almost fifty last year – six times as many per year!

“This is just so important, because each settlement leads a claimant collective into a future where they set their own goals and plan their own development, as a major contributor to the social, cultural and economic growth of their region,” said Dr Sharples.

“The overall picture is very positive, and the coming review of the Constitution will lay the foundations for even more progress next year,” said Dr Sharples.
