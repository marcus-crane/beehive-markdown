The Government is seeking public input into a review of the gas and electricity sector’s certification regime, says Associate Energy and Resources Minister Hekia Parata.

“The safe supply and use of gas and electricity is important to all New Zealanders,” says Ms Parata.

“Certification is an integral part of energy safety, and I welcome this opportunity for consumers, tradespeople and all those involved in the sector to have their say on how it could be improved.”

The Gas and Electrical Certification and Fees Review aims to identify any improvements that could be made to the certification regime, and to make sure that certification fees are good value for money.

“This review follows the introduction of new electricity and gas regulations last year. It is also an opportunity for the public to provide feedback on how well those changes are working,” says Ms Parata.

The discussion document released today at www.energysafety.govt.nz/certification-and-fees-review outlines the current certification regime and proposes potential options for the future.

Submissions to the review, which is being jointly conducted by Energy Safety at the Ministry of Economic Development and the Department of Building and Housing, are due by 5.00pm, Friday 4 March 2011.
