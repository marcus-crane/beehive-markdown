Research, Science and Technology Minister Wayne Mapp has announced the membership of the two new boards that will decide funding for science and innovation.

The Science Board and the Innovation Board will be associated with the new Ministry of Science and Innovation. The Science Board will allocate science funding to research organisations. The Innovation Board will make funding decisions related to business-facing programmes.

“These boards will be key players in the Government’s reforms to improve the science and innovation system,” the Minister said.

“They will help ensure that New Zealand businesses are innovative, internationally competitive and contributing to economic growth. They will fund the high-quality research needed to increase productivity and raise our standard of living.

“We have appointed some of New Zealand’s top scientists, business people and innovation experts to the boards.

“The Innovation Board will be chaired by Dr William Rolleston, who has extensive experience in the sector. Professor Sir David Skegg, one of our most distinguished scientists, will chair the Science Board.”
