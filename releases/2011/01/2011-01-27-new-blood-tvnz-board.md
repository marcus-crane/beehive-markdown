Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman today announced the appointment of professional company director Wayne Walden and business consultant Alison Gerry to the board of Television New Zealand (TVNZ).

Dr Coleman also confirmed that Sir John Anderson, who was appointed chair in 2006, has been retained as chair for another year from 1 May. Mr Walden and Ms Gerry were both appointed for three years.

‘’Wayne and Alison bring skill sets that will add to the existing expertise of the board,’’ Dr Coleman says.

‘’Wayne’s background is grounded in the retail and business sectors. He was the managing director of the Farmers Deka retail chain and was chair of Tranzrail. He’s also been heavily involved in Maori Television serving as chair from 2003 to 2007.

‘’Alison’s business acumen and experience is comprehensive and her financial management skills are a real asset for the board.’’

Ms Gerry, a Kiwibank director, specialises in financial management and before establishing her own business, was group treasurer for Lion Nathan in Sydney. Mr Walden is currently a director at Maori Television but will resign from that position before joining the TVNZ board on 1 May.

Dr Coleman thanked outgoing board members June McCabe and Bryan Gould for their work.
