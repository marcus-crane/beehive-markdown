Defence Minister Wayne Mapp and his Singaporean counterpart Associate Professor Koo Tsai Kee are spending today observing Exercise Thunder Warrior, the annual Singaporean Armed Forces artillery exercise at Waiouru Military Camp.

“Singapore is one of New Zealand’s closest friends in the Asia-Pacific region,” Dr Mapp said.

“The two countries signed a defence co-operation agreement in 2009 which reconfirmed and strengthened our defence working relationship. We have many valuable interactions such as joint exercises, staff visits, and reciprocal training.

“Both countries are also members of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) of which 2011 is the 40th anniversary.

“This week I held formal bilateral talks with the UK Secretary of State for Defence, Dr Liam Fox, and next month I will be meeting the Australian Minister for Defence, Stephen Smith. These meetings and today’s with Associate Professor Koo demonstrate the closeness of the FPDA partners.”

Associate Professor Koo will return to Singapore tomorrow.
