The Minister of Education, Hekia Parata, today confirmed the next 150 schools to receive government-subsidised internal network upgrades, in readiness for ultra-fast broadband.

The Ministry of Education’s School Network Upgrade Project (SNUP) has so far upgraded networks in more than 700 state and state integrated schools with more in progress.

Ms Parata says that with the majority of schools having now registered their interest in the project, the criteria for selection for SNUP has been updated to give greater priority to schools where fibre connection is imminent.

“This approach is a key part of ensuring that the Government’s significant investment in providing 97.7 % of schools with ultra-fast broadband access delivers the expected benefits for our young people,” Ms Parata says.

In line with education priorities, the revised selection criteria also place greater emphasis on schools with high numbers of Māori, Pasifika and special needs students.

Ms Parata says that, to keep pace with the fibre rollout, schools will be selected for SNUP in smaller groups more frequently and that the next group of schools to be upgraded will be announced in early 2012.
