Associate Commerce Minister Craig Foss today congratulated International Accreditation New Zealand (IANZ) on winning a Business Achievement Award from the New Zealand Business Excellence Foundation.

“I am pleased that this Crown entity has been recognised as a top performer.  It stands out – not just in its field, but right across the public and private sectors.  The state sector should be aiming for top marks for its work, and this shows just what can be achieved,” said Mr Foss.

The Business Excellence awards recognise quality in leadership, organisational processes, and customer relations.  The New Zealand business excellence criteria focus on continuous improvement in organisational performance.

IANZ is responsible for accrediting New Zealand laboratories, radiology services, and inspection bodies.  It operates in a range of fields from hospitals to food safety.  IANZ accreditation provides assurance that these technical services are competent, and their judgments can be relied upon.  This confidence underpins both domestic suppliers and exports.  IANZ is the main business unit of the Testing Laboratory Registration Council, an autonomous Crown entity.
