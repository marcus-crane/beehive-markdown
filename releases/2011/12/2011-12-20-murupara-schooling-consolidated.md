The Minister of Education, Hekia Parata, says the consolidation of schooling in Murupara will help strengthen education in the area and raise student achievement levels.

Today’s announcement confirms the establishment of a new year 1-13 area school in Murupara. It will open at the start of the 2013 school year on the site of the Murupara School.

It will replace Murupara Primary School and Rangitahi College which will both close on 27 January 2013.

“The community has been working towards a brighter future for its tamariki for some years and a viable and sustainable area school will help achieve this,” says Ms Parata.

“I am pleased to be able to play my part in this process. The decision follows considerable consultation and this new school is an important step in implementing the community’s educational strategic plan Ka Awatea.

“It aims to strengthen education at all levels in the town by ensuring there are seamless pathways for all learners and that schools deliver strong educational outcomes.”

Nominations for the establishment board of trustees will be sought in early 2012 and when appointed the board will establish the school and appoint staff.

The Ministry of Education is working with the boards of Rangitahi College and Murupara Primary School and will provide support to the schools during the reorganisation.

The community will be kept informed throughout the process.
