Police Minister Anne Tolley has praised Gisborne and Hawkes Bay Police following successful raids on gang-related properties in Gisborne.

Armed offenders squads targeted major suppliers of methamphetamine in the city, with searches of seven properties uncovering:

• $60,000 worth of methamphetamine

• $40,000 cash

• 200 cannabis plants (estimated value $200,000)

• Two firearms

• Five Harley Davidson motorbikes

• Vehicles including a Hot Rod car and an S Type Jaguar

• Thousands of dollars’ worth of stolen property

“I want to congratulate every one of the fifty police staff who were involved in such a successful operation,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Their excellent work will be welcomed by local communities, who have had enough of methamphetamine in their midst, and the crime associated with it.

“These raids send yet another powerful message to gangs and criminals, that the makers and sellers of this drug have no place in our communities.

“For those that have yet to learn their lesson, they can be assured that the Police will be targeting them soon, and will seize the proceeds of any criminal activity.”
