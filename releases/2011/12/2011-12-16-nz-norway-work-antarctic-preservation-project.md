Prime Minister John Key has welcomed the Norwegian Government’s decision to work with the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust on the Cape Adare preservation project.

Following a bilateral meeting with Mr Key today, Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg has announced his Government will provide NZD$900,000 to preserve the two huts of Norwegian explorer Carsten Borchgrevink on Cape Adare in the Ross Dependency.

“Norway and New Zealand have a history of strong cooperation on Antarctic issues,” says Mr Key. “This four-year project is a chance to preserve an important piece of heritage, and Norway’s generous support for this project is greatly appreciated.”

Carsten Borchgrevink led an expedition to Antarctica in 1898. The two huts were the first buildings constructed on the continent and contain more than 1000 artefacts. In addition to the four-year preservation phase, the project will also cover future maintenance of the site.
