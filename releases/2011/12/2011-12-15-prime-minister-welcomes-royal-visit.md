Prime Minister John Key has welcomed the news of a planned visit to New Zealand by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall next year.

“I am pleased New Zealand will be able host the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall as part of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations,” says Mr Key.

“Prince Charles, heir to the throne, will be visiting New Zealand on the Queen’s behalf.”

The Palace has announced that family representatives will make official visits in 2012 to all 15 countries outside the United Kingdom of which Queen Elizabeth is Sovereign. The Prince of Wales will also visit Australia, Papua New Guinea and Canada.

The Prince of Wales last visited New Zealand in 2005. This will be the Duchess of Cornwall’s first visit here.

Further details regarding next year’s visit will be made available in due course.
