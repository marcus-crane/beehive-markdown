Prime Minister John Key today announced the incoming National-led Government’s new Ministry.

“National’s line-up is a very strong one, with a mixture of fresh talent and experience,” says Mr Key. “There has been a revamp of some portfolios, and some first-term Ministers have been rewarded for their performance.

“The new National-led Government is ready to hit the ground running. There is a lot of work to do as we look to continue implementing our plans to build a stronger economy, reduce debt, and create more jobs.

“The front bench is being strengthened with the elevation of Steven Joyce, who will have a mix of economically-focused portfolios reflecting the priority the incoming National Government places on economic growth. He will get a new portfolio called Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment, as well as Economic Development, Science and Innovation, and Associate Finance.

“Hekia Parata and Paula Bennett are also promoted to the front bench. Hekia Parata gains the Education portfolio. Paula Bennett retains the Social Development and Youth Affairs portfolios.

“Hekia Parata will build on the good work of Anne Tolley in the Education portfolio, particularly around the implementation of National Standards, one of National’s key policies to boost student achievement. Anne Tolley becomes Minister of Corrections and Police, and Deputy Leader of the House.

“Judith Collins is elevated and gains the Justice Portfolio vacated by Simon Power, along with ACC and Ethnic Affairs,” says Mr Key.

Other changes include:

- Gerry Brownlee will resume the role of Leader of the House, and is given the Transport portfolio. He retains the all-important role of Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery.
- David Carter receives the Primary Industries portfolio, which combines the Agriculture, Biosecurity, Fisheries and Aquaculture, and Forestry portfolios.
- Jonathan Coleman picks up Defence, State Services and Associate Finance, while Phil Heatley picks up Energy and Resources while retaining Housing.
- The Infrastructure portfolio is incorporated into Bill English’s Finance portfolio, and the Disarmament and Arms Control portfolio is incorporated into Murray McCully’s Foreign Affairs portfolio.

“New Minister inside Cabinet Amy Adams is given the Associate role for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery, and also becomes Minister for Communications and Information Technology, and Internal Affairs,” says Mr Key.

Other new Ministers inside Cabinet are Nathan Guy and Craig Foss, who were both Ministers outside Cabinet in the previous term. Mr Guy picks up Immigration and Mr Foss Broadcasting and Commerce.

There are three new National Ministers outside Cabinet – Chris Tremain, Jo Goodhew and Chester Borrows, all of whom pick up a mixture of portfolios. Maurice Williamson is the fourth National Minister outside Cabinet.

“The support party Ministerial roles have already been announced, but I want to acknowledge again their contribution to the formation of a strong, stable, National-led Government.”

The Ministerial line-up also includes a number of changes to reduce the number of portfolios and separate Ministerial responsibilities. Ten portfolios or Ministerial responsibilities have either been disestablished or incorporated into other portfolios.

“This is a strong line-up for our second term. The new Government will be totally focused on delivering for New Zealand,” says Mr Key.

The new Ministry will be sworn in at Government House in Wellington on Wednesday morning.
