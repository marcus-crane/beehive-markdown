Civil Defence Minister, Chris Tremain, together with Nelson MP, Nick Smith, is this morning visiting Nelson in response to the floods that hit the region over the last 24 hours.

"I want to assess the damage firsthand, ensure Civil Defence is appropriately responding, and identify any ways that Government can further assist the region to protect life and property," said Mr Tremain.

The Nelson Region was heavily hit by a weather bomb with rainfall of up to 320mm in a 24 hour period. Over 54 slips have occurred, a dozen roads have been closed, 108 people have been evacuated, and a State of Civil Emergency was declared last night by both Nelson and Tasman Councils. The worst effected areas are Nelson City and Golden Bay in the Tasman District.

"I spoke with Nelson Mayor, Aldo Miccio, last night to offer support and to be further briefed. I am meeting Tasman Mayor, Richard Kempthorne, this morning. The update I have received this morning is encouraging in that the rain slowed overnight and the river levels are falling,' said Mr Tremain.

The National Crisis Management Centre has been activated at level 2 to monitor and support the response.
