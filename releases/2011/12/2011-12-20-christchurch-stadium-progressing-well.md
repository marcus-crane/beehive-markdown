Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says work is progressing well on a new stadium at Addington in Christchurch.

The facility will host sports matches and outdoor music events, starting with an early season Crusaders home game.

Mr Brownlee said two old stands at the Canterbury Rugby League site in Addington had been demolished; old concrete bleacher seats had been removed; the design of new covered stands had been confirmed; preparation of the new pitch was underway; and four lights recycled from Carisbrook were being trucked up from Dunedin to arrive before Christmas.

“Christchurch Stadium will be Canterbury’s only outdoor venue for big games and concerts for the foreseeable future so is an important part of the city’s recovery and rebuild.

“Cantabrians will be able to watch some outstanding rugby, rugby league and football here, listen to some great music, and attend community events.

“I am very much looking forward to attending a Crusaders’ home rugby game at the stadium early next year,” Mr Brownlee said.

The Addington venue has been used for A&P shows and rugby matches in the past, and has current open space zoning. Mr Brownlee is using section 27 of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act powers to amend the City Plan to construct the stands and ancillary structures so that day and night time events can be held, with capacity and noise limits.

Much of the infrastructure at the Christchurch Stadium is being recycled from other venues: four stadium lights are being transported from Dunedin’s Carisbrook ground; the public address system from AMI Stadium will be used; and food and beverage outlets, temporary seating and toilet blocks are coming from Eden Park in Auckland.

Christchurch City Council owns the land the stadium is being built on, and the Christchurch Stadium Trust has been established to manage the stadium, ensuring that events hosted at the ground represent broad community interests.

Mr Brownlee today announced the appointment of Sir John Hansen as chair of the Christchurch Stadium Trust. The Minister will work with Sir John and stakeholder groups to identify appropriate trustees over the coming weeks.

Sir John is convenor of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Review Panel, chairman of Dunedin Venues, and a retired High Court judge.
