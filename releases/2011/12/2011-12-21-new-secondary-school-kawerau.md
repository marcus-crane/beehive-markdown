Education Minister, Hekia Parata, has today announced her decision to establish a new secondary school, for years 7 to 13, in Kawerau to replace both Kawerau College and Kawerau Intermediate.

The Government last month announced $6 million to establish a new secondary school in Kawerau and invited the Kawerau College and Kawerau Intermediate Boards to provide feedback before a final decision was made.

“I have carefully considered the feedback provided during the consultation process with the Kawerau community, including the Boards of both Kawerau Intermediate and Kawerau College,” says Ms Parata.

“A modern new secondary school with 21st century facilities will be established on the College site, with separate middle and senior school campuses, which we know through consultation is important to Kawerau parents.”

Earlier this year the Government announced changes to primary schools in Kawerau that come into effect in 2012.

Ms Parata says the reorganisation of schooling in Kawerau will strengthen education in the area.

“The new secondary school presents an opportunity to improve education for the young people of Kawerau, to ensure it meets the needs of learners, their parents and the Kawerau community, and provides a positive environment to lift achievement.”

Kawerau Intermediate and Kawerau College will close in January 2013, with the new school to open for term one 2013.

An establishment Board of Trustees will be appointed in 2012. The Ministry of Education will appoint a governance facilitator to guide the Board through the establishment process, including its construction and the appointment of staff.
