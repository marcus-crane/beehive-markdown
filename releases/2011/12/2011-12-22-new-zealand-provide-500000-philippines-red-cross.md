The New Zealand Government will contribute $500,000 to the relief efforts of the Philippines Red Cross, Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully announced today.

The Philippines Red Cross is providing urgent humanitarian assistance to people affected by Typhoon Washi. Typhoon Washi struck the Mindanao region in southern Philippines in mid December, killing more than 1000 people and displacing 285,000. Estimates suggest 470,000 people have been affected.

The money will be used by the Red Cross to provide food, blankets, water and sanitation, shelter and livelihood assistance to 25,000 people in the worst affected areas.
