Internal Affairs Minister Nathan Guy has welcomed $6,675,734 in new funding for 40 projects around the country through the Lottery Communities Facilities Fund Committee.

“This funding will be a real boost for many local communities. These projects will help build and improve new facilities for everyone to benefit from.”

Some of the major highlights include:

- $660,000 to the North Harbour Softball Association for a new multi-purpose sports facility
- $363,204 to Pongakawa School in the Bay of Plenty for a community and school centre
- $680,000 to Selwyn District Council towards a new Aquatic centre
- $750,000 to help rebuild the Southland indoor stadium
- $317,735 to Wellington High School to upgrade the school and community hall
- $462,991 to upgrade the Westland Community Centre.

“Without this help, most of these projects would not be possible. This shows again how lottery funding helps to build stronger communities throughout New Zealand," says Mr Guy.

In total, $154 million will be distributed amongst the community this year from the profits of lotteries such as Lotto, Lotto Strike, Instant Kiwi and Keno.

For more information on Lottery grants and the various distribution committees see [www.dia.govt.nz](http://www.dia.govt.nz) or [www.communitymatters.govt.nz](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz/).

The Lottery Community Facilities Fund makes grants for building projects to construct and improve community facilities. Funding is provided for community facilities that support participation in community activities and social interaction to foster community cohesion and strengthen communities.
