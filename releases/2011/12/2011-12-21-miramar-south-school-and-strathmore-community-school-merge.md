The Minister of Education, Hekia Parata, has today announced that two Wellington schools, Miramar South and Strathmore Community School, will merge.

“I have carefully considered the information provided to me by the Boards of Trustees, and through the wider community consultation, and believe that creating one large, full primary school will strengthen education and provide stability for children and their families in the area,” says Ms Parata.

The change, which takes place in 2013, will see the two schools merge on the site of Strathmore Community School.

An establishment Board, which will include representatives from both school communities, will be appointed in term two of 2012, to oversee the merger. The Board’s tasks will include choosing a name for the merged school and overseeing the upgrade of the buildings.

“Both school communities have co-operated fully in this process, and it is clear that they are passionate about the education of their young people,'' says Ms Parata.

“I am confident that this commitment will carry through to the newly merged school as both communities come together in this exciting new phase.''

Peninsula Community Kindergarten and Aoga Amata, two early childhood education centres, currently operate on the school sites. They will continue to do so after the merger has taken place.

The Ministry of Education will work closely with both Miramar South and Strathmore Community Schools to support the implementation of the Minister’s decision.
