A significant Government investment in Immigration New Zealand’s IT system is a further step in increasing immigration’s contribution to the economy, says Immigration Minister Jonathan Coleman.

Dr Coleman today announced the Government is contributing $75 million towards a new IT system.

‘’This IT initiative is a major step up in INZ’s ability to provide timely, responsive and secure immigration services,’’ says Dr Coleman.

‘’We are competing worldwide to recruit skilled and talented people, and a new system will help speed up the processing of visa applications and allow applicants to do more online. Providing a fast and modern service is critical in attracting skilled migrants who can help grow the economy.

‘’The existing IT system is over 15 years old and is reaching the end of its technological lifespan. The cost of even simple changes is high and cannot be maintained over the long term. It‘s also significantly impairing our ability to provide standards of service and security comparable to other nations.’’

The new Immigration Global Management System (IGMS) will provide an agile system that enables more online processing and automation of simple tasks for clients and employers and the ability for all data to be accessed by INZ offices worldwide.

The system will also provide biometric capability which offers significant improvement in identity management and enhanced security.

Customers applying for visas will also have their own individual online immigration accounts that will enable them to enter all their details online and track progress on their applications. Implementation of IGMS is scheduled to begin in early 2012.
