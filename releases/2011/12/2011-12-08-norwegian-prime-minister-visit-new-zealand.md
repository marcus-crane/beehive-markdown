Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg will arrive on Sunday for a six-day visit to New Zealand and Antarctica, Prime Minister John Key announced today.

Prime Minister Stoltenberg is visiting Antarctica as a guest of the US Antarctic Programme for the centenary celebrations of the first expedition to reach the South Pole, which was led by Norwegian Roald Amundsen.

“I am pleased to welcome Jens Stoltenberg to New Zealand. Though geographically distant, Norway and New Zealand are similar-sized countries with much in common,” says Mr Key.

“Our two countries share a good record of cooperation, particularly at a multi-lateral level through organisations like the United Nations and the World Trade Organisation. Both New Zealand and Norway are also internationally-active on polar issues, especially the preservation of the Antarctic environment.”

Mr Stoltenberg will arrive in Christchurch on Sunday before travelling to Antarctica. He will return to Auckland next Friday, where he and Mr Key will hold a bilateral meeting. While in New Zealand, Mr Stoltenberg will also meet the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Mr Stoltenberg will depart the country on 16 December.
