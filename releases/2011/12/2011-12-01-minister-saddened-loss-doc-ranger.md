Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson says she is deeply saddened by the tragic death of Department of Conservation ranger William MacRae in a helicopter crash overnight.

“My thoughts and condolences are with his partner, family and colleagues in the Kaitaia office and Northland conservancy.

“William died trying to help others. He was an experienced, well-known and well-liked DOC staffer and he will be greatly missed in the community.

“I also wish to offer my deepest condolences to the family of the pilot who died in the crash.”

Ms Wilkinson says counselling will be available to DOC staff affected by the tragedy.

The Civil Aviation Authority will be investigating the cause of the crash.
