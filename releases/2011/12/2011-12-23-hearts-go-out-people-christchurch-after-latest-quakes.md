It will be frightening and disheartening for the people of Christchurch and Canterbury to be experiencing even more earthquakes of such a magnitude, particularly this close to the holiday season, says Prime Minister John Key.

His comments follow two new aftershocks this afternoon, one a magnitude 5.8 at 1.58pm, and a second strong earthquake at 3.19pm.

“My heart goes out to the people of Christchurch and Canterbury at this time,” says Mr Key.

“However, residents can be confident that the authorities are onto the situation and government resources stand ready to assist wherever they are needed.

“My officials are keeping me informed as information comes in.

“The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister, Gerry Brownlee, is intending to travel back to Christchurch later this afternoon to assess the situation.

“The Government’s resolve to work with the people of Christchurch and Canterbury to rebuild remains unchanged following today’s two aftershocks,” says Mr Key.
