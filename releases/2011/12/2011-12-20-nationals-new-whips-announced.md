Prime Minister John Key has announced the election of National’s new senior whip and junior whip following the National Party Caucus this morning.

Mr Key says the new senior whip will be List MP Michael Woodhouse, who is from Dunedin.

He will replace Chris Tremain, who is now a Minister outside Cabinet.

The junior whip will be MP for Taupo, Louise Upston.

She replaces Jo Goodhew, who is also now a Minister outside Cabinet.

“Both Michael Woodhouse and Louise Upston are hard-working MPs, and I am confident they will do a good job in their new roles,” says Mr Key. “I congratulate both of them.”
