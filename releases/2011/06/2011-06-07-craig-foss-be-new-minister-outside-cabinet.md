Prime Minister John Key today announced that Craig Foss would be appointed as a new Minister outside Cabinet to take over the portfolios of retiring Minister John Carter.

"I want to record again my thanks to John Carter for his work as a Minister in this National-led Government, and his work as National MP for Northland..

"John has dealt with many challenging issues in his time as a Minister in this Government, most notably as Minister of Civil Defence during the Canterbury earthquakes," Mr Key says.

"Mr Foss is being promoted to take John Carter's place as a Minister outside Cabinet. Craig has done a fine job as MP for Tukituki and as chair of Parliament's Finance and Expenditure Select Committee. I am sure he will do a fine job in his new role.

"Mr Foss will take over the portfolios of Racing, Civil Defence and Senior Citizens.

"He will also be the Associate Minister of Local Government and Associate Minister of Commerce," Mr Key says.

"The Governor-General will appoint Mr Foss to his portfolios at a ceremony tomorrow afternoon."
