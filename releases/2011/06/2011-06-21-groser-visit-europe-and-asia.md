On 24 June, Mr Groser will join Minister of Agriculture, David Carter in Rome for the Ministerial Summit of the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases. Mr Groser will chair the meeting while Mr Carter leads the NZ delegation. The Summit will mark the official launch of the Alliance, with its Charter expected to be signed by more than 30 countries.

“Agriculture is an important sector, making up 14% of global emissions. The Alliance brings together a range of countries to work on reducing emissions from livestock, cropping and rice production.”

“The signing of the Charter represents a critical milestone in the Alliance’s development.”

The Minister will then travel to New Delhi and Mumbai in his capacity as Minister of Trade, to support the Prime Minister’s visit and a 25-strong CEO business delegation.
