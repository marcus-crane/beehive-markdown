Social Development Minister Paula Bennett has welcomed a new agreement between Fostering Kids and Child, Youth and Family signed today.

“It’s great to see the New Zealand Family and Fostercare Federation rebranded as Fostering Kids and working alongside CYF,” says Ms Bennett.

“Having the backing of a government department and the Minister will help strengthen and support the good work Fostering Kids do.”

Today’s signing of an MOU marks the beginning of a relationship which will see training for foster carers which aligns with national qualifications.

The agreement will also see 11 new workshops for foster carers; covering topics such as building attachment and managing behaviour.

“More than 4,000 caregivers provide vital care to children who’ve often had a rough start to life and we must support those caregivers as much as possible.”

Fostering Kids provide support to around 1,000 foster parents caring for children through Child, Youth and Family and Non Government Organisations such as Barnardos and the Open Home Foundation.

Fostering Kids was formerly the New Zealand Family and Fostercare Federation.
