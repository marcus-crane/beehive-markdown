Volunteers provide an invaluable contribution to our society and every minute of their work counts, says Associate Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Hekia Parata.

'Every Minute Counts' is the theme for this year’s Volunteer Awareness Week which starts on Sunday.

The week acknowledges the vital contribution volunteers make in a myriad of ways – through sport, arts and culture, conservation, health, social services, police, and education.

A 2008 study found that volunteers make up 67% of the New Zealand non-profit workforce – a higher proportion than in 40 other countries studied. More recently, data has found that around 30% of people volunteer a median of 10 hours per month.

“I would like to acknowledge the outstanding contribution so many people already make and encourage other New Zealanders to offer what time they can to help their communities,'' Ms Parata says.

“As well as contributing to building stronger and healthy communities, volunteering can also break down social barriers. There is so much we can do to make another life better.’’

This year, which also marks the 10th year of the International Year of Volunteers, is one of the most significant in New Zealand’s volunteering history.

Volunteers have played a crucial role in Christchurch following the earthquakes' and will play an important role when New Zealand hosts the Rugby World Cup later this year - an event which will involve more than 5000 volunteers.

“Volunteering is a way of Kiwi life,’’ Ms Parata says.

“Today’s volunteers are many and varied – with new and innovative approaches using social media networks and technology to be effective in the service of communities. The future of volunteering has never looked so exciting.''
