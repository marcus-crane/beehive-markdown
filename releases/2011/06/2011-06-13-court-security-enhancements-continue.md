Palmerston North Court will be the first of six additional courts to operate a baggage x-ray machine during security screening, further improving the safety of court users, Minister for Courts Georgina te Heuheu QSO announced today.

The baggage x-ray facility will be operational in Palmerston North District Court from 13 June. The remaining five baggage x-rays will be installed at Whangarei District Court, New Plymouth District Court, Napier District Court, Wellington High Court, and Wellington District Court, and will be in place by the end of this year.

“Safety in our courts is a critical part of the Government’s plan for a safe and secure society,” says Mrs te Heuheu.

“The baggage x-ray enhancements continue court security improvements, funded by the Government in Budget 2009 in the sum of $9million over four years.

“So far, the programme has delivered full-time security screening of all court users at Manukau, Auckland and Christchurch courts. There are now 83 court security officers, up from 53 when the programme began, and there will be 105 court security officers by the end of the four year programme.

“The installation of baggage x-rays at these six courts will allow airport-style screening of all court users. Screening will not be full-time, but on a spot-check basis, and on other occasions as appropriate,” says Mrs te Heuheu.

Court users will walk through a metal detector, and may be subject to further screening with a handheld detector. At some courts, bags will be x-rayed, and owners asked to produce any items of interest for further inspection. Items can be temporarily surrendered, but if the item is an offensive weapon, the police will be involved.

“The focus on enhancing court security is aimed at preventing potential weapons getting into our courts and making our courts safer overall for all court users – the judiciary, lawyers, court staff, the public and those attending court,” says Mrs te Heuheu.
