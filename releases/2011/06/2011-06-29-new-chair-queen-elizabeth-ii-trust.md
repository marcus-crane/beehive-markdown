Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson today announced the appointment of James Guild as the new chairperson of the Queen Elizabeth II National Trust Board following the retirement of Sir Brian Lochore.

The QEII Trust works to blend farming and conservation to protect rare, threatened, and significant indigenous biodiversity, special landscapes and other open spaces through the use of covenants.

“I am delighted that James Guild has agreed to take on this important role,” Ms Wilkinson says.

“As a high country farmer, James has had wide experience as a chairperson in both the private and public sectors, encompassing both farming and conservation.

“He has a significant QEII covenant on his property encompassing the headwaters of the Selwyn River, making him well-qualified to lead this unique organisation.

“The chair plays an important role in advocating for greater protection on private land and James has the skill-set needed to take the Trust forward.”

Mr Guild takes up his appointment on 1 July 2011 on the retirement of Sir Brian Lochore.

Ms Wilkinson says Sir Brian’s leadership of and contribution to the Trust has been immense.

“Sir Brian has been the flagship of the Trust for eight years and it has benefited enormously from his leadership and standing in the farming community.

“He is a remarkable New Zealander and deserves recognition and thanks for his many years of service to conservation.”
