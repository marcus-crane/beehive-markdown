Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says the government will give an initial update on the state of land in greater Christchurch at a media briefing at 1:30pm tomorrow in Christchurch.

"As part of this announcement, the government will be presenting options for homeowners with insurance in some of the worst affected areas," Mr Brownlee said.

"This is the next step in the government's commitment to providing timely and accurate information to the people of greater Christchurch.  While we will not be able to provide all the answers to all residents tomorrow, we will continue to provide regular updates to residents on progress over coming weeks.

"This announcement will provide some certainty for residents in the worst affected areas, and will give them options for their immediate future.

"We will be releasing the most up-to-date information we have about the state of the land in greater Christchurch."

A website and call centre will be activated tomorrow afternoon which residents will be able to visit or call to find out about the status of their land.

A series of community meetings will also be held over the next days and weeks for affected residents.

"The earthquakes are an ongoing major event but the government is committed to getting things right for the people of Canterbury," Mr Brownlee said

"We're moving as quickly as we can to give some certainty to those most affected."
