The Minister for Ethnic Affairs, Hekia Parata, will address members of the New Zealand Chinese Association (NZCA) at their annual conference this Saturday, to be held at the Wellington Chinese  Sports & Cultural Centre in Wellington.

The NZCA was established as an incorporated society in 1935, and is one of the largest ethnic associations in New Zealand with over 2000 active participants. 

Representatives from each of their 13 branches across the country, will come together to plan projects that will cater to the social and cultural needs of the Chinese community in New Zealand.

"The NZCA has played a vital role in maintaining the culture and language of Chinese New Zealanders, particularly among young Chinese New Zealanders,’’ Ms Parata says.

The NZCA run regular annual sporting and cultural events, and they provide ongoing support to Chinese schools across the country, including the successful Wellington Chinese Language School based at Victoria University. 

"I commend the NZCA for the work they have done, and continue to do,  to support Chinese schools in New Zealand."
