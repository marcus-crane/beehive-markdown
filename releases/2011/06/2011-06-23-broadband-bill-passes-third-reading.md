A bill to deliver ultra-fast and rural broadband has passed its third and final reading in Parliament today.

Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce says the Telecommunications (TSO, Broadband and Other Matters) Amendment Bill positions New Zealand to take advantage of communications technology that will truly transform this country.

“There has been a lot of talk for a long time in this country about support for innovation. The passing of this Bill today is a very significant step that proves this government’s commitment to further develop New Zealand as an innovation-based economy.”

The Bill provides the regulatory framework for the Government’s ultra-fast broadband and rural broadband initiatives. It also implements reforms to the Telecommunications Service Obligation (TSO) regime, and implements measures to assist in the roll-out of broadband.

The Ultra-Fast Broadband Initiative will deliver fibre connectivity to schools, hospitals and 90 percent of businesses by 2015, and to three-quarters of all New Zealanders by 2020.

The Rural Broadband Initiative will cover areas outside of the UFB and will enable 97 percent of schools to connect to ultra-fast broadband and 97 percent of households to receive peak speeds of at least 5 Mbps.

The Bill implements a robust open access regime for new broadband infrastructure the Government is investing in. It also clears the way for the structural separation of Telecom into two new businesses, as part of Telecom’s involvement in the Ultra-Fast Broadband project.

“The passing of this Bill today marks the end of the beginning of a new era of world-class broadband infrastructure for New Zealand, and the delivery of the Government’s broadband investment commitments,” says Mr Joyce.

“This infrastructure will revolutionise the way Kiwi firms do business, the way our kids learn, and the way our health providers deliver services to our communities.”

Following Royal Assent, the Bill is scheduled to come into force on 1 July 2011.
