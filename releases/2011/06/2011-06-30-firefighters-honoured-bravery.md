Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy has congratulated two firefighters on their New Zealand Bravery Awards, presented today in a ceremony at Government House in Wellington.

“Senior Firefighter Mervyn Neil from the Hamilton Fire District has received the New Zealand Bravery Decoration for his actions during the tragic Tamahere coolstore fire in 2008.

“Mervyn was seriously injured in the major explosion, but he insisted on taking charge of the situation and helping other injured firefighters. When he finally left the scene he was taken to hospital where he spent 10 weeks in a coma.

“Peter Hanne is a new recruit to the Turangi Volunteer Fire Brigade, who has been awarded the New Zealand Bravery Medal. In 2008 he risked his life to free a truck driver when the vehicle slid down a riverbank near Opotiki.

“These awards are fitting recognition for two courageous New Zealanders. Both men put the needs of others ahead of their own personal safety, and we are proud to have them as part of the New Zealand Fire Service.

“Events of the last 12 months in Canterbury have shown just how much we rely on emergency service like firefighters, both professional and volunteer, in times of need.”
