Economic Development Minister David Carter is welcoming negotiations with SkyCity to build a large international convention centre in central Auckland.

Mr Carter says the proposed 3500-seat centre would create around 800 new jobs and inject an estimated $90 million a year of extra spending by international visitors into the New Zealand economy.

“The proposed New Zealand International Convention Centre will give New Zealand an edge in a significant growth market as the venue would compete with other centres in Australia.

“We’ve known for years that a centre of this size is needed to attract large-scale international business conferences. This proposal now gives us that opportunity.”

Mr Carter says SkyCity’s proposal is favoured because it offers by far the best level of benefit to taxpayers, the company has a good track record in the convention business and the location is good.

Under the proposal, SkyCity would pay the full construction cost of the centre; an estimated $350 million. SkyCity has asked the Government to consider some alterations to gambling regulations and legislation, and the two parties are entering into negotiations.

“The negotiations are commercially sensitive, but the Government can rule out any discussion on reducing the age of entry to casinos, allowing SkyCity an internet gambling licence or additional casino licences,” Mr Carter says.

“The broad areas of negotiation are an extension of SkyCity’s licence to beyond its current date of 2021 and a proposed increase in gaming tables and machines at the Auckland casino.

“Any proposed changes to gambling legislation would be subject to a full public submission process and made in a highly regulated environment.”
