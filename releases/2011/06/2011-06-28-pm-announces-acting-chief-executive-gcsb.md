Prime Minister John Key today announced that Simon Murdoch has agreed to be the acting Chief Executive and Director of the Government Communications Security Bureau.

Mr Murdoch has previously been the Chief Executive and Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

In 2010 he undertook a review of the intelligence agencies and, from November 2010 to February 2011, was the acting Chief Executive and Director of the GCSB before the appointment of Lt Gen Sir Jerry Mateparae.

Mr Murdoch has been appointed because of the vacancy created by Sir Jerry’s departure to become the next Governor-General.

Mr Murdoch takes up the role on 1 July.
