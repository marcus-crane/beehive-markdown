Marae across the country will open their doors to officially welcome teams from around the world to New Zealand for the Rugby World Cup 2011.

Māori Affairs Minister the Hon Dr Pita Sharples and IRB RWC Tournament Director, Kit McConnell announced the names of 15 marae who will host the teams and other RWC VIPs on behalf of the nation.

“From heartland New Zealand in the rural provinces to our biggest cities, New Zealanders will stand together to pōwhiri the world. This is the first time Rugby World Cup teams and visitors will be welcomed to a host country like this,” says Dr Sharples.

“As we prepare to host one of the world’s biggest sporting events, come September New Zealand will not only be a stadium of four million, we will also be a marae of four million proud hosts.”

Currently 15 marae from Invercargill in the deep south to Waitangi in Te Tai Tokerau will host teams and IRB officials. There will also be joint pōhiri and civic ceremonies in some communities across the country.

“Today’s announcements are an important part of the unique welcome communities across New Zealand will extend to teams and visitors.  Regions are preparing a range of welcome events and festivals to showcase the best of their region,” says Mr McConnell.

Dr Sharples says Rugby World Cup 2011 has sparked exciting tourism and businesses developments for Māori communities with more than 200 Māori-led projects planned nationwide.

“Today’s announcement demonstrates the unique impact Māori will have on our hosting of Rugby World Cup 2011, as we prepare to stand alongside our fellow New Zealanders to welcome the world to Aotearoa.”
