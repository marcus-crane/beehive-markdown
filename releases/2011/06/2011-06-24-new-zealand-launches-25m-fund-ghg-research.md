New Zealand is establishing a competitive international NZ$25 million fund to support research on mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from pastoral farming.

Agriculture Minister David Carter will today announce the New Zealand Fund for Global Partnerships in Livestock Emissions Research at the inaugural ministerial meeting of the Global Research Alliance in Rome.

The fund draws on the $45 million New Zealand committed to the Alliance in 2009, and it will be allocated over four years.

“This Fund will focus on innovative solutions to help reduce emissions while producing more food, a significant challenge faced by farming systems both in New Zealand and around the world,” says Mr Carter.

“There is no silver bullet for reducing emissions from livestock. Only by partnering with other countries can we make the scientific breakthroughs that we need.”

Mr Carter says the fund will be open to international scientists, and multi-stakeholder/country consortia bids are highly desirable. Projects can be led by New Zealand or international participants, but must include a New Zealand partner. Co-funding from international participants will be encouraged.

“The proposals will need to demonstrate a balance between innovative science and the achievement of cost-effective and sustainable solutions for livestock farmers,” Mr Carter says.
