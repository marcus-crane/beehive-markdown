The Government has approved a $40 million cash injection for Capital and Coast District Health Board for the 2010/11 financial year.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says "This DHB continues to have the largest deficit of any DHB in the country.

"This is a one-off payment so the board can pay its day to day bills without always going into overdraft.

"The $40 million support is what was budgeted, and the DHB remains on track to break even in 2013/14."

Capital and Coast has been in deficit – or close to it - for the past decade, and last year it was given $58 million in deficit funding.

"Capital and Coast has now been given a total of $203 million by this government in deficit support and capital projects.

"On top of these deficit and capital injections, the government has lifted Capital and Coast's annual funding to a record $677 million in the 2011/12 year, which is $88 million more than when we took office," Mr Ryall says.
