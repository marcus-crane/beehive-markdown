Police Minister Judith Collins today congratulated 10 Police officers involved in the Napier siege in 2009 who received New Zealand Bravery Awards at a ceremony at Government House in Wellington.

The officers were recognised for bravery during the siege which began with the fatal shooting of Police Senior Constable Len Snee by Jan Molenaar during a routine check of a Chaucer Rd address.

The officers who received the awards today were: Constable Michael John Burne, Senior Constable Dennis Michael Hurworth, Detective Sergeant Timothy Nigel Smith, Senior Constable Paul Anthony Symonds, Sergeant Heath Courtenay Jones, Senior Sergeant Anthony James Miller, Constable Kevin Lawrence Rooney, Detective Paul Buckley, Senior Constable Bradley James Clark, and Detective Sergeant Nicholas John Clere.

“In the Napier siege Police were confronted by an extremely dangerous and unpredictable situation,” Ms Collins said.

“The Police honoured today showed tremendous leadership, initiative and personal courage in helping bring the siege to an end without further loss of life to Police or innocent members of the public.

“I congratulate each of them on their award, and for their unshakable commitment to protecting and serving their fellow New Zealanders.

“Bravery goes with the territory for our Police. When the lives of others were at risk, each of these inspirational officers stepped forward and put their own safety on the line.

“All New Zealanders can be proud of them.”
