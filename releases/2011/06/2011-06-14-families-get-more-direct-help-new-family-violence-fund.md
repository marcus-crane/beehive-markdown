Community organisations directly responding to the needs of families and whānau experiencing family violence will receive most of the funding under the Family Centred Services Fund announced by Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment, Tariana Turia today.

Minster Turia said that in the 2011/2012 year, over $9.250 million will go to frontline services directly working with families and whānau.  This includes services funded under the previous Family Violence Whanau Ora Fund.    

Another $2.641 million has been approved for co-ordination services that bring together organisations that work with families experiencing family violence and $0.664 million for both direct and co-ordination services.

The remainder of the Fund ($0.780 million) is currently unallocated and we will be working with providers to target areas of high need and address gaps in service provision.

“These groups are funded to work with New Zealand families and whānau, who live with family violence, to help them build on their own strengths and work out their own ways to change the anti-social practices that lead to family violence,” said Minister Turia.

“Long lasting change will only be achieved when families take responsibility for their own members and are given the tools to transform their homes and lives into places of safety and wellbeing,” she said.

One hundred and sixty-six applications are approved under the Fund.  Of these, 121 are for direct services, 35 are for service co-ordination and 10 are for both.  This is on top of the 25 organisations already funded under the previous Family Violence Whānau Ora Fund – which was rolled into the new Fund.

The grants also include $1.778 million in funding for 22 Women’s Refuges for the ongoing social support work they do with women and their families in their local communities.      

“I am pleased to report that funding to affiliated Women’s Refuges has increased by 94% as a result of the new approach to funding,” said Minister Turia.

“We have also approved $2.641 million to funding innovative and joined up approaches to the coordination of responses to family violence, such as community networks and case collaboration, for a period of one year. During this time the Taskforce for Action on Violence within Families will complete its review on how best to achieve good coordination of family violence services and initiatives across New Zealand communities.”

“As a result, we are funding 45 providers for service coordination”.
