Cabinet has given the green light for work to commence on a new natural health products regulator, Associate Health Minister Jonathan Coleman confirmed today.

The natural health products regulator is one of the shared policy initiatives agreed to by the National and Green Parties under a Memorandum of Understanding.

‘’Existing legislation relating to natural health products is obsolete. We want to develop a regulatory system that is cost-effective and gives New Zealand consumers the assurance that the natural health products they buy are safe, true to claim and true to label,’’ says Dr Coleman.

‘’We've listened to consumers and industry representatives, and there’s overall support for some level of regulation in the natural health products sector. However we are conscious of the need to protect consumers while not imposing high levels of cost on the industry.

‘’The industry, with an annual turnover of approximately $760 million, encompasses a huge range of products, from simple vitamin preparations to potent herbal medicines and substances derived from animals.’’

The Government intends to introduce a Natural Health Products Bill before the election.

The Ministry of Health consulted on a proposed regulatory scheme for the industry last year with 1500 submissions lodged by consumers, industry groups, and practitioners.

It is proposed that a new regulator would be based in the Ministry of Health. More information is available from www.moh.govt.nz
