The start of the new standalone Environmental Protection Authority tomorrow will provide stronger and better coordinated central government leadership on environmental regulation, Environment Minister Nick Smith says.

“The new Environmental Protection Authority will strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of New Zealand’s environmental regulation,” Dr Smith said at the official launch of the EPA at Parliament today.

“It is better to have one national regulator of environmental issues than having the same issues relitigated across 78 councils. It also makes sense to have one government agency responsible rather than having these functions spread across four different departments and authorities.”

The EPA will be responsible for regulation of hazardous substances, new organisms, genetically modified organisms, national consenting under the Resource Management Act, ozone depleting chemicals, assessment of environmental effects in Antarctica and toxic waste exports and imports. Management of the Emissions Trading Scheme will transfer to the Authority on 1 January 2012, and will take over consenting in the Exclusive Economic Zone and Continental Shelf on 1 July 2012, subject to the proposed legislation coming in.

“The EPA is complemented by a raft of new National Policy Statements and National Environmental Standards on water, air quality, contaminated soil, renewable energy, coastal management and biodiversity which are part of the Government’s agenda of strengthening national direction. The National Policy Statement on Freshwater Management also comes into effect tomorrow,” Dr Smith said.

“Well designed institutions are crucial to New Zealand performing well. The Treasury, Reserve Bank and Auditor-General play key complementary roles in delivery the policy, regulatory and audit roles for managing New Zealand’s economic resources. We need an effective Environment Ministry, EPA and Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment to play equivalent roles with respect to New Zealand’s environmental resources.

“This proposal originates from National's 2006 Bluegreen Vision for New Zealand and 2008 election policy. It brings us into line with best-practice internationally where most jurisdictions have an Environmental Protection Authority.

“The success of the EPA will be in it being a fair, effective and efficient regulator of our environment. We want a technically expert and professional organisation that will protect the environment while minimising compliance costs and enabling our economy to grow.”
