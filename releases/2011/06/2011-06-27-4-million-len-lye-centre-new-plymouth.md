The Government will provide a $4 million grant for the Len Lye Centre project which is to be built immediately adjacent to New Plymouth’s Govett-Brewster Art Gallery, Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson announced.

“Len Lye’s work is both nationally and internationally significant,” Mr Finlayson said. “Funding to the Len Lye Centre project will ensure New Plymouth’s visitors and residents will have substantially better access to this collection of works by one of New Zealand’s preeminent artists.”

The Len Lye Centre building has been designed by one of New Zealand’s leading architectural firms, Pattersons. Recently, World Architecture News announced Pattersons as an international practice “set to shape the future of architecture in the 21st Century”. In addition to referencing Len Lye’s works artistically, the building’s design will provide New Plymouth with new iconic built heritage to enhance the city for its residents, and as a tourism destination.

Len Lye’s artworks capture motion and often utilise sound, movement and light.  Many of his sculptural works are crafted from stainless-steel.

Mr Finlayson acknowledged the work of local Member of Parliament Jonathan Young advocating for the region's interests.

The grant has been made under the Regional Museums Policy Funding, which is intended to ensure nationally significant material is housed adequately and made accessible to New Zealanders. The funding grant will be spread over two years. 

Previous recipients of this fund have included the Auckland Museum, Auckland Art Gallery, Rotorua Museum of Art and History, Otago Settlers Museum, Hawke’s Bay Museum and Art Gallery, and Puke Ariki.
