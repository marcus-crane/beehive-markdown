The new Gisborne Community Probation Service (CPS) centre will enable a bigger team of probation officers to better manage community offenders in the area, Corrections Minister Judith Collins said.

The new centre, which opened today, will provide management of all community based sentences and orders such as home detention, community detention, parole, release conditions from prison, supervision, intensive supervision and community work.

“Centres such as this one play an important role in creating safer communities,” Ms Collins said.

“Over the past five years the number of probation officers at Gisborne has increased from 14 in 2006 to 24 in 2011, which has enabled CPS to provide better oversight of offenders and lift the quality of its practices to record levels.

“It’s vital that we do a good job of managing these offenders. That is why the Government has injected $256 million into CPS since coming to office to boost the number of probation officers in Gisborne and across the country.”

The new building also brings the 34 staff responsible for managing around 830 community based offenders together in one central location. Previously they worked from two locations.

The opening was attended by justice sector partners, social agencies and service providers that work alongside CPS.

“A facility such as this could not function without the help of a wide range of people from a wide range of groups,” Ms Collins said.  “Their work contributes to the Government’s vision of a better and safer New Zealand.”
