Commerce Minister Simon Power has announced the delegations for new Associate Commerce Minister Craig Foss.

"One of Mr Foss's main delegations will be the oversight of the Commerce Commission as ownership Minister and of ongoing operations of the Commerce Act," Mr Power said.

"I look forward to working with him as the Government continues its major reforms of regulation in the business sector to promote competition and increase participation in New Zealand's capital markets."

Mr Foss's other delegations are:

• Responsibility for trade remedies and responsibility for the administration of the Dumping and Countervailing Duties Act 1988 and the Temporary Safeguard Authorities Act 1987.

• Responsibility for the oversight of the three institutions involved in standards and conformance infrastructure in New Zealand. The three bodies are: Standards New Zealand, the Testing Laboratory Registration Council, and the Join Accreditation System of Australia and New Zealand.

• Responsibility for the National Contact Point responsible for the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises which provide voluntary principles and standards for responsible business conduct.

Mr Foss said he welcomes the opportunity to work in the Commerce portfolio.

"Following my experience as Chair of the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee, I'm keen to contribute to the Government's reforms in the commerce area."
