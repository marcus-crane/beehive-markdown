Minister of Science and Innovation Wayne Mapp is on his way to the United States this week to help promote New Zealand companies at the Bio International Convention in Washington DC.

“The Bio International Convention is the major global event for the biotech industry world-wide, attended by close to 20,000 people, “ Dr Mapp said.

“Twenty of New Zealand’s top biotech and other related companies are showcasing New Zealand skills, products and services. It is a unique opportunity for New Zealand.

“As the convention is in Washington DC this year, the visit also presents an excellent opportunity to advance our science relationship with the US in the wake of the Wellington Declaration.

“The ICT sector is a particular area of focus for our science and innovation relationship with US entrepreneurs. In San Francisco I will be visiting the ICT Launching Pad project.

“This is led in the US by the founder of TradeMe, Sam Morgan, and is designed to provide a shopfront for New Zealand ICT businesses in the US. It is an initiative that will help realise the potential of New Zealand innovation and research in the US and beyond.

“While in the US I will also be meeting my Australian counterpart, Senator Kim Carr, to discuss progress on the ANZAC Square Kilometre Array bid,” the Minister said.
