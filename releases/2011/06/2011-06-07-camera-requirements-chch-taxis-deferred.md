The government has agreed to delay the implementation of new safety requirements for Christchurch taxi operators, says Transport Minister Steven Joyce.

Changes announced in December mean taxis in larger towns and cities need to be fitted with in-vehicle security cameras and have around the clock telecommunications support from 1 August 2011.

“In light of the destruction caused by the Canterbury earthquakes and the impact this has had on the city’s taxi industry, it would be unreasonable to expect operators to have systems in place by August as originally planned,” says Mr Joyce.

The requirements for approved in-vehicle cameras and telecommunications systems will be delayed to 1 May 2012 to give Christchurch operators more time to comply. The deadline of 1 August 2011 will still apply to operators in all other specified towns and cities.

“There is no doubt that these requirements are important for the safety of drivers and their passengers. Christchurch taxi operators will eventually need to meet the new standards, but for now they will have some necessary time to recover from the effects of the earthquakes.”

“Christchurch drivers and operators who have concerns about safety are free to install cameras or upgrade telecommunications. There is nothing to prevent them doing this before the implementation date and I would encourage those who can to do so.”
