The Board of the new Environmental Protection Authority was today announced by Environment Minister Nick Smith at the Environment Defence Society Conference in Auckland.

“The new authority is about strengthening New Zealand’s environmental management and efficiently bringing together the regulatory functions that were previously across four different agencies,” Dr Smith said.

The Board will be chaired by former Wellington Mayor Kerry Prendergast and includes David Faulkner, Anake Goodall, Tim Lusk, Graham Pinnell, Taria Tahana, Richard Woods and Gillian Wratt.

“The new board has the right mix of skills to oversee the new Authority with strong expertise in the environmental sciences, agriculture, infrastructure, renewable energy, tikanga Maori, as well as governance and risk management. The balance of economic and environmental skills reflects National’s Bluegreen approach of supporting growth and protecting the environment,” Dr Smith said.

The Environment Protection Authority as an independent Crown entity takes effect on 1 July 2011 and will be responsible for regulation of hazardous substances, new organisms, national consenting under the Resource Management Act, ozone depleting chemicals, assessment of environmental effects in Antarctica and waste exports and imports. The management of the Emissions Trading Scheme will transfer to the Authority on 1 January 2012, and consenting in the Exclusive Economic Zone and Continental Shelf on 1 July 2012.

“This announcement enables the new Board to appoint a Chief Executive and a smooth transition to the new Authority,” Dr Smith said.

**Attached: EPA Board Members biographies**

**Kerry Prendergast (Chair)** As Mayor of Wellington from 2001 to 2010 and as a borough and city councillor for 15 years prior to that, Ms Prendergast gained substantial governance experience. During her time as Mayor, she was involved in significant periods of change and growth at the Wellington City Council. She also brings knowledge in environmental management and has experience working with Ministers and government departments.

**David Faulkner** has worked for Fulton Hogan Ltd for a number of years, including as Managing Director from 2001 to 2009.   Mr Faulkner's experience in these areas will be invaluable to the Board because it will provide a private sector perspective.  He will also be able to provide the Board with an understanding of the complexity associated with significant infrastructure proposals which might be seeking resource consent as a nationally significant proposal.

**Anake Goodall** was Chief Executive Officer of Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu from April 2007 until April this year. He has experience in management and organisational leadership and is particularly interested in the areas of strategic planning and organisational development, change management and capability building, sustainability issues, and the development of community-based philanthropy. He also brings to this role his extensive experience as manager of Ngāi Tahu’s historical Treaty settlement process and as an independent consultant to a number of organisations.

**Tim Lusk** is the retiring Chief Executive Officer of Meridian Energy and has held senior roles in Transpower and Telecom.  This experience gives him a unique blend of understanding of major infrastructure projects and the regulatory environment. This experience and knowledge will be invaluable to the EPA.

**Graham Pinnell** has experience as professional engineer and sheep and cattle farmer.  As a farmer, he will bring to the Board an important understanding of the links between the economy and environmental management.  As an inaugural Board member of the Electricity Commission, Mr Pinnell has experience governing a new Crown Agent. 

He will also bring knowledge of environmental and risk management frameworks, gained through his role on the Pesticides Board (the organisation that preceded the Environmental Risk Management Authority) and in assisting with the preparation of national best management practices for chemical and fertiliser application in farming. He has also served on a number of advisory groups, providing advice on resource management and sustainable farming practices. 

**Taria Tahana** is on the Board of Learning Media and Te Mangai Paho (Maori Broadcasting Agency).  Additionally, she consults in Maori development as the Managing Director of Tahana Ltd and has been a business executive for corporations such as Fletcher Challenge and Ernst & Young (Canada).   She is a trustee to Te Pumautanga o Te Arawa, Ngati Pikiao Iwi Trust, and Korowai Aroha.  She has served on a number of government advisory groups including the Maori Economic Taskforce for Waiariki, Hui Taumata Economic Taskforce 2005 and the Women’s Affairs Maori Economic Reference Group.

**Richard Woods** has been the Chair of the Environmental Risk Management Authority (ERMA), one of the agencies forming the new EPA, since 2008. He is a member of the Independent Police Conduct Authority and a former Chief Executive of the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service. He will bring his knowledge of ERMA and considerable experience in governance procedures and of central government processes. He will also bring demonstrated strategic and leadership skills to the position.

**Gillian Wratt** is currently the Chief Executive of the Cawthron Institute, an independent scientific research organisation that provides practical and independent aquatic and environmental research expertise, scientific technologies and analytical services to build economically and environmentally resilient communities.

Ms Wratt has significant experience of New Zealand’s environmental management system.  Cawthron Institute’s work includes provision of research-based advice to a range of public and private sector organisations, including expert witness support for RMA consent hearings.
