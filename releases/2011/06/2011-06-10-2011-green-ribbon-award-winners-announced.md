Minister for the Environment Nick Smith last night announced the 14 winners of the 2011 Green Ribbon Awards, including the Supreme Winner, Eco Stock Supplies.

“The Green Ribbon Awards recognise the efforts of New Zealanders who are taking action to address environmental challenges such as climate change, water quality, biodiversity, waste, and protecting our coasts and oceans,” Dr Smith said.

The overall winner Eco Stock Supplies collects food waste destined for the bin from manufacturers, retailers, importers and transport companies. This waste is processed into high-quality stock feed at its plant in Wiri, South Auckland.

“Rotting organic waste is a key cause of greenhouse gas emissions from landfills.  By removing 25,000 tonnes of food waste from landfill over the last year, Eco Stock Supplies estimates it has stopped the production of approximately 13,625 tonnes of CO2 emissions,” Dr Smith said. 

Eco Stock Supplies is also contributing to the environment by providing a feed stock to replace imported cotton seed and grain used by the agricultural sector. 

“Eco Stock Supplies is an innovative, small New Zealand business that has recognised a niche opportunity, providing not only employment, but also a number of positive environmental spin-offs. It is a deserving winner of the Supreme Award,” Dr Smith said.

“The quality of entries for the awards this year was of a very high standard and I would like to congratulate all the winners and finalists for their outstanding contribution to protecting and enhancing New Zealand's environment.”
