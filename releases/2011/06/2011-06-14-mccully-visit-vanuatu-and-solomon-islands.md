Foreign Minister, Murray McCully, is travelling to Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands this week to meet with leaders ahead of the Pacific Islands Forum in Auckland later this year.

“New Zealand is honoured to host this year’s meeting of Forum leaders in Auckland in September. We are determined to use our leadership role constructively and consult widely amongst Pacific nations in the lead up to the event,” Mr McCully said.

“A major theme at this year’s Forum is how to turn the Pacific region’s untapped potential into prosperity and identify ways we can work together to bring about lasting improvements to the lives of Pacific people, Mr McCully said.

“Vanuatu is the current Forum Chair. Both Vanuatu and Solomon Islands make an important contribution to the Pacific region and we will be discussing regional issues and their priorities for the Forum,” he said.

“New Zealand’s development assistance programme has a strong focus on helping Pacific island countries such as Vanuatu and Solomon Islands realise their potential,” he said.

The Minister departs New Zealand on 14 June and returns on 16 June.
