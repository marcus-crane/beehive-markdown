Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman and Pacific Island Affairs Minister Georgina te Heuheu today welcomed the opening of the new Pacific Media Network studio in Wellington, and in collaboration with Whitireia Journalism School.

The studio expands the Pacific Radio Network with Niu FM now broadcasting across the Wellington region.

‘’Niu FM’s foray into the Capital increases the reach of Pacific language programming and news to Pacific communities which helps many people stay connected with their culture and identity,’’ Dr Coleman says.

‘’The Government spends $3 million dollars a year supporting Pacific broadcasting through the National Pacific Radio Trust which maintains Niu FM and Radio 531pi. A Pacific radio network is vital for nurturing and developing Pacific identity, so today’s launch is an exciting time for the network as it branches into another market.’’

Pacific Island Affairs Minister Georgina te Heuheu said the Pacific population was the fastest naturally growing population in New Zealand and by 2026 one in 10 people in New Zealand will be of Pacific descent.

“The role of the Pacific Media Network is vitally important in connecting Pacific communities across Aotearoa and it is great that it is now extending its reach into the Wellington region, where New Zealand’s second largest Pacific population lives,” Mrs te Heuheu says.

“Promoting Pacific languages and culture is a priority for the National Government, as it is for the Network. Locating Niu FM in Wellington will add to the diversity in the region’s media, and help consolidate the important role of languages in our society.”

Niu FM broadcasts nationally offering a mix of music, diverse cultures, topical news and information straight from the heart of the Pacific and is aimed at a younger audience.

“Today’s young people are our future. It is important that we nurture them in their language, culture, and their sense of belonging, and community.”

Mrs te Heuheu congratulated Pacific Media Network on their foresight and enterprise in locating themselves in the capital.
