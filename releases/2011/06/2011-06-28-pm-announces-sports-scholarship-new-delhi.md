Prime Minister John Key today announced a new sports scholarship and academic exchange programme between India and New Zealand.

The programme will include a number of scholarships for Indian students to study sports qualifications in New Zealand universities. 

Greater connections between New Zealand and Indian sports scholars, coaches, trainers, and students in physical education and sports medicine will also be encouraged under this new scheme.

“India and New Zealand have a long-standing sporting relationship and shared love for cricket and hockey, among other sports,” says Mr Key.

“Deepening education links through sports will benefit young people from both countries who will gain from each other’s expertise and skills.”

Several New Zealand universities offer qualifications and programmes in sports, often in close cooperation with our high performance sports centres, and sporting bodies.

Details of the scholarships and criteria will be announced later this year following further discussion between the two countries.

Mr Key announced the scholarships as part of his visit to India’s Feroz Shah Kotla cricket stadium.

The visit highlighted sporting education links between New Zealand and India.

He was joined by Stephen Fleming, and students from the Asha Foundation – an NGO working with slum children.
