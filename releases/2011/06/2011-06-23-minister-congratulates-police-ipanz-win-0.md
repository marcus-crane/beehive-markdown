Police Minister Judith Collins today congratulated the New Zealand Police as they took out two top prizes at the Institute of Public Administration New Zealand (IPANZ) Gen-i Public Sector Excellence Awards in Wellington last night.

The annual awards celebrate initiatives within the public sector that are making a positive difference in our communities.

Police’s emergency 111 Deaf TXT service topped the Excellence in Working Together category.

“This fantastic initiative shows the extraordinary commitment by our Police to our deaf and hearing impaired communities,” Ms Collins said.

“Thanks to this service, those New Zealanders who are deaf or hearing impaired can now have quick access to emergency services no matter where they are.”

The Deaf Text Service is the first of its kind in the world and following its success in New Zealand, Australia and Canada are now looking to set up similar services.

The NZ Police Ethnic Strategy Towards 2010 was also awarded the top prize for Excellence in Recognising Ethnic Diversity.

The strategy sees Police engaging across all cultural communities to enhance community safety and help prevent and reduce crime.

“I congratulate the New Zealand Police on their tremendous achievements,” Ms Collins said.

“Both awards demonstrate Police’s commitment to respond positively to the diverse needs of our community.

“I am immensely proud that their work has been acknowledged as being among the finest in the public sector."
