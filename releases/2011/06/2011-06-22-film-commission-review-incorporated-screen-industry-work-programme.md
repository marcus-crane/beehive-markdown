The work programme considering government support for the screen sector, including its response to the review of the New Zealand Film Commission (NZFC) by Sir Peter Jackson and David Court, has been released.

“Government initiatives play a significant role in supporting the film and television industries in New Zealand,” Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson said. “So we want to ensure our response to the review by Sir Peter Jackson and David Court is part of a work programme looking at government initiatives across the sector.”

“Our screen industry, including film and television production, makes a substantial contribution to the New Zealand economy,” Economic Development Minister David Carter said. “The sector generated almost $3 billion of gross revenue in the year ending March 2010. We need to look at enhancing the potential in the industry as well as meeting our cultural objectives.”

Major areas being considered include evaluations of the Large Budget Screen Production Grant and Screen Production Incentive Fund, screen training and professional development services, physical screen sector infrastructure, and New Zealand’s international film co-production agreements.

The Ministries for Culture and Heritage and Economic Development are working together on a joint programme which considers these and other initiatives. The work programme will go through to June 2012 and will involve consultation with other agencies and the wider screen sector.

“We recognise that the Film Commission has implemented a number of changes suggested in Sir Peter Jackson’s review, and is continuing to make further changes following its release,” Mr Finlayson said. “The review has also provided an excellent starting point for considering wider government support for the screen sector beyond the role of the role of the Commission.”

“To this end, we are working together on ensuring the effectiveness of key government interventions in the screen sector,” Mr Carter said.
