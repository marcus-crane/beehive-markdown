Pacific radio stations Niu FM and 531pi are relocating to new studios in South Auckland, Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman announced today.

Dr Coleman confirmed the National Pacific Radio Trust has secured a special $725,000 grant from NZ On Air to move from its dated Ponsonby premises to the heart of the Pacific community in Manukau.

The trust operates three broadcasting services – Niu FM Network, Niu FM Auckland (103.8 FM) and Radio 531pi.  Niu Fm has thrived since it was established in 2002 with the objective of delivering a national Pacific radio network and has now outgrown its current premises. The Trust aims to move within the next six months.

‘’The studio equipment is obsolete and the current premises are far removed from the community served by the stations,’’ says Dr Coleman.

‘’The stations provide an important service to Pacific audiences in New Zealand and it’s great NZ On Air has been able to assist.’’

The network provides quality broadcast services and programmes in ten languages (Samoan, Tongan, Cook Islands, Niuean, Fijian, Tokelauan, Tuvaluan, Solomon Islands, Kiribati and English) reflecting the diversity of Pacific peoples and their communities. 

NZ On Air is assuming funding responsibility for Niu FM and 531pi from 1 July 2011.  Funding will be transferred from the Ministry for Culture and Heritage and the trust will receive $3.25 million a year to run Niu FM and 531pi.
