The Minister of Women’s Affairs, Hekia Parata, will host two events tomorrow to celebrate the contribution Maori women make to the economy and to society.

A breakfast event in Auckland tomorrow morning will focus on Maori women in business leadership.  Along with the Minister, the guest speakers are inspiring business women Parekawhia McLean, the chief executive of Tainui and Hinerangi Raumati, a company director.

“Maori women are making a growing contribution to building the kind of enterprising economy we need to build a better future for all New Zealanders,’’ Ms Parata says.

“We need to celebrate that contribution and inspire other young Maori women to use their entrepreneurial and leadership skills in all parts of the economy.’’

Tomorrow night, Ms Parata will co-host a function at Parliament with Hon Tariana Turia.  The function will focus on the priorities for women in Aotearoa New Zealand.

“We want to see all women economically independent and able to practice personal rangatiratanga over all aspects of their futures. This includes the ability to be fully engaged in the economy and fully rewarded for their skills,’’ Ms Parata says.

“We also want to see more women in leadership roles on the boards of state, private and Maori sector organisations.

"Diversity of leadership and in governance creates the possibility of greater innovation. That's why I want to encourage a greater leavening of current board membership. It future-proofs us.

“We also need a society where women are safe, strong and free from violence.’’

The Mana Wahine events’ coincide with the end of Matariki, the Maori New Year.

“Matariki reminds us that we need to look back to look forward,’’ Ms Parata says.

“We are building on the foundations laid by those who went before us, and we need to provide that same solid base for the next generation of leaders.’’

 

**Background Info:**

**What is Mana Wahine / He Wahine Pumanawa?**

Mana Wahine / He Wahine Pumanawa has been celebrated annually by the Ministry of Women’s Affairs, and by other organisations, since 1993. Traditionally events have been in April or May, but in recent years the Ministry has celebrated later in the year to coincide with Matariki. Mana Wahine / He Wahine Pumanawa is one way of celebrating the important role and achievements of Maori women as tangata whenua, and to highlight the contributions that Maori women make to different aspects of Aotearoa  New Zealand.
