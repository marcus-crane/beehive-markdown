The countdown is on to get a million New Zealanders immunised against seasonal influenza with almost 950,000 doses of vaccine distributed so far.

"Last year more than a million doses of flu vaccine were distributed by the end of the flu season, and the signs are good that we will reach this milestone again by the end of July," says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

“The pandemic showed New Zealanders how serious flu can be. Although flu can be a mild to moderate illness for most of us, for some people, it can lead to serious complications – even death. 

“With the official start of winter this week, it’s important people who want to get protected against flu get immunised as soon as possible as it can take up to two weeks to develop immunity, ” says Mr Ryall.

"People may not realise that getting the flu is also very expensive as was seen in a recent study of the H1N1 flu pandemic," says Mr Ryall.

The analysis of critical care costs of the pandemic in Australia and New Zealand in 2009 showed the average total hospital cost of a swine flu patient was NZ$110,000 – including NZ$85,000 for treatment in an  intensive care unit alone.

The study was based on 762 patients admitted to ICU in Australia and New Zealand during the pandemic, between 1 June and 31 august 2009.

The 2011 seasonal flu vaccine provides protection against three strains of flu including the Pandemic H1N1 (swine flu), seasonal H3N2 and B viruses, which are all expected to circulate this season.

Influenza immunisation is free for New Zealanders at high risk of complications– people aged 65 and over and anyone under 65 years of age with certain long term health conditions. Pregnant women are also eligible for free influenza immunisation as studies have shown they are particularly susceptible to severe complications from influenza.

Free flu immunisation is available to eligible groups until 31 July.

"This year free flu immunisation has also been offered to Cantabrians under the age of 18 as part of the response to the Christchurch earthquake."

"New Zealanders are opting in increasing numbers to get immunised against flu. About three years ago we would only have distributed about 750,000 doses of flu vaccine by this time. This year we’ve distributed almost 200,000 more," says Mr Ryall.
