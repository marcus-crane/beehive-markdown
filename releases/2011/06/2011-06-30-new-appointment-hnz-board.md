Whaimutu Dewes has been appointed to the Housing New Zealand (HNZ) Board for a period of three years, says Housing Minister Phil Heatley.

"I am delighted that Whai Dewes has accepted a position on the Board," says Mr Heatley.

"HNZ is currently going through a period of significant change as it works to implement its Social Housing Reform Programme, which will see it refocus its efforts on its core business of providing social housing to those most in need, for the duration of that need.

"Mr Dewes has considerable legal and business experience and is a welcome addition to HNZ’s Board. I am sure the mana, knowledge and range of experience he brings to the role will greatly appreciated," says Mr Heatley.

"I'm confident this Board has the right mix of skills and experience to lead the efficient and effective delivery of social housing by HNZC, as it adapts its housing portfolio to ensure it has the right houses, that are the right size, and in the right place to meet tenants' needs,” he said.
