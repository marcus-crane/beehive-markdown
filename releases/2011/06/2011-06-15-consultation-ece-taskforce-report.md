Education Minister Anne Tolley has launched an eight-week consultation on the recently-released independent Early Childhood Education Taskforce report.

“I want to encourage parents, families, whānau, employers and the ECE sector to have their say on the report’s recommendations,” says Mrs Tolley. 

“The taskforce was established to review the effectiveness of ECE spending and to make recommendations on proposed improvements, including changes to funding and policy settings.

“The taxpayer is investing $1.4 billion in ECE funding in the year ahead, and the Government is totally committed to a quality early childhood education system that works for all children and families.”

The consultation ends on 8 August.
