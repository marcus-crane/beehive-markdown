Revenue Minister Peter Dunne today announced the launch of a new student loans web page that brings together all the information people would need before taking out a loan, while they are studying and once their repayment obligation starts.

“Effectively, this is a ‘landing’ page that will allow prospective students, students and those who have completed their studies and have student loans to pay off to access all the information and tools they need.

“Effectively it becomes a one-stop shop because from the landing page, borrowers will be able to access student loan information and tools available on the StudyLink and Inland Revenue websites and the agencies’ secure online services,” Mr Dunne said.

StudyLink is responsible for processing student loan applications and managing the loan while borrowers are studying.  Inland Revenue is then responsible for collecting loan repayments once it is transferred to them. 

“The Student Loan page will help ensure future borrowers are aware of what a loan entails, the eligibility criteria, and the responsibilities that come with a loan, before actually applying,” he said.

“For existing borrowers it will make it much easier to monitor and manage their repayments and keep up with information about what’s happening with the scheme.”
