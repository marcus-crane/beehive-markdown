The final dates for New Zealand television going digital were announced today by Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman.

Confirming the timetable for the biggest change to television broadcasting since the introduction of colour gives certainty to viewers who are yet to go digital, says Dr Coleman.

‘’We’re planning for the start of a fully digital TV age where New Zealanders can enjoy better pictures and sound, more choice and benefits such as onscreen television guides,’’ Dr Coleman says.

‘’Almost eight out of ten New Zealanders are already watching digital television and I’m encouraging those who are not to plan and prepare now.’’

The switchover will occur in four stages:

\- Hawke’s Bay and the West Coast at 2:00am on Sunday 30 September 2012

\- Rest of the South Island at 2:00am on Sunday 28 April 2013

\- Lower North Island, Taranaki and Gisborne at 2:00am on Sunday 29 on September 2013

\- Rest of the North Island at 2:00am on Sunday 1 December 2013.

Today’s announcement coincides with the launch of Going Digital’s television and newspaper advertising campaign on June 10 to let people know what is required to go digital.

Households that have Freeview, Sky or TelstraClear, are already set for digital television. Other viewers do not need to buy a new television to go digital, but may need to buy a set-top box and possibly a new aerial or satellite dish depending on what equipment they currently have and where they live.

More information on Going Digital is available from www.goingdigital.co.nz or by phoning 0800 838 800.
