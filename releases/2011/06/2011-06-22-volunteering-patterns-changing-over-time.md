The Associate Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Hekia Parata, welcomes new data released by Statistics New Zealand that shows that 69 per cent of people are undertaking unpaid work outside of their own households.

This includes a participation rate of 27 per cent for unpaid work in non-profit organisations.

The Time Use Survey involved 9,159 people aged 12 years and older, who completed questionnaires and two-day diaries about how they spent their time.

Data from 2009/10 was compared to a previous 1998/99 survey.

“The results of this survey show a strong willingness by New Zealanders to get out and support organisations, neighbours and extended family,’’ Ms Parata says.

"While this survey was undertaken prior to the Canterbury earthquakes, the huge amount of time people are volunteering there underlines the generous spirit of New Zealanders,’’ Ms Parata says.

“Interestingly, there is an increased rate of formal volunteering for organisations by youth and older people.” 

The participation rate of 12-24 year-olds undertaking unpaid work for organisations increased from 19 per cent to 24 per cent over the past 11 years. The rate of people in the 65+ age group who volunteer for organisations increased from 31 per cent to 38 per cent.

However, the actual amount of time that people spend in formal volunteering activities has decreased for everyone aged 25-years and over.

“This indicates that people want to volunteer, but in shorter bursts of activity. Community organisations are aware of the need to offer flexible options for volunteering that meet people’s availability,” Ms Parata says.

Gender differences are also apparent, with 63 per cent of men’s work being paid, while 65 per cent of women’s work was unpaid. 

“I commend Statistics New Zealand for providing this new data during Volunteer Awareness Week, and in a year that marks the 10th anniversary of International Year of Volunteers 2001,” Ms Parata says.

The Time Use Survey will provide base information for a second “non-profit institutions satellite account” which will compile and analyse statistics on non-profit organisations and is due for release in 2012/13.
