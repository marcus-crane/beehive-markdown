Biosecurity Minister David Carter has reiterated the Government’s commitment to Government Industry Agreements (GIA) in a round of meetings with leading industry representatives this week.

Mr Carter says strengthened partnerships between industry and government will lead to better results in dealing with incursions of pests and diseases.

“In discussion with industry, the Government has agreed to meet a minimum cost share of 50% for priority readiness and response programmes,” says Mr Carter.

“This underpins the Government’s willingness to work in partnership with industry to ensure New Zealand has the best biosecurity system possible.”

Mr Carter says the timeframe for the signing of the GIA Deed of Agreement still enables industry groups to engage on the finer details of the legal Deed.

“Government Industry Agreements are about joint decision-making. I urge industry to continue to collaborate closely with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry so that any issues are worked through before the Deed is finalised by Cabinet.”
