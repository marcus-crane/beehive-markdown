Transport Minister Steven Joyce says there is no room for complacency on the roads as we head into Queens Birthday weekend.

“While this year got off to a positive start in terms of the road toll, the last few days have sadly brought with them a significant number of fatal accidents on the roads as winter sets in.

“All road users need to be mindful of the weather conditions and extra traffic on the roads this holiday weekend and be extra vigilant.”

So far this year the road toll stands at 120, 60lower than at the same time last year and the lowest in more than 30 years.

Mr Joyce says a number of factors will have contributed to the lower road toll, including public attitudes to safety on the road, enforcement measures and higher fuel prices.

“However, the reality is that progress seen so far this year, while encouraging, is a long way from a permanent step-change to a lower road toll.

“To help achieve that change, the government is introducing a number of mechanisms that will help bring the toll down.

“Changes to the driving age, a nil drink drive limit for repeat offenders and young drivers, introducing alcohol interlocks and, in the longer term, making improvements to major highways through the Roads of National Significance will all help reduce crashes.  These will sit alongside the cell phone rule, drugged driving legislation and illegal street racing legislation.

“Ultimately, of course, governments can only do so much, and a very significant number of fatalities are caused by drivers making poor choices and operating outside the existing road rules.

“I urge all road users to continue their vigilance on the roads.  As we approach Queen’s Birthday weekend we all need to take personal responsibility in the driving decisions we make to keep ourselves, our families and other road users safe.”
