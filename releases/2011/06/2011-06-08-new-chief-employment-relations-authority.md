A new Chief of the Employment Relations Authority has been appointed by Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson.

Alastair Dumbleton will lead the organisation through to May 2015.

“The ERA is a very valuable part of New Zealand’s employment relations system. Its members investigate and resolve employment relationship problems and Mr Dumbleton has vast experience in this area,” Ms Wilkinson says.

“Mr Dumbleton was the Authority’s inaugural Chief from October 2000 to December 2003.

“He has extensive experience of adjudication and mediation work, and was the Department of Labour’s Auckland District Solicitor before joining the former Employment Tribunal and becoming its Chief in 1995.”

The Minister also paid tribute to outgoing Chief James Wilson.

“Mr Wilson has been with the Authority for 10 years and as Chief he has led it with distinction for nearly eight of those. I am grateful for the work he and his members have undertaken during his tenure.”
