Agriculture and Economic Development Minister David Carter will represent New Zealand at the inaugural Global Research Alliance Ministerial Summit in Rome next week, and travel to Milan and London.

While in Rome, Mr Carter will also lead the New Zealand delegation to the 37th meeting of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) where he will deliver New Zealand’s Ministerial Statement and participate in the election of the new Director-General of the FAO.

“These are both significant agricultural ministerial meetings, particularly with New Zealand’s leadership role in the Global Research Alliance, and they enable our views on food security and climate change to be heard at an international level,” says Mr Carter.

The Minister will hold bilateral meetings with visiting agricultural Ministers at the events.

Mr Carter will travel to Milan and London for a range of trade promotion and economic development events focused on green growth, health tech and primary sector exports.

He will also visit Wales to meet with HRH The Prince of Wales and undertake a number of rural engagements.

“International trends in sustainability and integrity, especially those driven by major retailers, impact on New Zealand’s exports and it’s important we stay abreast of them, and the opportunities and challenges they present,” Mr Carter says.
