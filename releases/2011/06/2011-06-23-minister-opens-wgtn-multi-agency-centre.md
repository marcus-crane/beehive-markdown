Wellington’s new Multi-Agency Centre, Koru House, underlines the Government’s commitment to provide the best care and support for victims of child abuse, and to bring abusers to justice, Police Minister Judith Collins said.

The new centre, which was opened by Ms Collins today, is a joint initiative between Police, Child, Youth and Family, and the Hutt Valley District District Health Board.

It follows the establishment of similar Multi-Agency Centres in Auckland City, Counties-Manukau and Tauranga.

Ms Collins said that internationally New Zealand rated poorly around the abuse of children and family violence. Wellington District accounts for approximately 12 percent of all child abuse investigations nationally.

“Our children have a right to grow up free from abuse and violence by those who they should be able to look up to and trust,” she said.

“When a child’s life is marred by the horror of abuse or violence, that child must have somewhere to go, and someone they can turn to for help.

“This centre will provide an integrated response to child abuse with a safe and supportive environment where child victims can interact with a team of Police, Child Youth and Family and Health professionals investigating allegations of child abuse.

“The centre will allow one-stop access to specialised medical, forensic and psychological services, and enable investigations to be more easily co-ordinated and carried out.”

Ms Collins acknowledged the work of many community organisations, such as Barnardos and Relationship Services, which are working alongside Police and other agencies in child abuse cases.

“Your work underlines just how important Koru House will be in providing help and support to the most vulnerable members of this community.”
