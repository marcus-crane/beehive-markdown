Prime Minister John Key today welcomed ANZ’s $1 billion dollar commitment of special mortgage lending to help Christchurch homeowners relocate.

ANZ today announced it has committed $1 billion in new residential mortgage lending, with a low interest rate, to help residents relocate from the residential red zone.

“This announcement is welcomed by the Government,” says Mr Key.

“It shows that despite the earthquakes, there is business confidence in Christchurch and Canterbury.

“As the Government and community move ahead into the rebuilding phase, it is important that the business community continues to get in behind Canterbury and its residents.

“I welcome this as another vote of confidence in Christchurch and Canterbury. I note that this is another example of a major bank that has made a strong commitment to the region since the devastating earthquakes struck.”
