Minister for Food Safety Kate Wilkinson today welcomed the appointments of Andrew McKenzie and Neil Walker as New Zealand’s new members of the Food Standards Australia New Zealand board.

Andrew McKenzie has a background in veterinary public health and food safety, food regulation, international trade and financial management. 

In particular, he has an extensive knowledge of the New Zealand food regulation system as he led the New Zealand Food Safety Authority from its inception in 2002 until 2010. 

Neil Walker is a food scientist who has spent over 35 years working in senior roles in the New Zealand dairy industry for Kiwi Dairies and Fonterra. 

He is also currently the chair of the dairy section of the New Zealand Institute of Food Science and a fifth term councillor on the Taranaki District Council.

“Both Andrew and Neil have considerable expertise in New Zealand’s food industry and regulatory environment and I’m confident they will make excellent contributions to the joint food regulation system,” Ms Wilkinson says.

“I would also like to thank outgoing members Winsome Parnell and Dianne Yates for their contribution to the board.”

The appointments are for terms of three years.
