Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has announced the make-up of the community forum to provide him with information and advice on earthquake recovery matters.

The forum will consist of 38 members from a wide cross-section of the Canterbury community representing business and ethnic interests, as well as residents associations and groups.

The forum includes Canterbury Communities' Earthquake Recovery Network (CanCERN) chair Tom McBrearty, New Zealand Council of Trade Union's earthquake co-ordinator Marty Braithwaite, Ballantynes managing director Richard Ballantyne, and CCS Disability Action national manager Ruth Jones.

Under the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act, the forum must consist of at least 20 members and meet at least six times a year.

"There was a high level of interest in this forum with more than 230 nominations received from community and special interest groups, individuals, and local MPs," Mr Brownlee said.

"The number and quality of the nominations means the final group is much larger than required by the legislation, which is great as it means more people have a voice in the recovery process."

Mr Brownlee also holds regular briefings with local elected representatives, including community board members, councillors and district health board members, in Canterbury to discuss progress on recovery.

The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) has committed to engaging broadly with the community through a range of mechanisms, including the community forum, social media, newsletters, local elected members' briefings, and regular media updates.

The full list of community forum members is (in alphabetical order by surname): Sally Ansley, Lynne Ball, Richard Ballantyne, Marty Braithwaite, Ross Brereton, Glenda Burt, Leah Carr, Joseph Chamberlain, Belinda Charteris, Weng Kei Chen, Gill Cox, Leanne Curtis, Martin Evans, Rachael Fonotia, Kath Fox, Wendy Gilchrist, Maria Godinet-Watts, Linton Gray, Ruth Jones, Paul Lonsdale, Tom McBrearty, Deborah McCormick, Trevor McIntyre, Lesley Murdoch,  Jocelyn Papprill, Faye Parfitt, Brian Parker, John Peet, Bruce Russell, Patricia Siataga, Walter Stone, Emma Twadell, Suzanne Vallance, Brian Vieceli, Rachel Vogan, Steve Wakefield, Siong Sah (John) Wong, and Darren Wright.
