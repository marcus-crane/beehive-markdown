From modest beginnings some four years ago, Samoan Language Week has not only grown into a prominent fixture in the national calendar of important events, but it has also gone global says the Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, Georgina te Heuheu

Mrs te Heuheu was referring to the myriad of events being staged around New Zealand this week, as well as the entry of Samoan communities in the USA and Australia into New Zealand’s celebrations.

“The growing interest in Samoan Language week reflects not only the increasing impact of Samoan language and culture to add to our diversity, but also the contribution that Samoan people are making to the economic, social and cultural life of New Zealand,” says Mrs te Heuheu.

“Pacific cultures are contributing significantly to New Zealand’s uniqueness. Samoan Language Week is a time for us all to enjoy part of that cultural uniqueness in a positive way.”

Mrs te Heuheu says the Samoan community is the fourth largest ethnic community in New Zealand and Samoan is the third most spoken language in New Zealand after English and Māori.

“Promoting Pacific languages and cultures is one of the Governments priorities and Samoan Language Week gives us all the opportunity to embrace and celebrate the Samoan language in New Zealand, and globally,” says Mrs te Heuheu.

The Samoan Language Week Facebook page has over 4,700 followers from all over the world including Australia and the USA. In New Zealand, widespread support for the celebrations has been taken up by many schools across the country, while in libraries throughout the Auckland region, almost all are paying tribute to Samoan Language Week.

The 2011 theme for Samoan Language Week is Samoa Ola – Samoa Active, focusing on language, sport and healthy living.

“The theme sends out a positive message particularly to Pacific young people. They are the growing part of our population and for that reason Samoan Lanugae Week is important to their future.”

Samoan Language Week runs from Wednesday 1 June to Tuesday 7 June starting with Samoan Independence Day on Wednesday 1 June.
