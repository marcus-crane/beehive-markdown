Foreign Affairs Minister, Murray McCully, has announced two key appointments to Afghanistan as New Zealand takes the next steps in leading the transition process in the Bamyan region.

The new Ambassador to Afghanistan will be career diplomat Dr Justin Fepuleai. He had recent experience as Deputy Special Coordinator of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) in 2009 and 2010,

The new Provincial Reconstruction Team Director will be Richard Prendergast.  He is a Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade career diplomat who has previously been posted to Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur.

“These are important appointments at an important phase in our efforts in Afghanistan. Bamyan is one of the areas named by the Afghan President recently to begin the process of transition over the coming months” said Mr McCully.

“Their task is to work closely with the Afghan authorities as they help steer the process towards full Afghan governance and rule of law in Bamyan, while also overseeing development and aid projects.”

“Our efforts will be carefully viewed by the international community and we will be expected to provide a good model during the handover process,” said Mr McCully.
