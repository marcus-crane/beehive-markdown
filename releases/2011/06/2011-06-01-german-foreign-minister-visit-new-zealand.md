German Foreign Minister, Dr Guido Westerwelle, will visit New Zealand on Thursday and Friday this week to hold talks with Foreign Minister, Murray McCully, in Auckland.

“Germany is an important bilateral partner, the largest EU Member State and a key international player, so I’m delighted to host the first visit by a German Foreign Minister since 2005,” said Mr McCully.

“This visit provides a valuable opportunity to engage with Dr Westerwelle on issues in the Middle East and Afghanistan. I am also looking forward to discussing the expansion of New Zealand’s relationship with the European Union,” he said.

Dr Westerwelle will also meet with the Prime Minister, Rt Hon John Key, and the Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister, Hon Chris Finlayson.
