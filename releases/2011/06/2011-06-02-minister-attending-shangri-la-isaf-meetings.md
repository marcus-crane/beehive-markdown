Defence Minister Wayne Mapp is on his way to Singapore, Israel and Europe for a range of meetings in both his portfolios.

Dr Mapp’s first stop is Singapore, where he will take part in the annual Shangri-La Dialogue this weekend.

“New Zealand is a leader in the Asia-Pacific region. The Shangri-La Dialogue is an important component in maintaining close relations with other governments in the area. Most of the region’s Defence Ministers will be there,” he said.

The Minister’s visit to Israel focuses on Science and Innovation. Accompanied by the Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor, Sir Peter Gluckman, he will meet the Israeli Minister of Science and Technology, Daniel Hershkowitz, and senior scientists next Monday.

He is also scheduled to host a dinner for prominent members of the Israeli science and innovation community, including Professor Mina Teicher, a member of the panel conducting the New Zealand high-value manufacturing review.

“There is considerable scope for co-operation between New Zealand and Israeli research institutions and science and innovation generally. This visit will stimulate greater collaboration in these areas between the two countries,” the Minister said.

Dr Mapp will also lay a wreath at the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade Hill memorial in Ness Ziona, near Tel Aviv, and meet Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak. Later in the week he will visit North Camp at el-Gorah, the headquarters of the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO), currently commanded by New Zealand Major-General Warren Whiting.

The final stop is Brussels, where the Minister will attend the six-monthly meetings of NATO/ISAF Defence Ministers.

“These meetings provide an opportunity for high-level briefings on progress in Afghanistan and for Ministers to exchange views and ideas,” Dr Mapp said.
