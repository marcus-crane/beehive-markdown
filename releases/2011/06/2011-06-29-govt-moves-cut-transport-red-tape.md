Cabinet has approved changes to transport planning legislation as part of ongoing efforts to cut unnecessary red tape and get New Zealand moving.

Transport Minister Steven Joyce says amendments to the Land Transport Management Act 2003 (LTMA) will make the transport planning process simpler, more streamlined and less prescriptive.

“The current legislation is far too complicated. It has resulted in confusing and convoluted decision making, ambiguity between planning documents, and onerous consultation processes.

“When passed, the updated legislation will promote a better alignment between central and local government roles in the transport sector. Local government will have more flexibility around its transport planning and fewer processes and procedures to manage.”

Changes in the Bill will include:

- Almost halving the number of transport committee members around the country from 228 to 118.
- Halving the number of formal transport plans or strategies required around the country from 35 to 18.
- Removing barriers to the use of the tolling and public private partnership provisions in the LTMA.
- Implement a previous Cabinet decision to halt the introduction of regional fuel taxes, which would have added further costs to road users and been an expensive and inefficient means of gathering revenue.

The legislation will greatly simplify the number of tests and criteria used to assess transport projects.

“These changes will reduce regulation and compliance while delivering similar outcomes.  This will allow Councils to save money, and release more funding to be spent on actual transport solutions.”

Amending legislation is expected to be introduced to Parliament within the next six to nine months.
