The Government is increasing funding for adult restorative justice by $2 million, Justice Minister Simon Power announced today.

Mr Power said restorative justice helps address the harm done to victims, holds offenders to account for their crimes, and reduces re-offending.

The Ministry of Justice funds restorative justice services prior to sentencing – cases both before a judge and those that have been referred through the Police Adult Diversion Scheme. Judges can refer any case for restorative justice, from lower level offending to very serious charges, where the offender pleads guilty.

“There is mounting evidence, both in New Zealand and internationally, about the positive benefits restorative justice provides for both victims and offenders," Mr Power said.

“A newly published report by the Ministry of Justice shows that offenders who took part in restorative justice conferences in 2009 had a re-offending rate 20 per cent lower than similar offenders who did not take part.

“Another report, which is being finalised, shows that victims report a high level of satisfaction after being given the opportunity to participate directly in the criminal justice process through pre-sentence restorative justice.

“At the moment, restorative justice receives about $2 million a year to fund about 1500 restorative justice conferences through 24 community providers at 31 District Courts, as well as supporting a national facilitator training programme, national conferences, and the national provider body – Restorative Justice Aotearoa.

“Only about 5 per cent of eligible cases – where the offender pleads guilty and there is an identifiable victim – are referred to restorative justice."

The reprioritisation means that in 2011/12 and 2012/13 restorative justice will receive an extra $500,000, while in 2013/14 and out-years it will receive an extra $1 million.

“This new funding will help increase the number of restorative justice conferences, particularly in areas with high Maori populations and high offending.

“Increasing restorative justice also supports the whole-of-government priority to address the drivers of crime by providing alternative approaches to managing low-level offenders and offering pathways out of offending.

“This announcement builds on the review of victims' rights which was announced last month, and which requires criminal justice agencies to provide victims with information about restorative justice, and district courts to refer eligible cases for restorative justice where services are available.”
