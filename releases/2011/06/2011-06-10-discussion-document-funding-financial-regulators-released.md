Commerce Minister Simon Power today released a discussion document on third-party funding options for the Financial Markets Authority, the External Reporting Board, the Companies Office, and the Insolvency Trustee Service.

“New Zealand needs well-functioning financial markets to entice investors back so businesses have access to the capital they need to grow, and a key component of that is for the regulators to be at the top of their game,” Mr Power said.

"We've given the main financial market regulator, the Financial Markets Authority (FMA), more grunt and it needs resources to deliver on that.

“In particular, the FMA has taken on new regulatory functions to help lift the bar in terms of market behaviour, and drive a culture of visible, proactive, and timely enforcement."

The discussion document proposes two levies to cover the cost of these extra functions, and of administering the Financial Advisers Act.

Examples of proposed levels of fees and levies can be found in appendix 1 of the discussion document, which is available here.

“The Government recognises that in order for the FMA to do its job it needs to be adequately resourced, and market participants, who stand to benefit from operating in this stronger regulatory environment, should contribute to that.”

The Government has previously announced that from 2014/15 the FMA’s budget will be about $26 million – an increase of around 44 per cent over the $18 million budget for the current regulators.

The discussion document also proposes:

• New charges to fund the FMA’s responsibilities for the new auditor oversight regime, which is a core element of financial market confidence.

• A levy to cover some of the operational costs of the additional functions of the External Reporting Board, which will be responsible for all financial reporting, audit, and assurance standards-setting.

• Changes to the fee structure of the Companies Office and the Insolvency and Trustee Service, to cover the costs of providing these services to companies.

The FMA’s new powers include the ability to exercise an investor’s right to take civil action against a financial market participant, the ability to prevent products from being structured to avoid being supervised by the FMA, and enhanced warning powers to deal with low-ball unsolicited offers.

Submissions close on 8 July.
