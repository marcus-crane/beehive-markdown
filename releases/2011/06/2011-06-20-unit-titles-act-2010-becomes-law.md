Housing Minister Phil Heatley describes the updated Unit Titles Act that comes into force today, as a ‘game changer’.

"When the Act was originally drafted in 1972 the market was nowhere near as complex as it is now," says Mr Heatley.

"The updated Unit Titles Act, modernises legislation that is over 30 years old. The former Act was considered to be outdated and no longer fit for purpose. The new Act will bring unit title developments into line with today’s property market," he said.

As of the middle of last year, there were nearly 18,500 unit title developments in this country, comprising more than 120,000 units.

"The revised Act aims to ensure that the diverse and complex range of unit title developments can be managed more effectively. It will also provide a clear and flexible mechanism for both simple and complex developments to be created in the future," says Mr Heatley.

The work to modernise the Act has been led by the Department of Building and Housing, who are responsible for providing advice and information services. A new dispute resolution service will also be provided under the Act.

"The Tenancy Tribunal can now hear disputes arising in developments such as apartment buildings,” says Minister Heatley.

"The Tribunal has been responsible for hearing disputes between landlords and tenants for many years. Now they can unlock some of those unit titles disputes that our evidence suggests are out there.

"The voting threshold is also being lowered to help bodies corporate reach decisions including decisions about keys issues such as dispute resolution or access to other services, like weathertightness remediation," says Mr Heatley.

"Currently, for many body corporate decisions, each and every unit owner must vote in favour of a motion for it to pass. . That’s changing to 75% of the owners who actually vote at a meeting. This will simplify process for bodies corporate who want to take action, as resolutions will need fewer owners to agree – although a majority will still be required.

"It is expected that this will settle some long running disputes in unit title developments where, in the past, a minority of unit owners could halt progress on a resolution for change.

"More simple disputes can now be managed by The Department of Building and Housing for example those that arise around pets, parking and parties when people are living closely together," says Mr Heatley.

The new Act makes a number of other improvements to provide a more modern framework for the joint ownership and management of buildings. More information is available on the Department of Building and Housing website at [www.dbh.govt.nz/unit-titles](http://www.dbh.govt.nz/unit-titles).
