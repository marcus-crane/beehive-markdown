Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson has appointed Anthony Ahern to the Electrical Workers Registration Board and reappointed Michael Macklin.

Both are registered electricians and will serve for terms of three years. Mr Ahern replaces Stephen Albrecht who decided not to seek a further term.

“Mr Ahern brings strong strategic and financial skills to the Board,” Mr Williamson says.

Mr Ahern holds a Master of Commerce in Management Science and a Bachelor of Science in Operations Research, and has also completed the Institute of Directors Company Directors’ Course. 

The Electrical Workers Registration Board was established under section 148 of the Electricity Act 1992 (the Act).

The Board’s main functions are to register electrical workers and ensure competency of those workers in order to guarantee public safety.

Mr Williamson congratulates both men in their appointments.
