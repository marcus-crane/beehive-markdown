Health Minister Tony Ryall has announced that four District Health Boards  (DHBs) will trial a programme to lift performance in endoscopy units and make procedures such as colonoscopy a more comfortable experience.

Waitemata, Lakes, Wairarapa and Canterbury have been selected to run the year-long trial, beginning in August.

"The programme is based on a UK protocol called the Global Rating Scale (GRS). Three years after being introduced, UK endoscopy units increased the number of patients being seen on time from 16 percent to 82 percent".

GRS establishes protocols for endoscopy units to measure their performance, identify weak points and make improvements.

Mr Ryall says, "It provides insights into both technical performance and patient satisfaction, along with support and advice to make improvements."

"Endoscopy procedures such as colonoscopy can be worrying for patients.  They often tell me the procedure is embarrassing, and can sometimes be uncomfortable.

"GRS allows units to track feedback from patients, specify areas for improvement and benefit from the innovations shared by other units. 

“Endoscopy services need to be operating efficiently and effectively in order to deliver the increasing number of colonoscopies needed by our ageing population. “

Nearly 38,000 New Zealanders received colonoscopies to investigate for bowel cancer and other serious bowel issues in 2009/10 – 2346 more than the previous year. This number is expected to increase when the Bowel Screening Pilot begins in Waitemata DHB in October.
