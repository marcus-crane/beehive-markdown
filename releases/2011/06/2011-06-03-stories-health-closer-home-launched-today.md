- Community workers throat swabbing schoolchildren for rheumatic fever;
- a rural woman with lung and heart disease managing her symptoms from home with a tele-health monitor and;
- an integrated family health centre  that offers telephone consults and 'virtual' appointments for their patients' convenience.

These are some of the case studies featured in a new Ministry of Health booklet illustrating the strides being made in bringing better, sooner, more convenient health care to New Zealanders.

Launching 'Better Sooner, More Convenient Health Care in the Community' at a meeting of the PHO Alliance in Wellington today, Health Minister Tony Ryall said the National Government has given GPs , nurses,  pharmacists and others greater funding flexibility and freedom to design local solutions for local need.

"These are the dedicated and experienced people who know the health needs of their communities best and how best to meet them," said Mr Ryall.

"Over the next ten years it is thought demand for healthcare will double but we can't double our hospitals or the numbers of doctors and nurses in New Zealand.

"Instead we need GP clinics and other community health care services to take some of the load off hospitals –and let the hospitals concentrate on the more serious and urgent health cases.

"This booklet shows how hospital and community health professionals are already doing that - sharing information and ideas and working together collaboratively to streamline and improve health care for New Zealanders."

"This booklet is the latest in a series recording changes and improvements in public health services for health professionals to share."
