Health Minister Tony Ryall today opened a state of the art, $9.2 million Dialysis Centre at North Shore Hospital – enabling Waitemata renal patients to receive their care closer to home.

"Auckland DHB is also moving to establish dialysis services for patients closer to home.  It is on track to establish three community based dialysis centres, most likely near primary care clinics, with the first one planned for east Auckland next year," said Mr Ryall.

At Waitemata DHB, until recently, patients had to travel into central Auckland for treatment.

"We face an increasing demand for dialysis services because of the growth in diabetes.  This government is committed to ensuring more people get services closer to home," said Mr Ryall.

"Waitemata has an increasingly ageing population with a higher incidence of kidney disease, often caused by high blood pressure, and more people who are at a higher risk of developing diabetes.

"From July 4, Waitemata District Health Board's 250 dialysis patients, 140 transplant recipients and several hundred people with advanced chronic kidney disease will be able to get their treatment on their side of the harbour bridge," said Mr Ryall.

The renal service will diagnose and manage all forms of kidney disease, care for patients before and after renal transplants and provide on-site support for other hospital services.

As part of that service, North Shore Dialysis Centre will accommodate up to 48 dialysis patients a day, six days a week and also include a peritoneal dialysis unit.

Six out of ten Waitemata patients manage their dialysis needs at home and services for these patients will be improved next, along with the development of a radiology and renal vascular access surgery service at North Shore Hospital.
