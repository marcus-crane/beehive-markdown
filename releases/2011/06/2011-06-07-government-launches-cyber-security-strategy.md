The Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Steven Joyce, has today launched a new strategy to improve New Zealand’s protection against cyber threats.

Mr Joyce says cyber security is increasingly important to New Zealanders, business and government.

“Criminal elements are increasingly using the internet to gain access to personal information, steal business’ intellectual property, undermine critical services and gain knowledge of sensitive government-held information for financial or other malicious purposes.

“New Zealand’s Cyber Security Strategy is the government’s strategic response to the growing cyber threat.  It brings forward targeted initiatives aimed at improving cyber security for individuals, businesses, critical national infrastructure and government."

The Government will work in partnership with critical national infrastructure providers and other businesses to help them address evolving cyber threats.  The Government will also establish a National Cyber Security Centre to help protect government agencies from sophisticated cyber attacks. 

“The actions contained in New Zealand’s Cyber Security Strategy will significantly improve New Zealand’s cyber security response and create a strong platform which we can build from to meet new cyber security challenges as they emerge,” says Mr Joyce.

The Strategy has been developed in consultation with industry and government cyber security experts, non-government organisations, academia and our international security partners.

The strategy is available on the Ministry of Economic Development’s website: [www.med.govt.nz/cyberstrategy](http://www.med.govt.nz/cyberstrategy)
