Revenue Minister Peter Dunne today launched an updated version of the Sussed programme which gives senior secondary school students an insight into the costs of tertiary study and the financial support available to them.

After attending a ‘Sussed’ presentation of the revamped programme to about 100 senior Tawa College students in Wellington today, Mr Dunne said it was “essential viewing” for anyone considering going to a university, polytechnic, or wananga.

"The name Sussed reflects the objective of the programme very well and in terms that young people understand. It is about getting it sussed.

“It is about ensuring that young people have all the information they need to make good choices in planning their tertiary study and that they know about all the funding options available to them," he said.

Sussed has been developed by StudyLink, the agency responsible for administering student loans and student allowances.

It is presented to Year 12 and 13 students at secondary schools throughout the country, and Sussed Reality Check is available on StudyLink's website: www.studylink.govt.nz/

"It is interactive and guides prospective students through the big questions they face when making decisions about study.

“It covers everything from what their career goals are, where and what they will study, what the course will cost, living costs, what sources of finance they can get, whether it all adds up and who they should talk to.

“It really is a reality check and a tool that parents would want their children to use to cover off all the bases before stepping into tertiary education.

"There is a lot to think about and Sussed breaks it down into useful, accessible, manageable chunks,” Mr Dunne said.

He said that feedback from students and teaching staff has been “overwhelmingly positive”.
