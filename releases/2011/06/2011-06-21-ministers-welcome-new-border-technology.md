Customs Minister Maurice Williamson and Biosecurity Minister David Carter today welcomed the signing of a contract to develop a new border processing and management system.

New Zealand Customs, with MAF, has signed the contract which formally kicks off the development of a joint border management system (JBMS). The new system combines Customs’ and MAF’s existing independent systems, Cusmod and Quantum.

Mr Williamson said the new system would bring very sophisticated technology to the New Zealand’s border.

“Our border processing and management technology is already amongst the best in the world and JBMS will take it to a new level,” he said.

“This contract will benefit of New Zealand’s economy and its security.”

Mr Carter praised the collaboration between the two key border agencies.

“Quite clearly, bringing the two previously independent systems together will give us efficiency benefits and allow more effective facilitation of legitimate trade and improved biosecurity.”
