Police are to be congratulated for seizing over $2 million worth of methamphetamine today, says Police Minister Judith Collins.

A two-month operation, conducted by Police and New Zealand Customs, targeted an Iranian organised crime syndicate operating in the Auckland metro area.

The successful completion of the operation netted 2.3 kilograms of methamphetamine with a street value of $2,380,000. Police also arrested three people and seized $16,000 in cash, a Taser disabling device, a Range Rover and a BMW.

“This is another huge blow to the drug dealers and importers who cause so much damage in our communities. I applaud the Police and all involved for their meticulous work,” says Ms Collins.

“This is a great example of the Police’s continued success in targeting organised crime and working hard to keep this harmful drug off our streets.”

The Government has introduced a raft of policies aimed at tackling criminal gangs and the drugs trade, including a tough new forfeiture law.

As at the end of April, Police and Customs had seized 20.6 kilograms of methamphetamine this year, which is estimated to prevent more than $8 million in social harm. This does not include today’s bust, which was expected to cause almost $1 million in social harm.

So far this year, $38.5 million in criminal assets have been seized and restrained under the tough new forfeiture law passed in 2009. Police are holding a further $8.5 million of assets seized under other legislation.

“This sends a very strong signal to criminals that the Government is serious about taking away the profits of crime and putting gangs out of business.”
