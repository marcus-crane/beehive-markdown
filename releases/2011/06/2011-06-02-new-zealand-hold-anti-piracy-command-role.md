For the first time, a New Zealand naval officer is to take command of the US-led counter-piracy Combined Task Force (CTF151) in the Gulf of Aden, Defence Minister Wayne Mapp announced today.

“Piracy in the Gulf of Aden poses a real threat to international shipping,” the Minister said.

“It threatens life and property and constant vigilance is required to ensure it is controlled. Last year’s Defence White Paper highlights New Zealand’s national interest in countering the threat from piracy.

“New Zealand relies on its sea lanes for nearly all of its trade. Our economy is impacted by piracy, even far from our shores,” he said.

“By sending a command team to this multinational task force, New Zealand is showing its commitment to protecting security and stability in the international maritime environment.”

The New Zealand Defence Force has previously deployed frigates to the Persian Gulf. Individual Defence Force personnel have also participated in CTF 151. These contributions have been recognised with the request by the US-led Combined Maritime Forces Headquarters for New Zealand to take the command role, the Minister said.

The job will be filled by Captain Jim Gilmour RNZN for three months from 30 June. He will be supported by two other New Zealand officers – a Chief of Staff as second-in-command, and a legal adviser.
