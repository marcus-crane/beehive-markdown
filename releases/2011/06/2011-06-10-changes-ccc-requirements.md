The government has agreed to prepare an order in council changing Christchurch City Council’s annual planning and accountability responsibilities, Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee and Local Government Minister Rodney Hide announced today.

"The primary goal of this order in council will be to condense the public consultation period for the council's draft 2011/12 annual plan so they can focus on getting on with the recovery process in Canterbury," Mr Brownlee said.

"We do not want the council to divert resources away from earthquake recovery work in an attempt to comply with the existing rules, some of which are no longer relevant because of the earthquake," he said.

Mr Hide said the proposed order in council would be made under the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011 and would modify provisions in the Local Government Act 2002 and the Energy Companies Act 1992.

"We need a different approach that helps the council and its communities manage the situation they are facing," Mr Hide said.

The government will consult with opposition parties on the order in council and it will need to be considered by the independent Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Review Panel, which is chaired by former senior High Court Judge Sir John Hansen, before it can be approved.

After considering any feedback and making any amendments necessary, the Ministers will recommend the Governor-General approves the order in council to give effect to this decision.

The order in council will also include some provisions that apply to council-owned entities, including Orion New Zealand.
