The Crown has paid $250,000 to settle an injustice created in 1997, when the Karanga Te Kere Whānau Trust lands near Taumarunui were not included in the Māori Reserved Land Amendment Act.

The ex-gratia payment recognises that, because of the 1955 Māori Reserved Land Act, the Trust over time received less than fair market rents for their lands in Taumarunui.

“The Karanga Te Kere Whānau Trust should have been compensated under the Māori Reserved Land Amendment Act 1997, but due to an oversight, their lands were not included,” said Māori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples.

“As the Trust’s lands were not identified and are therefore not covered by the amended legislation to date, the Trust has not received any compensation.  This payment simply recognises the Crown’s oversight, and is not part of a Treaty settlement,” Dr Sharples said.

“The payment will benefit the Karanga Te Kere Whānau Trust and its beneficiaries, as well as the wider community,” said Hon Tariana Turia, Minister Responsible for Whānau Ora.  “We recognise the economic benefits that will accrue to the landowners".

“I am delighted that we have been able to correct this long-standing error, and I am pleased that the Karanga Te Kere Whānau Trust is finally receiving compensation that their beneficiaries are entitled to,” Mrs Turia said.

"It is my personal hope, as it would have been the hope of Archie (the late Sir Atawhai Taiaroa) that the Trust lands will be subject to the Amendment Act in the future"said Mrs Turia.
