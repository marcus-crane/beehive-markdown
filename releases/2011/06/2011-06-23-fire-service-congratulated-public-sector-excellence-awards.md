Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy has congratulated the New Zealand Fire Service for their awards at the IPANZ Public Sector Excellence Awards last night.

“The new national fleet of hazmat/command vehicles have been recognised with the Excellence in Networked Government award, and the Overall Prime Minister's Award for Public Sector Excellence.

“These high-tech vehicles can be used as either a command and control unit for major incidents, or as the response vehicle for a serious hazardous materials incident. Each vehicle has the latest information and communications technology, and can work with other emergency services.

“After the events of 9/11 the New Zealand Fire Service recognised the importance of being able to respond quickly and effectively to a whole range of situations.

“When I officially launched the first new vehicles in Christchurch 15 months ago it was clear they would be a great national asset, but no-one could have foreseen just how important they would become.

“They have proved their worth during the Christchurch earthquakes, the Pike River mining tragedy and will soon be used during the Rugby World Cup tournament. By September of this year there will be 17 of these units based around the country.

“These awards are fitting recognition of the hard work and foresight of the New Zealand Fire Service.”
