The Government and Auckland city today announced further details of plans to deliver the nation’s premier Rugby World Cup 2011 Fanzone, festival and showcase experience on Queens Wharf in Auckland.

Rugby World Cup 2011 Minister Murray McCully and Auckland Mayor Len Brown today gave media a preview of Queens Wharf preparations including a tour of The Cloud, due for completion in July.

“The construction work on the wharf is nearing completion, on time and within budget. We can now start to give a better idea of how we will make use of this facility” said Mr McCully.

“Queens Wharf will be open every day of RWC 2011 with free access. New Zealanders and visitors will be able to watch the rugby on big screens, enjoy free concerts by top kiwi bands and view displays of New Zealand’s creativity, innovation and ingenuity,” he said

Highlights for the Queens Wharf programme confirmed today include:

• An official RWC 2011 Fanzone which will screen all 48 matches live on multiple big screens.

• The homecoming of Tourism New Zealand’s Giant Rugby Ball – with free admission.

• A series of events in The Cloud showcasing the best of New Zealand business and industry ingenuity and innovation.

• A series of live concerts by popular bands and musicians.

“Queens Wharf is the event hub of the REAL New Zealand Festival and live music will be one of the features of Queens Wharf entertainment. Bands confirmed include Opshop, The Feelers, The Black Seeds, Katchafire, Don McGlashan, Greg Johnson, Bella Kalolo, Moana and the Tribe, Tami Neilson and I Am Giant” said Mr McCully.

 

“We are still in the process of securing more acts but I am already confident the line-up we have so far will display the best of kiwi music and provide some excellent entertainment, along with the rugby,” he said.

“The Giant Rugby Ball is also a welcome addition. It has been around the globe on tourism promotions in London, Paris, Tokyo and Sydney. It has always received good feedback and now New Zealanders will be able to enjoy the display during the RWC,” said Mr McCully.

Auckland Mayor Len Brown says Aucklanders and visitors alike should plan to make Queens Wharf the centre of their RWC 2011 plans.

“From the homecoming of the phenomenal Giant Rugby Ball to the Fanzone and the wealth of entertainment, there will be something for everybody.”

The Mayor said the Queens Wharf daily programme will be built around the Tournament’s 48 matches. Shed 10 will be the heart of the Fanzone, but the wharf’s flexible spaces will see the Fanzone expand outdoors and into The Cloud for the Tournament’s biggest matches.

“Queens Wharf will be the country’s biggest official Fanzone and the best place in New Zealand to watch the matches live on screen,” Len Brown said.

“Whether or not you have tickets to matches you can still be a part of RWC 2011 at Queens Wharf with all the action on screen and official merchandise available on site.

“Everyone is invited to Queens Wharf and they will enjoy a festival of rugby and a daily programme of events which will keep them coming back for more.”

The Queens Wharf entertainment programme will be focused around weekends during pool play and the programme intensifies during the school holidays, with special events from the Quarter Finals to the Final weekend.

RWC 2011 sponsors will add to the festival atmosphere on the Wharf.

ANZ is creating The ANZ World, a 16m high, purpose built structure located in the heart of Queens Wharf, which will be open to the public every day during the Tournament. Using the latest in technology and entertainment, visitors will be offered a truly unique and engaging interactive experience.

Heineken will be activating its unique Heineken Experience in the avenue side of Shed 10 during RWC 2011. The experience includes a bar and entertainment offering fresh from the Champions League Finals Festival in Hyde Park, London.

A Brancott Estate wine bar will be located inside The Cloud on Queens Wharf for the duration of RWC 2011, showcasing its award-winning range of wines to visitors from home and abroad who will have the opportunity to attend wine tastings with expert winemakers from Brancott Estate.

DHL, the official logistics partner of RWC 2011, will have an interactive exhibition zone at Queens Wharf. Visitors will be able to enjoy a behind-the-scenes look at Rugby World Cup and the DHL zone will engage and challenge fans, with gaming activities and simulated experiences that will appeal to adults and children alike.

Announcements from other worldwide partners and sponsors and more details of sponsor activities on the wharf are expected in the near future.

The Government’s NZ 2011 office is working with ATEED to deliver the six-week event on Queens Wharf from 9 September to 23 October and the two agencies have appointed Auckland Festival Trust to manage and deliver Queens Wharf. The full programme for Queens Wharf and The Cloud will be announced in August.
