Education Minister Anne Tolley says construction of a proposed new school on the site of the former Waimokoia residential school in Auckland has been put on hold to allow proper consultation to take place with neighbouring schools and the wider community.

Thurston Place College was due to open in January 2012, to cater for thirty students under the care and protection of Child, Youth and Family.

“I’m disappointed that the Ministry of Education did not carry out sufficient consultation,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Local people have not been given the opportunity to learn the facts about the new school, and I’m very concerned about the level of misinformation and malice that has been spread.

“The community will now have the opportunity to get good information, provide constructive feedback and have their concerns addressed.

“Details of the consultation process will be announced soon.

“In the meantime, we will find a way to continue delivering the specialist care and education that these thirty young people need and deserve.”
