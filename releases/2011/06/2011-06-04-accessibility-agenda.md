Minister of Disability Issues Minister, Tariana Turia, has commended the initiative and the leadership of Nelson advocates for people with disabilities in placing the issue of accessibility on the agenda.

“’It was really positive to see the range of submissions presented by the *Accessibility for All* advocates, and others working on behalf of disabled persons to the Nelson City Council in their annual plan hearings” said Mrs Turia. 

“They came up with some simple but effective strategies to facilitate access to the sea for people in wheelchairs and pushing strollers, such as a synthetic matting strip”.

“Their presentations also addressed barriers that impact on the quality of life for the visually impaired; and the ongoing struggles that disabled persons face around access to buildings and public toilets”.

“My advice to Nelson and Tasman Councils would be to look at the model pioneered in Auckland by the Be.Accessible campaign”.

Be.Accessible is a campaign to provide better access for those who may be temporarily or permanently disabled or in need of additional support in order to contribute fully to society.

“It’s about thinking about access in its broadest sense - an accessible physical environment, social networks, specialist mobilitiy services, or personal support”.

“I would encourage all local government authorities to get creative, and see how their communities can also be proud to Be.Accessible” said Mrs Turia.
