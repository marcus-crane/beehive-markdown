New Zealand’s sports clubs will have the incentive to reduce their environmental impact, thanks to a $300,000 grant to Project Litefoot from the Government’s Community Environment Fund, Environment Minister Nick Smith announced today.

Celebrating World Environment Day Dr Smith also announced another $300,000 will go to the Dune Restoration Trust of New Zealand from the same fund to restore indigenous biodiversity in coastal environments throughout the country.

“The Government’s Community Environment Fund of $3 million a year is designed to enable community groups such as Litefoot and the Dune Restoration Trust kick start their environmental projects.

“I am a big fan of Project Lightfoot and its LiteClub initiative because it brings together two of New Zealand’s great passions: sport and the environment,” Dr Smith said. “LiteClub helps sport clubs identify practical ways of reducing their impact on the environment and then work with them to make changes including installing energy efficient light bulbs and insulation.

“The key to the success of this project are our sports stars that adopt clubs from their sporting codes and support and inspire them to make changes. LiteClub ambassadors include All Black Conrad Smith, Black Cap Brendan McCullum, Olympic champions Caroline Meyer, Georgina Earl – the Evers-Swindell Twins – and Barbara Kendall, golfer Michael Campbell, and surfer Daniel Kereopa.”

Dr Smith today also announced the funding for the Dune Restoration Trust by joining it at Onehunga Bay, near Porirua for its coastal re-planting programme.

“Sand dunes are one of the most compromised major ecosystems in New Zealand.  Many dune species are threatened, including sand tussock and pingao. The work of the Trust is helping reverse this trend.

“The Government is keen to support smart initiatives like these that encourage local communities and sports clubs to think about their impact on the environment and help make a positive difference.”
