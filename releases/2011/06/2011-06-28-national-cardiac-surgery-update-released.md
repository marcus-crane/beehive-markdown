Minister of Health Tony Ryall has released a National Cardiac Surgery Update detailing recent improvements in cardiac surgery in New Zealand.

“The update shows the improvements in access to cardiac surgery being made by the Cardiac Surgery Clinical Network which was established in 2009,” the Minister of Health, Tony Ryall said.

Key points made in the update are:

• Cardiac patient waiting times continue to improve

• More patients are receiving cardiac surgery and fewer patients are waiting for surgery

• Regional variation in levels of cardiac surgery are reducing

• More patients are receiving coronary artery stenting

• The number of patients waiting for their First Specialist Assessment continues to fall

“This has been achieved through the hard work and dedication of the many clinicians involved.

“This progress presents new opportunities to further improve the system. To this end the Cardiac Surgery Clinical Network is being expanded to become the New Zealand Cardiac Network.

“This new network will oversee and co-ordinate improvements which focus on the full range of cardiac care, not just surgery, to ensure people have even greater access to cardiac services.

“I look forward to seeing the work of the New Zealand Cardiac Network take shape. It is important that clinicians take the lead in improving health services and I am confident that this network will help provide a blueprint for other clinical networks to follow,” Mr Ryall said.
