The Air Force’s retired Aermacchi jet trainers are up for tender, Defence Minister Wayne Mapp announced today.

The aircraft were withdrawn from service when the Air Combat Force was disestablished in 2001. They will be sold on an “as is, where is” basis, the Minister said.

“We have carefully considered the future of the 16 aircraft. Their age and condition means that they are no longer suitable for military training. Storing them costs money, so a sale by tender is the best option,” he said.

“We expect considerable interest in the sale. The aircraft have been very well maintained throughout their time with the Air Force. In fact, they were still flown occasionally until about a year ago, when they were finally put in storage.”

The package for sale includes 13 complete airframes, six spare engines, and support equipment including specialist maintenance tools and training publications.

“The Aermacchi package could be sold as a whole, as some countries still fly the aircraft. Alternatively, the package could be divided and individual aircraft and parts could be sold separately,” Dr Mapp said.

The remaining three aircraft will go on display at New Zealand aviation museums.
