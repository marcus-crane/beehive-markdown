Veterans’ Affairs Minister Judith Collins today paid tribute to the veterans of D-Day on the 67th anniversary of the Allied landings in Normandy, France.

“Sixty-seven years ago today, nearly 10,000 New Zealanders were involved in the D-Day landings - the largest amphibious military operation in history,” she said.

Although no New Zealand ground forces landed at Normandy on D-Day, they played a valuable part in the campaign as members of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force transporting troops across the English Channel by sea and air. 

More than 150,000 Allied troops were landed on the beaches of Normandy to start the campaign to liberate Western Europe from Nazi Germany. 

“Those New Zealanders who took part in D-Day operations were involved in a pivotal campaign that helped ensure that the Allies were victorious in the Second World War.

“Today is an opportunity to honour the New Zealanders who took part in the D-Day operations, and to acknowledge those D-Day veterans who served with other Allied nations but who now choose to call New Zealand home.

“As the number of surviving World War Two veterans declines, we must ensure that their legacy is not forgotten, and that we continue to honour the memories of those who did not return.”
