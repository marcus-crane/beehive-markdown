Acknowledging the importance of elders as integral to strong families and communities was just one of the key messages raised by the Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, Georgina te Heuheu at a Pacific event marking World Elder Abuse and Awareness Day.

Mrs te Heuheu was acknowledging the work of TOA Pacific Incorporated of Auckland, provider of services to older Pacific people for up to 15 years, mainly in Auckland and Manukau.

“TOA Pacific has made treasuring Pacific elders their number one priority, and an important part of this work has been to raise public awareness of elder abuse and neglect, and ways to prevent these behaviours,” says Mrs te Heuheu.

“Across all communities elder abuse and neglect may not be just physical or emotional. Financial abuse can also be an issue.

"A worry is that sometimes those committing the harm may be family.

“In respect of Pacific families, this cuts right across traditional Polynesian culture of elders as the mainstay of their families and it is important that such cultural norms are supported and maintained in New Zealand.”

Mrs te Heuheu had high praise for all providers who put the support and care of elderly citizens at the forefront of their services.

“Everyone needs to know how to recognise elder abuse and neglect, and take steps to deal with it including speaking out in difficult situations,” she says.

All elderly citizens no matter their background were entitled to independence, participation, self fulfilment and personal dignity, Mrs te Heuheu said.
