Justice Minister Simon Power today announced the 14 members of the new Legal Aid Tribunal, which comes into effect on 1 July.

The tribunal replaces the Legal Aid Review Panel, and will review decisions made by the independent Legal Services Commissioner. The commissioner, who is employed by the Ministry of Justice, has responsibility for granting legal aid under the new Legal Services Act 2011.

The legislation which establishes the tribunal requires the chair and members to be lawyers. They are appointed for three-year terms.

“The membership of the tribunal brings a high level of experience in all categories of legal aid,” Mr Power said.

“The tribunal is an important part of the higher-quality legal aid system the Government is designing in response to Dame Margaret Bazley’s 2009 report.”
