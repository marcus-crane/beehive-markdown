Environment Minister Nick Smith today visited Foxton to launch an action plan instigated by the Manawatu River Leaders Accord for cleaning up the Manawatu River. 

“It is no secret that the Manawatu River has been identified as having serious problems. This action plan represents a major milestone in a healthier future for this significant river. The Accord and its action plan build on the spirit of collaboration in dealing with the difficult issue of fresh water management that was pioneered so successfully by the Land and Water Forum. We’re now seeing that collaborative model being used elsewhere, such as in the Rotorua Lakes,” Dr Smith said. 

“It is pleasing to see the Horizons Regional Council, farming community, iwi, industry and environmental groups making a commitment to work closely together to look for solutions to the water quality issues facing the Manawatu River throughout its catchment.”

Dr Smith welcomed the plan’s focus on reducing the flow of sediment, nutrients and bacteria into the river from industry, farming and erosion as well as protecting native fish and bird habitats, preventing the overuse of water, and reducing the environmental impacts of flood control and drainage schemes.

“The National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management takes effect on 1 July. This is about Government giving clear direction to councils on the importance of improving New Zealand’s fresh water management. It increases the onus on regional councils and territorial authorities to put in place better rules to manage pollution and the effects of land use decisions which is what this action plan does,” Dr Smith said.

“Consensus on this plan clearly signals broad community support for improved efforts to clean up the Manawatu River.”
