Prime Minister John Key announced today the intention of the Australian and New Zealand Governments to proceed with the establishment of the Australia New Zealand Therapeutic Products Agency (ANZTPA).

The new agency will regulate medicines, medical devices and new medical interventions such as cellular therapy.

“Following discussions with Prime Minister Julia Gillard, we have decided officials on both sides of the Tasman will immediately begin work on the implementation of the new agency,” says Mr Key.

The establishment of the ANZTPA is expected to take up to five years.

“New Zealand’s regulatory arrangements for medicines and medical devices need to be updated, and this is a cost-effective and comprehensive way of achieving this.

“We want to move into a situation where all medicines and medical devices are specifically approved for New Zealanders before they are used. Currently, medicines are subject to this approval but medical devices are listed on a notification database which should be improved – the establishment of this new agency provides the opportunity to do so.

“We want to build the capability to ensure new medical technologies are safe to use, and are used safely, in New Zealand.”

The New Zealand Government’s review of the proposed separate scheme for natural health products in five years’ time will consider whether or not to maintain a separate scheme for natural health products in New Zealand.

Mr Key says both countries have agreed the creation of the joint agency is not dependent on natural health products being part of the joint regulatory arrangements. However, he says they do not want to exclude this option from happening at some time in the future if both countries agree.
