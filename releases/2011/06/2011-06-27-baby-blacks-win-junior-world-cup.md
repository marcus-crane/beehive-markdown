Sport and Recreation Minister, Murray McCully, has congratulated the New Zealand under-20’s team for winning the junior Rugby World Cup overnight.

The New Zealand Baby Blacks successfully defended their title by defeating England 33-22 in a closely fought final played at Padova in Italy

“It was a good win against a strong opponent. It also means coach Mark Anscombe and the team have built an impressive record,” said Murray McCully. 

“The Under-20’s have now won the Junior World Cup title four times in a row with a 100 percent record in the history of the four-year-old IRB tournament” he said.

“It bodes well for the talent of our emerging players. I have no doubt some of these players will be future All Blacks”, said Mr McCully.
