Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples says the Maori Youth Council’s report and recommendations is a refreshing mix of big ideas and practical solutions.

“I asked the Maori Youth Council to tell me what they think about how the government’s policies and programmes work for young people. They have put in countless hours, and had four meetings together, to produce this report,” said Dr Sharples.

“They have focused on four policy areas: youth justice, Maori education, youth development and representation of Maori youth,” he said.

“Their proposals for better facilities and services to keep young people out of trouble, more mentoring and training for young people, and community and agency support for families caught up in the justice system, have real merit.

“In education the Council’s focus is on supporting teachers to understand Maori students better, and helping schools to engage with Maori communities.

“Music production courses and quality rangatahi radio are their ideas for developing young people through creative arts; they want a permanent Maori Youth Council and a national Youth Summit; and they say training for youth candidates and inclusion of young people in appointment databases would achieve better representation of young people on local government and community organisations,” said Dr Sharples.

“Throughout this report there are four themes: greater use of whanau- and community-based initiatives, improved access to information, more targeted resources, and greater use of te reo Maori to engage young people.

“The Council has produced a very sound report, and I will be discussing with my officials how we can advance their recommendations,” said Dr Sharples.
