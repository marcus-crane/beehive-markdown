Sport and Recreation Minister Murray McCully has announced the appointment of Olympian Sarah Ulmer to the Drug Free Sport New Zealand Board.

“Sarah will provide a valuable contribution to the board with her experience as a high performance athlete, and also from her work with sports agencies,” says Mr McCully.

Ulmer became the first New Zealander to win an Olympic cycling gold medal when she won the 3000m individual pursuit during the 2004 Olympics at Athens. She also smashed Olympic and World records during those games.

From 2004 to 2007 Ms Ulmer was on the athletes’ committee of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and is a current member of the athletes’ commission of the New Zealand Olympic Committee.

Mr McCully has thanked the departing member Melodie Robinson, a former Black Fern and now Sky TV commentator. She has been serving on the board since 2002.

From 1 July 2011, the board will comprise of Michael Heron (Chair), Dr Lesley Rumball, Stewart Walsh, Stephen Cottrell and Sarah Ulmer.

DFSNZ is the country’s leading anti doping agency with a mandate to test, investigate, and educate athletes.
