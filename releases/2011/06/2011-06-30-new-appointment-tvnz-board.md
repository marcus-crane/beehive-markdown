Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman today announced the appointment of Barrie Saunders to the board of Television New Zealand.

Mr Saunders, a co-founder of Wellington government relations firm Saunders Unsworth, has been appointed for three years.

‘’Barrie’s knowledge of New Zealand’s economic landscape is extensive and his business experience and ability to deal with a wide range of issues are good attributes for the board,’’ Dr Coleman says.

Prior to establishing his business in 1994, Mr Saunders worked as a radio and television journalist in New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom. He was the first editor of the National Business Review when it commenced publishing in 1970.

Mr Saunders was also President of the Wellington Regional Chamber of Commerce from 2000-2002.
