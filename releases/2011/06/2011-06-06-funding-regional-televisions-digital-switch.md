An $850,000 assistance package to help regional television broadcasters make the transition from analogue to digital broadcasting was announced today by Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman.

NZ On Air will administer the package which provides up to $70,000 per regional broadcaster for equipment and other costs. Digital switchover will be completed in stages across New Zealand by November 2013.

‘’The package recognises the contribution that regional broadcasters make to their local communities,’’ Dr Coleman says.

‘’The Government acknowledges that regional broadcasters face funding constraints in making the switch from analogue to digital television, so we’re stepping up and helping with some of those costs.’’

The package will be available over the next two years. Regional broadcasters must meet certain criteria to be eligible for the support.

Digital switchover will be completed in New Zealand in November 2013, starting in the West Coast and Hawkes Bay (September 2012); rest of the South Island (April 2013); lower North Island (September 2013); and rest of the North Island (November 2013).

‘’Regional broadcasters will also benefit from the extension of digital terrestrial television (DTT) to cover over 86 percent of the population, up from the present 75 percent,’’ Dr Coleman says.

‘’DTT is a cheaper option than satellite transmission and enables regional broadcasters to just broadcast to their local community, satellite is nationwide.’’

The Government announced in March that DTT is being extended to an extra 160,000 homes in Whangarei, Rotorua, Gisborne, Taupo, New Plymouth, Whanganui, Wairarapa, Nelson, Timaru and Invercargill in time for the Rugby World Cup.
