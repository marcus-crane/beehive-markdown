A new Board is set to take the Government and Auckland Council’s aspirations to transform Tamaki forward.

Chaired by Dr Lee Mathias the Interim Tamaki Transformation Board (ITTB) will move the Tamaki Transformation Programme, a 15 to 20 year project aimed at redeveloping the Tamaki area, to its next phase.

The Board’s brief is to explore a recommended structure, mandate and legal form for a new organisation to advise Ministers and the new Auckland Council.

Housing Minister Phil Heatley says it is possible this interim governance structure may develop into New Zealand’s first Urban Development Agency.

"The new Board will build on the positive levels of community engagement and take steps to formally partner with Auckland Council to create measurable improvement under four key components," he said.

"A social component will support Tamaki residents and families to get the skills, knowledge and employment opportunities they need. An economic component will look at measures to strengthen the local economy. A spatial component will create safe and connected neighbourhoods and the housing resources component will look at making optimal use of land and existing housing stock. This will inevitably mean extensive subdivision, building and infrastructure investment," says Mr Heatley.

"It was important both to the Government and to the Auckland Council that the ITTB has real weight and the ability to effect change.

"To achieve this we have appointed the Chief Executives of the four relevant Ministries and senior representatives of Auckland Council as they hold the direct decision-making powers, control the resources in the 'front line' agencies, and are best placed to drive improvements from within their organisations," says Mr Heatley.

Mr Heatley has once again thanked the Establishment Board and its Chair Pat Snedden for their work to bring the Tamaki Transformation project to the point where the next phase can begin.
