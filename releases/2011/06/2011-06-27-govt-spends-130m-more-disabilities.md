Health Minister Tony Ryall and Associate Minister for Health Tariana Turia says that Budget 2011 sees the Government put an extra $130 million into disability support services over four years.

Mr Ryall says, "An extra $8.5 million a year extra is going into residential support services with some of that to help deal with increasing numbers of people being supported in these facilities.

"Home and community services, for activities like showering, getting dressed, preparing a meal, and house work, is to receive another $6.6 million a year.

"There's $2.5 million in the next year for equipment and modification services. This is on top of the $27 million announced in March last year to address waiting times and increasing costs."

Other areas of disability support that have received extra annual funding in this year's Budget include:

• $1.5m for respite for carers to be able to take a short break

• $2.8m to help disabled people learn skills to live more independently

• $2.5m for assessment, treatment and rehabilitation services, where District Health Boards coordinate help for disabled people to recover from a setback and live as independently as possible.

A range of community based services are also getting extra money covering rehabilitation, head injuries, child development, and specialist support.

Mr Ryall says, "Despite well known financial pressures, this Government has invested an extra $1.5 billion in new money for Health in our first term. We are protecting and growing New Zealand's public health service.

"Importantly, however, we must recognise the amazing efforts that disabled persons and their families go to, in determining the right pathway forward, that best meets their needs," said Mrs Turia.

"I am hopeful that the new model of disability support, the emphasis on individualised funding and the opportunities to promote local area coordination will all help to make the positive difference we need to see in improving outcomes for disabled persons," ended Mrs Turia.
