David Benson-Pope today said he was pleased to be returning to his work in the Fisheries and Associate Environment portfolios.

He also released copies of information he has supplied to police regarding accusations made in Parliament relating to his time as a teacher.

"Up until now a quite distorted picture has been painted of my time as a teacher," said Mr Benson-Pope. "Today I am releasing material which I believe tells quite a different story."

Mr Benson-Pope says the information he is publicly releasing represents the material he has forwarded to police to date, though in the material he is releasing publicly, names, where appropriate, have been removed to protect people's privacy.

"I believe I have good reason to be proud of my 24 year career as a teacher. I have been heartened by the level of support I have received from former staff and students and the wider community.

"I await an expeditious conclusion of the police inquiry and I have nothing further to add at this time," said Mr Benson-Pope.
