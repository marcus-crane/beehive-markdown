Defence Minister Mark Burton this morning announced a pay rise for military personnel from this Friday, July 1.

Speaking at a breakfast for Canterbury employers involved with the Territorial Force Employer Support Programme, Mr Burton said that the pay rise was the fifth consecutive adjustment since 2000.

The pay rise provides for an average 4.3 per cent increase, with the median rank increases ranging from 3 per cent to 7.5 per cent and will give a minimum two-step pay adjustment of $1200 to all personnel, with additional single service targeting of trades and branches.

"The 10-year $4.6 billion Defence Sustainability Initiative funding package for Defence which I announced in May highlighted the need for further investment in personnel.

"The funding from the DSI has enabled the Chief of Defence Force Air Marshal Bruce Ferguson to take prompt action to implement this latest pay increase.

"The Government recognises that the New Zealand Defence Force's greatest asset is its personnel and has provided the security of a 10-year-funding package to allow for a planned, strategic approach to rebuilding NZDF's personnel numbers.

"With one of the lowest unemployment rates in the OECD and high demands for skilled workers across a range of industries, defence recruitment, training and retention are a real challenge for the Defence Force.

"This Government has worked to address pay issues through pay rises in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and again this year.  
"We are committed to building a modernised, well equipped and sustainable Defence Force for New Zealand."
