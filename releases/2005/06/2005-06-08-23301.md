The Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Borislav Paravac, will tomorrow begin a two-day visit New Zealand, Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today.  
Mr Paravac is coming to New Zealand after his visit to Australia. He is one of three Presidents of Bosnia and Herzegovina, each representing one of the three main ethnic communities: Serb, Bosniak, and Croat. Mr Paravac is the Serbian member of the Presidency, and its current chair.

“Although contact between New Zealand and Bosnia has been limited, New Zealand has contributed Defence Force personnel to UN and EU peacekeeping forces there since the early 1990s,” Helen Clark said.  
"New Zealand observers first participated in the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia in 1992. Then in 1994 a 250-strong company group was contributed to UNPROFOR. There are currently 11 New Zealanders with the EU-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia.  
While in New Zealand Mr Paravac will meet Prime Minister Helen Clark and Foreign Affairs Minister Phil Goff. He will also be hosted at a state dinner in Auckland by the Governor General.
