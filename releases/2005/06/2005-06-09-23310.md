The Commerce Commission today released its final report to the Minister of Communications, Hon David Cunliffe, on whether mobile termination rates should be regulated under the Telecommunications Act 2001. The Commission has recommended that the termination of fixed line voice calls on a cellular telephone network should be regulated. However, the Commission excluded from regulation voice calls that use 3G mobile technology.

Speaking from Tuvalu, Mr Cunliffe thanked the Telecommunications Commissioner Douglas Webb and the Commission for its work on the report.

Mr Cunliffe also thanked those interested parties who made submissions.

The Minister can be expected to make an announcement regarding the future process for making his decision shortly after his return to New Zealand.

Under the Telecommunications Act the Minister may accept the Commission’s recommendation, reject the Commission’s recommendation, or request the Commission to reconsider its recommendation.

Copies of the report can be downloaded from the Commerce Commission website (www.comcom.govt.nz).
