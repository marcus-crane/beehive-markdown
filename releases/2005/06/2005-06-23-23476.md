"I have been advised today that a cricket tour of New Zealand by the Zimbabwean team is scheduled for December this year," Foreign Minister Phil Goff said today.

"This is not a matter I have yet discussed with my Cabinet colleagues, and nor have I sought legal advice on it from my Ministry.

"However, given the current appalling abuses of human rights and relentless trend of the Zimbabwe government towards a dictatorship, the New Zealand government would not welcome a visit from a side representing Zimbabwe at this time.

"The Zimbabwe cricket team should not anticipate that it will be granted entry to New Zealand.

"The imposition of a ban on the team would send a strong message to the Mugabe regime that New Zealanders and their government abhor the actions it is taking against its people," Mr Goff said.
