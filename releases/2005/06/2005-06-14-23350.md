14 June 2005Media Statement  
Cullen on Ralph Norris’s departure

Finance Minister Michael Cullen has “mixed feelings” about the departure from Air New Zealand and from New Zealand of Ralph Norris.

“For Ralph and New Zealand, I am delighted that one of New Zealand’s most successful business people has been appointed to one of the top corporate positions in Australia.

“But for Air New Zealand and the interests of the country, I am sorry that Ralph is going. His contribution to the rescue and revival of the company has been enormous.

“He leaves behind an airline which is financially one of the soundest in the world and in the early stages of an exciting upgrading programme.

“I wish Ralph Norris very well in his new position and look forward to working further with him,” Dr Cullen said.
