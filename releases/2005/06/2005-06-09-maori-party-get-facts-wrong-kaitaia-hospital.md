“I want to reassure the people of the north that Kaitaia Hospital is not closing and any comments suggesting it are simply wrong, said Te Tai Tokerau MP Dover Samuels in Wellington today.

“It is outrageous that language such as ‘legalised murder’ have been used by Maori Party candidate Hone Harawira, so carelessly causing unnecessarily stress and anxiety not only for those patients and their whanau but for all the people of the North, Maori and Pakeha."

"I understand that the well-attended meeting held to discuss the redevelopment of Kaitaia Hospital, was not attended by Mr Harawira, nor I understand has he sought any advice on the meeting from those involved."

The Minister of Health, Hon Annette King and myself announced a $9.5 million dollar upgrading package for Kaitaia Hospital and I am heartened to see that the District Health Board had extended surgical services, increased the number of beds, renovated the maternity unit, a new accident department and a surgical unit that is capable of handling twice as many people.

“When I received a copy of the Maori Party’s embargoed press release, I just could not believe what I was reading and in fact I was proven right – it simply was not true”, said Mr Samuels.

“If this type of irresponsible scaremongering based on fear and misinformation is the trademark for the future of the Maori Party in politics, then God help the Maori nation and the wider community”, said Dover Samuels.

This government is committed to ensuring that all New Zealanders are able to access the appropriate health services when needed.

For the first time in 20 years Maori health statistics are improving, this in a large part is due to easier access to low cost health services that are provided by PHO's.
