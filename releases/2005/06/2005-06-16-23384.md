While the rest of the world is facing up to the threat of climate change, Nick Smith and the National party are having a panic attack and are actively considering snubbing the international community by abandoning Kyoto.

"Not so long ago Nick Smith said climate change was such a problem that it would stuff life on earth. Now, at the first hint that the task will be harder than first thought, they are preparing to run up the white flag," says Convenor of the Ministerial Group on Climate Change Pete Hodgson.

"Climate change is arguably the greatest environmental threat the world faces. It needs a bit more leadership and tenacity than that shown by the NZ National Party."
