Prime Minister Helen Clark today congratulated the Silver Ferns netball team on their win against Australia in Sydney last night.

"Last night's game made for gripping viewing. The Silver Ferns established their dominance early on, and succeeded in winning every quarter. The margin of their victory was very convincing.

"Last night's win in the one-off test was the first time in 24 years that New Zealand has beaten Australia in Sydney. Breaking through this barrier now gives the team considerable momentum in its build up to next year's Commonwealth Games clash in Melbourne.

"I was able to convey my congratulations personally to the team on court at the end of the game last night - via Trevor Mallard's cell phone!

"Last night's win confirmed the Silver Ferns' status as truly the champions of world netball, bringing great pleasure to their many fans," Helen Clark said.
