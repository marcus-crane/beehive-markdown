Foreign Minister Phil Goff and his Fijian counterpart Kaliopate Tavola today signed a memorandum of understanding strengthening cooperation against international terrorism.

Under the memorandum, Fiji and New Zealand will work to combat terrorism through measures including cooperating in law enforcement and border control, and against illegal arms trafficking.

Mr Goff said the memorandum would improve Fiji and New Zealand’s ability to share information on the movement and activities of terrorists, and to develop better processes for combating and preventing terrorism and trans-national crime.

“This is the first government-to-government counter-terrorism agreement that New Zealand has signed," Mr Goff said.

"It is pleasing and appropriate that it should be with a Pacific nation, especially Fiji, because we share the common goal of a safe and secure Pacific.

"Terrorism is a threat to people everywhere, and it is important that all nations work together to counter such threats.

"The memorandum signed today is an important and concrete step against terrorism that New Zealand and Fiji are taking. We look forward to concluding similar arrangements with other Pacific neighbours in the near future,” Mr Goff said.
