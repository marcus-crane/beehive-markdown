Everybody knows the impact school traffic has on Auckland congestion but National's plan to dump school zoning pupils would make it much worse says Transport Minister Pete Hodgson.

"National's plan would be a disaster for children, parents, employers, congestion and the economy," says Pete Hodgson. "If National dump zoning, parents will have to bid for school places for their children. Some will end up in schools miles from home and others will be excluded from the school next door once that school has cherry picked the pupils it wants.

"Parents will be forced to take time out to drive their children affecting their availability for work and adding to congestion.

"Everybody enjoys the less congested roads during the school holidays and bemoans the increase in traffic when term starts again. Just imagine how bad the situation will be if National gets its way and forces many thousands of children out of their neighbourhood schools, and their parents onto the roads."
