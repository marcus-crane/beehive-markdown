Associate Minister for Arts, Culture & Heritage, Judith Tizard says that local support is needed for the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra (APO).

"Regional and local arts must be supported locally. I congratulate Auckland City for their ongoing assistance, and urge the rest of Auckland's councils and the Auckland Regional Council to increase their financial support to the APO," Judith Tizard said.

"I have met with the APO team and discussed a range of options with them, seeking better, direct, reliable funding from the Auckland councils.

"Creative New Zealand is also actively working with the orchestra. The 2005 Budget makes provision for increased funding to Creative New Zealand, but it will only be available once CNZ has established demand across New Zealand.

"Local government has a vital role to play in providing for community cultural wellbeing and institutions. It is important to ensure partnerships at regional and community levels because cultural wellbeing is now a purpose in the Local Government Act.

"Auckland would be a much poorer place without the Auckland Philharmonia. Auckland must engage with this issue," Judith Tizard said.
