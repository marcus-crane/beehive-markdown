The Government remains committed to improving public access to waterways, Associate Rural Affairs Minister Jim Sutton said today.

“We are still committed to achieving free, practical, and certain access to the publicly owned rivers, lakes and beaches for all New Zealanders. However, because of complications around drafting, we are running out of time to initiate the Parliamentary process to make this law.

“The National Party continues to support those who would whittle away what is left of the wonderful, 150 year-old tradition of the Queen’s Chain.

“Government is now embarking on a further round of consultation among major stakeholders in search of greater consensus on a way forward in enhancing public access. We are confident that sufficient goodwill exists to make this possible.”
