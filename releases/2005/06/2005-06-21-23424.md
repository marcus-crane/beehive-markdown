The government today welcomed the decision of the Supreme Court on the Zaoui case, saying that the Crown's submissions appear to have been accepted.

Immigration Minister Paul Swain said that he was pleased the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security could now proceed with his review of the Security Risk Certificate, which had been on hold for two years.

Prime Minister Helen Clark said she was pleased the Supreme Court had clarified the intent of the law.

She reiterated that the New Zealand government, as a matter of principle, does not deport people to places where they would be tortured.
