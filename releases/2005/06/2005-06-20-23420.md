The Minister of Communications, David Cunliffe, today announced an extension to the deadline for comments on the Commerce Commission’s final report on regulation of mobile termination rates under the Telecommunications Act 2001.

Interested parties now have until 1 July 2005 to provide comments on any new matters raised in the report that were not the subject of previous submissions to the Commission, and on any other relevant information that is not addressed in the Commission's report.

"I have granted an extension due to a call for more time to respond to the report and a delay in the release to interested parties of the Commerce Commission's cost/benefit model", said David Cunliffe.

On 9 June the Commerce Commission released its final report to the Minister recommending that the termination of fixed line voice calls on cellular telephone networks (excluding third generation cellular networks) should be regulated. The Minister can either accept the recommendation, reject the recommendation or request the Commission reconsider its recommendation.

Copies of the report can be downloaded from the Commerce Commission website (www.comcom.govt.nz). Comments, including a public electronic version, must be received by the Ministry of Economic Development no later than 5pm Friday 1 July 2005. Comments should be sent to:

The Manager  
Information Technology and Telecommunications Policy  
Resources and Networks Branch  
Ministry of Economic Development  
PO Box 1473  
WELLINGTON  
By email to: reg.hammond@med.govt.nz

Comments will be published on the Ministry of Economic Development website.
