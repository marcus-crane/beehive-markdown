Tukituki MP Rick Barker has welcomed the Trade Negotiations Minister's announcement that the Government is to take action at the World Trade Organisation to get access for New Zealand apples into the Australian market.

Mr Barker says this is a necessary next step and means that once this issue is inscribed to the WTO it remains on the Committee’s agenda until it is resolved or removed.  
" Hawke's Bay growers now have the action they've sought and deserve" he said.  
"This issue has dragged on too long and is costing growers by the unjustifiable denial of access, so the government have taken this issue to the next level.  
" In November 2003 the WTO ruled in favour of the US - that the risk of apples in commercial trade spreading fire blight is negligible. This ruling supports our view that any measures to protect against fire blight are unjustified and this block can therefore be considered as a non-tarrif trade barrier.

"The Australian pubic deserve the choice of our apples at the supermarket. If the Australian orchardists are as good as they think they are, then they have nothing to fear.  
"I won’t be satisfied until we can sell Hawke's Bay apples in Australia," he said.
