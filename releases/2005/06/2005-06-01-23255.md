More than 500 people are set to receive hearing aids and disability equipment shortly, Associate Minister of Health Pete Hodgson announced today.

Additional funding of up to $1.7 million (ex GST) has been made available to ensure people receive equipment over the next few months.

The Ministry of Health spends more than $70 million on aids and equipment each year to meet the needs of people with disabilities.

"What this $1.7 million injection means in real terms is that 374 people will receive hearing aids, 35 will get wheelchairs or mobility equipment and 101 will have modifications made to their homes," says Pete Hodgson.

"This is in line with this government's commitment to the disability sector and our desire for a fully inclusive society."
