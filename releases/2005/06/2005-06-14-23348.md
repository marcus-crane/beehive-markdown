The [$8.9 million funding for tourism in this year's Budget](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F23098) will mean a further strengthening of what has been a strong and effective industry-government partnership in promoting New Zealand tourism around the globe, Tourism Minister Mark Burton said today.

[Speaking](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F23347) at the annual [TRENZ tourism showcase](http://www.trenz.co.nz) in Christchurch, Mark Burton said that the extra funding would enable a stronger presence in the United Kingdom, United States and Japanese markets and would help [Tourism New Zealand build](http://www.tourisminfo.govt.nz/) on the very solid advertising base it had established with its [Pure New Zealand campaign](http://www.newzealand.com).

"It will also be used to investigate new and innovative ways of marketing New Zealand, like the [hugely successful exhibit](http://www.rhs.org.uk/chelsea/2004/exhibitors/show_gardens/tourismnz.asp) and marketing work done around the Chelsea Flower Show.

“Everyone knows that in the global tourism environment, New Zealand is a small fish in a rather large pond.

“To date, the 100% Pure New Zealand global marketing campaign has managed to make a disproportionately large ripple in that pond. It has been cited by many [National Tourism Organisations](http://www.tianz.org.nz/Industry-Facts/NZ-Tourism-Partners.asp) and marketing organisations as an example of a successful campaign.

“We bucked international [tourism trends](http://www.trcnz.govt.nz/), and actually increased spending and visitor numbers during what was quite a tough time for many countries over the last few years.

“However with the world settling into a more stable period, other destinations are increasing the amount that they are spending on tourism and other factors like exchange rate fluctuations, the increasing costs of advertising, and a general upping of the standard of marketing from other countries, are all competing with our voice out there.

"We want to maintain or increase our market share, and this won’t happen if we rest on our laurels."

The extra funding would allow for longer and more advertisements as well as more prominence at offshore trade shows and to create new media partnerships for more coverage on television in key markets, Mark Burton said.
