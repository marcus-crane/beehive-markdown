Prime Minister Helen Clark today congratulated Michael Campbell on his stunning win in the United States Golf Open, the first golfing major win by a New Zealander since Sir Bob Charles’ British Open win in 1963. The start of Cabinet was deferred while Ministers watched the final holes.

“His win is a triumph of immense skill, determination and perseverance, along with great modesty and humility. It is one of New Zealand’s greatest sporting achievements, and his place as one of New Zealand’s sporting greats is cemented.

“New Zealanders have watched Michael’s career since his emergence as an amateur in the Eisenhower Cup winning team. We have watched his highs, and we have watched him in more troubled times. Nobody deserves such an immense victory more than Michael.

“All New Zealand will join with me in sending our congratulations to Michael, and his family. He has done his family, his community in Titahi Bay, Wellington, and New Zealand proud,” Helen Clark said.
