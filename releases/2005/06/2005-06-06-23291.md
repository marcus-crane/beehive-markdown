Northern Employers and Manufacturer's chief executive Alasdair Thompson's anti-government campaign on Auckland land transport has got off to a bad start after the Labour Party registered his publicised website as its own.

Transport Minister Pete Hodgson said that Mr Thompson announced his campaign last Friday without having thought to register the website at the heart of it; www.revupthegovt.co.nz which the Labour Party registered.

"Mr Thompson's campaign is off to an amateurish start. He will now be needing to explain to his financial backers how such an obvious oversight occurred. If his billboards are already printed they will now be directing the public to a Labour Party website. If they have not been printed, he'll need to explain why he launched his campaign without them."
