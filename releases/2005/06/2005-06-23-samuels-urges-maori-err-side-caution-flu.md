Te Tai Tokerau MP Dover Samuels is urging Maori whanau to be extra vigilant in the coming months as a potent strain of influenza not common to New Zealand continues to spread around the country.

Influenza B is reaching epidemic rates in children and young people across the North Island, with high rates of absenteeism in some schools. In the last six weeks three young people became ill with influenza B and have died from complications from the virus.

"Tamariki and mokopuna are our most precious taonga and we all have a responsibility to ensure that their health remains a priority," Dover Samuels says.

"Nearly 90 percent of Maori live in the North Island where this flu strain is prevalent. As well as that around 40 percent of Maori are also under the age of 15, which means many of our tamariki and rangatahi could be affected.

"We have not seen this Hong Kong strain of the flu since 1987 which means immunity levels in children born after that date, will probably be minimal and they are therefore more likely to contract the virus."

"It's really important that that we keep a close eye on tamariki sick with flu-like symptoms which means no Kohanga (preschool) or Kura (school). It is especially important that a parent or responsible guardian stay at home to monitor sick tamariki as well," says Dover Samuels.

The Ministry of Health advises that sick tamariki be kept warm, given paracetamol (NOT aspirin) for fever and plenty of fluids. If they does not get better, or gets better and then develops another fever, or is having breathing difficulties, they should be taken to a GP.

Dover Samuels says Ministry of Health is advising all health professionals of the particular risks influenza B poses to children and young people. It was recommending to family doctors that if they suspected a child or young person could have influenza B they should assess them and refer them to specialist care if they had any concerns about possible complications. Hospital doctors are also being informed.
