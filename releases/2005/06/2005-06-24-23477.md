Representatives of Land Transport New Zealand and Transit New Zealand met last night with Minister of Transport Pete Hodgson to discuss how to allocate the extra $500 million for transport announced by the government yesterday.

"This further investment underlines this government's determination to wipe out the legacy of neglect left by the last National government," said Pete Hodgson. "National has a long history of being heavy on promises and light on delivery. This Labour-led government backs what it says with hard cash."

The next National Land Transport Programme (NLTP) is due to be released at the end of the month, too soon to include allocations for the extra $500 million. Therefore, an update to the NLTP will be released several weeks from now.
