A protocol that both creates and maintains vitality and character in design plans for our towns and cities will be launched today by the Prince of Wales and Environment and Urban Affairs Minister Marian Hobbs.

“The New Zealand Urban Design Protocol is a project that will help create more interesting and user-friendly buildings, places, spaces and transport systems. It is about developing towns and cities that people really appreciate,” Marian Hobbs said.

Eighty organisations across New Zealand have signed up to the Urban Design Protocol – including decision-makers, influencers, architects, developers, planners, and central and local government. Other signatories include investors, infrastructure providers and educational institutes. Representatives will attend the launch at the City Gallery in Wellington.

The protocol will get all the sectors that are involved in urban design working together in a coordinated way for the first time – to share their knowledge and experience, with each other and with our communities. Signatories have agreed to incorporate agreed design principles in their work.

“The Urban Design Protocol, led by the Ministry for the Environment, is a significant milestone in our nation’s urban development. The government is committed to raising the standard of urban design, and is leading this change,” Marian Hobbs said.

“New Zealand is already known all over the world for its breathtaking scenery, but today up to 87 per cent of New Zealanders live in our towns and cities. It would be fantastic if New Zealand also became known for its creative, stimulating and successfully designed towns and cities,” Marian Hobbs said.

“The launch of the protocol is timely, as 2005 is the Year of the Built Environment – which aims to raise awareness about the gains that can be made from improving urban design.”
