Last week’s interest rate rise and this week’s massive current account deficit announcement should be the last nails in the coffin for arguments that the government is running too big a surplus, says Finance Minister Michael Cullen.

“The position I have consistently adopted over recent months against ill-informed or self-serving criticism of the level of the surplus is to point to the need to avoid further stimulating an already overheated economy.

“The interest rate rise and the current account deficit are the results of very strong domestic demand which has put considerable stress on capacity. There are no miracle short term answers to that; only the long term hard slog of lifting productivity.

“Even now we still see commentators claiming the surplus is too large. No doubt the same commentators will respond to the changed fiscal forecasts in this year’s budget by saying it is too small.

“The fact is that sensible macro-economic management in the current circumstances must avoiding pumping more stimulus into the economy, particularly by way of large and unsustainable tax cuts.

“The budget will show how unsustainable such cuts would be over the longer term. The current account deficit shows how foolish they would be in the short term,” Dr Cullen said.
