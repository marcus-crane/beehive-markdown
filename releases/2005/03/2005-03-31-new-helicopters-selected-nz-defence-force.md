Minister of Defence, Mark Burton, announced today that NH Industries’ NH90 helicopter has been selected to replace the Royal New Zealand Air Force’s ageing Iroquois. The new helicopters will represent another significant step in re-equipping all three services of the NZDF.

“The NH90 is a modern, very capable helicopter with a growing international customer base and assured long-term support. It has been designed to meet current and future requirements and provides an excellent long-term investment.

“It has the capacity to carry up to 16 fully equipped troops; and has a rear ramp that can be used to load small vehicles such as quad bikes with a large freight capacity that will also be particularly useful for tasks such as disaster relief operations.” Mark Burton said.

Mark Burton noted that utility helicopters provide essential support for a wide range of military operations, peace support, civil emergencies and counter terrorism requirements.

“We used our utility helicopters extensively on New Zealand’s missions in such places as the Solomon Islands, Timor Leste and Bougainville. They also provide important support to the police and civil authorities in New Zealand, in activities as wide ranging as disaster relief, search and rescue, fire fighting and counter-drug operations”.

“This Government is committed to building a modern, sustainable, well-equipped Defence Force, and this investment in new helicopters is another clear example of that commitment. These helicopters will ensure interoperability with our security partners, allow New Zealand to participate in a range of operations, and provide valuable support to land force elements and other government agencies.”

The other key element of the helicopter modernisation project is the replacement of the old Sioux training helicopter with a new training/light utility work helicopter. Work is well advanced and can move towards completion now that the preferred medium utility helicopter has been identified.” Mark Burton said.

“Since the 2002 release of the Defence Long-Term Development Plan, 24 major re-equipment projects have been advanced. They include investments in seven new purpose-built naval vessels, a 15-year life extending upgrade of our C-130 Hercules aircraft, an upgrade of the P3 Orion aircraft, the purchase of two 757-200 jet aircraft and the recent acquisition of a new fleet of Light Operational Vehicles”.

Discussions with NH Industries will now focus on cost finalisation, numbers to be purchased and delivery availability. This information will be made public once the commercial negotiations have been finalised and decisions have been made about the replacement for the Sioux training helicopter.
