Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton today released an assessment of how the Thailand-New Zealand Closer Economic Partnership Agreement impacts on New Zealand and New Zealanders.

This [National Interest Analysis](http://www.mfat.govt.nz/tradeagreements/thainzcep/nia/thainiaindex.html) has been presented to Parliament with the Agreement under the parliamentary treaty examination process.

The agreement itself was negotiated in 2004, is scheduled for signing in April and is expected to enter into force on 1 July 2005.

Mr Sutton said the national interest analysis was a formal assessment undertaken to inform consideration of the Agreement by the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Select Committee.

“The analysis identifies the direct and indirect value of the negotiated deal.

“There were strong reasons for us to negotiate a Closer Economic Partnership with Thailand and this analysis, now that the agreement has been concluded, bears this out.”
