Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced an initial government donation of $50,000 to the mayoral relief fund for those affected by yesterday’s tornado in Greymouth.

Helen Clark outlined details of the government response after officials had been in contact today with those leading the tornado recovery exercise.

Minister for Rural Affairs and West Coast-Tasman MP, Damien O’Connor, and Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment, Rick Barker, are in Greymouth today to meet with Grey District Council staff and representatives of key agencies.

Helen Clark said she had spoken to Greymouth Mayor Tony Kokshoorn on Thursday evening, and was relieved to learn that nobody had been seriously injured.

“However, the damage to property is severe and the people of Greymouth are very shaken.

“We are moving quickly to meet the immediate welfare needs of those whose homes have been destroyed or damaged, and to ensure that vital services are restored,” Helen Clark said.

Measures being taken by the government include:

·A number of government agencies – including Housing New Zealand, Work and Income, Fire Service and Police - are sending representatives to Greymouth today to make assessments about what government support is needed  
·Search and Rescue personnel from Christchurch have been deployed to Greymouth  
·Rick Barker is working with Work and Income, and Victim Support, to ensure that support services are available to those who require it  
·The government has indicated that, as with the central North Island floods last year, it will reimburse councils for the cost of repairing critical infrastructure  
·Work and Income will provide labour through TaskForce Green to assist with clean-up projects in Greymouth, and a range of social assistance.

Helen Clark said the tornado had affected the livelihoods of many.

“Damien O’Connor and Rick Barker, along with officials, will be reporting to ministers and I expect to be able to say more about ongoing government assistance after the Cabinet has met on Monday,” Helen Clark said.
