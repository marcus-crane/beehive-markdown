Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton and Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton today congratulated New Zealand Trade and Enterprise on the announcement of the New Zealand Focus centre in Hong Kong.

Details of the centre, including its name and external partners, were announced by NZTE at the 'Inside the new China Summit', in Auckland today.

New Zealand Focus will be opened later this year and will be a showcase for New Zealand food and beverage retail products, whiteware, tourism, education and other business, boosting trade opportunities for New Zealand exporters targeting North Asia.

Jim Sutton said the centre targets Hong Kong’s own population base, where there is strong demand for New Zealand products, but is also designed to create new markets for New Zealand exports in Mainland China.

“Global trade flows, population demographics and our relationships with other countries all point to North Asia being our future export trading focus,” he said.

“This is an innovative and exciting initiative that demonstrates New Zealand’s long term commitment to its relationship with Hong Kong and China and recognises the high level of goodwill that exists between our two nations. We expect the centre to become a hub for cultural, social and business interaction between Hong Kong, China and New Zealand.”

Two leading New Zealand exporting companies – Fisher & Paykel Appliances and New Zealand Natural Ice Cream – have already confirmed they will have stand-alone operations at New Zealand Focus.

Jim Anderton congratulated both companies for their commitment to the project, which he described as an outstanding example of ‘NZ Inc’.

“Export success for New Zealand companies in China depends on them working collaboratively under innovative, New Zealand branding.

“New Zealand Focus will not only be a great showcase of New Zealand products and talent, it is also an outstanding example of high profile companies working with Government agencies to lay a platform for future growth.”

As a regional business hub for Asia and New Zealand’s 10th largest export market, Hong Kong is a logical site for the new centre. It offers a stable trading environment and attracts a strong international business presence. Hong Kong is also the leading gateway into China and the travel destination each month, for 1.2 million buyers and tourists from Mainland China.
