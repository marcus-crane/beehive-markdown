Auckland Central people have only a few more days to have their say on a draft code of practice for retirement villages.

Auckland Central MP Judith Tizard says the Retirement Commissioner Diana Crossan is calling for submissions and the deadline is Monday 7 March 2005.

The [draft code](http://www.retirement.org.nz/code_of_practice.html) has been drawn up by the Retirement Villages Association, and sets out minimum performance requirements in areas such as: staff qualifications; residents' health and safety; fire protection; dispute resolution; financial reporting; building maintenance; and occupancy agreements.

"I know from my constituency work that Auckland Central people living in these villages are interested in all these areas - in particular, I often hear from people who want more transparency and to be more involved in the running of their homes," said Judith Tizard.

"It's not just residents who can make submissions, but anyone who's involved in the industry, including village owners, workers and suppliers.

"The code of practice, once established, will make a big contribution to the daily lives of all these people."

Judith Tizard said the new code of practice was a key measure in the Retirement Villages Act, passed by the Labour-led government last year.

A retirement village is any place with two or more residential units, which provides services and facilities mainly for retired people who purchase the right to live there. Rest homes are different, although some retirement villages incorporate rest home facilities.
