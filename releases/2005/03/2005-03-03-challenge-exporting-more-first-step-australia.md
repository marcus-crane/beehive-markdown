New Zealand businesses have been encouraged to pick up the challenge to export and in particular, to export to Australia as a first step to being 'globally connected', by Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton this morning at the 'Gateway to Australia' conference in Auckland.

"Twenty two years on from the Closer Economic Relations (CER) treaty, no one doubts that both New Zealand and Australia are reaping the benefits of the treaty. Today, for example, Australia is New Zealand’s most important market for manufactured goods and New Zealand is Australia’s most important market for elaborately transformed manufactured goods.

"These days both New Zealand and Australia enjoy dynamic economies, but we need to be proactive to keep our gains going. The NZ government is developing a wider vision of what the relationship could look like in the discussion on a Single Economic Market. As the smaller partner we have to work on ideas that have benefits for both countries.

"By expanding our market beyond four million kiwis, we can produce the economic growth we need to support the life style that New Zealanders want.

"It is vital for New Zealand that our companies pick up the challenge to make a commitment to exporting and that they remain committed. Companies which export have to take risks, but in the process they create jobs, and the increased wealth we need to lift living standards for New Zealanders," Jim Anderton said.
