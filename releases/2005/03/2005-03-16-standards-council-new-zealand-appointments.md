Commerce Minister Pete Hodgson today announced two new appointments and one re-appointment to the Standards Council of New Zealand.

“I am pleased to appoint Vaughan Renner and Michael Wallmannsberger as new members of the Council. They are both respected leaders and managers with strong business and community-based connections. These links should prove valuable to the Council in its work.”

The Minister also re-appointed Professor John Hannah of the University of Otago. “The Council stands to benefit from the continued membership of Dr Hannah who has a sound understanding of standards issues in relation to the education sector.”

The Minister also acknowledged outgoing members William Simmers and Arthur 'Francis' Small for their time and expertise.

The Council is the governing body of Standards New Zealand, the national organization with statutory responsibility for the development and adoption of standards and related products. Through the voluntary participation of about 2,000 New Zealanders on its boards and committees, the Council is able to draw on the knowledge and expertise of many sectors of the population in carrying out its work. Professional and consumer bodies are also able to nominate members to the Council ensuring a broad representation of membership.
