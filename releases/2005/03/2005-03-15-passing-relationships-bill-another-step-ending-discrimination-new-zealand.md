The passing today of the Relationships (Statutory References) Bill was another important step towards ending discrimination in New Zealand, says Associate Justice Minister David Benson-Pope.

Mr Benson-Pope reiterated the Government's commitment to human rights. He said introducing the Relationships and Civil Union Bills into Parliament had been a Labour election manifesto promise.

The passing of this legislation was made all the more significant because the issues were treated as conscience issues in Parliament and passed because of cross-party support.

"There is no place in New Zealand society for this kind of discrimination," said Mr Benson-Pope. "These Bills were always about justice and fairness and Parliament was right to back them."

Mr Benson-Pope thanked his Parliamentary colleagues from all parties who supported the Relationships Bill, which passed its third reading today with a roughly two-thirds majority.
