Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard said today she was saddened to learn of the death of Paul Hester, former member of the bands Split Enz and Crowded House.

Paul Hester played in small Melbourne bands before joining the New Zealand band Split Enz in 1983. Hester and Neil Finn formed Crowded House with bassist Nick Seymour in the mid-1980s.

"The news of Paul's death is very sad. He made a huge contribution to both New Zealand and Australian music. Crowded House was one of the most successful New Zealand rock acts of all time and left a huge imprint on New Zealand, and indeed the world stage.

"Paul Hester was an active musician and a world-class drummer. He will be greatly missed, and I join with his friends and fans in extending sympathy to his family at this sad time.”
