Prime Minister and Minister of Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark announced today funding of $400,000 to support the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra's largest ever international tour.

The $400,000 for the NZSO's August 2005 tour, announced this afternoon, comes from the government's Cultural Diplomacy International Programme.

"This is an exciting project for the NZSO, and I am particularly pleased that we have been able to make funding available in support of this international tour," Helen Clark said.

"The Cultural Diplomacy International Programme recognises the significant value of showcasing New Zealand cultural activities on the world stage, presenting ourselves as a culturally diverse and contemporary nation, with a strong and unique cultural heritage.

"The NZSO will be excellent cultural ambassadors, performing a diverse repertoire which includes original New Zealand music, at the world famous BBC Proms in London, the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam and at the World Expo in Aichi, Japan.

"Attendance at the World Expo means the orchestra can build on its successful tour of Japan in 2003, cement cultural links and further reinforce New Zealand’s important trading, diplomatic and tourism relationship with Japan. The Orchestra represented New Zealand at the first World Expo in 1970 in Japan and also at the Seville World Expo in 1992.

"To take on such a tour is a great achievement for the orchestra and I wish them every success," Helen Clark said.
