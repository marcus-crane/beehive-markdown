Today's $715.8 million transport infrastructure announcement for Auckland demonstrates that the government is delivering on the transport funding promise it made in 2003, says Auckland Issues MP Judith Tizard.

Today's announcement was the first part of the delivery of the $1.62 billion transport funding package for Auckland that was announced by the government in December 2003.

The government today confirmed that it will invest more than $2 billion extra in transport infrastructure improvements across New Zealand, including $715.8 million in Auckland, over the next ten years by raising fuel excise duty by 5 cents a litre from 1 April 2005.

Judith Tizard said that the investment for the Auckland region demonstrates that progress on Auckland’s roading and passenger transport continues to move ahead.

"Auckland is currently in the middle of the biggest transport-building boom we've ever seen. We have historic levels of investment in infrastructure because there has been a deficit in investment over many years.

"We continue to work closely with the Auckland Regional Council, territorial local authorities and Land Transport NZ. The Auckland Regional Transport Authority (ARTA) was launched in February, with the key goal to improve the transport experience for Aucklanders.

"We are aware that new projects will place additional demands on industry and the government is working to ensure any constraints are minimised.

"For example, potential skill shortages in several areas are well known, and are being addressed through support for industry training, the Modern Apprenticeship programme and increased engagement with industry. We are also working closely with the construction industry to address planning and procurement issues that may arise from the additional pressures on industry.

"The transport investment package is central to maintaining a healthy economy. It also confirms that government is meeting its promises for the rejuvenation of Auckland's transport infrastructure," Judith Tizard said.
