New Zealand will not be withdrawing its Ambassador from Jakarta, Acting Foreign Minister Marian Hobbs said today.

"He has an important job to do there, including New Zealand's relief effort in Aceh," Marian Hobbs said.

"The Bashir verdict was the result of a judicial process by the Indonesian courts. It is not the Indonesian government that has delivered the verdict.

"NZ has welcomed the commitment of the present Indonesian government to bring to justice those responsible for terrorist acts. We will continue to encourage Indonesia in this respect."
