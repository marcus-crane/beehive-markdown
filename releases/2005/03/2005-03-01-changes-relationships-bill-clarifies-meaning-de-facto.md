Associate Justice Minister David Benson-Pope today welcomed changes to the Relationships (Statutory References) Bill, including an amendment to the definition of de facto relationships, which provides more clarity.

Mr Benson-Pope says the Relationships Bill is an important piece of human rights legislation designed to remove discrimination against people due to their relationship status.

He expressed his gratitude to the Select Committee who he says have worked their way through complex issues and recommended changes that will enhance the working of this legislation.

Included in this is a change to the proposed definition of de facto relationships, which will be inserted into the Interpretation Act 1999.

This clarification to the definition makes it quite clear that people in short-term or casual relationships, as well as flatmates and caregivers, will not be considered to be in a de facto relationship for the purposes of this Bill.

The new definition of de facto requires two people to be living together as a couple in a relationship in the nature of a marriage or civil union. A prescriptive list of factors has been removed.

"This Bill was always designed to provide protections and remove discrimination against couples living in long-term relationships akin to marriage, who have not formalised those arrangements," said Mr Benson-Pope. "Changes recommended by the Select Committee will help to clarify this point and should remove any doubt.

"When considering whether a couple are in a de facto relationship, Courts and appropriate decision-makers must take into account the legal purpose or context in which the question is to be determined.

"I think New Zealanders' innate sense of fairness has led people to conclude that the Relationships Bill is about a fairer society for everyone," said Mr Benson-Pope.
