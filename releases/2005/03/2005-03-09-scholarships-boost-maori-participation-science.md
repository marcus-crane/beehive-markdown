A scholarship programme for young Maori science students is part of a growing understanding that science and technology are important to all areas of New Zealand's knowledge economy, Research, Science and Technology Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Awarding this year's Mauriora ki te Ao scholarships, Steve Maharey said that by 2025 many jobs will require a strong foundation in the sciences.

"We're moving into an era where science skills will be valuable in all professions," Steve Maharey said. "These scholarships are designed to encourage young Maori students with a passion for science and an understanding of its importance to the future of our country."

This year's scholarships have been awarded to nine young Maori tertiary students studying the sciences and taking science-related courses.

The scholarships were established in 1997 to increase participation by Maori in the public sector, and in particular in departments involved in policy around land management and natural resources.

"The need for science skills in the public sector is just as strong as the need in the private sector. The scholars will be assigned to a government agency for the next year, giving them valuable insight into how the sciences are being used to improve the way the government does business."

The scholarships are awarded annually and are funded by: the Ministry for the Environment; Ministry of Fisheries; Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; Ministry of Research Science and Technology; Land Information New Zealand; and Antarctica New Zealand.

The 2005 Mauriora te ki Ao scholarship winners and their sponsoring agencies are:  
·Hannah Leckie and Simon Ngawhika (Ministry for the Environment);

·Raana Bisson (Ministry of Fisheries);

·Nathaniel Maxwell (Antarctica New Zealand);

·Connie Nisbet and Tane Brunt (Land Information New Zealand);

·Julie Jane Whelan (Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry);

·Lloyd McGinty and Melissa Baker (Ministry of Research, Science and Technology).
