Treaty Negotiations Minister, Mark Burton, announced today that the Ngäti Awa Claims Settlement Act has been passed by Parliament. The Act provides for the transfer of settlement assets agreed in the 2003 Deed of Settlement, and finalises Ngäti Awa’s historical Treaty of Waitangi claims.

Representatives of Ngäti Awa were in the House to witness the passage of the legislation. The Ngäti Awa settlement is the third largest historical Treaty settlement, and the first Bay of Plenty claims settlement bill introduced by the government.

Parakura Horomia acknowledged the importance of the new relationship between Ngäti Awa and the Crown. “This settlement will help Ngäti Awa move on from the grievance they have carried over the past one hundred and fifty years. It will help to contribute to the growth of the Ngäti Awa iwi.

“The settlement process is progressing well, with more claimant groups in negotiations than ever before. The challenge before us is to streamline the legislative process for settlements so that once a settlement is agreed; it can be implemented in a timely manner. The Crown is currently considering ways of doing this.” Mark Burton said.

“The settlement includes a Crown Apology for breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles, cultural redress which includes the transfer of seven sites of significance to Ngäti Awa and a combination of cash and Crown-owned land of $42.39 million.”

Te Runanga o Ngäti Awa Act, which will establish Ngäti Awa’s governance entity to receive and manage the settlement assets, was passed on Wednesday 16 March.
