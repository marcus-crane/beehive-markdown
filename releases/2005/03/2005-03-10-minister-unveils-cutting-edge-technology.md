$2 million worth of new technology at Auckland University will enhance New Zealand’s ability to attract and retain leading researchers, Research, Science and Technology Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Two new instruments – an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) and an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM) – have been purchased by the Research Centre for Surface and Materials Science at the university's Faculty of Engineering.

Speaking at the launch of the new equipment, Steve Maharey said that science and technology will drive New Zealand's future development.  
"Being competitive in the 21st century global economy will mean being at the cutting-edge of technological innovation," Steve Maharey said. "The instruments we're launching today will contribute greatly to New Zealand's research capacity with benefits spread across all areas of our economy and society."

The XPS will provide a range of insights including a better understanding of how things like paint and glue bond to metals. The ESEM will allow researchers to study a number of areas, including how cartilage is affected by osteoarthritis.

"Investing in research equipment like this demonstrates tremendous foresight by the university. New Zealand researchers will now have easy access to technology that is truly world-class.  
"And having a world-class facility like this enhances Auckland University and New Zealand’s ability to attract and retain leading researchers across a range of disciplines.

"The new equipment will also allow Auckland University to strengthen its bonds across the entire research sector and with industry."
