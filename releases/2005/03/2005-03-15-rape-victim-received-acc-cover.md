Claims that a rape victim received no support or advice from ACC are baseless and untrue, ACC Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

“Statements that ACC did not provide this woman with cover are absolutely not correct. The woman is covered by ACC for her injury. She has received funding for medical costs to cover GP visits and counselling,” Ruth Dyson said.

The woman’s application for lump sum compensation was declined on the grounds that her own doctor indicated that the injury was not permanent and stable at this stage.

“When her doctor does certify that she may have an ongoing impairment and that her injury has stabilised, then she will be able to re-apply for lump sum compensation.

“In the meantime, she is still entitled to funding for GP costs and counselling.

“On the advice given to me today, it appears ACC has handled this sensitive case carefully and appropriately, and entirely within the requirements of the legislation,” said Ruth Dyson.
