Our school children today have a [new website learning tool](http://www.justice.govt.nz/education/) available as part of a new Civics education programme being developed by the Ministry of Justice and Courts Minister Rick Barker.

At the launch today, observing a school lesson involving the new website programme, Access to Justice, Rick Barker said as the justice system is fundamental to a modern working democracy, it's important that there's more information describing how it works.

"[Courts](http://www.justice.govt.nz/courts/) play a vital role in a democratic society and the sooner our young people have the complex system demystified, the sooner they will be able to participate as adult citizens who are not afraid of the law and see it as a service to assist them," said Mr Barker.

"On too many occasions I have heard from young and old that they ran out on the system simply because they didn't understand how it works. This becomes a problem as they carry a grudge and a fear that is carried all their life.

"The need to improve the quality of information available to the public has been highlighted by the [Law Commission](http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/) and this website education tool is a good step towards providing New Zealanders with easy access to information. It also has links to NZ Parliament and to electoral enrolment information.

"The website shows how the many aspects of New Zealand courts fit together like a jigsaw: it has funky cartoons and scenarios like, 'what if someone takes my idea, what happens if I'm arrested, what if I am accused of a crime?, for example.

"The learning tool fits well into the social studies unit with other topics and my colleagues are writing to school principals to encourage them to incorporate this into their lessons.

"In the UK, Citizenship and Democracy is a core paper in the national curriculum for school students. I'd like to see this civics programme developed here as a core aspect of New Zealand's education programme.

"This is another part of the drive to bring more openness into the NZ court system along with district court open days and the new family court website with sections for children," he said.
