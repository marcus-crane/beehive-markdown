The Australian Treasurer, Peter Costello and New Zealand Commerce Minister Pete Hodgson today jointly announced cross-appointments between the Australian Financial Reporting Council (FRC) and the New Zealand Accounting Standards Review Board (ASRB).

Charles Macek, Chair of the FRC has been appointed as a member of the ASRB and Warwick Hunt, Chair of the ASRB has been appointed as a member of the FRC.

“This is a further step in developing a trans-Tasman single economic market,” Peter Costello said. “New Zealand and Australia are both adopting international accounting standards. This has increased the need for high levels of coordination between Australian and New Zealand accounting standards bodies."

"The FRC and ASRB are responsible for standards setting oversight and strategy," said Pete Hodgson. "These cross-appointments will promote higher levels of coordination and communication in these areas."

“They will also give us more opportunity to influence the direction of international standards,” said Mr Costello.

Today's announcement follow the recent cross-appointments of David Boymal, Chair Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) to the New Zealand Financial Reporting Standards Board (FRSB) and; Joanna Perry, FRSB Chair to the AASB.

“It is no coincidence that all four cross-appointees are the chairs of their home bodies,” Pete Hodgson added. “It reflects the importance that both countries attach to the trans-Tasman relationship and working towards a single economic market.”

Accounting Standards Review Board (ASRB)  
The ASRB is a Crown entity established under the Financial Reporting Act 1993. Its main function is to review and, if it thinks fit, approve any financial reporting standard or amendment submitted to it. The ASRB consists of not less than four and not more than seven members appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Minister of Commerce. When considering appointments, the Minister must recommend candidates who have knowledge of, or experience in, business, accounting, finance, economics or law.

The New Zealand Government is currently reviewing the Financial Reporting Act. A Ministry of Economic Development discussion document proposes that the ASRB be replaced with a new body with broader responsibilities. www.asrb.co.nz
