Tourism Minister Mark Burton today announced details of the Tourism Demand Subsidy Scheme (TDSS) and invited applications. The TDSS will help qualifying small communities to fund the water and wastewater infrastructure they need to maximise benefits from New Zealand’s thriving tourism sector.

The Tourism Demand Subsidy Scheme is targeted at communities with high tourism numbers and small resident populations of between 100 and 10,000 people. It will subsidise investment in quality water and wastewater infrastructure to meet tourism demand.

Applications will go through a two stage process. Final applications will be assessed by the Sanitary Works Technical Advisory Committee, which also evaluates applications to the SWSS. This will maintain co-ordination between the two schemes. The committee will evaluate applications on their public health and environmental benefits, affordability, tourist flows and the percentage of tourist driven costs.

“New Zealand is forecast to receive an extra 30 million international and domestic visitor nights by 2009. These visitors will rightly expect effective, infrastructure that delivers hot showers, clean drinking water, and functional toilets, whether they are in Auckland, Wellington, Kaikoura or Franz Josef.”

“Our Government understands that rapid growth in tourism can place pressures on some smaller communities, particularly where rating bases are small. The investment needed to build water and sewerage infrastructure to meet the needs of visitors can be much higher per capita than in larger cities." Mark Burton said.

The criteria for the scheme have been developed in consultation with councils, district health boards, community groups and the tourism industry. The TDSS will co-ordinate as closely as possible with the existing Sanitary Works Subsidy Scheme (SWSS) administered by the Ministry of Health on behalf of the Minister of Health. The Ministry of Tourism worked collaboratively with the Ministry of Health, the Department of Internal Affairs and Local Government New Zealand throughout the development of the TDSS.

To be eligible for the subsidy, applicants will need to have contracted a scheme after 14 May 2004.
