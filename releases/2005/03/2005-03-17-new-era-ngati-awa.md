"Today, the Ngâti Awa Settlement Bill was passed. Yesterday, Te Runanga o Ngâti Awa Bill was also passed. Together these Bills acknowledge the 140 years that Ngâti Awa has invested in reaching a resolution of their historical Treaty claims. Now, is a new era for Ngâti Awa" said Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia.  
"These two days have been a landmark event for Ngâti Awa. Now, Ngâti Awa can focus on creating a new future for their people. Ngati Awa succeeding as Ngâti Awa! That means Ngâti Awa people being successful, participating in, and contributing to society without compromising what it means to be Ngâti Awa" said Parekura, who sponsored the Runanga Bill in his capacity as MP for Ikaroa-Râwhiti.  
The Ngâti Awa Claims Settlement Bill gives effect to the Deed of Settlement, which was signed by the Crown and Ngâti Awa, to settle historical claims made by Ngâti Awa. Settlement in the Bill includes financial redress of $42.39 million. It also recognises Ngâti Awa has traditional historical, cultural and spiritual associations with particular places and sites.  
"The people of Ngâti Awa have earned a reputation for being strong, confident and dignified. These attributes fortified them in the negotiations process and I have every confidence that Ngâti Awa will enjoy a prosperous and successful future".  
"These last two days have provided a platform for Ngâti Awa to design their own future on their own terms".  
"I congratulate Ngâti Awa on the development of their new governance entity and the passing of their Settlement Bill and wish them well in their future development and success".
