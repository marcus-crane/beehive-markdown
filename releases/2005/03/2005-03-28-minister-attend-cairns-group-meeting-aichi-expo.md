Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton leaves New Zealand tomorrow to attend the Cairns Group meeting in Cartagena, Colombia, and the Expo at  
Aichi, Japan.

Mr Sutton said the current round of multilateral trade negotiations at the World Trade Organisation would dominate the Cairns Group meeting of agricultural exporting nations.

“2005 is a very important year for the Cairns Group.

“It represents a key window of opportunity to advance the interests of agricultural exporters in the Doha WTO negotiations - aiming for fundamental and irreversible reform across all agricultural products in the Doha negotiations.”

Mr Sutton said the meeting in Cartagena would give impetus to reaching agreement on modalities for agricultural reform by the Hong Kong WTO Ministerial Meeting in December this year.

“The Cairns Group is working to end the protectionism and huge subsidies that distort world markets and penalise efficient agricultural producers everywhere.

“Only a strong and ambitious outcome on agriculture in the WTO negotiations will guarantee the successful completion of the DohaRound.The credibility of the entire Round rests on such an outcome.

In Cartagena, Cairns Group ministers are expected to urge WTO member countries to reach agreement on  
oSubstantially improved market access for all products in all markets.  
oThe elimination of all forms of exports subsidies by a credible end date  
oReductions in trade-distorting domestic support. ;

The Cairns Group is keen to work closely with other like-minded groups, including the G-20, to achieve an ambitious outcome on agriculture.

The Cairns Group is a coalition of 17 agricultural exporting nations formed in 1986. Its members are Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Paraguay, the Philippines, South Africa, Thailand and Uruguay, and account for one-third of the world’s agricultural exports.

Mr Sutton will also attend the Expo in Aichi, Japan, where New Zealand has a pavilion.

“New Zealand has put a lot of resources into a pavilion that is something to be proud of, portraying us as a clean and green nation, with an innovative and entrepreneurial society.”

Mr Sutton said New Zealand would join more than 120 countries at the six-month event that started on 25 March 2005.

He said our participation reflected the importance we place on our relationship with Japan both as a key trading partner and an influential Asian neighbour.

The Aichi Prefecture is located in the central part of Japan and its capital, Nagoya City, is one of the three major metropolitan areas of Japan.

An estimated 15 million visitors are expected to attend the Aichi Expo.

Mr Sutton returns to New Zealand on April 9.
