Parliamentary rugby team co-captain Damien O’Connor says his team's already putting together a rigorous training schedule in preparation for the 2006 World Golden Oldies Festival of Rugby.

The team is the proud first entrant in the biennial festival, the biggest rugby festival in the world. It's expected to attract over 200 rugby teams and 5,000 people from over 20 countries to Wellington in October/ November next year.

"We're really excited to be part of Golden Oldies," Mr O'Connor said. "The festival epitomises all that's good about sport. It's a great excuse to get physically active and it inspires a huge amount of camaraderie among players, both on and off the field.

"Furthermore it enables the more "mature" players among us to actively enjoy the game well beyond what might otherwise be considered an acceptable age for retirement from the sport!

“Being active is an essential part of a healthy lifestyle, and it's that much easier to be active when you're able to play a sport you enjoy. And of course, winning’s always a bonus!”

He said his team, which was celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, had "a fair bit of training" to do before the festival, but he was confident they'd be in top form by October next year. He planned to discuss a game plan with team coach John Hart, and get the team stuck into some serious training. "I'm confident that when the time comes we'll make formidable opponents."

Meanwhile, co-captain Murray McCully described the team as "probably the only genuine non-partisan grouping of its kind within Parliament". "Its been hugely positive for Parliament," he said.

Both politicians said the Wellington City Council should be congratulated for its successful bid to host the event. "This is another high profile event for Wellington that will have a huge impact on the local economy and vibrancy of the city," said Mr O'Connor.
