Mid Canterbury is to get a new $3million state full primary school in the north east area of rural Ashburton, Associate Education Minister David Benson-Pope said today.

Mr Benson-Pope confirmed a decision to merge Dorie, Chertsey, Fairton and Wakanui schools to create a rural country base school on a site central to the four communities. The site has yet to be chosen.

This new school will unlock $1.1million for local education. In addition the Ministry of Education will provide $3million to construct a new state-of-the-art school.

The decision to establish a new full primary school for students from new entrants to Year 8 followed a proposal put forward by the schools and after consultation with existing schools and the local community.

“I am in no doubt that it will enhance education in the area," said Mr Benson-Pope. "I would like to thank all parents, boards of trustees and members of the community who participated in the consultation process. I have carefully considered their views and I hope the establishment of this school will be welcomed by local parents.”

The Fairton School board of trustees will be the continuing board of trustees and as such will work through the implementation process on behalf of the four schools involved. In addition the continuing board will have representation from each of other three schools involved.

The Ministry of Education will work with the continuing board of trustees as they drive the project along. This board will be in place until the new school is operational. The Minister says it is hoped that the new school will be up and running within a year. A board election will be held within three months of the new school opening.
