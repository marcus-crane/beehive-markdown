Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that Indonesian President Dr Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono will visit New Zealand on 2 and 3 April.

“President Yudhoyono’s visit is very welcome. As Indonesia’s first directly elected leader, President Yudhoyono represents a new era in Indonesian politics. President Yudhoyono’s commitment to the process of reform and democratisation is impressive and we support him in this,” Helen Clark said.

“The visit will also be an opportunity to discuss the achievements of President Yudhoyono’s new administration and to explore ways that New Zealand and Indonesia might deepen their co-operation.

“Indonesia is of great importance to New Zealand. It is the largest country in South East Asia and a leader in the Asia-Pacific region. President Yudhoyono’s visit will enable us to share views on developments in Asia of strategic importance to both countries, as well as on shared global concerns, such as security and development.

“New Zealand’s response to the Boxing Day tsunami disaster, which so terribly affected the Indonesian provinces of Aceh and Northern Sumatra, demonstrated this country's desire to be a good neighbour in times of crisis.

“We will also discuss ways of deepening our economic relationship, including through securing better air links,” Helen Clark said.

Details of President Yudhoyono’s programme will be issued later.
