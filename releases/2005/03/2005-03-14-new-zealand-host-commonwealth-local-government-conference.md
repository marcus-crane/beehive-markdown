New Zealand has won the right to host the Commonwealth Local Government Forum's Biennial Conference in Auckland in 2007, Local Government Minister Chris Carter announced from Scotland today.

"This is a very exciting opportunity for New Zealand. The Commonwealth Local Government Forum's Biennial is a huge international conference. It will bring hundreds of ministers, mayors and local government leaders from all over the world to Auckland for a week," Mr Carter said.

"Our own local government leaders will have a unique opportunity to showcase New Zealand, and the strength of our local democracies. They will also be able to learn about international trends in local government management and best practice."

Mr Carter said New Zealand faced stiff competition for the conference from two other short-listed countries, Mozambique and Uganda.

"I am delighted the Forum has given New Zealand this opportunity, and I'm confident Auckland will turn it on for the world's local government leaders," he said.

Mr Carter is in Aberdeen in Scotland finalising details for the 2007 conference, and attending and speaking at this year's conference.
