Radio Spectrum Fees now simpler and fairer

Changes to radio spectrum licensee fees will make the system simpler and fairer at an overall lower cost according to Communications Minister David Cunliffe.

The changes, announced today, make the fee system simpler by reducing the fee categories from 76 to 47. Mr Cunliffe says this means less cross-over of subsidies and greater clarity for licensees as to how radio services are classified for fee purposes.

"Eliminating the cross-subsidies between annual licence fee categories will make the process fairer. Further fee adjustments are proposed in 2007 and 2009 to completely remove remaining cross-subsidies between fee categories to streamline the process.

“Overall the revenue collected from fees is projected to decrease by two per cent in the coming year," Mr Cunliffe says.

“For approximately 400 individually licensed ships and boats, there will no longer be any annual fee to pay, as the existing general licence for maritime purposes will be extended to cover these vessels.”

Mr Cunliffe says the adjustments are being made in phases to minimise the impact rather than making one major change to the fee system.

"Feedback from the public indicated that removing the cross-subsidies in one adjustment could cause some people difficulty. The first phase will therefore only make a partial adjustment with further phased adjustments planned in 2007 and 2009.

"By then new on-line business services, currently in development, will have been introduced. Administration costs, which have already been significantly reduced in the last two years, will continue to decrease," Mr Cunliffe says.

Other changes being made to the fees paid by radio spectrum licensees include:

·Eliminating initial licence fees, operator certificate fees, registration fees, and declined application fees.  
·Introducing a 10 per cent discount for on-line payments by direct debit or credit card and  
·Introducing a new separate engineering certification fee where this work is done by the Ministry of Economic Development (MED) at the applicant's request.

While the changes could mean increases for some licence holders, for others the fee decreases and increases will balance out.

Radio amateur licence fees have also been restructured so that 4700 individually licensed amateurs will no longer be invoiced annual fees. Instead MED costs will be recovered through annual fees on amateur repeaters and beacons, Mr Cunliffe says.

Meanwhile, the separately itemised engineering certification fee is intended to provide an incentive for the private sector to undertake engineering certification work themselves.

“The new certification fee will only apply to licence applications where the applicant has chosen MED to engineer their licence application.”

The changes will begin to take effect from 1 July 2005.
