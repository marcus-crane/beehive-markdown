Students using the Student Job Search service earned $50 million over the summer, Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey announced today.

Speaking at the opening of a new Student Job Search office at Massey University in Palmerston North, Steve Maharey said that the service had beaten it's targets for the summer season and continues to help an ever-growing number of students find jobs.

"Over 32,000 students found jobs with the help of Student Job Search over the summer," Steve Maharey said. "That's eight per cent above the service's target and nine per cent more placements than last year.

"The opening of the Massey Student Job Search office means that every university in the country now has on-campus access to the service. Student Job Search does excellent work. The government is thrilled that our $4 million investment is helping so many students."

Of the 32,081 summer placements, over 4,900 were in jobs over 30 hours a week – a nearly 13 per cent increase on last summer's duration job placements. In total, Student Job Search helps around 50,000 students find jobs every year.

"Student Job Search is run by students, for students. Everyone involved is to be congratulated for the great work they're doing for students and employers across the country."
