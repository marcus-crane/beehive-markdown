Greater collaboration with business will be key to boosting New Zealand's international research capability, Research, Science and Technology Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Speaking to UniServices staff at Auckland University, Steve Maharey said relationships with business were increasingly important as  
New Zealand universities looked to increase the international profile of their research.

"The government sees linking research and business as one of the key areas to continuing New Zealand's transformation.

"This year we will provide around $56 million, through Technology New Zealand, to support the effective commercialisation of the work of research organisations in New Zealand."

Steve Maharey said the international experience showed that business partnerships can significantly boost the capacity of research organisations.

"In the UK for example, 89 percent of higher education institutions are now offering a single enquiry point for business. UK universities are experiencing a strong growth in income from consultancy work, rising 38 per cent in a single year to reach NZ$445 million.

"Auckland's UniServices has succeeded by recognising the value of building relationships between universities and businesses."
