Regional councils are invited to apply for funding to help clean up contaminated sites around the country, Environment Minister Marian Hobbs said today.

"A new funding round is now open under the Ministry for the Environment’s Contaminated Sites Remediation Fund," Marian Hobbs said. "I encourage councils to work with their communities to determine what clean-up work needs to be done.

"The fund has been extremely successful since it was launched in October 2003, stimulating a large number of clean-up projects on the ground. The ministry has already initiated work on 18 clean-up partnerships, involving regional councils, local communities and landowners. Many of these projects are ongoing."

The fund helps regional councils encourage the investigation and clean up of priority contaminated sites. To qualify, contaminated sites must pose a known or potential risk to human health and the environment within their regions.

Earlier this year the minister announced the allocation of $303,937 for five projects, including work at two former gasworks sites (Westport and Masterton), a disused timber mill (Tapanui, Otago), a contaminated stream (Lower Hutt, Wellington) and a former sheep dip (Ngongotaha Valley near Rotorua).

A further $16,500 was allocated in February towards a trial, in conjunction with Auckland Regional Council and Auckland City Council, to determine the best soil sampling strategy for investigating former horticultural properties in Auckland.

Regional councils will receive application forms and guidelines for the latest Contaminated Sites Remediation Fund round. Applications close on 2 May.
