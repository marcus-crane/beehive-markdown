New Zealand is embarking on its next big era of discovery, the Minister for Land Information and the Minister for Research, Science and Technology said today.

The Ministers will today launch Ocean Survey 20/20. The objective of the Survey is to build up a comprehensive picture of New Zealand's oceanic interests and the resources and ecosystems they contain over the next 15 years.

“New Zealand’s future prosperity will depend increasingly on our ocean resources; such as our fisheries, aquaculture, natural products, hydrocarbons and other minerals,” said Land Information Minister Pete Hodgson. “Before we can efficiently and sustainably manage those resources, we need a fuller understanding of their make up. Ocean Survey 20/20 is designed to deliver that.”

The survey will cover the seabed, water column and airspace of New Zealand's Exclusive Economic Zone and extend out to the edge of the continental shelf; an area of around 6.5 million square kilometres.

Minister for Research, Science and Technology Steve Maharey added: “Many agencies are already involved in a variety of exploration and research activities, but there is still a lot more to find out about our marine jurisdiction. New technology and the resources being brought together for Ocean Survey 20/20 mean we stand to greatly increase our understanding of our marine interests."

Land Information Minister Pete Hodgson said, “Ocean Survey 20/20 is the marine equivalent of the land mapping and survey of New Zealand that began 150 years ago, which today influences land use decision making. Our goal is to build up an equivalent body of knowledge against which we can make decisions around the sustainable management of our oceans."

Editor’s note

1\. New Zealand has the world’s fourth largest exclusive economic zone (at 4.8 million km2). The ocean area administered by New Zealand is 18 times the size of its land area. The area of seabed administered is set to increase by around one third on confirmation by the United Nations of New Zealand's jurisdiction to the edge of the continental shelf (expected by 2009).

2\. The Ocean Survey 20/20 project will be co-ordinated by Land Information New Zealand and will involve the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology, and a number of other government departments and agencies.

3\. The vision of Ocean Survey 20/20 is to complete by 2020 an ocean survey that will provide New Zealand with the knowledge of its ocean territory to:

· demonstrate our stewardship and exercise our sovereign rights  
· conserve, protect, manage and sustainably utilise our ocean resources, and  
· facilitate safe navigation and enjoyment of the oceans around New Zealand.

4\. The scope of the Ocean Survey 20/20 project will cover:

· Geographic Area: the exclusive economic zone; continental shelf; the Ross Sea region; and (as a secondary focus) South Pacific islands within the realm of New Zealand

· Physical Zones: subsurface, seafloor, water column and atmosphere, and

· Information and Inventory Supporting: minerals exploration, fisheries, maritime safety, oceanographic science (including geological hazards), protection, conservation, resource management and where appropriate recreation and tourism.
