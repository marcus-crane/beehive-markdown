The government today confirmed its plan to invest more than $2 billion in transport infrastructure improvements around New Zealand over the next ten years by raising fuel excise duty by 5 cents a litre from 01 April 2005.

Customs Minister Rick Barker says it is prudent to avoid delay to increases in Fuel and Excise Duty and Road Users Charges. He says by announcing a firm implementation date the government has secured the new land transport projects planned.

" We have seen petrol prices going down recently and now stabilizing somewhat and it has been decided, as originally proposed, that 1 April 2005 is a suitable time to start this large transport investment programme," he said.

"Retail petrol prices have tended to follow trends in international oil prices. International demand went up from 2003 with increased demand from China and instability in Iraq added to high prices, however retail petrol prices declined from a peak of $1.27 per litre in October 2004 to $1.17 per litre in mid February 2005.

" Opposition to this investment has been hypocritical. In the same breath as saying they want economic growth and road transport improved, they suggest we rob Peter to pay Paul and this means slashing spending in education and health. This government is not going down that road of turning the clock back to run down public services where the cost of cuts to New Zealanders is so high.

" Some have suggested that the country should borrow the money for improving the roading infrastructure, obviously thinking these loans don’t have to be paid back and somehow loan money is free money: In other words 'Voodoo Economics'.

" Whilst road users will be paying more for petrol, the benefits of transport improvements are vast, bringing wide-ranging improvements to the average household's living standards. The long-term economic improvements for business no longer sitting in traffic and families not stuck in gridlock are vast and a real relief for all New Zealanders," said Rick Barker.

Transport Minister Pete Hodgson says this investment package of an unprecedented size in New Zealand's transport infrastructure is central to maintaining a healthy economy. "For the first time in years, it provides the certainty contractors and the wider business community need to make investment decisions," he said.
