24 March 2005 Media Statement

Customs Minister Rick Barker is seeking a meeting with Police and the Ministry of Economic Development to discuss developing a strategy for Customs, to be more effective in their fight against piracy and counterfeit coming into New Zealand.

Since 2001 interceptions subject to investigation have gone up by a couple of hundred a year. Each seizure can involve thousands of dollars worth of fake goods. In 2002 there were 236, increasing again in 2003 to 408, last year 606 individual interceptions were investigated.

"Tens of thousands of CDs, CD Roms and DVDs were seized last year, this is also due to increased Customs staffing levels. The amount of intellectual property cases Customs have been involved with has gone up by around 750 per cent from 1999 to 2004" said Mr Barker.

"I want to discuss with Police and MED how we can move forward with possible joint operations which should led to more fake goods being stopped at the border and more prosecutions. This joint framework is working well in efforts to stop drug traffickers."

Nearly half the goods Customs seize are counterfeit items such as DVDs and CDs.

"When more NZ companies see the benefits of advising Customs of their trademarks and designs, the more ability Customs has to protect their businesses and the NZ economy."

Mr Barker also asks kiwis this Easter to question a product's authenticity if it is a lot cheaper than the same product elsewhere.

"For pirated CDs and DVDs look out for poor spelling and shoddy labelling, because this is a sign that it may be fake. The goods are likely to be poor quality and subsequently a waste of money. Unfortunately the global trade in fake goods has a staggering estimated value of US$450 billion.

"Buying items with the kiwi made label is a guideline of good quality and the goods being genuine. If it seems too good to be true– it probably is, because someone has 'ripped off' someone's idea or brand and made a cheap copy.

"I understand MED is conducting a review of intellectual property rights and I as Customs Minister, am aiming for more businesses to register their brands with Customs in order for them to be able to act on their behalf to protect the good name of the kiwi product," he said.
