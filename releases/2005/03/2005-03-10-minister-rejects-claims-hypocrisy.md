Federated Farmers is trying to claim rights for farmers that it would deny the Government, Associate Rural Affairs Minister Jim Sutton said today.

Federated Farmers today criticised the Conservation Department for locking a gate across a road 11 kilometres into the Ahuriri Conservation Park.

Mr Sutton said the gate only stopped access to 4-wheel drive vehicles, and other forms of access, including walkers, horses, and mountain bikes, were encouraged.

“The Government’s access policy also excludes 4-wheel drive vehicles, so that is no double standard.”

Mr Sutton said the proposed access policy also provided for farmers to be able to shut off access to sensitive areas.

“Contrary to Federated Farmers’ claims, the Government is being consistent.”
