The government is looking at options for a review of the voluntary regime that regulates alcohol advertising.

This decision was contained in a [response](http://www.clerk.parliament.govt.nz/Content/Parliamentary-Papers/A.5Petition%202002-119of%20Viola%20Palmer.pdf) tabled in parliament today to a Health Select Committee report recommending such a review. The report was the result of a petition, presented to the Committee by Dr Viola Palmer (a member of GALA, the Group Against Liquor Advertising) and 2, 869 others.

The petition called for a Committee inquiry into the effects of alcohol promotion, particularly advertising and sponsorship.

"The Government has agreed there are issues relating to the self-regulatory framework that need to be considered," said Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor.

"Consequently, the Government has asked the Inter-Agency Committee on Drugs to look at options for a Government-led review. A policy paper covering these issues will be presented to the Ministerial Committee on Drugs in mid-2005."

The Committee report also recommended the monitoring of research into the health impact of advertising, and the facilitation of counter-advertising. Mr O'Connor said the Government was already undertaking initiatives in both these areas.
