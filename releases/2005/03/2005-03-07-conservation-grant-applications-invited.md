More than $1.5 million worth of funding will be made available to private landowners and community groups for nature protection on private land.

Environment Minister Marian Hobbs and Conservation Minister Chris Carter today announced the second funding round for 2004-2005 for the Biodiversity Condition and Advice Funds.

"This is an ideal opportunity for people around the country with a keen interest in conservation to get support for protecting and restoring native flora and fauna on private land," Chris Carter said.

"We are looking forward to receiving applications now from people all over New Zealand. The funds are building momentum, with more people applying each year and higher quality applications being received," Marian Hobbs said.

A recent survey conducted by the Ministry for the Environment and the Department of Conservation of past applicants, and of agencies such as New Zealand Landcare Trust and the Queen Elizabeth II National Trust, shows there is a large degree of support for the funds.

"Most respondents said that the most beneficial aspect of the funds was that the government is demonstrating a commitment to assisting landowners. Many said that their projects would not have been possible, without the financial assistance," Marian Hobbs said.

In this round, $1,012,000 is available for projects from the Biodiversity Condition Fund, and $515,000, from the Biodiversity Advice Fund.

Applications close on 20 April 2005 at 5pm. Since the last round, a toll free number – 0800 86 2020 – has been established, to make it easier for land owners and rural communities to communicate with the fund management staff in Wellington.
