Winston Peters is continuing his campaign of misleading older New Zealanders about the government's superannuation policy, Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

"Winston Peters wrongly claimed today that the government has allowed superannuation to fall below 65 percent of the average wage," Steve Maharey said.

"After the annual CPI adjustment on 1 April superannuation will continue to remain above 65 percent of the net average wage.

"This government guaranteed to protect the level of superannuation at between 65 percent and 72.5 percent of the average wage and that is exactly what we've done.

"A married couple both receiving NZ Super are now better off by $21.82 a week because of the changes made by this government to restore the 65 percent wage floor.

"This government can be trusted on superannuation because we have kept our word and we will continue to do so."
