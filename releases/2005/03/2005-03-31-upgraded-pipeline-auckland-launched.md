Energy Minister Trevor Mallard today launched the upgraded refinery to Auckland pipeline and visited the Future Fuels Project at the Marsden Point refinery.

The New Zealand Refining Company (NZRC) pipeline, which was constructed in the 1980’s, transports approximately half of the refinery’s production to the Auckland area. Upgrades to the pipeline have increased its capacity from approximately 2 million to 2.6 million tonnes per annum.

"This will allow the refinery to keep up with increases in demand for petrol, diesel and jet fuel resulting from strong economic growth in the Auckland region," Trevor Mallard said.

"The upgrade of the pipeline is also a positive development from an environmental perspective as pipelines are generally regarded as the safest and most environmentally friendly way of transporting fuel over long distances."

The Future Fuels Project is a $180 million upgrade that will enable the refinery to produce cleaner fuels that meet the fuel specifications that come into force in 2006.

"I would like to congratulate NZRC for its ongoing investment in refinery infrastructure. This investment ensures that the refinery is positioned to deliver fuels that meet stringent environmental standards, in a manner that minimises environmental effects, to help fuel New Zealand’s economic growth."
