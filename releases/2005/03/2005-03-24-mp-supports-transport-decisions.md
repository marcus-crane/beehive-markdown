The outcry from National about progress on State Highway 20 displays a spectacular ignorance of the facts, says Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard.

"Far from being abandoned, the Avondale section of SH20 remains in Transit's draft ten year plan with a start date of 2010/11. It would take around five years to complete, pushing completion outside of Auckland's Regional Land Transport Committee (RLTC) ten year planning timeframe," says Judith Tizard.

"In their haste to criticise, objectors have also overlooked the fact that work has already started on the extension of other parts of SH20. Last year, $309 million was announced for the Mt Roskill and Manakau projects. Both are on track to be completed within ten years.

"It is disappointing that National wants to overrule the plans set by the body elected by Aucklanders. This government believes Aucklanders should have a say in where more than $10 billion of transport funding earmarked for the City is spent. Maurice Williamson seems stuck in the Muldoon-era of centralised planning.

"It's also disappointing that Maurice Williamson has slammed moves to improve public transport for commuters city-wide. Does he not understand that Aucklanders want public transport improving now?

"I firmly support the RLTC's draft transport strategy and for Auckland's transport priorities to be determined by Aucklanders and those elected to do so. Central and local government need to work together co-operatively and this is happening. The strategy recognises that over $10 billion worth of funding is in the pipeline. The proposed funding allocations are sensible and forward-looking.

"I am delighted that the RLTC has adopted a 'High Passenger Transport' option in their draft plan. This decision will meet public transport needs and will help to ease traffic congestion in Auckland. The option will also address one of this government's priorities - vehicle emissions."

"It is important to recognise and acknowledge that a huge amount of work regarding transport infrastructure is already currently underway in Auckland," Judith Tizard said.
