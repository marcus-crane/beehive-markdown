Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that the Bahrain Prime Minister, His Highness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Salman Al-Khalifa, will visit New Zealand from 28 to 30 March.

He will be accompanied by the Bahrain Deputy Prime Minister, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Mubarak Al-Khalifa, and senior culture, economics and finance ministers and officials.

The visit includes engagements in Auckland and Wellington.

“Bahrain and fellow Gulf States are valued economic partners of New Zealand,” Helen Clark said.

“They are moderate and stable Middle Eastern states of considerable geo-political significance to the world, as well as key suppliers of much of the world’s oil and gas.

“New Zealand is looking to expand economic linkages with Bahrain including in the areas of education services, tourism and investment, and to promote New Zealand as a centre for technology investment by Bahrain,” Helen Clark said.

Bilateral trade between Bahrain and New Zealand last year was worth $30 million.

During the visit New Zealand and Bahrain will sign arrangements covering trade and economic as well as foreign ministry co-operation.
