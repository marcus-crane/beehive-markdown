A new Biotechnology learning hub is to be launched today by Associate Minister for Industry and Regional Development Pete Hodgson.

The hub will link the biotechnology sector and educators via an on-line resource and facilitate direct contact between educators and scientists.

"New Zealand biotechnology leads the world in a number of medical and agriculture applications. It is one of the most innovative and fastest growing sectors in our economy. This exciting new initiative has been set up to give students a more thorough insight into this sector," says Pete Hodgson.

The on-line resource contains case studies and examples of effective classroom and internet based teaching methodologies. It has also been set up to support live video conferencing between scientists and schools and for the archiving of such events. The Hub also enables direct contact to be established between educators, students and scientists working in the sector.

"The Hub's structure and the wealth of information available through it gives educators the opportunity to bring field of science and technology to life for students at all levels."

The Hub has been developed by a team of sector representatives and educators lead by Professor Alistair Jones of the Centre for Science and Technology Education Research at the University of Waikato in conjunction with the New Zealand Council for Education Research, e-learning company CWA New Media and staff from the University of Auckland's Education faculty. It will be managed by Cathy Buntting of the University of Waikato.

It has been designed to support the attainment of the Ministry of Education's professional development objective for teachers relating to biotechnology.
