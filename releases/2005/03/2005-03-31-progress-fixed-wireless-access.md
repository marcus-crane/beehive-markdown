Communications Minister David Cunliffe says further progress is being made on the allocation of area-based spectrum rights for the provision of fixed wireless access (FWA) services.

FWA is a method of delivering broadband Internet and telephony to consumers and businesses, in competition with existing copper cable networks.

"FWA is important to the delivery of broadband services to consumers and small businesses and we are keen to see its use expanded," Mr Cunliffe says.

A call for expressions of interest in obtaining licences to provide area based FWA service has received strong interest, with nearly fifty organisations and individuals responding.

"The level of interest expressed is a good indication that the allocation process will result in increased local offerings of FWA broadband services within two years,” Mr Cunliffe says.

"Making additional radio spectrum available for broadband services on an area basis will help achieve our overall goal of increasing broadband availability to all New Zealanders.

“The area allocation plan complements work already done to implement project PROBE throughout New Zealand," Mr Cunliffe says

The Ministry of Economic Development has announced a call for applications for the licences and application documents can be accessed on the Ministry’s website at: http://www.med.govt.nz/rsm/spp/fixed-wireless-access/applications/index.html.
