National's welfare spokesperson should make up his mind about how many families he thinks will benefit from Working for Families, says Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey.

"Yesterday John Key claimed in a press release that four out of five households will get nothing from the government's Working for Families package.

"Today he told Morning Report that too many people were getting money from Working for Families and this will offset gains from pay rises.

"He can't have it both ways. He should stop flip-flopping and make up his mind.

"The fact is from 1 April this year, 260,000 families with children – about 55 percent of all New Zealand families – will be entitled to more money from Working for Families. This will increase to 61 percent of all families with children by 2007.

"Working for Families will deliver an average of $100 a week in direct income assistance to families with children in the $25,000 to $45,000 band by the time it is fully rolled out in 2007."
