Veterans' and War Disablement pensions and allowances will increase from 1 April as part of the annual cost of living adjustment, George Hawkins, Minister of Veterans¡¦ Affairs, said today.

The increase of 2.70 per cent equates to the increase in the cost of living for the year to December 2004, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

Examples of the increases include:

„hA veteran on a 100 per cent War Disablement Pension will now receive a tax-free payment of $166.62 per week.

„hA Surviving Spouse¡¦s Pension will increase to $122.91 per week, tax-free.

„hThe single rate for someone living alone on a Veteran¡¦s Pension increases to $309.73 per week.

„hThe Veteran¡¦s Pension married rate increases to $447 per week.

All allowances will also be adjusted in line with the increase in the CPI.
