Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced the appointment of Phil Lewin, Chief Executive of Positively Wellington Business, as one of New Zealand's representatives on APEC's Business Advisory Council (ABAC), and the reappointment of two current members, Sir Dryden Spring and Wendy Pye. Phil Lewin replaces Peter Masfen, who did not seek reappointment.

"Phil Lewin will bring to the Council the experience of working with local businesses in the Wellington Chamber of Commerce and now on Positively Wellington Business. As a former New Zealand diplomat, he had hands-on experience of trade negotiations," Helen Clark said.

"ABAC is playing a key role in galvanising support among the Asia-Pacific business community for progressing APEC's trade and investment agenda.

"I have greatly valued the role New Zealand's ABAC representatives have played in this process. I thank Peter Masfen for his very considerable contribution to the work of the New Zealand ABAC team over the last four years," Helen Clark said.
