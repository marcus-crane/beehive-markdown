A claim by National's Finance spokesperson John Key that four out of five households will get nothing from Working For Families was misleading, Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

"What John Key should be looking at is the number of families with children that will benefit from Working for Families," Steve Maharey said.

"From 1 April this year, 260,000 families with children – about 55 percent of all New Zealand families – will be entitled to more money from Working for Families. This will increase to 61 percent of all families by 2007.

"The changes will put more money in the pockets of low to middle income families through increased support for living costs, housing and childcare.

"Nearly 80,000 people are already benefiting from Working for Families. The changes at 1 April are a major boost to support already available and will ensure work pays for all New Zealand families.

"National's Welfare spokesperson Judith Collins is clearly not giving John Key adequate briefings."

Steve Maharey suggested that for helpful information on the package John Key visit the Working for Families website at www.workingforfamilies.govt.nz
