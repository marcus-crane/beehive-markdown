### Welcome to the Tizard Revue

***News in Arts, Culture and Heritage from the Office of Hon Judith Tizard***

It's been a fantastic start to what promises to be a huge year in the cultural sector.

In February, I had the pleasure of hosting a screening of Taika Waititi's short film *Two Cars, One Night*, and some scenes from Roger Donaldson's *The World's Fastest Indian* at the Beehive. A number of MPs and well-known filmmakers attended, including Cliff Curtis. I am so proud of the excellent filmmaking that is evident in NZ at the moment.

This month there are also numerous arts festivals happening all over the country - I encourage you to get out and enjoy the many wonderful cultural events that are on offer.

***Judith Tizard***  
***Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage***

[**Short film nominated for an Oscar**]()

Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard said the Academy Award nomination for *Two Cars, One Night*, is a great achievement for Taika Waititi, its New Zealand writer and director.

"I congratulate Taika on his success with *Two Cars, One Night*," Judith Tizard said. "The nomination is another boost for the New Zealand film industry, and further evidence that we are up there with the world when it comes to film-making."

Although the film did not collect the Oscar in the Short Film Live Action category, *Two Cars, One Night* has scooped numerous awards since its release, including best short film at Hamburg, Melbourne and Seattle 2004 Film Festivals and the Grand Jury Prize for the Best International Short Film at the AFI Los Angeles Film Festival in 2004.

Produced by Ainsley Gardiner and Catherine Fitzgerald, the film tells the story of first love when two children develop a relationship as they wait for their parents in the carpark of a rural pub.

*Two Cars, One Night* was financed by the [New Zealand Film Commission](http://www.nzfilm.co.nz) and executive produced by Vanessa Alexander. The New Zealand Film Commission assisted the filmmakers to attend the Academy Awards.

[**Online encyclopedia of NZ launched**]()

On 8 February 2005, Prime Minister and Minister of Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark launched *Te Ara: the Encyclopedia of New Zealand*, the first original, official, digital, national encyclopedia in the world.

Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Judith Tizard said that *Te Ara* would provide authoritative information about New Zealand online to a wide audience.

Judith Tizard said to know the country we are today, it is important that we know the stories of our past. The encyclopedia is being published by theme over the next seven years. *Te Ara's* first theme, New Zealanders, tells the stories of the many peoples who have made New Zealand their home.

The next theme, 'Earth, Sea and Sky' will focus on forces such as climate, tides, and earthquakes that have shaped our physical environment.

*Te Ara* has been developed by the [Ministry for Culture and Heritage](http://www.mch.govt.nz). A small team, led by General Editor Jock Phillips, worked with hundreds of people from around the country to collect the information for the individual entries and to source the thousands of images, artworks, maps, video clips and sound recordings which feature on the website.

*Te Ara* is online at [www.TeAra.govt.nz](http://www.TeAra.govt.nz)

[**Toi iho™ at Te Papa**]()

Te Papa Store has brought together a range of works by toi iho™ registered Maori artists.

The toi iho™ mark is a registered trademark used to promote and sell authentic, quality Maori arts and crafts. There are now more than 100 artists who are licensed holders of the registered trademark.

"The registered mark assists Maori to create viable careers as practising artists, and promote Maori art and artists in the global market. It is a valuable tool for promoting New Zealand's unique arts and crafts," said Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard.

"It is particularly appropriate that works with the toi iho™ trademark are showcased at the [Te Papa Store](http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/online_store/shop.asp?Language=English) - as the Museum of New Zealand houses authentic collections of New Zealand Maori art. Te Papa is also a key attraction for international visitors, and the toi iho™ works showcased at the Te Papa Store will further promote New Zealand's arts and culture on the international stage."

[**Kiwi music humming**]()

An exciting six-year old plan to establish an all-New Zealand content radio station came to fruition on Waitangi Day this year. “Kiwi” radio station was launched – New Zealand’s first 100% local music network.

Kiwi broadcasts on three major frequencies: 93.8FM in the Auckland region, 91.7FM in Wellington and 99.3 FM in Christchurch. It is also available to Sky subscribers on Sky Channel 100 and streaming online for everyone else at [www.kiwifm.co.nz](http://www.kiwifm.co.nz)

The launch of Kiwi is a huge sign of how much New Zealand music has grown. Indeed, the amount of NZ music being played on NZ commercial radio is ten times more than it was ten years ago.

The latest figures released by the Radio Broadcasters Association show that New Zealand music accounted for 18.6% of music played on commercial radio in 2004, an increase of 4.6% from 2003.

"This is a fantastic result for the New Zealand music industry which demonstrates the huge success of the voluntary quota system," Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey said.

Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Judith Tizard agrees. "New Zealand music enjoys ten times more airplay than it did a decade ago. This demonstrates what we've known all along – that New Zealanders want to listen to more of their own music."

[Te Matatini](http://www.tematatini.org.nz/index.shtml), New Zealand's premier festival for Maori performing arts was a huge success for New Zealand's arts community and for the Manawatu, said Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard.

Te Matatini, which means 'The Many Faces', showcased the national kapa haka competition. The four-day government funded festival was held at the Arena Manawatu (Stadium), in Palmerston North, on 24 - 27 February.

The festival featured over 1200 performers, from winning groups selected from 14 regional kapa haka competitions throughout New Zealand and Australia. The performers competed in all aspects of Maori performing arts' disciplines.

Te Whanau a Apanui, from the Eastern Bay of Plenty won the competition and the group's leader, Tamati Waaka, was named kaitiaki tane (male leader).

"This is one of the best festivals I've ever been to. It’s inspiring to see how it has expanded to include a wide range of community, culture, art, music and youth activities," said Judith Tizard.

"The development of Te Matatini shows how the arts and cultural sectors in New Zealand are thriving. Maori art plays a vital role in the enrichment of our cultural identity. Te Matatini offers a unique cultural experience and illustrates the sheer passion that drives our creative people.

"Running an event of this size takes a huge commitment of time, energy and resources and I congratulate all those who provided a platform for New Zealand performers to nurture their talents and careers," said Judith Tizard.
