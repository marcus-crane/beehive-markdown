A New Zealand Herald article today was inaccurate when it suggested that beneficiary families would gain only $4-8 a week from the Working for Families package, Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said.

"The Herald claims that from 1 April most beneficiaries with children will get $25 a week more in family support but $17-21 a week less in core benefit," Steve Maharey said.

"This is not the case. From 1 April the child component of benefits will be shifted into Family Support, a payment that can be retained when beneficiaries move into work.

"Increases to Family Support from 1 April are $25 a week for the first child and $15 a week for each additional child.

"The net gain to beneficiary families from 1 April changes to Family Income Assistance will be anything from a minimum of $7.86 for a couple with one child up to a minimum of $52.86 for a couple with four children, or more if the family is larger.

"Maximum rates for Accommodation Supplement will also be increased in a number of areas from 1 April. The changes are on top of extra Accommodation Supplement and Childcare Assistance made available since October last year."

Key changes from 1 April are:

Move child component of benefits into Family Support:  
\- Couple 1 child; $17.14 a week reduction in core benefit  
\-Sole parent, 2+ children; $21.40 a week reduction in core benefit

Increase Family Support:  
\-Couple, 1 child; $25 a week increase  
\-Sole parent, 2+ children; $40 a week increase plus $15 a week for each additional child beyond 2

Changes to Accommodation Supplement:  
\-Lifts average increase for 100,000 people to $19 a week

In addition Childcare Assistance rates increased by 10% in October 2004 and will be increased by another 10% in October this year. Beneficiary families can get up to nine hours a week childcare subsidy.

"Having the additional money in Family Support rather than benefit is better for families in the long-term because they will still be able to retain the payment when they move into work.

"Beneficiaries who move into work will also be eligible for the new in-work payment of up to $60 a week from April 2006."

Steve Maharey said Working for Families would deliver an average net increase of $100 a week in direct income assistance to families in the $25,000 to $45,000 band by the time it is fully rolled out in 2007. Changes from 1 April this year will benefit about 260,000 families (about 55% of all families).

"The lowest net gain from Family Income Assistance by the time Working for Families has been fully rolled out in 2007 is $17.86 a week for a couple with one child and at least $92.86 a week for a couple with four children."
