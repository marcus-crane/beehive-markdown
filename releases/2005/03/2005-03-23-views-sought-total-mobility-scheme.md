Public comment on ways to improve the Total Mobility Scheme is sought with the release of a consultation document.

“The government is looking to increase the amount of funding available to the Scheme. People who currently use it will not be disadvantaged by the review. We are asking people to comment on ways to make the scheme better,” says Acting Transport Minister Harry Duynhoven.

Operated by local authorities the scheme provides a subsidised taxi transport service to people with serious mobility constraints. Last year, $3.277 million of central government funding, and an estimated $4.7 million from regional councils, went into the Scheme.

Around 10,000 consultation documents and submission booklets are being mailed out to stakeholders. These include regional councils, disability sector organisations, assessment agencies, transport operators' organisations and key government agencies. Consultation meetings will also be held in March and April in Auckland, Howick, Hamilton, New Plymouth, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. A consultation website has also been established.

A report on the review’s findings and recommendations will be provided to the Minister of Transport later this year.
