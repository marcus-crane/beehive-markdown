An RNZAF Hercules is scheduled to leave Rarotonga tomorrow carrying urgently needed relief supplies for cyclone-hit Pukapuka and Nassau islands in the north of the Cook Islands group, Aid Minister Marian Hobbs said today.

"The Cook Islands Government has asked New Zealand to help transport food, water and shelter to the people of these two islands, which have been hard-hit by Cyclone Percy," Marian Hobbs said.

"The Red Cross and government authorities in the Cook Islands have done a magnificent job at pulling the relief package together at short notice.

"Early reports indicate that buildings on both islands have been seriously damaged and there are shortages of clean water and food. We’ll be responding just as quickly as we can.

"An over flight by an RNZAF Orion earlier today confirmed that 80 per cent of houses had lost roofs and a lot of water was covering the ground."

Both Pukapuka and Nassau were very isolated and this would present some problems for the relief mission, the minister said.

The runway at Pukapuka had been damaged by the cyclone and could not be used, so the Hercules would have to land at Penrhyn Island, further to the north. The relief supplies, including fresh water from Manihiki Island, would then be transported by ship to the affected islands.

The Defence Force had advised that repairs being carried out to the Hercules in Rarotonga were likely to be completed by Wednesday morning New Zealand time, Marian Hobbs said. The relief flight would take to the air as soon as the repairs had been carried out.
