Cabinet has approved a significant increase of funding for the broadcasting of election programmes for the 2005 election. The total for the broadcasting of election programmes will be $3.212 million. This is an increase of $1.13 million up from $2.081million, which has been unaltered since 1990.

Associate Minister of Justice Rick Barker says that Cabinet has decided on this increase based on the unanimous recommendation from the Justice and Electoral Committee's inquiry into the 2002 election.

"I welcome this decision, broadcasting costs have gone up significantly since 1990, so an increase in the funding is essential to ensure that the public is getting information about political party manifestos before the next general election. An informed public is critical to good democratic practices,” he said.

" Submitters to the inquiry into the 2002 general election pointed out that the broadcasting allocation amount has not increased since 1990 and this is even more problematic now because it is allocated amongst an increased number of parties.

"The option to only make the increase in line with CPI since 1990 would not have actually reflected the increases in average quarterly peak time rates for the election television broadcasts which have increased by 57% between 1994 and 2005. The submission from the Broadcasters' Association estimates that radio broadcasting rates have also increase by 45 per cent between 1999 – 2002.

"Bringing the amount up to $3.212 million recognises that costs have increased. This increase is in line with the recommendation of the Select Committee report, however fifteen years is too longer gap for such an adjustment and I feel that more regular adjustments would be preferable in future, said Mr Barker.

The money allocated to a party is to meet the costs of radio time, television time or production cost in such proportions as the party see fit. Broadcasting allocations are excluded from parties' election expenses.

The announcement at this time is necessary for the Electoral Commission to begin its work in allocating funds for the 2005 general election.
