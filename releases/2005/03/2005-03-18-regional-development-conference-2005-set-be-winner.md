Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton will be opening New Zealand's third Regional Development Conference on Monday, in Napier, and says it is shaping up to be a great conference.

"The third Regional Development Conference is themed 'Our Future, Our Potential, Our Choices' and provides and excellent opportunity for our regional leaders to celebrate their 23rd consecutive quarter of year on year growth."

Over 500 representatives of New Zealand's businesses, local and central government, economic development agencies, and education institutions, will be attending.

"The conference gives an opportunity for those at the regional development 'coalface' to discuss solutions to the challenges facing our regions, such as filling skill gaps, lifting exports, promoting innovation, developing regional advantages and collaborating to maximise our potential.

"All 26 regions have produced economic development strategies, which are guiding their development activity. Sixteen have started to implement their Major Regional Initiatives, assisted by up to $2 million in government funding through New Zealand Trade and Enterprise.

"More information will be released during the conference, on which I expect our regional media will be reporting," Jim Anderton said.
