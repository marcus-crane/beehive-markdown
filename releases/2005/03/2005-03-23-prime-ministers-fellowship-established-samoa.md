Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced the establishment of a Prime Minister's Fellowship for Samoa.

She made the announcement following discussions in Auckland with Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa on a broad range of regional and bilateral issues.

"The establishment of the Prime Minister's Fellowship reflects the close ties between Samoa and New Zealand," Helen Clark said.

"It builds on a number of initiatives that we are working on with Samoa to strengthen the Treaty of Friendship between Samoa and New Zealand.

"Samoa is the only country with which New Zealand has a formal Treaty of Friendship. We want to see our relationship grow in accordance with the principles of that Treaty.

"New Zealand is developing a modern relationship with Samoa which reflects both our close ties and the changes and developments which have taken place in both our countries since the Treaty was first signed," Helen Clark said.

The fellowship is modelled on existing Prime Minister's Fellowship schemes with Japan, Korea, and Latin America. It will enable potential leaders and key figures in Samoa to come to New Zealand on a programme.

The annual fellowship will be awarded to a leader or potential leader from either the public or private sector. These could include Members of Parliament, and people from academia, business, media or other sectors.

"The Fellow will make a visit to New Zealand to look at aspects of New Zealand life particularly relevant to the New Zealand-Samoa relationship," Helen Clark said.
