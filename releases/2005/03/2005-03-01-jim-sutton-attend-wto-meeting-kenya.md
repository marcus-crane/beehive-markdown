Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton leaves New Zealand today to attend the informal World Trade Organisation meeting in Kenya.

The informal meetings are a forum for a small group of ministers from some of the 148 WTO member nations to thrash out solutions that the rest of the membership might agree on later.

The Doha Development Round of multilateral negotiations started in November 2001. The next full ministerial meeting is in Hong Kong in December this year.

Mr Sutton said the bones of an agreement that could be signed off by all ministers at the Hong Kong ministerial meeting in December needed to be worked out as soon as possible.

“That means that we are likely to have a large number of informal mini-ministerial meetings as groups of ministers attempt to find solutions that all can agree to at Hong Kong.”

Mr Sutton said Kenya was a good place to hold WTO negotiations because African nations were among those with the potential to benefit most from the goals of the Doha Development Agenda.

“The overwhelming majority of members of the WTO are developing nations, and it is crucial that developing nations get real gains out of this round.”

Mr Sutton said New Zealand’s goals were quite clear.

“We want the rules for non-agricultural goods, agricultural goods, and services to be fair. We want to have greater market access, reduced domestic support, and the elimination of export subsidies. The world trading system will work better for all if this is achieved, especially developing countries which are heavily reliant on agricultural trade which is the most distorted.”
