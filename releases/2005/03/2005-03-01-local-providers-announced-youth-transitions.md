The goal of getting all 15-19 year olds in work, education or training by 2007 is a step closer with the announcement of the first five Youth Transitions Service providers, Youth Affairs Minister Steve Maharey said today.

The Youth Transitions Service will provide career training, job seeking advice, information on educational opportunities and customised support for at-risk school leavers.

The first five providers of the Youth Transition Service are:

Whangarei:People Potential Ltd  
Waitakere:Youth Horizons Trust / Hoani Waititi Marae (joint venture)  
Rotorua:Te Waiariki Purea Trust  
New Plymouth:Tui Ora Ltd  
Porirua:Porirua City Council with Work and Income regional office

Speaking at the Mayors Taskforce for Jobs meeting in Christchurch today, Steve Maharey said the service would help thousands of young New Zealanders in the transition from school to work.

"This first group of providers will play a vital role in ensuring that young people are ready and able to seize opportunities for success," Steve Maharey said.

"The providers chosen are well-placed to help young people take advantage of career training, job seeking and educational opportunities. They are organisations that are passionate about their communities and committed to helping young people."

The Youth Transitions Service – implemented in partnership between the government and the Mayors Taskforce for Jobs – will be launched in its first five locations over the next month. In total, the service will be up and running in 14 locations by 2007.
