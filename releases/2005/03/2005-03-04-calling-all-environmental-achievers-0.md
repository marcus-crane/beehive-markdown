Environment Minister Marian Hobbs is calling for nominations for the 2005 Green Ribbon environment awards, recognising New Zealanders making a real difference to the environment.

"In a nation that prides itself on being committed to environmental sustainability, certain people lead the way and inspire others through their actions. It's these heroes the Green Ribbon Awards recognise," Marian Hobbs said.

"The number and quality of the nominations received has increased significantly in the past two years. This makes my job of selecting only one or two winners per category tremendously difficult but I’m keen to encourage even more entries this year.

"Every day I hear about and meet outstanding people, organisations and businesses making a difference for the environment through their actions. The Green Ribbon Awards are about celebrating these achievements and inspiring others to get involved.

"The Green Ribbon Award winners show us all how anyone can make a huge difference through their commitment and hard work."

The categories for this year are:  
·urban sustainability  
·rural sustainability  
·sustainable business  
·young people making a difference  
·caring for our water – fresh and sea water  
·community action for the environment

Nominations close on March 24. The winners will be announced in June 2005 at an event hosted by Marian Hobbs at Parliament. The Green Ribbon Awards are held each year in conjunction with World Environment Day; the theme this year is ‘Green Cities’.

In the past 14 years, 70 individuals, businesses, voluntary organisations, schools and councils from all over New Zealand have been honoured with Green Ribbon Awards.

More information and Green Ribbon nomination forms can be obtained from the Ministry for the Environment’s website: www.mfe.govt.nz or by calling 04 917 7400.
