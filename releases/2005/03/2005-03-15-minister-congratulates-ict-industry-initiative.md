Minister congratulates ICT industry on initiative

Communications and Information Technology Minister David Cunliffe today congratulated the ICT industry for establishing a national umbrella organisation for New Zealand ICT sector companies.

Mr Cunliffe says the industry organisation ICT-New Zealand (ICTNZ) initiative is a positive step towards uniting New Zealand's disparate Information and Communications Technology industry.

"The government recognises the importance of industry collaboration for driving growth in the ICT industry.

"Both New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE) and the HiGrowth Project have helped to facilitate the formation of ICTNZ and I envisage that all three organisations will continue to work closely together to help grow the ICT sector."

Key industry representatives involved in ICTNZ include the NZ Software Association, ITANZ, ICONZ, Health IT Cluster, Canterbury ICT Cluster, NZ Computer Society, The NZ Wireless Forum and Internet NZ.

"I look forward to establishing a strong working relationship with ICTNZ. We have a common interest in growing the ICT industry for the social and economic benefit of all New Zealanders. This interest will be well served by an open dialogue between government and industry." said David Cunliffe.
