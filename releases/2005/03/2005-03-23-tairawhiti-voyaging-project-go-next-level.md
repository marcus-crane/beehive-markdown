The Tairawhiti museum is developing a unique voyaging centre that will celebrate the sea journeys made by Maori and European people to New Zealand. $110,000 of funding from the Ministry of Economic Development's Regional Initiatives Fund, will support this initiative.

The Labour Progressive government contribution was today announced by the Minister for Industry and Regional Development, Jim Anderton at the museum in Gisborne. The funding is for concept development and an economic impact study.

"Gisborne has some of New Zealand’s most significant historical sites, and these will form the basis of a voyaging centre, where the common history of voyaging, shared by all New Zealanders, can be explored. It will become a key tourist attraction for the country," Jim Anderton said.

"The centre will also act as a gateway to the rich heritage of Tairawhiti, from the landing place of the Horouta canoe (mother waka) in the great migration, to the site of Captain James Cook’s first landing in New Zealand, and the site of the first greeting between Maori and a European," Jim Anderton said.

The voyaging centre is expected to be an attraction for independent travellers who have an interest in New Zealand’s culture and heritage and who wish to explore those parts of New Zealand which are away from the main tourist routes. An economic impact study is going to assess the potential benefits of the project, and it is anticipated that the development of cultural tourism products in Tairawhiti will create employment opportunities.

"The Tairawhiti Museum has already undertaken a wealth of work to get the project this far, and $140,000 has been contributed over the last three years mostly from local sources.

"I am pleased that the Regional Initiatives Fund (RIF) can be used to complete an economic impact report and to fund the detailed concept design. This will provide information, which is critical for enabling the Museum to implement the project. The Museum will consult widely with local communities following the outcome of the Economic Impact Report," Jim Anderton said.

**Editors Note:**

The Regional Initiatives Fund (RIF) is a discretionary fund administered by the Ministry of Economic Development. Each application is sent to the Minister for Economic, Industry and Regional Development for approval.

On average 20 projects through RIF are funded in each year. RIF grants range in value between $28,000 and $200,000 with most between $50,000 and $70,000. The majority of RIF grants are paid to territorial local authorities. In some cases, the council holds the money on behalf of groups that are not a legal entity.

Each application is based on partial funding on a case by case basis. A ‘local contribution’ is an essential part of any RIF application.

The purpose of the RIF is to provide support for regional projects that are consistent with economic, social and environmental objectives but cannot be funded through other Government assistance programmes. A region is defined as a geographical concentration of communities with similar economic, social and environmental characteristics and objectives.

The Regional Initiatives Fund was created to provide catalyst funding for regional projects that fall outside the criteria of existing Government assistance programmes, but have the potential to leverage economic growth as well as meet Government objectives for economic, social and environmental development.

Funding is only paid out on the completion of agreed milestones, and is monitored by the Ministry of Economic Development.
