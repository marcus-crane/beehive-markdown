The Government is offering nurses working outside hospitals the chance to apply for Primary Health Care scholarships for the third year in a row, says Health Minister Annette King.

"These scholarships were initiated in 2003 for a two-year term, but have proven to be so successful that we have decided to fund them for a third year.

"This year we will offer approximately 120 scholarships at a cost of about $300,000 which will enable registered nurses working in primary health care to undertake postgraduate study in the second semester of this academic year, and the first semester of 2006."

Ms King says primary health is usually the first port of call for people when they are sick, and it is important to enhance the skills of health professionals working in the sector.

The scholarships are open to NZ registered nurses, who have previous work experience in the New Zealand health and disability sector, have the support of their employer and are able to take time off for study if appropriate.

In previous years 390 nurses were awarded primary health care nursing scholarships.

Applications close on 8 April 2005, and application forms are available by request or from the Ministry of Health's website (www.moh.govt.nz).

Applicants will be selected by a panel of nurses, including postgraduate educators and members of the Primary Health Care Nursing Expert Advisory Group.
