Celebrations marking Volunteer Awareness Week begin today and Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector Rick Barker challenges kiwis this year to do something local to help in their neighbourhood.

Mr Barker says the awareness week brings a good opportunity to go and thank a volunteer and also to think about how to help.

"Volunteers give time freely and work in every facet of our community - from meals on wheels, to sports clubs, volunteer fire fighters and surf lifeguards, and running of marae – volunteering is enriching and part of the kiwi way of life," said Mr Barker.

"It would be just great if we each took time next week to say thank you to one of the legion of volunteers. This person may be someone you didn't even realise was a volunteer, thanks is a great small word that gives genuine appreciation.

“I personally say thank you to all those volunteers who give their time and expertise freely out of a commitment and passion to assist others and to make New Zealand a better place for everyone and the government supports this work," he said.

Volunteering New Zealand Chairperson Alison Marshall says there are many ways to get involved and to give thanks during Volunteer Awareness Week and many of them are advertised in the community newspapers and are on line at: www.volunteering.org.nz.

"I agree with the Minister, one of the best ways to show support for volunteers is to join them" she says, "Volunteering strengthens communities, and it’s a safe way for all ages and ethnicities to gain work experience in a variety of roles and sectors.

"Around the country, Volunteer Centres and community groups have organised picnics, displays, marches and volunteer award ceremonies in a bid to give the unsung heroes in their communities a turn in the limelight," said Alison Marshall.

People can view the range and diversity of local volunteer opportunities do this by visiting www.VolunteerNow.org.nz, a website listing volunteer opportunities listed with Volunteer Centres around the country.
