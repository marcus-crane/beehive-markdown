New Zealand is to contribute $1.5 million to relief and reconstruction efforts in the Maldives, Foreign Minister Goff announced today during his visit to the Indian Ocean nation.

“Loss of life in the Maldives, whose highest point is no more than two metres above sea level, was thankfully low. However, almost every island group was hit and the effect on housing, water and health services and tourism infrastructure has been severe,” Mr Goff said.

"Ten per cent of inhabited islands were totally destroyed – no structures remain. One third of the population has been severely affected: their homes destroyed or seriously damaged, or their food or water supplies cut. The poorest people were hardest hit. Many of those who earned their living from fishing lost everything – their homes, boats and nets," Mr Goff said.

“New Zealand, through the government’s international aid agency NZAID, will provide $525,000 to the Commonwealth Secretariat’s Disaster Volunteer Programme which will support 50 doctors in the Maldives for up to a year to assist with healthcare and medical services.

“Discussions are continuing with the Commonwealth Secretariat over reconstruction work worth a further $500,000.

“We are also providing $525,000 to a United Nations programme undertaking the priority work of repairing and rebuilding homes in communities shattered by the tsunami. The programme will also work on land-planning strategies that will help reduce the impact of future disasters."

Mr Goff said further help will be available from the $20 million out of the government’s $68 million tsunami aid package, which had been directed to UN agencies.

“New Zealand NGOs, who received dollar-for-dollar funding from the government, are also involved in tsunami relief and reconstruction projects in the Maldives.

"The Red Cross, for example, is working on one of the worst affected atolls of Laamu, providing temporary housing, electricity generators, work on restoring water and sanitation services, and counseling for those who lost their homes.

"Jerry Talbot, the New Zealander heading the Red Cross delegation in the Maldives, tells me that they are planning to build two new towns on Laamu and Raa Atolls, which will include health centres, schools and mosques to resettle people from islands which were completely destroyed," Mr Goff said.
