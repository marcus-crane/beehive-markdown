Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that the wedding gift from New Zealand for Prince Charles and Mrs Parker Bowles will be a selection of New Zealand plants and trees for Prince Charles’ southern hemisphere garden at Highgrove House in Gloucestershire.

Prince Charles and Mrs Parker Bowles will marry on 8 April.

The Prime Minister also said that Governor-General Dame Silvia Cartwright and Mr Peter Cartwright had accepted an invitation from the Queen to attend the service of prayer and dedication on 8 April at Windsor Castle.

Helen Clark said Prince Charles’ advocacy for the natural environment and love of gardening were well known.

“The New Zealand High Commission in London is working with a UK-based nursery on identifying an appropriate selection of plants.

“A number of New Zealand species grow well in the United Kingdom. The success of the New Zealand garden at the Chelsea Flower Show last year highlighted for many visitors the uniqueness and extraordinary variety of our trees and plants.

“New Zealand officials have been advised by Clarence House, on behalf of Prince Charles, that such a gift would be very well received,” Helen Clark said.
