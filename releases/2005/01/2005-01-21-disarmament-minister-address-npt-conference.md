Disarmament and Arms Control Minister Marian Hobbs will give a keynote address to the opening session of an international consultation on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in the United States next week.

The Extraordinary Consultation on the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) 2005 Review Conference is organised by the Middle Powers Initiative, a network of international citizen organisations campaigning for a nuclear weapon-free world, and will be held at the Carter Centre in Atlanta, 26-28 January.

"Debate will focus on the issues to be discussed at the five-yearly NPT review conference in New York in May, and on ideas governments can consider as they prepare for the conference," Marian Hobbs said. "I will be using the opportunity to test different approaches to the NPT and work on a plan that will allow us to influence the outcome effectively."

The conference will be attended by key disarmament players, including government ministers, ambassadors, NGO representatives , academics and disarmament practitioners from the United Nations and other international organisations. The President-Designate of the 2005 NPT Review Conference, Ambassador Duarte from Brazil will also participate.
