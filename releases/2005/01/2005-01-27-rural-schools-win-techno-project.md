Rural Affairs Minister Damien O'Connor today welcomed the announcement of a new project that will provide essential technical support to rural schools.

The project, launched by Associate Education Minister David-Benson-Pope, supports people from rural communities as they undertake the NZQA-registered Diploma in Information and Communications Technology.

The 18-month course will provide nine technicians with a recognised qualification, while at the same time guaranteeing quality-assured technical support to communities right around the country.

Mr O'Connor said rural schools today had the advantage of information and communication technologies, but the technologies weren't foolproof.

"You can't just install 10 computers with high-speed Internet in remote schools and expect that they'll run themselves. There needs to be people on hand who can give technical support, as well as train those using the equipment.

"The project ensures that full advantage is taken of all opportunities presented by technologies like the Internet." He added that the government had spent $48m connecting schools to the Internet via Project Probe.

Schools hosting project technicians are Tarrangower School (Taumaranui), Northland College (Kaikohe), Tuatapere Community College (Southland), Tikokino School (Waipawa), Opononi Area School (Hokianga), Stratford Primary School (Stratford), Reporoa School (Reporoa), Dargaville Primary (Dargaville), and Opaki School (Masterton).
