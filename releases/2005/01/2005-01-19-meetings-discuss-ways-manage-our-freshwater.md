The government is seeking feedback on its preliminary thinking on managing water resources now and into the future, Environment Minister Marian Hobbs said today.

A series of consultation meetings will be hosted by the Ministry for the Environment and Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry staff at 20 centres around the country during February.

A discussion document on finding the best ways to manage New Zealand’s freshwater resources sustainably was released on 9 December 2004 by Marian Hobbs and Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton.

The discussion document sets out to examine the pressures on our water resources and the different ways in which New Zealanders value water. It signals the first step in February's nationwide consultation programme, which is part of the sustainable Water Programme of Action.

"As minister responsible for the Sustainable Development Programme of Action, I want to receive the views of interested people before we determine government's position," Marian Hobbs said.

"We want New Zealanders to let us know whether we've identified the right issues and the right options and what others might exist. I encourage you to take this opportunity to have a say on the future management of New Zealand’s water by attending a meeting in your region."

Submissions close on 18 March 2005.
