Foreign Minister Phil Goff today officially confirmed the appointment of Speaker of the House Jonathan Hunt as New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and Ambassador to Ireland.

"This follows completion of the formal diplomatic appointment process with the British and Irish governments," Mr Goff said.

“Jonathan Hunt has been a Member of Parliament for 38 years. As a Minister between 1984 and 1990 in the fourth Labour government he held the portfolios of Telecommunications and Broadcasting, Postmaster-General, Tourism and Housing. He was Leader of the House from 1987-90; elected Speaker in December 1999, and re-elected following the 2002 election.

“He will bring a wealth of political experience and knowledge of New Zealand's ties with Britain and Ireland to his new position in London.

“The relationship with the United Kingdom remains of great significance to New Zealand. It is based on shared history and values, but has many other important strands, including trade and investment, multilateral diplomacy, defence, culture, science and technology, and migration. The High Commission's role in promoting that relationship at all levels is pivotal.

"Jonathan Hunt will also be accredited to Ireland, a country that has important people-to-people ties to New Zealand, and much in common with New Zealand as a small nation that seeks to play its part internationally," Mr Goff said.

Jonathan Hunt takes up his posting in March. He replaces Russell Marshall, who has completed a three-year term in London.
