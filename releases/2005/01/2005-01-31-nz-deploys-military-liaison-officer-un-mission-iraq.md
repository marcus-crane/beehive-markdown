Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that a New Zealand Military Liaison Officer has been deployed to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI).

Helen Clark said that the UN had requested this deployment from New Zealand.

"The chief function of the MLO is to liaise and co-ordinate activities between UNAMI, the Multinational Force and the Interim Iraqi Government security forces, and provide advice to the UN's Special Representative on military matters.

"This deployment underlines New Zealand's support for the UN's involvment in Iraq at this critical juncture in the Iraqi political process," Helen Clark said.

Helen Clark said that the deployment of one NZDF officer to this position with UNAMI was of one year's duration.
