Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that the Queen had agreed to a short extension of Dame Silvia Cartwright's term of office as Governor-General.

Dame Silvia is due to complete her five year term as Governor-General on 4 April 2006. Her term has now been extended until 4 August 2006.

"The appointment of the Governor-General is a significant matter, important to all New Zealanders, and it is appropriate that the selection and appointment process do not coincide with the pre-election period.

"I am grateful to Dame Silvia for agreeing to continue to serve in office for the additional four months," Helen Clark said.
