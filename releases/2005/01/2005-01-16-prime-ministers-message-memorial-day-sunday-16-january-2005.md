On this Memorial Day, we remember and honour all those who died and all others who have been so terribly affected by the earthquakes and tsunami in Asia and in the Indian Ocean region on 26 December 2004.

Our thoughts are with all the New Zealanders killed, missing, or injured, and with their families; and with those who have returned home deeply distressed by what they have witnessed.

Our thoughts are with the countless numbers of people who have been killed or who are missing, injured, or made homeless by this catastrophe.

Our thoughts are with the communities in New Zealand which originate from the devastated region – and which have seen their home countries so damaged and so many lives lost.

And our thoughts are with those New Zealanders who are serving on our behalf in the relief efforts in Asia – the New Zealand police officers working in the morgues, the defence personnel in the hospitals and supporting the relief flights, the foreign affairs staff and other government personnel, and all our non-governmental workers and volunteers in the field.

The support and compassion expressed by New Zealanders for those who have been the victims of this awful tragedy has been overwhelming. New Zealanders have contributed so generously to appeals for funds for the victims and the devastated communities.

The loss of so many lives is deeply distressing. The devastation and appalling human toll from death and injury as a result of these events has been felt right around the world. It is a natural disaster without precedent in recent times and it is, at times, almost too overwhelming to comprehend. We all identify with those who have suffered. May all those no longer with us rest in peace, may the injured be cared for and the distressed comforted, and may the devastated communities be supported to rebuild their lives.
