Auckland International Airport Ltd (AIAL) has just reported a record week, with 152,382 international passengers for the week ending 9 January 2005. Customs Minister Rick Barker says it's good to know the new investment in Customs staff came at the right time.

Rick Barker says it's pleasing to see that the record volumes have been handled "without fuss".

The success of New Zealand's tourism industry, and increasing numbers of New Zealanders travelling, means there was a 12 percent increase in people arriving or departing from our international airports in the last financial year.

"Although there are fluctuations in numbers, overall more people are travelling and that is why the government is investing in the infrastructure, to process passengers in a more timely fashion, while still undertaking the checks and clearances which are essential to protecting New Zealand," he said.

"I'm particularly pleased to see how the new staff, which started last month, have handled the extra work of managing travellers and kiwis coming home following the stress of the tsunami.

"If the staff can work together smoothly now under stress at a very busy time, it bodes well for an excellent year ahead of strong public services to be proud of.

"The Government has invested an extra $5.75 million this financial year on extra border control staff and equipment to facilitate arrivals at Auckland and Christchurch international airports. The funding will increase to $7.7 million in out years.

The Government has funded:

·96 more customs officers at Auckland International Airport, ensuring the 50 arrival and departure booths are fully staffed at peak times, including allowance for some off-schedule flights  
·Two new MAF x-ray machines and 17 new staff at Auckland international Airport  
·Nine extra Customs officers at Christchurch, as well as five new MAF Quarantine officers and a new MAF x-ray machine.

Rick Barker says the airport company has invested in expanding the space available while the Government has funded the positions to fill the extra space for passenger processing.
