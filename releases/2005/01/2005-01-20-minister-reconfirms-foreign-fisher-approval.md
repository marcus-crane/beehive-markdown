Associate Immigration Minister Damien O'Connor has reconfirmed approval for 24 foreign fishers to work aboard Christchurch-based company Independent Fisheries' sole deep-sea factory trawler.

He'd given approval for the workers earlier this week, but halted it when he learnt the company had laid off 52 New Zealanders in November.

Having sought further information from the Immigration Service, Mr O'Connor today reiterated his initial decision.

"I'm now confident this is not a case of replacing New Zealand workers with foreigners. At the time of the redundancies, Independent Fisheries was fishing hoki and didn't require as many crew. The company has since decided its deep-sea trawler would be best used at this time of year to fish squid and seasonal positions have become available.

"The redundant crew was immediately given the opportunity to apply for the new positions, and 15 chose to do so. Twelve were re-appointed. The company advertised widely all around New Zealand for the remainder of the vacancies. When they couldn't fill the remaining positions, they applied to the Immigration Service for foreign workers."

Mr O'Connor said the process whereby foreigners were recruited to crew New Zealand ships was robust, and didn't impact opportunities and conditions for New Zealanders.

"The government's focus continues to be on improving wages and conditions for New Zealanders working in the fishing industry. Labour Department officials met just this week with the industry to discuss ways to further this goal."

In the meantime, New Zealand was enjoying the lowest unemployment rate in two decades (3.8 per cent), which meant domestic fishing workers were harder to attract. Also, many preferred to work onshore leaving vacancies offshore that needed filling.

"As a last resort, foreign workers are an effective way to keep the fishing industry viable," said Mr O'Connor. He added that foreign workers had to be employed under New Zealand conditions, including the wages they received.
