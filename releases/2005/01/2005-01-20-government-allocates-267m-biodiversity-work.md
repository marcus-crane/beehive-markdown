Kiwi, brown teal, frogs and snails are among native species to benefit from more than $2.67 million in government grants to 148 conservation projects nationwide.

Announced today by Environment Minister Marian Hobbs and Conservation Minister Chris Carter, the allocations were divided among 117 projects under the Biodiversity Condition Fund, totalling $1,661,099, and 31 projects under the Biodiversity Advice Fund, totalling $1,015,840.

The government is continuing to support nature protection on private land, as part of its commitment to the New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy the ministers said.

"As the ministers responsible for these funds, we were amazed at the number of high quality applications received, and regret that it was not possible to approve all of them this time," they added.

"We are fortunate in New Zealand to be able to count on a large number of landowners and groups keen on doing hands-on conservation work on their properties, and these grants will go a long way to giving them the help and encouragement they need from the government."

The contestable funds were established under the government’s $187 million Biodiversity Strategy Package in 2000.

The Biodiversity Condition Fund aims to improve and maintain the condition of areas of native vegetation, species and habitats, and broaden community participation in nature protection in New Zealand.

The Biodiversity Advice Fund supports the provision of advice and information on native species biodiversity to assist land managers and community groups in managing nature protection projects.
