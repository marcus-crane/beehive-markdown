"Fred Anderson made a very significant contribution over many years to the lives of working people in South Auckland," said Manurewa MP Hon George Hawkins today.

"His lengthy contribution was recognised last year when he was made an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit (ONZM) in the New Year's Honours List."

74 year-old Mr Anderson died on Saturday at Lady Elizabeth Hospital after a long illness. He declined to seek re-election as a Manukau City Councillor in the local government elections held in October citing his ill health as a reason for standing down after three terms.

"Fred was my electorate Chairman for a number of years. I first met him more than 30 years ago as a result of our work for the Labour Party in South Auckland.

"He was always an energetic man who took on many tasks and community projects to improve the lives of working people. Throughout his life, as a union official and latterly as a Manukau City Councillor, he was motivated to make a difference for Manurewa people."

Born in Greatham on England's north east coast, Frederick George Anderson, came to New Zealand as a marine engineer in 1959.

The trade union movement beckoned and he answered the call, filling leadership roles in the Engineer's Union, and the Flight Attendants Union.

Mr Anderson was a lifelong member of the Labour Party, both in the UK and in New Zealand, and served the party at the national level as well as locally. He was Senior Vice President from 1988 to 1990 and spent many years on the party's national executive.

His experience and knowledge of the aviation sector saw his appointment to the Board of Air New Zealand prior to privatisation.

"Many people in South Auckland have reason to be grateful for the life and times of Fred Anderson – he will be sorely and greatly missed," concluded Mr Hawkins.
