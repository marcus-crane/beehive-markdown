Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today extensions of New Zealand Defence Force deployments in Afghanistan, and for the first time, the deployment of New Zealand Police to Bamyan to help rebuild the local police force.

"The deployment of the 120-strong New Zealand-led Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Bamyan Province will be extended for a further 12 months to September 2006. In addition, two police officers will be deployed to assist with the training of Afghani police officers in Bamyan," Helen Clark said.

"The New Zealand police will be based at the Bamyan Regional Police Training Centre, one of seven such regional centres. The UK, Germany, and the US are also involved with operating regional police training centres.

"New Zealand has also deployed a Military Liaison Officer to the United Nations Assistance Mission for one year. This officer is playing a valuable role as a strategic interface between the multinational forces in Afghanistan and the Afghan authorities.

“New Zealand is making a difference in restoring stability to Afghanistan. The New Zealand PRT played an important role in promoting enrolment and participation in last year's presidential elections.

"Now, parliamentary and provincial elections are scheduled for April 2005. This is the next major step in Afghanistan’s progress towards full democratic government. Improving security helps ensure that the elections are fair and credible.

"Failure to stabilise Afghanistan would have consequences for the campaign against terrorism. The Taliban and elements sympathetic to Al Qaeda continue to provide resistance to the Afghan authorities and to the multinational force mandated by the United Nations," Helen Clark said.

The new and extended deployments are as follows:

- The Provincial Reconstruction Team in Bamyan consisting of about 120 NZDF personnel. The PRT has been extended through until September 2006.
- Two non-commissioned officers assisting with the training of the Afghan National Army. This deployment has been extended until 31 December 2005.
- Two New Zealand Police officers to assist with the training of Afghan police officers in Bamyan. These officers will be deployed from March 2005 until the end of 2005.
- Four NZDF officers with the International Security Assistance Force till 31 December 2005. The ISAF supports the Afghan Transitional Authority in the maintenance of security in Kabul and other areas of Afghanistan.
- Two NZDF personnel are also deployed in multinational force operational headquarters till 31 December 2005. This includes one officer in the Combined Forces Command Afghanistan in Kabul and one officer with the Coalition Joint Task Force in Bagram.
- One NZDF Military Liaison Officer with the United Nations Assistance Mission for one year. This officer is playing a valuable role as a strategic interface between the multinational forces in Afghanistan and the Afghan authorities.

The total cost of these New Zealand Defence Force deployments from January 1 2005 to the end of the PRT deployment in September 2006 is just over $34 million.

The Minister of Defence Mark Burton said over the past year, the New Zealand-led PRT has made a significant contribution to the stabilisation and reconstruction of Bamyan Province.

“It provided a reassuring security presence during the Presidential elections, resulting in a particularly high voter turnout, including of women, in Bamyan. In addition the PRT, working with NZAID, has supported a number of development projects,” Mr Burton said.

The Minister of Police George Hawkins said the establishment of an effective police force in Afghanistan is a critical element in the restoration of law and order.

"Following years of conflict, it is important that help is given to Afghanistan to establish a well-trained, professional police force under central authority.

"The two officers will be deployed in March, with the mission lasting about nine months, at a cost of $300,000. The cost of the police deployment will be met by NZAID," said Mr Hawkins.

Mr Burton acknowledged that the situation in Afghanistan still poses a security challenge.

“But I have confidence in the professionalism and expertise of our personnel. They have already earned great respect for their contributions to stability in Afghanistan. New Zealand’s PRT in Bamyan has received high praise from within Afghanistan and from other countries for its work,” Mr Burton said.
