The Act party's pathetic attempt to appeal to working people in New Zealand is so ridiculous it is laughable, Labour Minister Paul Swain said today.

"Working people know that the Act party is the most anti-worker party in Parliament. They have consistently voted against legislation that this Labour-led government has introduced to improve the lives of working people.

"Act opposed four weeks' leave, extra payments for working public holidays, minimum wage increases, paid parental leave and the Employment Relations Act," Paul Swain said.

"In addition they have attacked the government's economic policies that have seen record job numbers, the lowest unemployment for 20 years and growth rates that are the envy of most of the developed world.

"Working people know that Labour is the party that has their interests at heart – always has and always will.

"People will see the Act ploy for what it is – a desperate attempt from a desperate party that is heading for oblivion after the next election," Paul Swain said.
