This year 2005 has been designated as the Year of the Built Environment, Environment Minister and Minister Responsible for Urban Affairs, Marian Hobbs announced today.

"It will be an opportunity for New Zealanders to celebrate the buildings, spaces, places and structures in which they live, work and play," Marian Hobbs said.  
"Our stunning natural environment forms an integral part of our national identity. For the 87 per cent of us who live in cities and towns, the built environment is an even more familiar and immediate part of our daily lives."

The Year of the Built Environment 2005 is a collaborative effort between the government, the New Zealand Institute of Architects, and a consortium of local government, industry, research organisations and professional institutes.

New Zealanders will be challenged to consider the impact, meaning and significance of the built environment in their lives. Events will span public lectures, open-days, training opportunities, conferences, awards and design competitions and will include the launch of the New Zealand Urban Design Protocol in March, the Urbanism Down Under Conference in August and the New Zealand Institute of Architects centenary celebrations.

The Year forms an important part of the government’s Sustainable Development Programme of Action and Urban Affairs portfolio. It reflects the government’s commitment to work towards ensuring quality built environments throughout New Zealand.

"It is about helping New Zealanders recognise the contribution the quality of our built environment makes to our quality of life, and to the success, vitality and prosperity of New Zealand as a whole," Marian Hobbs said.
