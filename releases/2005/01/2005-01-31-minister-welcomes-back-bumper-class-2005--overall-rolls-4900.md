The first of an estimated 758,300 New Zealand students will head off to school today, about 4,900 more than last year, says Associate Education Minister David Benson-Pope.

Total primary enrolments this year will be around 482,500, down by around 1,700 on last year or 0.4percent. However, secondary enrolments will be around 275,800, an increase of around 6,600 on last year or 2.5percent.

Actual school rolls will not be known until the March and July roll collection, but it is expected that around 9,900 new entrants will be enrolled at schools this week. They’ll be among an estimated 59,600 children who will start school for the first time throughout the year, around 2,300 more than last year.

"I warmly welcome all these young New Zealanders and their families into our education system," said Mr Benson-Pope. "I urge parents and caregivers to take an active interest in their children's learning and their wider school community.

"We are focused on raising student achievement and improving learning outcomes for all students. As a Government we have invested in more teachers and professional development for teachers, but it has to be acknowledged that the support and encouragement students get from home is also an important driver in the success of a child."

Most new school entrants will already have experience in education through attending an early childhood education centre. In 2004, 94% of new entrants had attended some form of early childhood education.

"Early childhood education is the foundation on which all future learning is built," says Mr Benson-Pope. "We are committed to increasing participation in quality early childhood education. "

At a regional level, one third of new entrants to school this year will be in the Auckland region. In most regions the number of new entrants is expected to be higher than last year. Only the Taranaki region is expected to show a decrease in the number of new entrants, though the decrease is small.

"We've added 2700 extra teachers, over and above those needed to match roll growth. Initiatives to recruit and keep teachers in the profession are working. Schools head into the year well placed for teachers to meet the demands presented by the 2005 roll."
