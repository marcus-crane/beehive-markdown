Labour Minister Paul Swain today paid tribute to leading trade union figure Bill Andersen, who died yesterday.

"Bill had strong and forthright views and never shied away from expressing them. This meant he was sometimes contentious but he was widely respected for his deep commitment to improving the lot of working people," Paul Swain said.

Mr Andersen was the Northern Drivers' Union secretary from 1957, which became part of the National Distribution Union in 1986. Mr Andersen was NDU president when he died.

"Bill was involved in the some of the most significant events affecting the New Zealand union movement, including the 1951 waterfront dispute. He will be remembered as an influential figure. His knowledge and experience are a loss to the union movement."

Paul Swain said his sincere condolences were with Mr Andersen's family.
