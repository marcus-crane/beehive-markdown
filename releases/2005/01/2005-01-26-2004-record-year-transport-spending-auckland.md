"Transport spending was at an all time high in Auckland through 2004, and it is set to grow through 2005," says Auckland Central MP Judith Tizard.

Around $1 billion of transport projects have recently been completed, are underway or set to start in the near future in the Auckland region. A further $114 million is budgeted for road maintenance in the 2004/05 year.

"This government understands the importance of Auckland's transport infrastructure to the region and the wider New Zealand economy. That's why it is backing it with unprecedented levels of spending. The penny-pinching days of chronic underinvestment under National are well and truly over.”

Judith Tizard says the government is working hard to reduce congestion and bottlenecks on our region's roads but realise that improving roads is only part of the answer. Passenger transport carries around 49 million passengers each year already but offers significant scope for further growth. Better public transport offers the people of Auckland greater choice and cuts congestion.

“That's why we're putting a record $73 million into that in the 2004/05 year. That's four times as much as under National. “

Major projects recently completed, now underway and scheduled to start next year include:

- SH 20 Manukau extension$174 million
- SH 20 Mt Roskill extension$167 million
- Central Motorway Junction (phase one)$55 million
- Central Motorway Junction (phase two)$140 million
- Greenhithe Deviation$94 million
- Grafton Gully$67 million
- Upper Harbour Bridge duplication$37 million
- Esmonde Road Interchange$36 million
- Widening of Whangaparoa Road $13 million
- Manukau’s Waiouru extension$49 million
- Northern Busway$180 million
- Rail rolling stock improvements$36.7 million
- Design of the central transport corridor $1.3 million
