The government will contribute a third of a million dollars to New Zealand Cricket's tsunami fundraising efforts for Sri Lanka, Foreign Minister Phil Goff said today.

"The series against the World XI was a great success in engaging New Zealanders in support for the victims of the tsunami in Sri Lanka," Mr Goff said.

"New Zealanders gave generously at the grounds and corporate sponsors added their weight to the cause.

"On the agreed sponsorship rate for the three matches $252,000 was raised; $224,000 from the first two matches. Given the disappointingly short third match, the government has decided to increase its contribution to $333,000, the upper level of the one quarter to one third of a million dollars we had calculated the sponsorship might be worth.

"The series provided a means by which we have been able to make a specific contribution to the work being done by World Vision and Cricket Aid in Sri Lanka.

"Further contributions have been made to Sri Lanka through dollar-for-dollar matching of donations made to a range of aid organisations and through other efforts including medical support from New Zealand's Sri Lankan community.

"The contribution made by New Zealanders is a gesture toward Sri Lanka that reflects our long-standing friendship, shared membership of the Commonwealth and shared love of cricket.

"I thank New Zealand Cricket, World Vision and other sponsors, and all New Zealanders for the generosity of their contribution during this series," Mr Goff.
