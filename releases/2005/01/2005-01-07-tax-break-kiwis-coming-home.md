Customs Minister Rick Barker says from today New Zealanders returning home will get a tax break on their vehicles, if they meet certain requirements.

"From 7 January New Zealanders returning home after a substantial time living overseas will no longer be required to pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) or other duties on motor vehicles (including motor homes) they import, provided they meet a series of conditions," he said.

"The returning residents will have to have been out of the country for more than 21 months, have personally owned and used the vehicle for at least a year before departing for New Zealand and be returning home for good.

"They will also be required to give a written undertaking that if they sell or dispose of the vehicle within two years, they will pay the GST and duties which would have previously applied."

This is the result of an amendment to the Tariff Concession Reference 80 under Part II of the First Schedule to the Tariff Act 1988.

The government’s decision means returning New Zealand residents will now be treated in the same way as first time immigrants when importing personal-use motor vehicles.

"Buying a vehicle is a big investment and this tax break should help make the extra cost of coming home a little bit easier for people, said Mr Barker.

It is understood that less than 500 vehicles are imported by returning New Zealanders each year.
