Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Hon Judith Tizard, today announced the appointment of Tumu te Heuheu as a Ministerial appointment to the Historic Places Trust Board and Maori Heritage Council for a term ending on 30 June 2007.

Mr Tumu te Heuheu, paramount chief of Ngati Tuwharetoa and a member of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust Board (appointed by the Trust Board members) since September 2003, is now being appointed to the joint Ministerial positions on both bodies to replace John Klaricich, a long-standing member of both bodies.

Ms Tizard welcomed Mr te Heuheu’s appointment. “Through Mr te Heuheu’s knowledge of Maori and heritage issues and his work in the Waitangi National Trust Board and the World Heritage Committee, the Council’s work will be greatly enriched.”

In welcoming Mr te Heuheu’s appointment to the Trust Board and Council, Ms Tizard also paid tribute to the commitment and effort demonstrated by his predecessor, Mr John Klaricich. “First appointed in 1990, Mr Klaricich provided wise and considered guidance to the Trust and the Council, and chaired the Council for almost a decade before his retirement last year”, the Minister said.

The New Zealand Historic Places Trust Board and the Maori Heritage Council are established under the New Zealand Historic Places Act 1993 with responsibilities to protect historic places and areas of Maori interest in New Zealand, with the Council’s specific role of assisting the Trust to develop and reflect a bicultural view in the exercise of its powers and functions.
