Parents' need for information has been one of the driving forces behind a new web-based education resource launched by Associate Education Minister David Benson-Pope.

Mr Benson-Pope says the new education portal –edCentre – provides people with a single gateway to information on education in New Zealand. It will help raise the level of understanding and awareness of publicly available education information. The web address of edCentre is [www.edCentre.govt.nz](http://www.edCentre.govt.nz).

“Helping people to access education information is a key part of the government’s strategy to improve the educational achievement of New Zealanders.”

EdCentre will help people access important information contained on any one of 28 different Government websites and is a joint initiative of the [Career Services](http://www.careers.govt.nz/) rapuara, the [Education Review Office](http://www.ero.govt.nz/), the [Ministry of Education](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/), the [National Library](http://www.natlib.govt.nz/) of New Zealand, the [New Zealand Qualifications Authority](http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/), the [New Zealand Teachers Council](http://www.teacherscouncil.govt.nz/), and the [Tertiary Education Commission](http://www.tec.govt.nz/).

“Specially designed areas within the portal meet the specific information needs of six groups – parents, learners, educators, governance bodies, researchers and the community,” said David Benson-Pope.

“Irrespective of their prior knowledge of the education sector, or technical capability, edCentre will be an ideal starting point for people to quickly access the information they are trying to find. By providing easier access to information, more people will be encouraged to take a more active role in learning.

“The edCentre for Parents section, for instance, is structured to help strengthen family and community involvement in learning. It offers access to comprehensive information for parents that can help them plan their children’s education and help them to understand what their children are doing at whatever stage of the education system," said Mr Benson-Pope.

The portal is one of a series of information technology projects on which the education sector is working collaboratively, to ensure that New Zealanders – be they parents, learners or educators - can access the information they need.

“Like all websites, edCentre will evolve and grow over time, which will enable the education agencies involved to customise information for those needing it,” said David Benson-Pope.
