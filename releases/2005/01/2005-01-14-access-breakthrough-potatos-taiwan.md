In a significant breakthrough for the New Zealand potato industry, Taiwan has approved the import of New Zealand potatos, Trade NegotiationsMinister Jim Sutton said today.

Mr Sutton said the import health standard to enable this trade came into effect on 10 January.

“New Zealand potato growers will be pleased to know that they can now plan for the Taiwan market, and the industry expects significant exports as early as next year.”

The New Zealand potato industry has long held hopes to be able to export potatos to Taiwan – a market it estimates could be worth as much as US$10 million.

Mr Sutton said negotiations to enable this have continued for almost a decade.

He said MAF and MFAT officials worked closely with industry representatives, and in the past year, efforts began to show signs of bearing fruit.

“We appreciate the co-operation between officials in Taiwan and New Zealand that has brought about this outcome. Taiwan is New Zealand’s eighth largest trading partner, and this co-operation strengthens that important economic relationship.”

Taiwan is also New Zealand’s seventh largest export destination, with exports last year topping NZ$600 million.
