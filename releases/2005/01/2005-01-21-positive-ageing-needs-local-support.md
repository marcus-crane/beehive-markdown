Senior Citizens Minister Ruth Dyson today called on all local authorities to follow the example of New Plymouth, South Taranaki and Taupo District Councils and Christchurch City Council and sign up to the New Zealand Positive Ageing Strategy.

Releasing the strategy’s 2003/2004 annual report and 2004/05 action plan, Ruth Dyson said local body issues such as housing, transport and access to services have a huge impact on the ability of older people to participate in society.

“I want to congratulate the New Plymouth, South Taranaki and Taupo District Councils who have formally endorsed the strategy’s goals by developing positive ageing plans for their communities. I am also delighted to see that Christchurch City Council is included in the 2004/2005 national action plan for the first time.

“I hope that over the coming year, other local councils will work in partnership with the Office for Senior Citizens and older people in their communities to promote positive ageing and make New Zealand a better place for everyone.”

Ruth Dyson said government agencies were making good progress in implementing the 10 goals of the positive ageing strategy, with 152 actions completed in 2003/2004 and a similar number identified for the following year.

Highlights for 2003/2004 included:  
·legislation to progressively remove asset testing for older people in residential care;  
·legislation to improve protection for people buying into and living in retirement villages, including a Residents’ Code of Rights and Industry Code of Practice;  
·development of guidelines for multi-disciplinary, comprehensive, integrated assessment processes for older people and their carers;  
·research funding of $4m over five years to Waikato University and the Family Centre Social Policy Research Unit to study well-being and ageing.
