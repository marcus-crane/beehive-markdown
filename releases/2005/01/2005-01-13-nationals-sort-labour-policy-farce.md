National's latest ramblings on the Holidays Act show that they still do not have a clue about this important issue.

Duty Minister Mark Burton said Wayne Mapp is clearly hedging his bets with his proposed review of the Holidays Act.

"Comments like 'you'd be sort of wanting to head in that sort of direction' when talking about National's proposals show just how far the National Party is from being ready for government."

Mr Burton said Dr Mapp's latest musings follow hot on the heels of his leader's spectacular flip flops on the Employment Relations Act and four weeks annual leave.

"Dr Brash now supports the Employment Relations Act after predicting it would be the downfall of New Zealand as we know it. He also went from saying that four weeks annual leave was a 'massive cost to New Zealand employers and workers' to saying that a National government would retain it."

New Zealanders have not forgotten that National is the party that in the 1990s tried to make public holidays a tradeable commodity. Many will be seriously concerned to see Dr Mapp raising similar ideas again. National's true instincts are clear, Mr Burton said.

"Labour stands for fairness in the workplace and this means a little bit extra for those who have to work on public holidays, and four weeks annual leave for all workers. What does National stand for?"
