John Key appears to have caught the Brash disease, says Finance Minister Michael Cullen.

“Mr Key, like Dr Brash, now can’t keep up a consistent line from one month to the next.

“For months he has been saying that the government is running too big a surplus and we can afford more spending and tax cuts. Now he is saying that the government is spending too much and needs to put the brakes on spending.

“What this means is that Mr Key has pulled the rug from under Dr Brash prior to the upcoming Orewa Speech. Dr Brash cannot credibly promise tax cuts given Mr Key has called for a tighter fiscal policy.

“Mr Key needs also to show authority as finance spokesperson for National by stopping his colleagues from promising extra spending which at least one of them does almost every day.”
