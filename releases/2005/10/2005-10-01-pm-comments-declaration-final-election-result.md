Prime Minister Helen Clark today welcomed the confirmation of the election night results, and a final vote for Labour which saw it poll within 0.16 per cent of its share of the 2002 vote.

“As I said on election night, the result of voting appeared to give the Labour Party the opportunity to begin negotiations to form a new government,” Helen Clark said.

“This has been confirmed by the declaration today of the final result.

“Discussions have been occurring in the past two weeks with the aim of forming working relationships between Labour and other parties.

“I now look forward to engaging further with those parties that have expressed a willingness to discuss arrangements with us.

“Further talks to progress arrangements around forming a government are likely to be held in the coming week,” Helen Clark said.
