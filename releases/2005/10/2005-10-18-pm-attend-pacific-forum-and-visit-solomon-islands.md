Prime Minister Helen Clark will attend the Pacific Islands Forum in Papua New Guinea from 25 to 27 October.

Prior to the official Forum meetings Helen Clark will visit Solomon Islands to underline New Zealand's support for the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands. She will also spend one day in formal bilateral meetings in Papua New Guinea before the Forum's opening ceremony.

Helen Clark said she was looking forward to visiting Papua New Guinea.

"While the Forum meeting will be the major focus of my visit, I will also have the opportunity to meet with Papua New Guinea leaders about strengthening our relationship," Helen Clark said

“PNG is the largest Pacific Island nation, and this year takes up the Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum.

“A key objective for this year’s Forum is to promote the successful adoption of the Pacific Plan, the end point of a process launched during New Zealand's year as Chair in 2004.

“The Plan is all about making more effective use of existing regional resources, and creating new networks for regional co-operation.

The Pacific Plan aims to give practical effect to the leaders’ vision for realising the four Forum Goals: economic growth, sustainable development, good governance and security. It also aims to foster regional approaches by Forum member countries.

“In terms of other Forum goals, I expect a good discussion about the regional trade agenda, and how to encourage the flow of goods and services, both between the island countries and with New Zealand and Australia.

“I also look forward to health issue discussions including the HIV/AIDS strategy, and measures against a possible avian flu outbreak.

“Regional security issues will also be a key topic, which is why I will visit the Solomon Islands on 23 October with other Forum leaders to underline the region’s support for the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI).

New Zealand police, aided at various times by New Zealand defence personnel, have been in Solomon Islands as part of RAMSI since July 2003.

“RAMSI has been a significant regional success, but Solomon Islands has a long way to go before the task is over. RAMSI has stabilised law and order in the Solomons. Now it has embarked with the Solomon Islands Government on the even more difficult task of reconstruction and development of both the economy and society more broadly.

“I look forward to discussing the challenges, and what is being done to address them with members of both RAMSI and the Solomon Islands Government. My visit, in the company of other leaders, will demonstrate our support for the efforts which are being made to give Solomon Islands the opportunity to develop its potential.

Helen Clark leaves New Zealand on 22 October, returning early on 28 October.
