Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark said today that work is underway this week to erect the New Zealand Memorial in the United Nations' Memorial Cemetery in Busan, Korea.

Helen Clark said that the memorial is dedicated to the 6,000 New Zealanders who served with the United Nations’ forces in the Korean War and its aftermath, and commemorates the 45 who lost their lives in the conflict.

"The memorial has been designed by artists Fred Graham and John Edgar, and Warren and Mahoney Architects. It is made of Coromandel granite. Along its sides are 45 cuts into the granite, each marking the loss of a New Zealand serviceman during the Korean War.

"Supporting bronze plaques offer an explanation of the symbolism of the memorial and have a dedication in English, Maori, and Korean," Helen Clark said.

Helen Clark said that the memorial project has been well supported by the Ministry of Culture and Heritage, by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade staff in Seoul, by Korean Airlines, who are transporting the 5.7 tonne memorial to Korea free of charge, and by the United Nations Memorial Cemetery and its Custodian Ambassador Byun.

"The memorial will be officially dedicated in Busan when I travel there for the APEC Summit in November. Six Korean war veterans have been chosen to travel to Korea for the dedication ceremony," Helen Clark said.
