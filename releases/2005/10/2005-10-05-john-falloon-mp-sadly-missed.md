John Falloon was a respected Minister and Member of Parliament who worked constructively with people from all walks of life, Minister of Economic Development, Forestry and Progressive Leader Jim Anderton said today.

"I had many opportunities to work with John Falloon over the years, both in government and opposition, as well as outside of Parliament. In all roles I found him a pleasure to work with.

"He and his wife Philippa hosted my daughter Jillian at a function in their home to help her advance her operatic career. They were very supportive of her and I have always greatly appreciated that.

"John was someone who always had a positive and valuable contribution to make to whatever he was working on. As Minister of Forestry, he was an enthusiastic supporter of the industry and championed many innovations during his time in the position.

"He will be sadly missed and my sympathies go to his wife and family," Jim Anderton said.
