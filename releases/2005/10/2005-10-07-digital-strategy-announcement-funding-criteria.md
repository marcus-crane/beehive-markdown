Caretaker Information Technology Minister David Cunliffe today announced the launch of the first two pools of funding available under the [Digital Strategy](http://www.digitalstrategy.govt.nz/), in line with previously announced policy.

“The first part of the Digital Strategy action plan is the introduction of two contestable seed funds, the [Broadband Challenge](http://www.digitalstrategy.govt.nz/templates/Page____14.aspx) and the [Community Partnership Fund](http://www.digitalstrategy.govt.nz/templates/Page____18.aspx)”, said Mr Cunliffe.

The Broadband Challenge is a $24 million fund geared towards supporting initiatives that bring broadband to areas that do not have it, and high-speed fibre networks to urban areas.

“The Broadband Challenge aims to make broadband and high speed Internet accessible and affordable to all New Zealanders, on an open access basis", said Mr Cunliffe.

“When the Government [released the draft Digital Strategy](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F23040) there was an overwhelming call from New Zealanders for cheaper, faster broadband", said Mr Cunliffe, "This is one part of a response to that call."

The $20.7 million Community Partnerships Fund will support regional and community ICT (Information and Communications Technology) initiatives that provide New Zealanders with the skills, capability and confidence to use ICT.

“For the Digital Strategy to work for all New Zealanders - communities, local government, businesses and individuals all need to be involved.

“We all need to share in making the investment because we will all reap the benefits,” David Cunliffe said.

Applications for the two funds open in mid-October.

“Projects should be community-focused, have strong representative partnership and show potential to be self sustaining after the completion of the funding process, including co-funding."

“We are particularly interested in projects that can grow and link with others around New Zealand and want to see ideas that;

- build ICT skills and capability in regions and communities
- map communities’ ICT assets and identifying priority gaps
- strengthen community projects through the use of ICT
- address issues of confidence, such as safety and security, in using ICT; and
- involve smart ways to digitise and link content and use applications across your community and New Zealand."
