Prime Minister Helen Clark today paid tribute to the memory of the Hon John Falloon, who passed away overnight.

Helen Clark said that she had known John Falloon from the time she entered Parliament in 1981.

"John Falloon was an unfailingly courteous Member of Parliament who enjoyed good relationships with his parliamentary opponents.

"To me he was always a decent, public spirited, and well motivated human being, who worked hard for his community and constituents.

"I am deeply saddened at John's untimely death and am conveying my deepest sympathies and condolences to his wife Philippa and family," Helen Clark said.
