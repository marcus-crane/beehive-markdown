Prime Minister Helen Clark has condemned last night’s bombings at restaurants in Bali, Indonesia, which occurred just days before the third anniversary of the October 2002 terrorist attacks on the same island.

Helen Clark has today written to Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, saying the New Zealand Government is appalled at such cowardly and indiscriminate acts of violence.

No New Zealand casualties have been reported at this stage. Latest news reports put the death toll at 25, and say that more than 100 people have been wounded.

“Our thoughts are first and foremost with the families and friends of those who have borne the brunt of what is another callous and cold-blooded attack,” Helen Clark said.

“A Jakarta-based New Zealand diplomat who happened to be in Bali at the time of the attacks has visited the morgue and hospitals to try and ascertain whether any New Zealanders are among the casualties.

“A consular staff member and New Zealand Police liaison officer from the Jakarta embassy are travelling to Bali today to assist.”

In her letter to President Yudhoyono, Helen Clark has offered whatever assistance Indonesia requires in the aftermath of last night’s bombings.

“Such cowardly and indiscriminate acts of violence, which are deliberately aimed at innocent people, are an affront to humanity,” the letter says.

Helen Clark said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade is setting up a toll-free line to take calls from New Zealanders wanting to check on family members and friends who might be in the area. The number is 0800 432 111.
