New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Argentina will be career diplomat Lucy Duncan, Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced today.

“New Zealand enjoys a friendly and cooperative relationship with Argentina. We have shared interests many areas, including agricultural trade liberalisation, Antarctica and the southern oceans, human rights, the environment, peacekeeping, and United Nations issues.

“New Zealand’s Embassy in Argentina was opened in 1998, and since then our relations have continued to develop. There is significant New Zealand investment in the Argentine dairy and fisheries sectors; a working holiday scheme began in 2003, and several cooperation agreements have been signed between universities in the two countries," Mr Goff said.

Ms Duncan joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in 1984, and has previously been posted to Singapore, Geneva, and Vienna. She will take up her appointment in January, replacing Carl Worker, who is returning to Wellington.
