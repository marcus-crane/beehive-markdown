Eight Hamilton secondary schools are to be involved in a co-operative new project designed to help their students’ gain qualifications, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

Fairfield College, Hamilton Boys’ High School, Hamilton Girls High School, Hamilton’s Fraser High School, Hillcrest High School, Melville High School, Sacred Heart Girls’ College and St John’s College will be part of the Early Start to Qualifications project planned for 2006.

“This project will boost collaboration among the eight Hamilton secondary schools as they work together to raise attainment for Waikato at risk students,” Trevor Mallard said. “It will focus on improving learning achievement and help at risk students gain NCEA achievement levels.”

“The $40,000 will be made available to scope the planning of the three year project,” he said. “That will include identifying the target students, research in to best practice for teachers, strategies to raise student achievement and preparing teachers of Year 9 students for the 2006 start.”

“This funding is part of the Ministry of Education’s Collaborative Innovations Fund which provides $1 million each year to encourage collaborative projects that enhance student learning among schools.

“With the support of the Collaborative Innovations Fund towards projects such as this, we are developing an education system that meets the needs of a diverse range of students and focuses on raising achievement for all,” Trevor Mallard said.

“This project provides an opportunity to strengthen and develop the existing support and co-operation between the eight Hamilton secondary schools. Once it begins in 2006 these schools will be committing their own funding and resources to develop the programme.”
