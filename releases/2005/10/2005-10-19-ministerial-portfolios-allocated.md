Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced a major reallocation of ministerial portfolio responsibilities.

Helen Clark said that the government was renewing and refreshing itself for the third term in government.

"Experienced ministers need new challenges and we have a significant number of new ministers to fill the slots of those retiring," said Helen Clark.

Key changes in allocation follow:

- Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen continues as Minister of Finance and Leader of the House, as well as becoming Minister for Tertiary Education.
- Third ranked minister Jim Anderton takes on the major primary industry portfolios of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, together with biosecurity. I am keen to see a more strategic focus by government on how we work alongside these major industries which are critical to New Zealand's economy and export profile.

- Phil Goff's huge experience and credibility in international relations will be invaluable in his new portfolios of Defence, and Disarmament and Arms Control.

He also continues as Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, and takes on Associate Minister of Finance.
