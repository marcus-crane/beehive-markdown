The results of an independent inquiry into police culture in the Counties Manukau District have been welcomed by Police Minister, George Hawkins.

"Sir David Tompkins has not found evidence of a culture which condones or encourages inappropriate treatment of prisoners," Mr Hawkins said.

"The unacceptable actions of an individual officer led to this inquiry and that case has been dealt with by the courts.

"I congratulate Police management on the way they are working to foster a climate of integrity and teamwork amongst staff in Counties Manukau."
