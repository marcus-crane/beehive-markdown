The Minister of Police, George Hawkins has paid tribute to Police Commissioner Rob Robinson, who has announced that he would be stepping down from his role at the end of the year.

"Mr Robinson is a good commissioner who has dealt with issues head-on," said Mr Hawkins. "Under him, Police have helped achieve the lowest crime rate in 25 years, the highest clearance rate in 18 years and kept our roads safer than they have been in decades.

"Today's announcement is a sad day for Police but I thank Mr Robinson for his considerable contribution and wish him good luck in the future."
