Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard is delighted that a property on the Kaipara Harbour has been gifted to the Auckland Regional Council.

The owners of Atiu Creek Farm, which is situated on the Kaipara Harbour, have gifted the property to ARC. The ARC will take ownership on 1 July 2006 and it will become the region's third largest regional park.

"I am delighted that the Auckland Regional Council has been gifted this piece of land. It confirms the respect that Aucklanders have for the ARC and its continued role in ensuring that a representative range of Auckland's unique landscapes will be preserved for the future," Judith Tizard said.

"I wish to thank the farm's owners, Pierre and Jackie Chatelanat, for their generous gift and vision for the future. The land will be preserved and protected and New Zealanders will be able to enjoy its unique characteristics as a regional park," Judith Tizard said.
