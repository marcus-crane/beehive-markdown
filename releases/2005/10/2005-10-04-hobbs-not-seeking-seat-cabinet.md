Wellington Central MP and Minister Marian Hobbs is not seeking a seat in Cabinet in the new Labour-led government.

"I strongly believe in what Labour has done and continues to do for New Zealand," Marian Hobbs said. "We are a government that is working for all Kiwis, providing hope, inclusion and opportunity. I want to see Labour lead New Zealand into the future, and to do that we need to renew and refresh for re-election in 2008. New faces and ideas around the Cabinet table are an important part of this.

"Eighteen months ago I told the Prime Minister I would be unlikely to seek a spot at the Cabinet table if we were able to secure a third term in government. I have confirmed that intention with her. I am still very much committed to working for a Helen Clark-led government, and I am keen to play whatever role is asked of me.

"I have enjoyed my time as a minister enormously. I am particularly proud of my work in setting up the Code of Practice with commercial radio that now means 20 per cent of the music we hear is Kiwi music. I am also proud of our work in protecting and preserving the environment. The clean up of the Mapua site in Nelson is one highlight of many that particularly stands out for me. The National Library and Archives New Zealand are great institutions that I will continue to advocate vigorously for.

"I remain committed to serving the people of Wellington Central as their MP. I am very humbled by the confidence the Wellington Central electorate has shown in me, re-electing me for a third time, with a majority of over 6000. I am also proud that Wellington Central saw the largest percentage increase in any electorate in Labour's party vote. This is a great city, and one that I will continue to give my utmost to serve."
