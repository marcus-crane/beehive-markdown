Foreign Minister Winston Peters has welcomed Israel’s announcement that it intends to reopen its Embassy in Wellington.

“This provides a helpful basis for strengthening our bilateral relationship with Israel.

“Israel closed its Embassy in Wellington in October 2002. Israel’s bilateral contacts with New Zealand have since been conducted from its Embassy in Canberra.

“There has been a period recently of strained relations but that period is now behind us. The New Zealand Government welcomes Israel’s decision to re-open its Wellington Mission. The Embassy will provide an additional means for dialogue and cooperation between our countries,” Mr Peters said.

Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom made the announcement after meeting with New Zealand's Turkey-based Ambassador to Israel, Jan Henderson.

Ms Henderson is currently making her first accreditation visit to Israel since two Israeli citizens were arrested last year on charges related to passport fraud.

Diplomatic links with Israel were suspended until August when the two sides agreed to exchange letters, including a statement of regret by Israel over the actions of its two citizens, which enabled the reestablishment of normal friendly relations.
