National's policy of 'PC Eradication' has already started to backfire horribly, says Steve Maharey.

"Less than 24 hours after National's Wayne Mapp launched his assault on political correctness, his own party has contradicted its new policy," Steve Maharey said.

"This morning Dr Mapp said he would 'eradicate' the Human Rights Commission's advocacy role because it was too PC.

"Thirty minutes later National's Paul Hutchison came out in support of the Human Rights Commission's advocacy report on access to public transport for people with disabilities.

"Does Dr Mapp disagree with his colleague Dr Hutchison, or does he now believe the Human Rights Commission should have an advocacy role?

"Does he support Dr Hutchison's call for improved access to public transport for the disabled, or Allan Duff's call - reported on National Radio today - for disabled people to get used to the idea that life is unfair?

"Wayne Mapp is not off to a good start. He, or his Party leader Don Brash should explain to New Zealanders with a disability where National stands on this issue."
