The fisheries bust at a school gala last week is being investigated by the new Minister of Fisheries, Jim Anderton.

"The way the law is currently written, the fisheries officers had little choice but to investigate the stall at the Waiharara school Calf Day last weekend, and to question the person running it.

"I have asked my Ministry officials to look into the issue of selling or raffling fish for charity, to see what options are available to deal with a situation like this," Jim Anderton said.
