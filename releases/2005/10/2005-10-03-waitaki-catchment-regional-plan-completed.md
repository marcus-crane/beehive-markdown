The Waitaki Catchment Water Allocation Plan was officially handed to Environment Minister Marian Hobbs today by the chair of the Waitaki Catchment Water Allocation Board Judge David Sheppard.

The Plan, developed by the board, provides the framework for allocating water in the Waitaki catchment. It will help guide decision-making on resource consent applications to use water from the catchment.

The government appointed the Waitaki Catchment Water Allocation Board under legislation passed in September last year – giving them 12 months to develop the regional plan.

"Their job was to produce a plan that included rules and policies to direct how water use should be managed in the Waitaki catchment," Marian Hobbs said. "I congratulate and thank them for completing their job and within the 12 month deadline."

The legislation was introduced because the region faced a very large number of water use applications and no regional water plan to guide decision-making. Meridian Energy Ltd's withdrawal of Project Aqua still left competing demands for water in the Waitaki catchment, Marian Hobbs said.

The Board revised the Waitaki Catchment Water Allocation Plan after considering 1197 submissions on its draft plan, and hearings in Oamaru and Omarama over six-weeks in June and July.

The Plan, to be implemented by the Canterbury Regional Council, also includes changes to the Otago Regional Council's water plan for the small part of the catchment that is in the Otago region.

The Plan becomes operative in three weeks, unless there is an appeal to the High Court. Any appeal can only be on a point of law. The period for lodging an appeal with the High Court is 15 working days from the day each submitter is notified of the decision.

Once the plan becomes operative, Canterbury Regional Council can commence processing the applications for resource consents that were held over under the Waitaki law until the plan was prepared. Any further applications can also be processed under the provisions of the plan.

Once the regional plan is operative, the Waitaki Catchment Water Allocation Board will be dissolved.

The plan will be released publicly at noon today and will be accompanied by three supporting documents including a document giving the Board's decisions and reasons for adopting the Plan's provisions, a document evaluating the Plan's provisions, and a document containing material referred to in the Plan.
