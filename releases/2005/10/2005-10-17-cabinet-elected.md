A ballot was held for the remaining 17 places. Eleven serving ministers were re-elected and six new ministers were elected.

Helen Clark said the Hon Jim Sutton did not contest the ballot.

"I will be appointing him as Minister of Trade Negotiations, with Cabinet ranking, till the end of the year so that he is available for the important Hong Kong ministerial meeting of the WTO," Helen Clark said.

Helen Clark said that she and Dr Cullen would be working on Tuesday to determine portfolio allocations and appointments of members of the executive outside Cabinet.

The objective is to have ministers sworn in on Wednesday afternoon.
