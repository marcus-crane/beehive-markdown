Pete Hodgson, Convenor of the Ministerial Group on Climate Change, today reiterated that those on fixed incomes, including superannuitants, have their benefits adjusted to take into account any moves in the cost of living.

He made the statement in response to Grey Power and emphasised that adjustments would take into account any price effects arising from the introduction of the carbon tax in 2007.
