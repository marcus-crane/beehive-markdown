Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen confirmed today Labour would support the amendment to the Legislature Act recommended by the Privileges Committee in the wake of the Buchanan v Jennings case.

The recommendation would make it clear that no criminal or civil liability will be incurred as a result of a person merely endorsing, adopting or affirming statements made under parliamentary privilege if there is no matter that would give rise to that liability.

“This would effectively restore what everyone understood to be the status quo. That is the clear advice from senior constitutional law experts,” Dr Cullen said.

“The Jennings decision as it stands would have a chilling effect on Parliament’s rights of freedom of speech and on the media.”

Dr Cullen said all parties had supported the proposed legislative change in the select committee.

The legislation will be introduced after the election.
