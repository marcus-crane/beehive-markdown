Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that the government is prepared to contribute up to an additional $3.6 million (GST exclusive) to the Auckland War Memorial Museum’s major redevelopment project.

Helen Clark said that the offer of additional funding over 2006-08 is being made to enable the museum project to be satisfactorily completed. Rising costs of construction in the Auckland market have been largely outside the Museum's control.

"The funding would be provided on an incentive basis. The Museum will have to raise $5 million (GST inclusive, or $4.4 million GST exclusive) as its contribution towards the total additional costs of the project. The government would match 80 cents for each dollar the Museum raises, to the maximum of $3.6 million," Helen Clark said.

Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage and Minister for Auckland Issues, Judith Tizard, said the additional funding demonstrated the government's commitment to ensuring that the museum's nationally significant collections are displayed in contemporary facilities of an international standard.
