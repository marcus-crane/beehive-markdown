31 May 2005Media Statement  
Prisoners and Victims Bill to be passed this week

Leader of the House Michael Cullen said today that agreement in principle had been reached with the Green Party to support the passage this week under urgency of the Prisoners and Victims Bill.

“The bill will now include a sunset clause to enable more time to consider some of the broader issues, including suggestions around a proposed prison inspectorate, how victims are assisted, particularly in the immediate post-trauma period, and other matters.

“Given the cases before the courts at the present time, however, it is important that legislation is enacted quickly and I am grateful to the Greens for their support,” Dr Cullen said.
