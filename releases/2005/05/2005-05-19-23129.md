Disarmament and Arms Control Minister Marian Hobbs is delighted that New Zealand has committed more than $3 million over the next four years to the G8 Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction (WMD).

"This contribution underscores New Zealand's practical commitment to disarmament and to the fight against WMD proliferation," Marian Hobbs said. "The projects being carried out under this G8 programme will help to make a safer world for everyone."

Leaders of the G8 economies (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Britain and the United States) launched the Global Partnership in 2002 against the backdrop of the 11 September terrorist attacks and concerns about unsecured nuclear, chemical and biological weapons legacies in the former Soviet Union.

Projects include securing and disposing of nuclear material, the destruction of chemical weapons stocks, and dismantling decommissioned nuclear submarines.

"This funding will build on the contribution of $1.2 million New Zealand made to the G8 Global Partnership last year, towards funding the chemical weapons destruction project in Shchuch'ye, Russia," Marian Hobbs said.

"The next step for us will be to work with G8 partners to identify further suitable projects for New Zealand funds.

"G8 partners welcomed New Zealand's contribution to the chemical weapons destruction project in Russia. We want to look for similar opportunities for New Zealand to make a practical contribution."
