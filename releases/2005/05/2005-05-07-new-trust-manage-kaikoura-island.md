Conservation Minister Chris Carter has appointed the Motu Kaikoura Trust to control and manage the reserve on Kaikoura Island.

The announcement follows the $10.5m joint venture purchase of Kaikoura last year by the government, the ASB Community Trust, the Auckland Regional Council and Auckland’s local authorities.

"It was a community vision that resulted in the protection of Kaikoura, and the opening up of it for the public. As such, it is appropriate that a community trust manage this spectacular Hauraki Gulf island," Mr Carter said.

The Motu Kaikoura Trust includes representatives from the Native Forests Restoration Trust, Forest & Bird, the Great Barrier Island Trust and community board, Ngati Rehua, the Auckland Regional Council, Supporters of Tiritiri Matangi, Outward Bound, the Outdoor Pursuits Centre of NZ, and a number of well-known business people and academics.

"Kaikoura Island has a immense potential for conservation, recreation, and for the outdoor education of New Zealand youth," Mr Carter said.

"This trust is the body charged with fulfilling that potential, and I have every confidence that in time they will."

Kaikoura Island is located on the western side of Great Barrier Island and is 564 hectares in size, making it the seventh largest island in the Hauraki Gulf. Strategically placed, it forms the natural harbours of Port Fitzroy and Port Abercombie.
