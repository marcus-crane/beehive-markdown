Finance Minister Michael Cullen says that after just six days, National’s tax bribe policy lies in tatters.

“Last Friday, Don Brash promised tax cuts by Christmas – a phrase creepily reminiscent of his ‘gone by lunchtime’ blunder over New Zealand’s nuclear free status.

“By Tuesday, John Key was telling the Christchurch Press that the cuts might take up to nine years.

“On Wednesday, felled by the OECD report which made it clear tax cuts would lead to interest rate rises, Mr Key was saying the ‘by Christmas’ promise might be off.

“This was confirmed this morning when Dr Brash told Morning Report that, in the unlikely event they make government, they might have to defer their plans until they had been able to make corresponding cuts to expenditure to avoid pushing up interest rates.

“If this is how confused National can be in Opposition, imagine how they would cope with the pressures of government,” Dr Cullen said.

“Meanwhile Dr Brash is trying to get nasty and personal but his attempts at character assassination were like butter trying to cut a knife as he delved into his repertoire of naughty 1950s schoolboy words.

“Tax cuts mean higher interest rates or spending cuts in key government services, or both,” Dr Cullen said.
