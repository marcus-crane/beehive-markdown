Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) has reported back to government following the conclusion of the consultation process around the Geospatial Information – the future role of government discussion document released in November 2004. Geospatial information is used widely across government, by private individuals and business. It covers many areas including marine and land mapping as well detail around land and properly titles. The consultation process was designed to canvas views and how best geospatial information could be collected, managed and made available. A number of workshops were held and over 100 submissions made. Overall, there was widespread support for government developing a geospatial information strategy. LINZ will use feedback from the consultation process to develop a draft Geospatial Information Strategy for government to be focused in four main areas:1.Governance – promoting coordination of geospatial resources across government2.Data – defining what type of information should be collected3.Access – looking at how geospatial information can be made available, and4.Interoperability – ensuring the data collected is in a form that meets the relevant standards. Once the draft strategy has been drawn up, LINZ will once again consult with key stakeholders then report back to government.
