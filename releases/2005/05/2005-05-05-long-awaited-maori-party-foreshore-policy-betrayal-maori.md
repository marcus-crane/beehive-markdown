"The Maori Party's long awaited foreshore and seabed ‘policy’ is nothing less than a shocking betrayal of whanau, hapu and Iwi given that they are promising to bed down with the National & Act Parties to repeal the current foreshore and seabed legislation," said Dover Samuels MP for Te Tai Tokerau.

"Now that the rhetoric of the last 12 months has subdued, where is their response to the hikoi demand for Maori ownership, sovereignty and the claims of crown confiscation in their policy, the hikoi deserves an answer," says Dover Samuels.

"The Maori Party's policy does not protect Maori customary rights and has the potential to alienate a huge number of Maori landowners from their ancestral whenua.

This is a real credibility issue for the Maori Party, once again they are so lacking in detail that it is difficult to make any meaningful comment on it.

Labours Maori Caucus has worked to protect Maori interests in the Seabed and Foreshore and at least two major Iwi have recognised this by engaging in meaningful talks with the crown.

It is interesting that the Maori Party intends to legislate over the rights of private property owners by legislating for access given the policy will require hapu and iwi to negotiate with organisations that may be better resourced.

Under the Foreshore and Seabed Act those wanting to access the foreshore through private property will need to negotiate access rights with the current landowner, Dover Samuels says it is clear the Maori Party's policy will remove that right.

This was never an issue, which could be dealt with on a winner-takes-all basis. It required a careful balancing of competing rights and interests. The current legislation achieves that balance,” said Dover Samuels.
