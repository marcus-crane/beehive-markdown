The Chair of the National People's Congress of China, Wu Bangguo will visit New Zealand from 25 to 28 May, Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today.

Mr Wu is the second highest-ranking politician in China after President Hu Jintao, who visited New Zealand in October 2003.

The National People’s Congress is China's parliament. It has nearly 3000 deputies, representing China’s provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions and armed forces.

The NPC elects the President of China, State Council members, and members of the Standing Committee of the NPC (of which Mr Wu is also a member). It also passes Chinese Communist Party policy into law.

Mr Wu will be accompanied by a large delegation, including representatives of the NPC and senior officials. While here, he will have talks with the Prime Minister and the Speaker and visit creative and innovative industries, including Wellington's Weta studios.
