A new job partnership with the Auckland Chamber of Commerce to provide more opportunities for sole parents on the DPB to take up work, was launched today by Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey.

Steve Maharey said the job partnership demonstrates the government’s commitment to providing people with work opportunities while also addressing the need for skilled workers in key industries.

"The government will work with the Auckland Chamber of Commerce to identify skills and labour gaps in the regions. Work and Income will then draw from a pool of selected candidates – in this case primarily Domestic Purpose benefit clients – who have career aspirations that meet the needs of employers. The Chamber will provide or nominate training and support as required," Steve Maharey said.

"The success of this programme will require a shift in employer perceptions. A particular problem is that employers are often reluctant to hire sole parents with young children. To help address this the Chamber will promote the benefits of flexible workplace practices among its members."

The partnership is the ninth in the government’s Jobs Jolt package, joining the hospitality, meat, retail, transport, plumbing, track maintenance, road and bus industries in partnering with Work and Income to provide unemployed people with entry level skills training.

Steve Maharey said that the number of sole parents on the DPB had been on a downward trend since 2000, with the figure now below 100,000 for the first time since 1995.
