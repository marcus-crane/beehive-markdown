The Government will spend an extra $17 million over the next three years in providing a total of up to 7500 more cataracts operations.

Helen Clark and Annette King made the announcement today as they viewed a live cataract operation beamed into Annette King’s Beehive office from the mobile surgical bus in Kapiti.

Helen Clark said the new funding would see, by 2008, a 50 per cent increase on the number of cataract operations being performed now.

“This new cataract initiative is a logical follow-up to the orthopaedics initiative we announced in the Budget last year. Both initiatives are designed to dramatically improve the quality of life for thousands more older New Zealanders,” Helen Clark said.

Annette King said funding will be phased in over three years as capacity is increased to perform the extra operations.

“Currently we are performing about 8000 operations a year, and the aim is to perform an extra 1050 operations in 2005-06, up to 2500 extra in 2006-07, and to reach an extra 4000 operations a year by 2007-08. By then we aim to be performing 12,000 operations a year, a 50 percent increase on what is being done now,” Annette King said.

Annette King said an extra $2.67 million (all figures are gst exclusive) will be provided for the initiative in 2005-06, rising to $5.78 million in 2006-07 and $8.71 million in 2007-08.

“The Ministry of Health is setting up a working group, involving ophthalmologists, optometrists, and District Health Board and Ministry representatives, to find efficient and innovative ways of enabling even greater volumes of cataract surgery than planned to be carried out both over the next three years and subsequent to that.

“The mobile bus is one example of innovative practice, and I expect to see others develop around the country in response to the cataract initiative.  
“As well as Government commitment, we need the goodwill of health professionals, and I am delighted at the support we are receiving,” Annette King said.

Funding for the cataract project will be allocated to DHBs on a population basis. DHBs are expected to use their own facilities as the first option, those of neighbouring DHBs if more capacity is needed, and private facilities when required.

Helen Clark said when the cataract initiative is fully implemented, there will be more equal access to services around the country.

“For example, DHBs will be encouraged to consider using the mobile bus, particularly to improve access for those living in rural areas, for the elderly and those people who find transport difficult to arrange,” Helen Clark said.

“We are achieving equality of access with the orthopaedics project as well, and both initiatives illustrate this Government’s commitment to building a fair and inclusive society.”

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

What is a cataract?

A cataract is a clouding of the natural lens of the eye.

Who gets cataract?

Cataract is mainly a disease of the elderly. Studies overseas show that 50-60 percent of adults over 65 years have cataract.

What happens during a cataract operation?

During a cataract operation the damaged lens is removed and replaced with an artificial lens.

Most commonly, the natural lens is broken into microscopic particles and gently suctioned out of the eye, and a new lens is then inserted.

The actual procedure takes less than one hour. Most patients can be discharged home the same day they receive surgery.

Does cataract surgery require a General Anaesthetic?

Most cataract operations can be performed under a local anaesthetic administered either by injection or drops. In some patients a general anaesthetic is needed. The surgeon determines the most suitable anaesthetic for the patient.

Why aren’t both eyes treated at the same time?

Generally, even if you require cataract surgery in both eyes, only one eye at a time will be treated. With any surgery there is a risk of infection, and if both eyes are treated simultaneously, there is a greater risk that if an infection occurs in one eye it could spread to the other eye with devastating results.

How much does a cataract operation cost in New Zealand?

DHB are funded on a population basis to provide the required services for their populations. The price paid by the Ministry of Health to DHBs for a cataract operation and associated appointments is approximately $2,000 - $2,500.

Why can’t New Zealand perform cataracts as cheaply as the Fred Hollows Foundation?  
The major component of cataract surgery is the labour cost. The cost of employing the highly skilled New Zealand workforce is significantly greater than the labour cost in developing countries. New Zealand adopts modern techniques, equipment and lenses for cataract operations and these come at a higher cost.

How many cataract operations happen in New Zealand now?

In 2003/04, approximately 8,000 cataract operations were publicly provided in New Zealand.

How many people will benefit from this initiative?

Over the next three years up to 7,500 extra cataract operations will take place.

When fully implemented an extra 4,000 people per year will benefit from this initiative.

When will the first operation occur?

Extra funding for cataract operations will become available in 2005/06. The funding will only be available for “extra operations” over and above those DHBs are already funded to provide. The timing of the extra operations will depend on the DHBs, and their capacity to increase the number of procedures they perform.

I have had one eye operated on. With this announcement, am I more likely to receive surgery on my other eye?

As with all Elective surgery, access to surgery is based upon a patient’s need. For cataract operations a tool is used to prioritise patient need, and allow comparison between patients. The current cataract scoring tool is available at http://www.electiveservices.govt.nz/pdfs/ophthalmology-cpac.pdf

As part of the Cataract Initiative the Ministry of Health will work with Ophthalmologists and Optometrists to review this tool, ensuring it remains appropriate.

What is the breakdown of extra cataract operations, by region?

The number of extra cataracts provided by region will be finalised over the next month or so. The number of cataracts to be performed in each region will be determined by a combination of:  
·the capacity of the DHB to provide more surgeries, (operating theatres, staff etc)  
·the level of service currently being provided by the DHB for their population.  
Information on the current level of service being provided by DHBs is available at: http://www.nzhis.govt.nz/stats/surgical/tables.html

What is the difference between an Ophthalmologist, Optometrist and an Optician?

An Optometrist is a specialist in vision care who is trained to detect, measure and correct vision problems. Optometrists are trained to detect signs of disease and diagnose eye conditions. They refer patients for medical attention as required, usually to an Ophthalmologist.  
An Ophthalmologist is a qualified medical practitioner, who is qualified to undertake both medical management and surgical procedures for eye disease.  
A Dispensing Optician is qualified to advise you on what frames and lenses best suit your needs, prescription and consequently make up the spectacles for you. A dispensing optician does not test eyes.  
What will be the role of the Working Party?  
As well as the increase in cataract operations, an important component of the Cataract Initiative will be the establishment of a joint working party of Ophthalmologist, Optometrist, District Health Board and Ministry of Health representatives. The role of this group will be to:  
·advise on the most effective and efficient use of the available workforce  
·identify the most appropriate patient care pathway utilising the available workforce  
·examine and promote innovative practice to improve services.

What innovative practice exists currently?

The new Elective Services Initiatives Fund (ESIF) was launched in 2005. This Fund supports pilot initiatives designed to improve efficiency, productivity and Elective Services Patient Flow Indicators (ESPIs). Six of the approved pilot initiatives are ophthalmology related.  
There are five nurse-led initiatives, which aim to increase First Specialist Assessment (FSA) rates and reduce patient waiting times by freeing up consultants to see new patients. These initiatives aim to fully utilise a broader range of nursing skills within their scope of practice. The nurse led initiatives are:  
(a)Cataract Clinic (Auckland DHB). Clinical Nurse Specialists will see pre and post-operative cataract patients in clinic.  
(b)Fundus Fluorescein Angiography Clinic (Capital and Coast DHB). A nurse will perform this Fundus Fluorescein Angiography diagnostic test. The purpose is to free up consultants to do more FSAs.  
(c)Glaucoma Monitoring Clinic (Otago DHB). A nurse will monitor stable glaucoma patients to free up Consultants to do more FSAs.  
(d)Pre-Assessment Clinics for Cataract Surgery (Waikato DHB). Nurses will provide pre and post-operative assessment of patients. The aim is to increase volumes of cataract surgery and reduce patient waiting times by streamlining the preadmission clinic process, reducing patient ‘did not attends’ (DNA) and reducing same day theatre cancellations.  
(e)Visual Field Clinic (Hawke’s Bay DHB). Nurses will carry out visual field tests to free up consultants to carry out more FSAs.  
Funding has also been approved for one optometrist initiative:  
(f)Optometrist Eye Assessment Clinic (Capital and Coast DHB). The aim is to reduce FSA patient waiting times for comprehensive visual and ocular assessment. The Clinic will assess whether patients would benefit from surgery and whether their condition is over the service funded treatment threshold. This initiative aims to support DHB funded optometrists to assess Ophthalmology patients referred to the DHB by General Practitioners.  
These pilot schemes, which trial new ways of doing things in their respective DHBs, are to be completed within a six month period by 30 June 2006. An independent evaluator will assess the outcomes from these pilots. If the pilots receive a positive evaluation the DHB will provide ongoing funding.

How many people are currently waiting for cataract surgery?

A “snapshot” of the National Booking and Reporting System for March 2005, showed that almost 400 people had been given a commitment to treatment but had been waiting more than six months for cataract surgery. This initiative should provide treatment initially for this group. Over time, the threshold at which treatment can be offered will be lowered.

This funding is only for cataract operations. What about other eye procedures?

In a number of DHBs, cataract operations have been displaced by other higher priority procedures. Cataract operations have been identified as a useful start point for considering the way ophthalmology services are organised. Cataract surgery is considered amenable to innovation and efficiency in the patient care pathway, and an area in which significant gains can be made to benefit patients.

How well is the Orthopaedic Initiative performing?

For the period July to March 1220 additional joints have been delivered (verified by coding). Additional numbers for February and March will be confirmed as coding is completed within the DHBs. More up to date figures will be available shortly.

Total coded joints delivered for July to March are:  
FY 04-05 - 4757  
FY 03-04 - 3898  
FY 02-03 - 3603
