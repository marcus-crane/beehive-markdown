It's official. New Zealand has the best tourism website in the world.

Tourism New Zealand's www.newzealand.com site has been awarded the internet world's version of an Oscar – a 'Webby'.

The International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences has recognised the site as the top tourism site in the world.

Tourism Minister Mark Burton congratulated Tourism New Zealand on their win.

"The Webby awards are the leading international prizes honouring excellence in the online field. It is a very prestigious award and re-affirms that New Zealand tourism is at the top of its game.

"Winning the Webby will encourage more and more people to visit the site and see what New Zealand has to offer as an overseas destination and as a place to do business."

www.newzealand.com championed leading international tourism sites such as Yellowstone Park, the Italian Tourism Commission and Puerto Rico Tourism.

Thousands of sites enter into the awards, but only five are chosen to battle it out in each category. The five sites are then judged by content, structure and navigation, visual design, functionality, interactivity and overall experience.

"Tourism New Zealand's site is a wonderful tool for promoting New Zealand to the interactive traveller. More than 260 000 hits are made each month which means millions of hits every year since it became live in 2003 - it is an excellent way to market New Zealand to prospective visitors and indeed, potential investors and business partners."

This is not the first award Tourism New Zealand has received for its world- leading website. In 2003, it was named the best travel and tourism site at the NetGuide awards. The site also won two of the top Telecommunications Users Association of New Zealand (TUANZ) awards in 2004.

www.newzealand.com is designed to market New Zealand as a holiday destination to prospective international visitors and helps them plan their trip.

Previous winners of the tourism Webby include Lonely Planet, The New York Times and Expedia.
