Auckland Central MP Judith Tizard today welcomed the news that emergency response measures were being eased back against a claimed foot and mouth disease outbreak on Waiheke Island.

The receipt of a second letter, claiming the release of foot and mouth disease on Waiheke Island had not happened, reinforced a conviction that this was a hoax. As well, continued surveillance has shown no sign of the disease.

"It is a relief to be able to ease the emergency response measures. Low-level monitoring of stock will continue until next Monday," Judith Tizard said.

"I thank all Waiheke Island residents for the way they have responded to this threat, particularly the farmers who have handled a stressful situation superbly. I am also grateful for the excellent work undertaken by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF), Waiheke Community Board, Auckland Regional Council and Auckland City Council.

"I understand there has been good cooperation between the police and other government agencies and am pleased that this threat has been handled in an appropriate and timely manner," Judith Tizard said.
