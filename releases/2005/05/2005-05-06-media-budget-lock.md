The budget lock-up for media and analysts will be held on Thursday, 19 May from 11am in the Deloitte Gallery at the Westpac Stadium.

The change of venue from other years is due to the fact that the Beehive banquet Hall is being refurbished.

Access to the Deloitte Gallery will be permitted from 10.30am for those needing to set up equipment. Treasury officials will be available from 11:30am to answer factual questions. Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Associate Finance Minister Trevor Mallard will attend from 12 noon to 12:45pm.

A bus will be provided at 1.40pm to return accredited gallery media to Parliament in time for the delivery of the Budget Speech. Gallery media only will be allowed to leave the lock-up at 1:40pm.

All others will be permitted to leave when Dr Cullen begins the Budget Speech at about 2pm.

The budget information will also be available on CD-ROM.

Please note: NO dial up internet facilities will be available. The Stadium only provides wireless internet access (via CaféNET). If you require access to the internet once the embargo has been lifted you will need a wireless enabled laptop and a CaféNET account. Please see [www.cafenet.co.nz/about/what](www.cafenet.co.nz/about/what.html) for more information.

A technical briefing to assist understanding of some of the key background issues – for example, the government’s approach to fiscal management and the impact of the Public Finance Act changes - will be held on Friday 13 May from 9:30am to 10:30am at level 5, The Treasury, 1 The Terrace.

Organisations must RSVP by 5pm Wednesday 11 May to Katy Greco-Ainslie in Dr Cullen’s office on (04) 471 9091; fax (04) 495 8442; or e-mail: [katy.greco-ainslie@parliament.govt.nz](mailto:katy.greco-ainslie@parliament.govt.nz)

Please advise:

- names of those attending the lock-up,
- whether they will also attend the technical briefing, and
- whether they wish to take the bus. There are limited seats available on the bus so we will need a list of names in advance and some rationing may be necessary.

**IMPORTANT:**  
A rolling embargo applies to the content of the budget documents. Information within the budget documentation can be released once Dr Cullen has dealt with that area or issue in the Budget Speech. Areas not discussed in the Budget Speech, including the discussion at the press conference, are embargoed until the documents are tabled in the House and must not be communicated in any form, or acted on until that time.

Compliance with the embargo provisions is being monitored.

Any organisation found to wilfully break the embargo provisions may be refused permission to attend future lockups.
