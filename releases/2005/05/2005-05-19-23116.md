District health boards will get more than half a billion dollars over the next four years to help them meet the cost of this year's historic pay increase for nurses.

Health Minister Annette King says she is delighted to honour the government's commitment to valuing the role of nurses. The commitment was signalled in February when details of a 'pay jolt' were finalised.

Ms King says budget funding will see DHBs get an additional $102 million in 2005-06 and a total of $549.5 million over the next four years.

"The government is supporting DHBs in making this settlement because it delivers fair pay for nurses," Ms King said. "It will help DHBs recruit and retain people in the largest profession within the health sector."

DHBs will still contribute toward the settlement from within their existing budgets.
