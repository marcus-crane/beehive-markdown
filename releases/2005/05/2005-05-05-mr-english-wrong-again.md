Mr English is completely wrong about the availability of final NCEA grades to students and schools, says Associate Education Minister David Benson-Pope.

Students have been able to access their final NCEA results via the New Zealand Qualifications Authority website since the end of April, and their interim results since January.

National certificates and Records of Learning, where requested, are being lodged with New Zealand Post tomorrow \[subs: Friday, 5 May], not weeks away, as Mr English claims.

Similarly, schools have been able to access their final NCEA results via the New Zealand Qualifications Authority website since the end of April, and their interim results since February.

These school results will be available to the public next week – the second week in May, the same time they were made available last year.

"Mr English is just plain wrong again with his allegations," says Mr Benson-Pope. "Mr English has become increasingly casual with the truth, misleading the public on an habitual basis."
