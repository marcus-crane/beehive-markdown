Associate Education Minister David Benson-Pope today welcomed a new "digital bridge" that will help students of immigrant families living in the Hamilton region.

Cellphones and computers are set to support the students and their families who are from China, Somalia, Tonga, Afghanistan, Ethiopia and Kirabati and living in New Zealand.

"The Ministry of Education Digital opportunities initiative will use information and communication technologies to enhance language ability of the students, but also promote better cultural understanding," Mr Benson-Pope said at festivities celebrating the project at Hamilton East School.

"The aim in using technology this way is to motivate students to improve communication, reading and writing skills," he said.

Digital Opportunites are joint government, schools and business initiatives that aim to support innovative use of ICT to support specific student learning needs, and provide enhanced learning opportunities.

The trial Digital Bridges project, involving Hamilton East Primary School and Peachgrove Intermediate, will be facilitated by Pippa Wright from Hamilton East School and will initially involve six immigrant families, with others joining the programme over the next three years.

Pippa Wright will work in the homes of selected immigrant families and support them in using the technology to communicate with each other and the school. She will help them to develop their own ‘Digital Stories’ related to their lives in other lands.

The Digital Bridges project will be supported by a website that will allows parents to ask questions and share experiences with each other as well as teachers and students in the schools, thereby developing a sense of community ‘belonging’. It is hoped that developing this ‘virtually’ in the first instance can translate to more active engagement with the education of their children in a face-to-face manner, Mr Benson-Pope said.

The first year of the project will focus on development and trialling of a model which can be used for a wider-scale project roll out in 2006 and 2007.
