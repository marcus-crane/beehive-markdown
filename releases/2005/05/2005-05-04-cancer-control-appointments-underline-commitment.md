Health Minister Annette King says the appointment of members to the new Cancer Control Council and of the first Principal Advisor Cancer Control underlines the Government’s commitment to battling a disease that kills one in four New Zealanders.

"We know that at least one-third of cancer can be prevented, and we also know that early detection and effective treatment of a further third of cancer is also possible,” Ms King said today.

"To achieve those objectives, however, we must take a strategic approach toward all cancer services. This new council and the new position of Principal Advisor will ensure New Zealand maintains the strong strategic focus the Government has already put in place with adoption of a Cancer Control Strategy and funding of the $40 million first stage of the Cancer Control Action plan, announced in March.”

Ms King says she is delighted that Auckland District Health Board clinical adviser and radiation oncologist Dr John Childs has accepted the position of Principal Advisor Cancer Control. "With over 25 years experience in clinical oncology and radiotherapy, John is respected as one of our foremost specialists."

"That expertise, and his extensive network of contacts, will be invaluable as he drives implementation of the Cancer Control Strategy and the action plan that underpins it. He will be based within the Ministry of Health and will report directly to me, as well as to the Director-General.

“The Government does not, however, expect Dr Childs to deliver single-handedly. I have also appointed nine members to the Cancer Control Council, to be chaired by former Governor-General Dame Catherine Tizard. The council will oversee implementation of the strategy, which is our road map for trying to reduce the incidence and impact of the disease, and to reduce inequalities with respect to cancer. It will table an annual report in Parliament each year.”

Ms King says the council will provide independent strategic advice to her as Minister, to the Director-General, to DHBs and NGOs. "It is also charged with fostering collaboration and co-operation between bodies involved in cancer control, and promoting and supporting best practice in, and an evidence-based approach to, improving the effectiveness of cancer control.”

Members of the council are: Dame Catherine Tizard (chair), Dr Chris Atkinson (deputy chair), Associate Professor Tony Blakely, Ms Yvonne Boyes, Dr Garry Forgeson, Professor John Gavin, Ms Helen Glasgow, Dr Scott Macfarlane and Dr Beverly Lawton. All the appointments take effect today.
