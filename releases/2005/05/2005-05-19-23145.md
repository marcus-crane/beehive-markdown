19 May 2005Media Statement  
Brash in mire

“Don Brash has dropped himself and the National Party right in the political mire in his budget speech this afternoon,” said Finance Minister Michael Cullen.

“Finally, Dr Brash’s old pre-leader honesty got the better of him.

“He very clearly stated that the growth in spending in this year’s budget had made it impossible to have substantial tax cuts.

“That means, of course, he has now had to admit that if he wants to propose substantial tax cuts, he needs to find substantial expenditure cuts.

“The choice is clear: tax cuts and cuts to health and education spending or Labour’s balanced policies to build a better New Zealand.

“We now look forward to National producing an alternative budget in which they spell out where the cuts in spending will be made to fund their substantial  
tax cuts biassed toward the better off and big business,” Dr Cullen said.
