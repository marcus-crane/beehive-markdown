The Sustainable Farming Fund has a secure future, Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton and Rural Affairs Minister Damien O’Connor said today.

Mr Sutton announced that this year’s Budget would show the fund had moved from being a vulnerable add-on to the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry budget to being a core output.

“In political-speak, the fund has been “baselined” – that is, it’s part of the core funding of Vote Agriculture and Forestry now. This means it should have a much more secure future, with its funding assured, rather than funding being allocated specifically every few years.”

The Sustainable Farming Fund was allocated funding for three financial years in the 2003 Budget.

In this year’s Budget, it is set to receive $8.444 million in the 2006-07 and 2007-08 financial years, and $9.422 million in the 2008-09 financial year. This is the gst exclusive figures, which correlate with previous years’ allocations.

Mr O’Connor said the Sustainable Farming Fund had proved its worth to rural New Zealand.

“More than 300 projects have been funded, with the goal of ensuring the social, economic, and environmental viability of rural communities. The fund has been a great success, with projects producing hugely significant results in some cases.”

He highlighted the work being marketed now on merino footrot resistance genetic markers as an example of what Sustainable Farming Fund projects had produced.
