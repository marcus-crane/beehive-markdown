Forestry is a key contributor to growth in Southland and Otago says Forestry Minister Jim Anderton as he launched an economic and social impact assessment report on the forestry sector by BERL (Business and Economic Research Ltd) this afternoon.

The report was commissioned by the Southern Wood Council.

"It is no surprise that the forestry industry is an important contributor to regional growth. However, this report makes it clear that we can continue to build on that contribution in the future.

"The BERL study makes a number of findings:  
·The forestry sector has been a key driver of growth in Otago and Southland, and will continue to be;  
·The economic benefits of the industry are spread across the two regions, and forestry is a significant employer in smaller communities; and  
·The local industry has taken a strong lead in forest certification.

"We will continue to build up the strength of the forestry industry to lift living standards for everyone in the Southland and Otago regions, and the rest of our forestry regions also," Jim Anderton said.
