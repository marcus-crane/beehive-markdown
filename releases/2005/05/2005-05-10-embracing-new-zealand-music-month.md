"I am delighted that the National Party has finally woken up and decided to embrace New Zealand Music Month", says Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard.

National Party MP Katherine Rich has previously stated that she didn't support the Voluntary Code of Practice, which has seen airplay of New Zealand music increase tenfold since the 1990s, while Wayne Mapp has said that National would reduce spending on arts and culture by 30 per cent.

"This is a sector in which passionate, dedicated people put in a huge amount of effort to support and promote NZ music. I am delighted that National recognises that NZ Music Month should be about all Kiwis celebrating our great home-grown music - today's Steriogram concert at Parliament was such an occasion.

"I look forward to National's continued support of New Zealand's creative industries," Judith Tizard said.
