Tourism New Zealand receives $8.9 million in this year's budget to continue promoting New Zealand overseas in three key tourist markets – the United States, Britain and Japan.

Tourism Minister Mark Burton said the funding would boost the world leading 100% Pure New Zealand campaign in these countries, enabling Tourism New Zealand to further build the brand and extend enthusiasm for New Zealand as a high quality destination.

"The campaign combines advertising, internet, international media coverage, events and trade training to market New Zealand. Since it was launched six years ago, visitor numbers have increased by over 50 per cent and the foreign exchange they spend in our country has doubled, reaching a record $6.6 billion last year.

"Tourism is now a major export industry for New Zealand. It generates around 10 per cent of our GDP and represents one in every ten jobs," Mr Burton said.

"Latest forecast figures show international visitors are expected to reach more than three million in 2010. International visitor spending is expected to grow significantly faster than the visitor numbers."
