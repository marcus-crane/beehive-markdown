Racing Minister Damien O'Connor will officially open Rangiora Racecourse's newly completed training stables this Saturday.

The 30-horse barn is part of a wider upgrade at the racecourse; four months work and $300,000 have been spent upgrading the main grass track and completing the stables.

Mr O'Connor said it was fantastic to see this sort of investment at a provincial level.

"This is a great commitment by the racecourse Grounds Committee to the future of the North Canterbury racing industry. The committee's investment means the dual code facility is now among the best in New Zealand.

"Over time, the local community and the racecourse will reap the benefits of the improved facility. It's also raising the bar for other racetracks."

Waimakariri MP Clayton Cosgrove, a staunch advocate for the District, said he was delighted to have the Minister in town to do the honours, particularly as it coincided with the Rangiora Harness Racing Club's major winter race meeting.

"The upgrade is great news for Rangiora and for the racing community in particular. I'm positive it will also prove to be of great benefit to the various other racing clubs that also utilise these facilities. I encourage everyone to come along, check out the new improved facility, and catch up with the Racing Minister.

The Minister will be at the track for the official opening at 12:30pm, to be followed by the Rangiora Harness Racing Club luncheon and race meeting.
