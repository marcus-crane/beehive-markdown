Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Judith Tizard today issued her annual music quiz to all Members of Parliament in recognition of the fifth celebration of [New Zealand Music Month](http://www.nzmusicmonth.co.nz).

"I don’t mind whether MPs choose to answer the questions off the tops of their heads, or get stuck in and do some research. Either way, I think it’s a great way to celebrate NZ Music Month, and learn a little more about our vibrant music scene," said Judith Tizard.

Prizes will be awarded to the top five entries from MPs and include include New Zealand Music Month t-shirts and CDs by New Zealand musicians. Answers must be in to Judith Tizard’s office by 12 noon, Wednesday 11 May.

Judith Tizard said that 2005 has been an exciting year for New Zealand sounds, as the New Zealand music industry continues to go from strength to strength.

“The Labour-led government believes that the music industry offers a unique contribution to New Zealand culture, and is a valuable means of promoting New Zealand on the international stage," Judith Tizard said.

"Our investment in NZ music has produced some outstanding results - as a result of the Code of Practice, airplay of NZ music has nearly doubled since March 2002. Figures released in February this year showed that NZ music accounted for 18.6 per cent of music played on commercial radio in 2004, a huge jump from 1995 when NZ music accounted for less than two per cent of music played on commercial radio.

"The New Zealand Music Industry Commission (NZMIC) has also been working hard to create jobs using home-grown talent and take our music to the world. Government has just announced additional funding of $662,000 for the NZMIC, to enhance domestic activities and develop a programme that will help NZ music export projects break into overseas markets.

"Music month provides an opportunity for all New Zealanders to celebrate our artists, our fantastic creativity and musical achievements - something all Kiwis can be proud of. I encourage you to find out the Music Month performances in your region and head along to support your local musicians," Judith Tizard said.
