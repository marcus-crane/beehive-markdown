A 10-year plan for the housing sector was launched today by Housing Minister Steve Maharey, at the Auckland University Fale Pasifika.

Steve Maharey said the New Zealand Housing Strategy - which identifies seven priorities over the next decade - would build on the government's programme of work in state housing, home ownership and the growth of housing provided by the third sector.

"This is the first time we have had a strategy in New Zealand which sets out a vision for housing over the long-term. The aim is to ensure we continue to have affordable quality housing that meets the needs of all New Zealanders," Steve Maharey said.

"That means continuing to support those in need, but it also means developing new approaches to issues like the decline in home ownership and the growth of the private rental market.

"In the 1980s one in four people rented, today it's one in three – that implies big shifts in our society which we need to recognise and respond to. Rather than just watching the trends, this government is responding with a clear programme of action.

"Over the last 6 years we have invested more than $2 billion to reinvigorate the housing sector through state housing, home ownership assistance and by building the capacity of the third sector to deliver community-based housing.

"This strategy sets out how we intend to move forward on housing. The housing market is always changing and the strategy offers flexibility for solutions to grow at the local level.”

The Strategy’s seven areas of action are:  
§Sustainable Housing Supply  
§Assistance and Affordability  
§Home Ownership  
§Private Rental Sector  
§Housing Quality  
§Sector Capability  
§Meeting Diverse Needs.

The discussion document, Building the Future – Towards a New Zealand Housing Strategy, attracted submissions from over 200 organisations and individuals, and input from more than 500 people at meetings throughout the country last year.

The Strategy is available online at www.hnzc.co.nz or by calling Housing New Zealand on 0800 801 601. For further details on the Strategy, refer to the following fact sheet.

New Zealand Housing Strategy  
Fact sheet

The New Zealand Housing Strategy focuses on seven areas of the housing sector. It includes work underway as well as planned new work.

New initiatives include:

§a home ownership pacakge including deposit assistance linked to a work-based savings scheme  
§education programmes to help people make sound home ownership decisions  
§an Auckland based project to find solutions to local supply constraints  
§work to develop clearer funding policies and initiatives to support emergency housing  
§a design competition as part of the Year of the Built Environment activities  
§exploring workforce accommodation difficulties experienced in some localities  
§new research on future housing market scenarios  
§the development of housing work programmes for people whose social, health and support needs are not always met by the housing market.

1\. Sustainable Housing Supply  
The Government wants to work with local authorities, the building and development industries and other stakeholders to ensure New Zealand has an adequate housing supply that is well designed and built in the right way, and for a range of housing needs.  
The Strategy emphasises the importance of lasting urban development and planning. This is especially relevant to high growth areas like Auckland, which will be the initial focus of work under this area of the Strategy. Local and regional solutions to housing supply issues will also be encouraged.

2\. Assistance and Affordability  
This part of the Strategy focuses on actions to support those households that need help accessing affording, adequate, housing. It emphasises the continued expansion of the state housing stock; reviewing the Accommodation Supplement; and expanding social housing through the Housing Innovation and Local Government housing funds, so community-based groups and local government can increase their involvement in providing housing.  
The Strategy’s initiatives in this area aim to help balance the demand for, and supply of, housing.

3\. Home Ownership  
New Zealand’s level of home ownership is high by international standards, but has declined in recent years. Many people who commented on the Strategy’s discussion document believed that Government should play a more active role in helping people to buy their own homes.

The Government agrees with them. Later this month the Budget will announce a modest package of home ownership initiatives, including:  
§an already signalled expansion of the existing Mortgage Insurance Scheme  
§exploring innovative home ownership programmes including deposit assistance linked to a work-based savings scheme  
§education programmes to support sound decision-making and sustainable home ownership.

4\. Private Rental  
Not everyone wants, or is in a position to own their own home. Initiatives under the Strategy to support home ownership will sit alongside work to encourage the private rental market to provide more stable, quality housing, while also allowing landlords to manage their rental properties effectively.

A comprehensive review of the Residential Tenancies Act is underway and will provided a strong and flexible foundation for the sector’s future development. Actions under the Strategy will look at ways to promote tenure stability and security, and improve education and information for tenants and landlords.

5\. Housing Quality  
Work is already underway to improve the quality of new housing. This includes the implementation of the Building Act 2004 and the review of the Building Code, which governs standards for new building work.

A survey of housing condition will provide information on existing houses and inform a review of the legislation and regulations relating to existing houses.

Other actions in this area will include initiatives focused on the link between housing and health; raising the quality of existing houses by looking at compliance across the housing sector; and ways to encourage better maintenance of privately owned houses.

Also included is a set of design and development initiatives, to position the sector to respond to future planning needs, and design and building opportunities.

6\. Sector Capability  
There is a shortage of skilled tradespeople in New Zealand, which is leading to delays in the building of new housing, and rising building costs. The Government is already working with industry and training providers to address this shortage. For example, the Modern Apprenticeships Programme has resulted in more than 1,000 apprenticeships in the building and construction sector.

The Strategy emphasises inter-agency co-operation across the sector. For example, the Government will work with local authorities to provide guidance on changes introduced in the Building Act 2004.

The Strategy calls for new policy work to better understand the connections between labour and skill shortages, and the housing sector’s ability to respond to supply pressures.

Research coming from the Strategy will include a closer look at:  
§future housing market scenarios  
§the causes of declining home ownership and what that means for our society  
§workforce accommodation difficulties in some places.

7\. Meeting Diverse Needs  
The seventh area of the Strategy looks at New Zealand’s changing population and the implications of that for housing. A greater ethnic and cultural mix adds another dimension to the types of housing needed in New Zealand. Similarly, the number of single-parent families has increased, creating more demand for affordable housing with secure tenure.

Housing work programmes will be developed for groups whose social, health and support needs are not always met by the housing market. These include older people, women, children and youth, disabled people, Maori, Pacific peoples and ethnic communities.

Examples of priorities identified for each group in this part of the Strategy include:  
§Maori: Affordable home ownership; higher quality of private rental housing; education and advocacy to support tenant’s rights; sustainable housing; lending solutions on multiply-owned land; and more kaumatua housing.  
§Pacific peoples: Affordable home ownership, including access to capital; advocacy, education and capacity building; and larger homes designed for Pacific households.  
§Refugee and migrant communities: Safety and security; and community integration.  
§Older people: Housing initiatives that allow people to age in place; planning for an ageing population; and the promotion of universal design principles suitable for older people, for private and state housing.  
§Women: Affordable home ownership; good quality rental housing; and addressing the housing needs of women in emergency housing and refuges.
