Highly effective schools will receive $28.5 million over the next four years to encourage them to continue their high standards and share best practice across the sector, says Education Minister Trevor Mallard.

"The Extending High Standards in Schools initiative announced last year is designed to promote excellence across the school system and create an incentive to improve school and student performance," Trevor Mallard said.

"Our funding commitment acknowledges the contribution schools involved in the Extending High Standards in Schools programme will make to overall improvements in school performance."

The government had previously signalled that $16.8 million would be available from 2006 for the programme. It has now lifted that by 70 per cent, with an additional $11.8 million in Budget 2005.

"From 2006 funding will be made available to schools demonstrating both significant improvements in student achievement and the ability to help other schools achieve success by sharing the things that have made the difference.

"Extending High Standards in Schools gives all schools the opportunity to be recognised for improving school and student performance and will affirm excellence in schools across all deciles.

"I want to see students from right across New Zealand benefit from the implementation of this programme when it begins next year," Trevor Mallard said.
