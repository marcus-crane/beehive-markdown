Schools can now choose from seven Ministry of Education-accredited student management software systems, Associate Education Minister David Benson-Pope announced today.

Student Management System (SMS) software holds and manipulates data relating to a learner, both administrative and information relating to their learning. The Ministry of Education has an SMS project aimed at improving the quality of SMS in schools. It hopes all secondary schools will use accredited products by late 2006 and primary schools by late 2008.

“Schools told us they wanted better quality software products and better quality support to purchase these products and use them well," said Mr Benson-Pope. "The accreditation process has lifted standards as vendors have taken up the challenge of developing systems that really meet the needs of schools. Accrediting suppliers removes the burden schools faced identifying software appropriate to them."

The seven accredited software packages (vendors) are:

- eMinerva (MXL Consolidated Pty. Ltd);
- eTAP (Educational Software Distribution);
- Integris (Itas Education Division, Renaissance Ltd);
- KAMAR (KAMAR Ltd);
- Musac Student Manager (MUSAC);
- PC School 2000 (Com-Assist Solutions Pty. Ltd); and
- Schoolmaster (Kowhai Programming Systems).

Accreditation has driven improvements in the stability, quality and delivery of software as well as better support, training and a more professional level of service from software vendors. Schools using an accredited software package can be more confident in their administration system and will see real benefits in new software and data sharing tools over time.

An Accreditation Results Brochure with graphs of each accredited vendor results, the categories tested, and other important information will be distributed with the 9 May edition of the Education Gazette to all schools. Accredited vendors will retain the accredited status for five years, with a review of the SMS market in three years time to determine whether or not a third round of accreditation is required.
