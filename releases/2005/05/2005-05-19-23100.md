The government will increase land transport funding by $100 million a year for the three years from 2006-07, says Transport Minister Pete Hodgson.

"This budget continues the government's record of substantial funding for the improvement of New Zealand's land transport system," Mr Hodgson said. "Government spending on transport nationally is already 50 per cent more than it was in 1999."

"The new capital funding announced today will raise the amount available to be spent from the National Land Transport Fund to more than $8.4 billion over the next four years.

"The strength of the economy means the government can increase its investment in transport without taking funding away from other essential areas," Mr Hodgson said. "This government is building up the nation's vital infrastructure and wiping out a legacy of neglect."
