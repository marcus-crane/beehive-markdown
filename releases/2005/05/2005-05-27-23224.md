Commerce Minister Pete Hodgson today announced that Denis Byrne is to be re-appointed as an Australian member of the New Zealand Takeovers Panel from 1 June 2005 until 7 March 2007.

John King, chair of the New Zealand panel, was re-appointed to the Australian Takeovers Panel earlier this year.

“Reciprocal appointments such as these promote better understanding of each country's regulatory regimes and strengthen trans-Tasman relationships," says Pete Hodgson. " Denis Byrne has made a positive contribution to the panel's work since his initial appointment, particularly in the areas of class exemption cases and on some division matters.”
