Baseline funding for the provision of home based support increases by $18.7 million in this year's budget.

The money is for 2005-06. It will enable improvements in quality and working conditions, and cover increases in the prices of services funded by District Health Boards or contracted to the Disability Support Directorate of the Ministry of Health.

Funding for home based care services provided to older New Zealanders rises by $12.4 million, while services for younger people with disabilities receive a $6.2 million increase.

"Growing numbers of New Zealanders are benefiting from home based care services. They allow people more choice around remaining in their communities," says Associate Minister of Health Pete Hodgson.

"It is important that our home based care providers receive decent pay, training and working conditions. As these aspects of the job are improved, so is the quality of the services provided to those that rely upon them. The money announced today should help make improvements across the board."

The $18.7 million is in addition to new funding announced for residential care services for older and for younger New Zealanders with disabilities (see separate statement).
