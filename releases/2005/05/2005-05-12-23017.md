Associate Education Minister David Benson-Pope today rejected allegations made against him in the House by two opposition members of Parliament.

Mr Benson-Pope denies the allegation that he ever assaulted a student.

He described the conduct of the two MPs, ACT's Rodney Hide and National's Judith Collins, in levelling these allegations, as disgraceful.

"Allegations they described under Parliamentary privilege were of such a serious nature I challenge them to take their allegations directly to the appropriate authorities.

"In my 24 year teaching career I am unaware of any complaint of this nature ever being made against me.

"This is two opposition MPs, acting in concert, in a scurrilous muckraking exercise," said Mr Benson-Pope.
