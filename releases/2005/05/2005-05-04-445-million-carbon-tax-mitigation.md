The government today announced the scale of the pilot grants, training and education package to help energy intensive small and medium size enterprises take up energy saving technologies to offset the impact of the carbon tax.

$4.45 million will be made available for the pilot programme over the next three years.

"The government realises that there are a number of energy intensive small and medium sized enterprises that might be adversely affected by the tax. While many larger companies are applying for Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements, the transaction costs involved for individual smaller companies might be prohibitive.

"That is why we are piloting a programme to help them overcome the barriers to adopting energy efficient technologies and practices," says Convenor, Ministerial Group on Climate Change, Pete Hodgson.

The package is being developed in partnership with representatives of energy intensive businesses. It will be rolled out from 01 July this year and closely monitored to ensure that it is developed in a way that meets the needs of business.
