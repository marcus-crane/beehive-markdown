Energy Minister Trevor Mallard today confirmed that the government expects Transpower, as a matter of prudence, to proceed with its planning process, including route selection and negotiations with landowners.

"Transpower’s interim decision, announced today, on the route for its proposed new transmission line between Otahuhu and Whakamaru is a necessary step in its planning process, but it does not preempt the decision that the Electricity Commission must make, in due course, on the proposed grid upgrade," Trevor Mallard said.

"The government expects the commission, when making its decision, to thoroughly assess Transpower's proposal in comparison with other alternatives that may meet our on-going requirement for security of electricity supply to Auckland," Trevor Mallard said.

Trevor Mallard wrote to the commission and to Transpower last month, confirming the government’s expectations about the commission’s decision-making process and timeframe. The commission is expected to make its decision by mid-2006, if not sooner.

Attached is the letter sent by Trevor Mallard to the Electricity Commission.
