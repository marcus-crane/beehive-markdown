ACT and National are misleading New Zealanders when they suggest that transport solutions are not being delivered in Auckland, says Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard.

Judith Tizard was responding to comments made on Morning Report today, by ACT leader Rodney Hide and National MP Wayne Mapp.

"To deal with a serious lack of past investment, this government is investing an additional $1.62 billion in Auckland’s transport infrastructure over the next ten years. Problems like traffic congestion can’t be solved in one go. We are working hard together towards solutions - and we can all see the results of that work at spaghetti junction," Judith Tizard said.

"The government has fostered close relationships with Auckland's diverse communities, and acknowledges the importance of partnerships, co-operation between local government and central government, funding levels and training.

"We have clearly articulated our vision for Auckland, something that National and ACT seem to be lacking beyond their concerns about tunnels, tolls and the Resource Management Act.

"We will continue to address roading projects and passenger transport. We will also continue to strengthen Auckland communities and work on housing, education, and health issues, as well as growth and economic development strategies.

"Progress in Auckland is taking place on every level. The Labour government is making a difference - for Auckland, and for New Zealand," Judith Tizard said.
