Prime Minister Helen Clark today attended the launch of the Electoral Enrolment Centre’s campaign to encourage people to enrol for this year’s general election.

Personalised Enrolment Update Packs are being processed by New Zealand Post and will be delivered by posties to 2.75 million people from tomorrow. (Monday 2 May)

“Every voter who is currently enrolled should check their mail over the next few days for their personal Enrolment Update Pack. Each pack contains information about how people can ensure that they are correctly enrolled to vote,” Helen Clark said.

“Those who do not get an Enrolment Update Pack in the mail by Wednesday are probably not enrolled. People do not get enrolled automatically at age 18, or when they become eligible as new New Zealanders. For new voters to be enrolled, an enrolment form must be completed,” Helen Clark said.

The Electoral Enrolment Centre is running the Enrolment Update campaign to maximise enrolment for this year’s general election.

Enrolment forms can be obtained either by calling 0800 ENROL NOW (0800 36 76 56), or by free texting your name and address to 3676, or by visiting any Post Shop, or by going online to [www.elections.org.nz](http//www.elections.org.nz). People can also check and update their enrolment details online at the website.
