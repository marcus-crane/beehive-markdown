The Associate Minister of Education David Benson-Pope today announced the appointment of Catherine Gibson as interim chair of the New Zealand Qualifications Authority for a three month period.

Mr Benson-Pope says it is important that the NZQA addresses the issues before it as quickly as possible. Ms Gibson is a current board member of NZQA, and has wide experience of senior public service management.

"There is major work underway to improve structures and processes around the New Zealand Scholarship and it is important that continuity is brought to this work.

"I am pleased that a person of Ms Gibson's calibre and experience has accepted this responsibility.

"Equally, as the State Services Commission is currently reviewing the roles of NZQA, the Tertiary Education Commission, and the Ministry of Education, it is appropriate that no decision is made that would anticipate the outcome of this review."
