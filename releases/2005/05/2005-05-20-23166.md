Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard has congratulated New Zealand musicians Scribe and Evermore, whose albums have gone platinum in Australia.

Scribe's debut album *The Crusader* hit platinum (70,000 albums sold) halfway through his Australian tour with P-Money, where they have been playing sold-out gigs in Adelaide, Sydney and Brisbane. Following the Australian tour, Scribe and P-Money will head to the UK for the release of the single 'Not Many'.

"*The Crusader* already has multi-platinum status in New Zealand and I am delighted that it is doing so well overseas. Scribe has established himself as one of New Zealand's most popular hip-hop artists - his music is exciting and relevant to many young New Zealanders," Judith Tizard said.

Evermore's debut album *Dreams* has also just hit platinum status in Australia. In March, the band took home the Supernova Breakthrough Act at the Australian MTV Awards. The band will tour Australia this year from 7 June - 24 July.

*Dreams* is currently sitting at number 32 in the Australian charts and *The Crusader* is sitting at number 25.

"Reaching platinum status in Australia is a fantastic achievement for Scribe and Evermore. It potentially means that 140,000 Australians could now have a new New Zealand album in their record collections," Judith Tizard said.

"[New Zealand Music Month](http://www.nzmusicmonth.co.nz) is an opportunity to celebrate our artists, our creativity and musical achievements. These platinum album successes are certainly cause for celebration and I warmly congratulate Scribe and Evermore on their remarkable achievements;" Judith Tizard said.
