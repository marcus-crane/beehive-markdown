The claim by Martin Taylor, CEO of Healthcare Providers that the budget doesn't provide guaranteed funding for rest homes is bizarre.

"Either Mr Taylor doesn't understand the budget or he is locked into a personal framework of claimancy, no matter the facts," says Associate Health Minister Pete Hodgson.

"The budget contains, GST included, more money than Mr Taylor's request for $50 million plus inflation. Indeed that part of the health budget was settled before Mr Taylor made his request public."

Note – This is the first budget to be expressed in GST exclusive terms.
