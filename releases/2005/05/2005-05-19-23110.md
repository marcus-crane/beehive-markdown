Associate Health Minister Pete Hodgson today announced an additional $59 million in 2005-06 for residential disability support services and the provision of assessments.

An additional $29.6 million will be added to baseline funding for disability support services to cover demographic and inflation related adjustments.

The remainder of the money will be allocated across three main areas:

- $14.4 million for Kimberley Centre residents
- $8.4 million for younger people needing residential disability care, and
- $6.6 million to improve Needs Assessment and Service Co-ordination (NASC).

"This is a comprehensive funding boost for disability support services. It will help bring stability to the sector and allow for investment in improving the quality and level of provision," Mr Hodgson said.
