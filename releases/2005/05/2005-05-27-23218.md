The United Nations urgently needs a new mechanism to assist countries emerging from violent conflict Foreign Minister Phil Goff told the United Nations Security Council today. Mr Goff addressed an open meeting of the Council chaired by Danish Foreign Minister Dr Per Stig Moller. Other speakers included World Bank President James Wolfensohn and UN Deputy Secretary-General Louise Frechette.

“At present over fifty percent of conflicts revert to violence with five years of peace agreements but the UN is ill equipped to provide the necessary assistance once the ‘peacekeeping phase’ is over,” Mr Goff said.

“I believe a Peacebuilding Commission, as proposed by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, would provide a much-needed forum to ensure that sustained support can be given to countries emerging from violent conflict.

“I told the Council that New Zealand’s experience in Solomon Islands, Timor Leste, Bougainville and Afghanistan has been that successful peacebuilding requires a sustained and multi-dimensional approach involving aid, security, support for civil society, justice and human rights.

“The Peacebuilding Commission proposal is designed to ensure that international assistance continues once peacekeepers leave. The international community needs to ensure that the difficult transition from peacekeeping to development is fully supported.

“Peacekeeping, peacebuilding and development should not be treated as separate activities. I argued strongly that UN members need to give the Peacebuilding Commission their full support.”
