The government today published a working party report on Health of Older People services and Disability Support Services, and the associated Cabinet paper.

The working party was formed following a meeting between Ministers and representatives of the New Zealand Nurses Organisation, the New Zealand Council of Christian Social Services and the Service and Food Workers Union on 30 November 2004.

The working party, and its report, provide advice to government on the provision of appropriate and cost effective care over the short term and on longer term sustainability issues.
