Last year the government banned the sale of unsafe rubber hot water bottles. This followed a number of incidents where hot water bottles perished or leaked, in some cases causing serious burns, Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard said today.

Now that winter’s approaching, new hot water bottles are being sold by retailers.

“Only rubber hot water bottles with the British Standard marking BS 1970:2001 can be sold legally by retailers,” Judith Tizard said.

“Consumers need to look for this marking on the rubber hot water bottles they are buying. The markings can usually be found on the neck of hot water bottles.”

If consumers find a rubber hot water bottle without the BS 1970:2001 marking, they should report this to the Commerce Commission by calling 0800 94 3600.

Judith Tizard emphasises that regardless of the standard, people needed to take care when filling and using hot water bottles.

"I want to remind people not to use boiling water when filling their hot water bottle, and to cover the bottle in some way, for example by wrapping it in a towel.”

Judith Tizard has one final reminder for consumers.

“I know that some consumers may be tempted to use wheat bags as an alternative to a hot water bottle for heating their beds. But they must not use a wheat bag as a bed-warmer. They are only meant to be used as a heat pack for direct application to the body.

“When using a wheat bag, always follow the manufacturer's instructions and never overheat them,” Judith Tizard said.

Follow these simple safety tips and have a safe and warm winter.
