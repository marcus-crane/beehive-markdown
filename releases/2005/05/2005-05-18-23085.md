Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that Solicitor-General Terence Arnold will refer the allegations made about Hon David Benson-Pope to the Commissioner of Police to determine whether a prosecution should be mounted.

Helen Clark said she had been advised by the Solicitor-General that this was the most appropriate action and she has accepted that advice.

The matter will be referred to the Commissioner of Police tomorrow.
