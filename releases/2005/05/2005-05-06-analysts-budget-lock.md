The lock-up will finish at 2:45pm however analysts will be permitted to leave at 2pm subject to complying with the embargo provisions below.

A rolling embargo applies to the content of the budget documents. Information within the budget documentation can be released once Dr Cullen has dealt with that area or issue in the Budget Speech. Areas not discussed in the Budget Speech, including the discussion at the press conference, are embargoed until the documents are tabled in the House by Dr Cullen at the conclusion of his speech and must not be communicated in any form, or acted on until that time.

Compliance with the embargo provisions is being monitored.

Any organisation found to wilfully break the embargo provisions may be refused permission to attend future lockups.
