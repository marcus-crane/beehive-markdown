Prime Minister Helen Clark today congratulated British Prime Minister Tony Blair and the British Labour Party on their historic third term election victory.

Helen Clark said that the re-election of Mr Blair’s government meant that it was business as usual in relations between New Zealand and Britain, with key players in the two governments knowing each other well.

“Britain is a very important partner for New Zealand in economic, cultural and historic terms. Many New Zealanders have close family ties with Britain, and most New Zealanders have some British ancestry.

“Both the British and New Zealand Labour governments have presided over strong economies, low unemployment and big investments in health, education, and families.

“Such results provide a powerful platform for re-election,” Helen Clark said.
