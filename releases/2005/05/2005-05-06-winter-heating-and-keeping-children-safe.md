It’s important that we all make sure we stay warm and safe when using heaters this winter, says Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard.

With the weather we’ve had lately you’d be forgiven for thinking that winter has arrived a month or two early. Judith Tizard is reminding consumers, parents and care-givers to be particularly vigilant with children around heaters.

"I urge people to stick to the 'meter-heater' rule and keep children at least one metre from open fires or heaters. People should also look at putting up safety guards around their heater if they have young children and watch children at all times when heaters are on.”

"Take extra safety precautions with young children. Don’t leave a child alone with a heater, even for a short time. Be careful they don’t ‘post’ paper, plastic toys, or other flammable materials into the heater, regardless of whether it is off or on. Don’t let small children touch the heater, sit too close to it, or play with its switches.

“Also, when choosing nightwear for children, consumers should look for the white ‘low fire danger’ label in the garment. But we must be mindful that all fabrics, however well designed, will eventually burn if they are exposed to flames or a direct heat source," Judith Tizard said.

Daywear worn over 'low fire danger' nightwear can also increase the fire danger substantially.

"While the government has Product Safety Standards in place to reduce fire hazards from children's nightwear, it cannot totally eliminate this risk. Low fire risk doesn't mean no fire risk,” Judith Tizard said.

**Tips for parents and caregivers**

Be vigilant with children around heaters:

- Stick to the 'meter-heater rule' that is keep children at least one metre from open fires or heaters
- Put up safety guards around the heater if you have young children
- Don't let children wear daywear over their 'low fire danger' nightwear - this can increase the fire danger substantially.
