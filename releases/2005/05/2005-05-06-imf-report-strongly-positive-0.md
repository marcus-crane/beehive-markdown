6 May 2005Media Statement  
IMF report strongly positive

Finance Minister Michael Cullen today welcomed the latest report on New Zealand by the International Monetary Fund saying it was strongly positive about the economy’s performance and about the government’s economic management.

“The IMF notes that growth in New Zealand over the last six years has averaged 4 per cent a year compared with an annual average across the OECD of 2.5 percent and that job creation has been exceptional, producing one of the lowest unemployment rates in the OECD.

“It states that this has flowed through to sizeable budget surpluses and to a significant reduction in government debt.

“But it endorses the government’s view that although New Zealand’s fiscal position is very strong, there are limits on the scope for a big spend-up and that the prudence and discipline the government has been exercising should be maintained.

“This is an important message for all political parties to remember as we head into this year’s election campaign,” Dr Cullen said.
