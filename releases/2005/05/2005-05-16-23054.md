Prime Minister Helen Clark said tonight that Hon David Benson-Pope has at his own request stood aside from his portfolios while an independent investigation is conducted into the credibility of the allegations against him.

Helen Clark said she would be seeking advice from Solicitor-General Terence Arnold on the form of the inquiry.

“Mr Benson-Pope strongly refutes the allegations which have been levelled at him but has asked to stand aside while they are independently investigated,” Helen Clark said.

Hon Trevor Mallard will be acting minister for those parts of the education portfolio for which Mr Benson-Pope has responsibility and Hon Pete Hodgson will be acting Minister of Fisheries.
