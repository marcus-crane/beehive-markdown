I am pleased that appropriate and quick action is being taken regarding the possible threat of foot and mouth disease on Waiheke Island, says Auckland Central MP Judith Tizard.

"We have to take this very seriously, even though we are reasonably confident it is a hoax. The implications for damage to our economy of a genuine scare would be catastrophic. I regard this as a bioterrorism threat, and very severe penalties are in place for such crimes. Every effort is being made to reassure our major trading partners that this is being taken seriously, but that it is most likely a hoax," Judith Tizard said.

"I am very impressed with the work that the Waiheke Community Board and the Auckland City Council have undertaken and am pleased that the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) are providing good information to all parties concerned.

"I thank Waiheke residents for supporting MAF and appreciate that they have particular concern for their natural environment and for New Zealand's economic wellbeing," Judith Tizard said.
