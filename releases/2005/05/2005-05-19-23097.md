The government will invest an additional $204 million in research, science and technology over the next four years, says Research, Science and Technology Minister Steve Maharey.

"A strong investment in science and innovation is vital to New Zealand's continued economic success. This year's budget recognises the importance of innovation, with investments of $71.9 million to increase the competitiveness of key industries, as well as $47.8 million for infrastructure and development programmes for researchers and scientists."

The increase brings the total public spending on research, science and technology (excluding capital expenditure) to just on $600 million for 2005-06, a boost of over 56 per cent since 1999.

"The investment is a strong step forward that recognises research, science and technology as the key drivers of innovation in New Zealand's economy, and an important contributor to the health and wellbeing of our nation."
