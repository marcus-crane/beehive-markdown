National's Transport Spokesman Maurice Williamson has spelt out in a press statement the completely loopy approach to financial management being adopted by the Party under Don Brash.

Maurice Williamson claims that stopping around $4 billion from going into the Crown Account will not affect spending from it on: "health, education and any other area you care to name" one bit.

"How on earth can that be true?" Asks Transport Minister Pete Hodgson. "How can you meet spending commitments for essential services when you stop putting the money in to pay for them?"

"Maurice Williamson has blown away the smoke from Don Brash's plan and revealed them for the con trick they really are."

"National's spending plans just don't add up and Maurice Williamson should be congratulated for writing a press statement that clearly exposes the gross incompetence of Brash as a financial manager."
