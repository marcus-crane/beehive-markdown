[New Zealand Music Month](http://www.nzmusicmonth.co.nz) was established in 2001, says Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Judith Tizard.

Initially, New Zealand Music Week was organised in 1997, by the Kiwi Music Action group, which was a collaboration between NZ on Air, Australasian Performing Right Association, the Radio Broadcasters Association and the Recording Industry Association. It ran for two years and focused exclusively on commercial radio but it did not have official support from television or retailers.

New Zealand Music Month was first established in 2001, by the New Zealand Music Commission (NZMIC). The government established the NZMIC in 2000 to foster New Zealand popular music composition, performance, recording and marketing, and promote New Zealand music both here and overseas.

NZ Music Month is a partnership between government and commercial organisations, with the NZMIC acting as the main 'hub'. The partners are:

- NZ Music Industry Commission
- Radio Broadcasters Association
- NZ On Air
- Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA)
- Recording Industry Association of NZ
- Independent Music NZ
- Music Managers Forum

"New Zealand Music Month is about all Kiwis celebrating our great home-grown music, through radio, television, media, live music, schools and record retailers.

"There is a diverse range of home-grown brilliance to be brought into the spotlight over this month, as evidenced by the number and variety of shows being performed this month," Judith Tizard said.
