Fisheries Minister David Benson-Pope today congratulated Gisborne fisheries officers for their second significant poaching bust within a week.

Mr Benson-Pope says last week Gisborne fisheries officers apprehended suspects with 280 undersized paua, the largest illegal paua haul ever found in the Gisborne area. Earlier this week two men were caught with 50 undersized rock lobster, including an egg-bearing female, also undersized.

"This is serious offending in anyone's book and I commend the diligence of Gisborne's fisheries officers," said Mr Benson-Pope. "I recently visited the East Coast region and I continue to be impressed by the commitment and professionalism shown by our fisheries officers."

Mr Benson-Pope says the Ministry of Fisheries has confirmed that it will be seeking maximum penalties in cases like these.

"The Ministry of Fisheries rate of successful prosecutions for paua criminals is running in excess of 95 percent in 2005," said Mr Benson-Pope. "I am pleased that the crackdown on paua criminals is having success.

"I am also encouraged that the courts are hitting criminals where it hurts by also confiscating boats, vehicles and dive equipment used in the commission of poaching offences.

"I would remind the public that fisheries officers are out there helping protect a resource that belongs to all New Zealanders.

"We have fisheries regulations that set, for example, the number and size of paua or rock lobster that can be taken, so that our children, and their children will also be able to enjoy this resource.

"Fisheries officers, like those in Gisborne, are doing important work. I am sure the overwhelming majority of the public support the efforts fisheries officers take protecting our coastline from criminals. The public can also help by reporting suspicious activity."
