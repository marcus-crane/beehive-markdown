The government announced today that it has reached agreement on the framework for a Negotiated Greenhouse Agreement (NGA) with New Zealand Aluminium Smelters (NZAS).

Firms that obtain a NGA receive exemptions to the carbon tax in return for moving to world's best practice in emissions management. Firms of any size whose international competitiveness might otherwise be at risk from the carbon tax can apply.

“I'm pleased that industry and the government are continuing to make progress on tackling climate change at the same time as maintaining the competitiveness of New Zealand business," said Convenor of the Ministerial Group on Climate Change Pete Hodgson.

“The conclusion of the framework for agreement has been an excellent example of cooperation between NZAS and the government to achieve environmental outcomes and protect the competitiveness of New Zealand industry. We look forward to working further with the Government on this important issue,” said NZAS Chairman Tom Campbell.
