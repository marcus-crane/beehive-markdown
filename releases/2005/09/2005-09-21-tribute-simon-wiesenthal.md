Foreign Minister Phil Goff paid tribute today to Simon Wiesenthal, who died in Vienna on Tuesday, aged 96.

"Simon Wiesenthal was an extraordinary man. A survivor of the Holocaust, which claimed the lives of most of his family, he never rested in his determination to see justice done.

"As a result of his efforts, more than 1000 Nazi war criminals were prosecuted for the crimes that they had committed.

"Simon Wiesenthal campaigned tirelessly against racism and to ensure that the world should not forget the lessons for humanity that the Holocaust represented.

"His efforts should inspire the world to continue in its determination, through instruments such as the International Criminal Court, to prevent genocide and crimes against humanity," Mr Goff said.
