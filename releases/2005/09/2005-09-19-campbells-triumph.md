Prime Minister Helen Clark today congratulated Michael Campbell on his win in the World Matchplay Championship.

“Once again, Michael has taken on some of the best players in the world and triumphed.

“Just as he became the second New Zealander after Sir Bob Charles to win a major golf title, so he has become just the second New Zealander to win the World Matchplay, following on from Sir Bob Charles’ 1969 win.

“The World Matchplay title is, outside the four majors, one of golf’s most prestigious titles. The list of past winners – which includes Ernie Els, Vijay Singh, Nick Faldo, Seve Ballesteros, Greg Norman, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, and Arnold Palmer – tells us just how significant a tournament it is.

“Since winning the US Open in June, Michael has impressed the world with his modesty and humility, while continuing his superb run of form. This win cements his place as one of the top players in the world today.

“Once again, Michael Campbell has done his family, his community in Titahi Bay, Wellington, and New Zealand proud,” Helen Clark said.
