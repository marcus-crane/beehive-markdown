The latest report on road policing is further proof that our highways are getting safer, Police Minister George Hawkins said today.

The Road Policing Quarterly Report, collated by NZ Police, indicates a stabilisation in the number of road deaths, a decrease in the number of fatal crashes and a marked fall in the number of traffic tickets issued over the fiscal year.

"The road toll for the year to June was the fourth lowest for this period in the last 40 years, and – at 11 road deaths per 100,000 population - represents the third lowest rate since records began," said Mr Hawkins.

"There's cause for optimism that the road safety message is finally getting through, with a dramatic fall in the number of tickets issued over the past year," said Mr Hawkins.

The number of tickets for speeding fell by 10.4 per cent in the April-June quarter and is down 6.9 per cent for the year to June. Speed camera tickets fell by 15.3 per cent over the 12-month period.

"I couldn't be more delighted that this so-called revenue stream is drying up," said Mr Hawkins. "Fewer tickets mean more people driving safely. And that means fewer tragedies on our highways.

"Policing our roads costs twice what's gathered in revenue but that's money well spent, if we can continue to save lives.

"It's also worth noting that the Highway Patrol actually spent more than 10 per cent of its allocated hours on non-traffic duties, which proves that our traffic police are not 'just' there to target motorists, but are a vital and active component of overall Police resources."
