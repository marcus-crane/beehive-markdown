A national evaluation of primary and intermediate school children shows that our students have progressed in reading, speaking, music and technology, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

The Education Minister released the four-yearly National Education Monitoring Project (NEMP) evaluation of eight and nine-year-olds, and twelve and thirteen-year-olds at Naenae Primary School today.

The latest NEMP reports surveyed nearly 2,800 children from around the country examining reading, speaking, technology and music at year 4 and year 8 levels and compared the results to those identified in 2000.

“This latest investigation has found that overall, primary school children’s skills in reading, speaking and technology have improved since 2000,” the Minister said. “That’s very pleasing. The study also found that these students generally had very positive attitudes to the four subjects assessed and I‘m delighted about that too – kids are enjoying these subjects at school.

"New Zealand has a world-class education system. Our children are among the top in the world in reading and maths, and we are committed to making our education system even stronger."

The latest NEMP reports also reveal the first achievement results in music since the new arts curriculum was introduced and show students’ achievement in music has been maintained.

In comparing the latest NEMP 2004 results to the NEMP 2000 results the latest 2004 investigation found:

- Overall, progress has been made between year 4 and year 8 students in reading and speaking, music, and technology.
- Both Year 4 and Year 8 students had very positive attitudes towards the subjects in which they were assessed and liked doing each subject at school.
- Disparities have reduced noticeably between year 4 Pakeha and Mâori students and Pakeha and Pasifika students, in reading, speaking and technology.
- There were only small differences in achievement between girls and boys at both levels for music and technology.
- Girls are slightly better at reading and speaking than boys. There were almost no difference in music achievement between students of different ethnicities, and between students who mainly speak English at home and students who do not.

**Background:**

The NEMP reports are commissioned or undertaken by the Ministry of Education to inform development of the Ministry’s strategy that will raise educational standards in this country.

The NEMP reports provide the Ministry of Education and schools with system-wide information on student achievement across all areas of primary education on a regular cycle. They are part of a range of education assessment studies that monitor and evaluate educational progress.

The NEMP reports focus on assessing and reporting the achievement and attitude of Year 4 and Year 8 New Zealand children in all areas of the curriculum, including some subjects that span several curriculum areas.

Information collected gives a ‘raw’ image of what our children know and can do. Reports are published annually on the NEMP assessment from the previous year.

Each year about 3,000 students in 260 schools are randomly selected to take part in the national monitoring project. The focus is on growth in educational achievement across time at a national level.

The annual national educational achievement assessments cover a broad range of content included in the New Zealand school curriculum on four yearly cycles of learning areas and skills. The assessments focus on students at two levels, four years apart: year 4 (age 8-9) and year 8 (age 12-13).
