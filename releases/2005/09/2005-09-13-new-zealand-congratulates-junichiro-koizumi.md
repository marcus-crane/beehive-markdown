Prime Minister Helen Clark today congratulated the Prime Minister of Japan, Junichiro Koizumi, on his victory in Sunday's national elections.

Helen Clark said it was a clear-cut result, with Prime Minister Koizumi's Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner, New Komeito, likely to have a two-thirds majority in the new Parliament.

“I congratulate Mr Koizumi on winning another term. The New Zealand Government will continue its good relationship with the Japanese Prime Minister and his administration,” Helen Clark said.

“When I met with Prime Minister Koizumi in Japan in June this year we agreed to take a fresh look at the New Zealand-Japan economic relationship, and to strengthen high-level exchanges.

“I am sure that these initiatives will bear fruit over the next few years, and I look forward to New Zealand and Japan developing a stronger and closer economic and political relationship."

Helen Clark said she would be sending a letter of congratulations to Prime Minister Koizumi.
