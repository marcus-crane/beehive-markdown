According to a draft government paper released today at least five new radio stations could be broadcasting in most areas of New Zealand in 2006.

"This has great potential to benefit community radio stations who are struggling to find available spectrum," said Communications Minister David Cunliffe.

"We are aware of a diverse range of groups with needs for spectrum. These groups include ethnic communities, 'common interest' groups and those in rural areas trying to reach their local communities." said David Cunliffe.

The Ministry of Economic Development discussion paper includes several proposals that could mean more radio licences in most areas throughout New Zealand.

The Ministers of Communications welcomes the opportunity to discuss options that would encourage wider diversity in both content and ownership within the broadcasting industry.

"The idea of limiting some of the additional licences to local area broadcasting by new entrants could strengthen regional and community broadcasting," said David Cunliffe.

Other proposals to open up access to broadcasting include revising technical standards and lifting the ban on licences in the band above 100 MHz.

"A proposal to lower the frequency band limit from 88 MHz to 87.5 MHz may also assist in providing more licences and open up significant options," said David Cunliffe.

The discussion document explores opportunities of licences for local area use, full commercial broadcasting and a reservation for a future "not for profit" network.

The present ban on licences in the band above 100 MHz was established for three years in May 2003 when the reservation of frequencies for the government's four priority programmes (National FM, National Pacific Radio, National Maori Radio and Youth radio) was also established.

The document is available from the Ministry web site www.med.govt.nz/rsm and submissions close at the end of November 2005. Analysis and decisions are expected by the first quarter of 2006.

QWhy is the discussion paper necessary?

AThe Government decided in May 2003 to place a three-year prohibition on general use of the FM band above 100 MHz. A review process is necessary if further licensing in this spectrum is to occur from 2006.

QHow many licences are possible in the remaining spectrum?

AThe number of licences is determined by the technical planning standards used. If new standards are adopted as outlined in the discussion paper, five licences are practical in most areas. Additional licences would be possible in some areas. However if present standards were maintained only one licence would be possible in Auckland, none in Wellington, and between two and four in other areas.

QWhat are the new standards and have they been tested?

APresent standards use a frequency separation of 0.8 MHz between stations, but a trial using a 0.4 MHz separation has operated from Skytower, Auckland, since 2003. A separate trial is also operating in Wellington. Neither trial has showed any significant adverse outcomes to date. If these trials are to be made permanent it makes sense to consider use of the standards in the overall band.

QAre there any other implications of the new planning standards?

ABecause the stations would be packed in closer on the dial, the signals on adjacent frequencies need to be kept at about the same level. This dictates using a common transmitter site, which may limit flexibility. Coverage would be slightly less then existing high power stations as the frequency would be used again in adjacent areas. Some receivers may experience difficulty in reception, but trials to date have not highlighted any concerns in this area.

QWhy is a change to the present 88 MHz frequency limit proposed?

ABroadcast receivers generally operate on frequencies down to 87.5 MHz, and the present use of the 87.5 to 88 MHz segment for land mobile 2 way radio has decreased over recent years. Use of this segment for broadcasting seems appropriate in the future.

QWhat is proposed for “low power” broadcasting?

AIf the new frequency limit were adopted, the frequency specified in the General Licence for low power use would need to change. An increase in power from 0.5 watts to 5 watts is also proposed in a segment of the “low power” frequencies.

QHow are the proposed new licences throughout New Zealand to be used and allocated?

AA mix of uses comprising a licence for a non-commercial network, two licences for local area broadcasting and two licences for full commercial broadcasting are proposed. The non-commercial network licences would be reserved for a future allocation process, with the local area and commercial licences being auctioned with appropriate conditions to achieve the outcomes sought.

QDo existing frequencies need to change to fit in the new stations?

ANo. The new licences are expected to be largely in the unused spectrum above 100 MHz.

QWhat are the next steps?

Submissions on the paper - see www.med.govt.nz/rsm are being sought and close at the end of November. Analysis and decisions by government will follow in 2006. The ideas in the document are for discussion and are not government policy. Government policy will be decided following consideration of the submissions received.
