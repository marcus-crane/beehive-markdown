Funding secured by the Progressive Party for alcohol and other drug treatment in the Coalition Government’s budget process has been allocated to the Salvation Army organisation in Whangarei, Associate Health Minister Jim Anderton said today.

"$85,000 has been provided specifically for a two-year pilot youth alcohol and drug treatment programme," the Progressive leader said

"The reason this funding has been allocated is because it was drawn to my attention at a public forum in Whangarei that I was chairing that Northland lacked youth alcohol and drug treatment facilities," Jim Anderton said.

"The feeling at the forum was that the region needed a residential facility for youth, so I asked Ministry of Health officials to investigate the situation, which they did. However, officials advised that the gap in Northland youth alcohol and drug treatment was not at the residential treatment end, but at the community service end," Jim Anderton said.

"The Salvation Army is well known for its expertise in running successful adult alcohol and drug treatment programmes and this expansion to meet the need for youth treatment in Whangarei is a welcome and very valuable addition.
