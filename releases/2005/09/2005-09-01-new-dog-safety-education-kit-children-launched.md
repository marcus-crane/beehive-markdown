Local Government Minister Chris Carter today launched a new animated video for children, part of a comprehensive new education kit designed to promote dog safety.

The video features children in a variety of common situations with dogs in which some understanding of dog behaviour and a bit of knowledge of what to do and what not to do can help minimise risk of harm.

“Dogs are wonderful companions but they have likes and dislikes, and respond in particular ways to things children might do. This video is part of a comprehensive education kit designed to make kids more aware of how to enjoy dogs safely," Mr Carter said.

“The government has done a lot to make our streets, playgrounds, parks and housing areas safer from dogs. We have passed new laws which respect the rights of responsible dog owners, but which empower local authorities to take the action needed to help keep our communities as safe as possible.

“But laws and regulation only go so far. Teachers have asked for classroom resources that will help younger children stay safe around dogs, and the government has agreed to fund those resources," Mr Carter said.

"Our new dog video “Stay Dog Safe” is backed up with games, take home material and teachers’ notes, making it easy for busy schools to integrate into their curriculum. It is a sensible initiative and one that I hope dog owners and parents everywhere will support."
