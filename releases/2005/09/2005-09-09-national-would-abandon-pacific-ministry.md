National would dump the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs if elected to government, Mangere MP Taito Phillip Field warned Pacific communities today.

“The National party is hoping that no one noticed their proposal to do away with the Ministry of Maori Affairs or to have the Ministry swallowed up by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT).

“That idea shows exactly the low regard Don Brash and the National party has for Pacific communities,” Taito Field said.

“National’s suggestion that Foreign Affairs could take over the Pacific Ministry’s work demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of Pasifika communities in New Zealand.

“MFAT looks after New Zealand’s interests and relationships overseas; the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs promotes the development of Pacific people here in New Zealand!

“This is outrageous when you consider that one in 16 New Zealanders identify with a Pacific heritage. Labour has a proven commitment to Pacific communities with policies that have encouraged more Pacific people into work, higher education and into business. In June 1999 the average unemployment rate for Pacific people was 14 per cent. In June this year, that average dropped to 6.7 per cent. In business, more than 1000 Pacific people took up specialist business advice and support last year.

“Many Pacific families benefit from Labour’s Working for Families tax relief package, and from the primary health care subsidies.

“Labour also celebrates and supports the immense Pacific talent New Zealand in music, arts and performing arts.

“Don’t let National destroy the great work done to support and develop Pacific communities in New Zealand. It’s important that our Pasifika people get out and vote two ticks for Labour next Saturday,” Taito Field said.
