Prime Minister Helen Clark today set out a [timetable](http://www.elections.org.nz/elections/timeline_05.html) of events for the transition period following [Saturday’s general election](http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/).

All [special votes](http://www.elections.org.nz/voting/special_declaration_vote.html) must be received by returning officers in electorates by 7 pm on Tuesday 27 September.

Returning officers then complete the official count of votes. The final result must be declared no later than Saturday 1 October.

The writ – the command to each returning officer to proceed with arrangements for the holding of an election – must be returned by 6 October, unless any recounts have been ordered.

Helen Clark said that [while consultations took place about the shape of the government, the current government continues in caretaker mode](http://www.elections.org.nz/democracy/new-parlt-_-govt-formation.html).

The key principles of the caretaker convention are that:

- The normal business of government and the day-to-day administration of departments and government agencies continues as usual
- Decisions which were taken before the election continue to be implemented
- The caretaker government does not take significant or new policy decisions, or decisions with long-term implications, unless they cannot be deferred
- If neither deferral nor temporary arrangements are possible, the government would consult to see whether a proposed course of action has the support of a majority of the House.

Helen Clark said that the appointment of a government takes place after the Governor-General is satisfied that a group of parties can command the confidence of the House. By law, Parliament is required to resume no later than Friday 18 November.

“The task now is for arrangements to be made which will ensure stable government in New Zealand for the next three years,” Helen Clark said.
