Following a survey of the Invercargill Catholic community, there will be a change of structure to Years 7 and 8 at Catholic schools in Invercargill, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

The survey showed that a clear majority of the adult Catholic community were in favour of the proposal to change the class of Verdon College to cater for Year 7-13 students, and for Sacred Heart, St Patrick’s (Invercargill) and St Theresa’s to become Year 1-6 contributing primary schools.

“I applaud the Catholic community for initiating this proposal to consolidate Catholic education in Invercargill. This is an exciting opportunity to align the structure of Catholic education with state schools in the Invercargill area,” said Trevor Mallard.

Implementation of these changes will be from Term One 2006. The Ministry of Education will continue to support these schools and Catholic Education as they move through implementing these changes.
