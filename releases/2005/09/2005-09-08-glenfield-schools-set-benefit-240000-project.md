Eight Glenfield primary, intermediate and secondary schools will benefit from a $240,000 teacher professional development project, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today with Northcote MP Ann Hartley.

The schools, known as the Glenfield cluster, are Bayview School, Glenfield School, Manuka Primary School, Windy Ridge School, Greenhithe School, Marlborough School, Glenfield Intermediate School, and Glenfield College.

“The project will boost collaboration among the eight Glenfield schools as staff work together on professional development activities,” Trevor Mallard said. "The government is committed to adequately resourcing schools so that they can deliver a high quality education to all New Zealand children.

"In the 2005/06 financial year we will invest $93 million on centrally-funded professional development. This compares with $65 million in 1999, and is an increase of 42 per cent. We are committed to continually raising the quality of teaching in classrooms.

“The Glenfield project will focus on improving teaching practices, and developing curriculum and content which reflects the local school communities and individual needs of students, especially those at risk.

“It will assist developing an effective and manageable assessment systems tracking individual student achievement through Years 1 to 10."

The project will have $240,000 available over its three-year life and will be the main professional development initiative of the eight schools. This funding is part of the Ministry of Education’s Collaborative Innovations Fund, which provides $1 million each year to encourage collaborative projects that enhance student learning among schools.

“With the support of the Collaborative Innovations Fund towards projects such as this, we are developing an education system that meets the needs of a diverse range of students and focuses on raising achievement for all,” Trevor Mallard said.

“This will include working with students to make sure they have access to the appropriate educational experiences.”
