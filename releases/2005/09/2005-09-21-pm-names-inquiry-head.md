Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that Noel Ingram QC will investigate a number of allegations made in respect of Hon Taito Phillip Field.

The allegations concern the circumstances surrounding Mr Field’s involvement in applications for work permits in New Zealand for Thai citizen Sunan Siriwan and his wife, and other matters raised in the news media.

“Ministers are required to ensure that no conflict exists or appears to exist between their private interests and the use of their influence as ministers,” Helen Clark said.

“In the light of that requirement I have decided that an inquiry should be held to investigate these allegations.”

Helen Clark said the inquiry will:

- Investigate and determine the nature of Mr Field’s relationship with Sunan Siriwan and his wife, and the extent of any involvement he may have had in applications for work permits for them
- Identify whether any conflict of interest existed concerning Mr Field’s involvement in this matter
- Identify any other matters arising from or during the inquiry, as are necessary to provide a complete report

Mr Ingram will report the findings of the inquiry to the Prime Minister by 4 October.
