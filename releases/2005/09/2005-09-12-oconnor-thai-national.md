Associate Immigration Minister Damien O’Connor tonight commented on the case of Thai National Sunan Siriwan.

“My intervention was to allow Mr Siriwan to reapply for a work visa, which has not yet been issued and the issuing of which is subject to all standard criteria.

“Members of Parliament from all parties, and on a very regular basis, request my intervention on behalf of individuals. I consider each case on its merits - as I did in this instance - and intervene where justified and when in the best interests of New Zealand.”

Mr O’Connor said he was unaware of Mr Siriwan’s employment or activity in Samoa at the time of his decision.

“I will be reviewing the application in the next couple of days, given the new information that has come before me.”
