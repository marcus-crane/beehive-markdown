Tourism Minister Mark Burton has congratulated Kea Campers for winning tourism's top award for the second year in a row.

The company also won the major category award for Tourism and Transportation services and the major category award for Innovation in the Tourism Industry Awards.

Mark Burton presented the award in Auckland tonight.

"I am very proud to be here to present this Supreme Award for New Zealand tourism. These awards recognise the importance of quality in the New Zealand tourism industry, something that I have been committed to promoting during my six years as Minister of Tourism.

"The New Zealand tourism industry has grown enormously over recent years and Kea's growth tracks that pattern.

"Founded only 10 years ago, Kea has quickly become a major player in the campervan and motor home industry, but you haven't compromised quality during your rapid growth. Indeed, I note that your mission has been to provide the best vehicles and services in the leisure vehicle industry.

"Your business is a great fit for New Zealand's ideal visitor, the "Interactive Traveller", someone who demands quality and who comes to New Zealand for authentic experiences with our natural, social and cultural environment," Mark Burton said.
