Land has been purchased for a new primary school and early childhood education centre in Halswell, Christchurch, Education Minister Trevor Mallard confirmed today.

Trevor Mallard and Banks Peninsula MP Ruth Dyson today visited the three-hectare site in Milns Road, Halswell, selected as the new site for the school and early childhood centre.

The government has bought the land for $3.6 million as the first step in building the new educational facilities in the high growth area.

Demographic analysis and Christchurch City Council plans for expansion in the area were factors in the decision to build the new facilities, Trevor Mallard said.

"Labour is committed to providing strong public services such as schools that are modern, up-to-date, enjoyable learning environments,” Trevor Mallard said. "Existing schools in the area will not be able to cope with the projected numbers of school-aged children in the Halswell and Aidenfield areas.

“Demographics show that there could potentially be up to 1500 five-to-twelve year olds in the area by 2011,” he said. "The government is committed to creating sufficient capacity to support roll growth as well as improving the existing school environments. Since 1999, the government has invested over $220 million building new schools in areas of high population growth. Some 29 new schools have opened since Labour became government."

The site currently has an organic walnut orchard with a residential home on it.

Trevor Mallard said Ministry of Education-led consultation with the local community on how schooling will be delivered in their area was set to start in September. The outcomes of the consultation period would be reported back to the Minister.
