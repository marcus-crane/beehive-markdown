Three Auckland projects aimed at supporting gifted and talented learners in our city will gain up to $483,000 in new government funding.

The Kelston Intervention Team will receive up to $226,000* to help staff at 17 cluster schools to be involved in professional development and a mentoring programme designed to address the needs of gifted students with behavioural difficulties. The schools range from decile 3 to decile 10, with students from over 50 different cultural communities.

New Lynn School and Glen Eden Primary will receive up to $205,400* between them to allow a Talented and Gifted Coordinator to oversee the professional development of teachers and a programme for students teaching thinking skills in the regular classroom programme.

Ponsonby Primary School will receive up to $51,600* to build the capacity of schools to provide for gifted and talented children. The programme will combine ‘pullout’ sessions, teacher professional development, the development of in-class programmes, and encouraging gifted and talented children to construct communities and networks within the inner city school cluster.

They are three of 21 innovative programmes nationwide that will share from the government’s funding pool of nearly $4.2 million for initiatives in gifted education.

Judith Tizard, Minister for Auckland Issues, welcomed the funding announcement saying it reflected the quality and innovation of programmes being developed for gifted learners in our region.

"New Zealand’s gifted education policy is an example of community developed and community driven policy," said Judith Tizard. "Successes include the growing size and knowledge base of the national gifted education community. The community continues to work together to constructively address the issues in gifted education.

"As a result, a distinctly New Zealand approach to gifted education is developing. This includes a commitment to meeting the needs of gifted and talented learners in the regular classroom as well as through separate provision, a broad definition of giftedness and talent and the corresponding promotion of a wide range of appropriate identification procedures.

"Gifted learners may be found in every classroom and school in New Zealand, and therefore the regular classroom is the first place where the learning needs of gifted and talented students are to be met.

"However, in recognition of the diversity of gifted students’ needs and the need for a range of provision, special programmes like these ones receive financial support," Judith Tizard said.
