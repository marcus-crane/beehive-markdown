Public consultation will begin this month on seven new schools for the Flat Bush area of Manukau City, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

Trevor Mallard says the population of Flat Bush is expected to grow to 40,000 over the next 15 years so that by 2021 around 8,500 school-age children will live in the area. He confirmed a proposal that includes four new primary schools, two junior high schools and one senior high school, will go to the public for consultation this month. A new school in Flat Bush – Baverstock Oaks Primary School – was opened earlier this year.

"This is a long term plan to meet the needs of this area for the next two decades," said Trevor Mallard. "We are committed to providing strong public services such as schools that are modern, up-to-date, enjoyable learning environments."

Under the proposed strategy Flat Bush will have two education campuses – one in Jeffs Road and the other in Ormiston Road near the future town centre. The Jeffs Road campus would be developed by 2010 and include a junior high school (years 7-10) and a primary school (years 1-6). A senior high school (years 11-13) would be opened on the Ormiston Road campus, followed by a junior high school and a primary school.

Primary schools are also proposed for the south-west and south-east areas of the new town. All school sites would be developed to accommodate early childhood education facilities.

Trevor Mallard is encouraging parents already living in the Flat Bush area or thinking of moving there to take part in public consultation sessions run by the Ministry of Education.

There will be two information sessions for local residents and people thinking of moving to Flat Bush. The first information session will be held at 3.45pm-6pm on Monday 19 September at Sancta Maria College. The second will be at Baverstock Oaks Primary School 3pm-6pm on Tuesday, 20 September.

Additionally, a presentation of the schooling strategy and question and answer session will be held at Baverstock Oaks School at 7pm on Tuesday 20 September.

“The consultation is an opportunity for people tell us how they think the education needs of their children can be best met,” Trevor Mallard said.
