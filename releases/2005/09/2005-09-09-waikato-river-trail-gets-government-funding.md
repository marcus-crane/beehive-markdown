Minister of Tourism and Local MP Mark Burton presented a $14,330 Tourism Facilities Grant towards track signage for stage one of the Waikato River Trail, in Tokoroa today.

The Waikato River trail, which is currently being developed, will cover a distance of approximately 100 kilometres, almost a quarter of the length of the Waikato River.

"This is great news for Tokoroa. We live in one of the most beautiful areas of the country and we have a lot to share with international and domestic visitors alike.

"It's great that people can get off the beaten track and explore less well-known areas. The trail is situated between Waitomo, Rotorua and Taupo, which all record high visitor numbers – it has the ability to attract a number of these visitors to the local area, " Mark Burton said.

"The trail passes along the mid-Waikato river from Karapiro to Atiamuri and links six lakes in the area. It will be used by both trampers and mountain bikers and will include at least one section suitable for disabled users with adequate access, and start and finish sites."

The trail will reflect the heritage and natural features of the area, including the “sticks” (buried forest in the water), waterfalls, indigenous forests and hydro schemes.

The Tourism Facilities Grants Programme, administered by the Ministry of Tourism, aims to enhance overseas visitors' understanding and enjoyment of New Zealand through increasing the quality and number of nationally significant tourism facilities.
