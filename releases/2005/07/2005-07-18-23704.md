Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard travels to Brisbane today for the 2005 Australian International Music Market.

The Music Market, which is part of the Queensland Music Festival, will feature the musical genres of world, classical new work, jazz, fusion and popular music. The event attracts delegates from throughout Australia and the world and runs from 18 - 22 July 2005.

New Zealand has been formally invited to attend as a guest country, along with Canada and Mexico. Creative New Zealand is supporting the New Zealand showcase artists, which include Nesian Mystik, Tha Feelstyle, James Webster, and Hinewehi Mohi and Oceania.

While in Brisbane, Judith Tizard will meet with State Government representatives and strengthen links with the Queensland Museum and Art Gallery, as well as talk to representatives from the theatre, music and film industries.

“The Australian International Music Market presents an exciting opportunity to make and strengthen key contacts and put New Zealand music into an international context," said Judith Tizard.

"This government places enormous importance on the role of creative industries, particularly music, in our economic growth and on the importance of arts and culture for our social and cultural wellbeing.

"Australia is an important export market for Kiwi artists and musicians and the Music Market attracts musicians, presenters, promoters, festival directors, venue managers and record companies from all around the world," Judith Tizard said.
