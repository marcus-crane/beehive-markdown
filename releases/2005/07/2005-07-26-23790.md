National candidates Chris Finlayson and Mark Blumsky must learn that a dollar can only be spent once says Transport Minister Pete Hodgson.

The pair's claim that National will shift all petrol tax money into land transport overlooks the fact that Michael Cullen has already done so.

An example of this is the $885 million of extra money going into Wellington that has already been announced.

That's already more than the amount of petrol tax paid in the region that goes into the Crown Account.

"Under National's plan, the region would get just $482 million, so Finlayson and Blumsky have just committed Wellington to a $403 million transport funding cut under a National government," said Pete Hodgson.
