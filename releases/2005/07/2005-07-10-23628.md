Prime Minister Helen Clark today condemned the attacks on mosques in Auckland.

Helen Clark says she is saddened by the attacks.

"New Zealanders across all communities are horrified by the terrorist attacks in London which are the work of evil people.

"But it is wrong to target the Muslim community here in retaliation. New Zealand's Muslim community like all New Zealand's communities is overwhelmingly a law abiding and peaceful community.

"Times like these call for cool heads and for tolerance. The evil acts of some should not lead to scapegoating of minorities in our communities," Helen Clark said.
