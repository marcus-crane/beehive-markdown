Education Minister Trevor Mallard today announced a series of changes to Adult and Community Education (ACE) and the way Short Awards – qualifications of fewer than 40 credits – are funded.

"With the changes to ACE, the government wants to make sure that the amount of money ACE providers receive in the future depends on how well their activities and programmes line up with national and regional priorities. These priorities include meeting community's needs, and helping people with foundation education," Trevor Mallard said.

"I want to see a high level of regional involvement in funding decisions through local ACE networks, including the development of local advisory committees that will be involved in funding decisions. Providers will do a self-assessment of their own provision, get a picture of their community's needs and the fit with national ACE priorities which will flow into final funding decisions. Exact details will be the subject of Cabinet decisions later this year.

"The changes to the funding of ACE and Short Awards will also help ensure that the government gets better value for its investment while at the same time bringing greater certainty to those parts of the tertiary sector offering these types of education."

Single ACE funding pool and funding framework announced  
All government funding for ACE will come from a single pool from 2006.  
At the moment, the ACE that Tertiary Education Institutions (TEIs) have been providing has been funded separately (via course category 5.1), which has led to irresponsible spending by some institutions.  
"The government is committed to a smooth transition. As a result, changes to the way ACE is funded will not be made overnight," said Trevor Mallard.  
The changes are summarised as below:

- Course category 5.1 for ACE provision by TEIs will be abolished as of 1 January 2006. From then, funding for TEI-based provision will be transferred into the single ACE pool and ring-fenced at $35.6 million for 2006 only.
- In 2006, the total ACE funding pool will be $57.8 million.  
  From 2007, the total funding pool will be reduced by $17.8 million to $40 million.
- No ACE providers, other than TEIs, funded in 2005 through the current ACE funding pool will have to undergo more than a 10 percent reduction in overall funding for their ACE activities in 2007 and 2008.
- The total paid to secondary schools for ACE over 2007 and 2008 will not reduce.
- A mix of activities will remain funded, including those that cater for hobbies and personal interest, although the sector will be expected to demonstrate learning outcomes that better align with the ACE priorities.
- A new funding framework will be implemented along with the pool to ensure that funding is directed towards ACE providers that are delivering in line with the national ACE priorities.

Trevor Mallard said the new framework was widely consulted on with learners and other stakeholders.  
"It reflects the need to ensure all money invested in adult education is spent wisely, and delivers for a diverse range of people."  
The national priorities for Adult and Community Education are

- targeting learners whose initial learning was unsuccessful;
- raising foundation skills;
- encouraging life-long learning;
- strengthening communities by meeting identified community needs; and
- strengthening social cohesion.

Announcement on review of Short Awards (qualifications of fewer than 40 credits, often only involving a few hours of education)  
"In making changes to government funding of Short Awards, we are seeking to ensure that the government only funds shorts awards that would not otherwise be funded privately or by employers," said Trevor Mallard.  
"While we carry out more analysis and consultation on which Short Awards the government should be funding, we are going to limit the overall funding available for Short Awards to $22.8 million in 2006," said Trevor Mallard.  
"We recognise that some Short Awards that meet community and individual needs should be supported by the government. However more work is needed to consider what the balance of funding for Short Awards should be between the different stakeholders.  
"Funding for short awards has grown from $5 million to $30 million between 2000 and last year. This is a huge rate of growth, given that many of these courses provide just a few hours of education.  
"Prior to 2000, many Short Awards were supported by employers or delivered by the voluntary sector – not the government. For example, public policy and workplace safety courses were predominantly employer-funded and are now sub-contracted.  
"Government funding is also being used for Short Awards in areas such as first aid that were previously delivered by volunteer organisations.  
"To ensure that the available funding is directed to areas offering greatest value for money, short awards in public policy and administration, along with first aid, will no longer be funded.  
"Officials will work closely with St Johns, Red Cross and SeniorNet to ensure that the important work they do is not undermined by this decision."
