The past two weeks have been monumental for Auckland transport and demonstrate the real progress being made under a Labour-led government, says MP for Auckland Central Judith Tizard.

"We want solutions that make Auckland a better place to live and are working hard to achieve this goal. The Fanshawe Street bus lane extension, which opened this week, will save significant commuter time. This is significant for public transport and roading in Auckland, with a 40 per cent increase in peak services subsidised by the Auckland Regional Transport Authority (ARTA)," Judith Tizard said.

"National left a huge infrastructure deficit but this government is getting on with the job of putting it right. While problems like traffic congestion can’t be solved in one go, we are working hard together towards solutions.

"In 1999/00 under the budget set by National, there were three large Auckland State Highway projects under way with a combined value of $130.6 million. Under Labour, in 2004/05 there is $1.348 billion worth of major state highway projects either recently completed or underway during 2004/05," Judith Tizard said.
