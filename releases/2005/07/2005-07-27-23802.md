Foreign Minister Phil Goff today welcomed Myanmar's decision to relinquish the chair of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) for 2006/07.

“The situation in Myanmar remains unacceptable, with the government continuing to suppress democracy and human rights, and refusing to release Aung San Suu Kyi from detention," Mr Goff said in Vientiane, Laos, where he is attending the ASEAN Regional Forum.

“The military regime appears impervious to criticism over the lack of democratic procedures and widespread abuses, and promises of change not been delivered upon.

“Myanmar’s chairmanship would have made it difficult for ASEAN to present itself as an outward-looking and progressive organisation. It would also have created a barrier for dialogue partners such as New Zealand to participate in its annual meetings.

“I look forward to continued pressure being placed on Myanmar by ASEAN countries and the wider international community for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and the restoration of constitutional and democratic rule,” Mr Goff said.
