Prime Minister Helen Clark today expressed sadness at the news of more bomb attacks on London's transport system.

Helen Clark said that her thoughts today are with Tony Blair and the people of London at this testing time.

"I have great respect and admiration for the speed with which the British authorities identified those who carried out the bombings two weeks ago. Their response to these crises has been impressive, and I am sure will be on this occasion.

"Officials in New Zealand are meeting this morning, and will advise me further on the bombings and the steps being taken by the British authorities in response to these awful events," Helen Clark said.
