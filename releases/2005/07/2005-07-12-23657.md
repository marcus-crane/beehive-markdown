Advisories have been sent to about 2000 building industry participants following claims the treated timber product, TimberSaver Boron, is not being used properly, Building Issues Minister Chris Carter said today.

"While there may not be a problem with TimberSaver Boron or the way it is being used, I have decided it is best that we take a precautionary approach while claims about the product are being investigated," Mr Carter said.

"With this in mind, advisories have been sent to about 2000 building industry participants today, reminding them that they need to follow product usage guidelines for all building products, including timber framing," Mr Carter said.

"In addition to this, large suppliers of wood products are being contacted directly to remind them of their responsibilities to market products according to the conditions placed upon their use."

"All timber regardless of what it is treated with has the potential to rot if it is wet for long enough. All timber products are sold subject to conditions of use, and those conditions should be adhered to by the building industry," Mr Carter said.

"I must stress we do not yet know if there is a problem with TimberSaver Boron or the way it is being sold or used. We have only claims, and counter-claims. My officials are conducting a speedy investigation in to whether there are any grounds for concern, and we will notify the public as soon as possible."
