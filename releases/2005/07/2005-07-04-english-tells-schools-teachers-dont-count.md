National, in attempting to spin itself out of its education lies, have revealed they don't think teachers are important to children's education says Education Minister Trevor Mallard.

Speaking at the New Zealand School Trustees Association's (NZSTA) annual conference in Auckland yesterday Trevor Mallard dismantled National's lie that that Budget 2005 delivered more funding to the Ministry of Education than to schools.

Trevor Mallard showed that in fact schools in the 2006 calendar year would receive extra funding of $65 million, or around six times the new funding that went to Ministry projects. This included $22 million in extra new operational funding to schools – operational funding making up just one fifth of the government's total spending on schools.

National's Education spokesman Bill English reacted by issuing a release saying that new spending on salaries for all the new teachers shouldn't count.

"Tell that to students, parents and teachers themselves," said Trevor Mallard. "Research shows quite clearly that regardless of a students background, quality teachers can and do make the biggest difference to student achievement.

"The Labour-led government is committed to having quality teachers in schools and early childhood education services to raise education standards for our children. We won't be apologising for that any time soon."

Trevor Mallard says National has tied itself in knots trying to spin lies about spending on schools. The government has reversed National's disastrous under-funding of schools. In 2005/06 schools will get $1.3 billion more than they did in 1999, or an increase in spending on schools of one third.

"National's maths just doesn't add up," said Trevor Mallard. "They don't think teachers are important, or teacher aides working with students with special education needs, or new computer equipment.

Trevor Mallard issued to all media today a complete breakdown of new spending delivered by Budget 2005 to schools, to back up his claims.
