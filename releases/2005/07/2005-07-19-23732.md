Labour Party policy does not include support for legalising marijuana and it does not support taking any action that might promote its use, Justice Minister Phil Goff said today.

"The Labour government has not introduced, and will not introduce, legislation to legalise it.

"The police already have discretion not to bring charges for possession of small amounts of marijuana and use that discretion frequently," Mr Goff said.

Mr Goff's comments were in response to the private member's bill released today by Greens MP Nandor Tanczos.
