Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced further funding to assist councils in the Bay of Plenty area with recovery efforts following the effects of the July 2004 floods.

Helen Clark announced additional funding of more than $7 million during a visit to the Bay of Plenty region. The extra money will used for recovery purposes by the Bay of Plenty Regional Council, Whakatane District Council, and Opotiki District Council.

This latest funding announcement brings the total government funding in response to the July 2004 floods in the Eastern Bay of Plenty region to more than $29 million.

Helen Clark said that the new funding had been determined in line with standard emergency support provided to all local authorities, and consistent with the decisions made for special recovery assistance following the widespread flooding in the Lower North Island during February 2004. As well, the particularly low income base of Opotiki District Council was taken into consideration in making an ex gratia payment to it.

Cabinet’s latest decisions were to contribute as follows:

**Bay of Plenty Regional Council**

- $6.166 million to reimburse the Bay of Plenty Regional Council for additional response costs and essential infrastructure repairs.

**Whakatane District Council**

- $95,295 for additional response costs and essential infrastructure repairs, in addition to the $100,000 it has already received as advance payment on its costs for caring for the displaced;
- $23,000 towards the costs of improving and protecting the existing pumps at Awatapu, to better protect residents; and
- an ex gratia payment equivalent to 50 per cent of the Whakatane District Council’s residual costs after Land Transport New Zealand’s subsidy. This figure is to be determined at the end of the year, but is currently estimated to be $850,620.

**Opotiki District Council**

- $13,500 for its additional response costs and essential infrastructure repairs, in addition to the $50,000 already made as an advance payment on its costs in caring for the displaced; and
- $100,000 as an ex gratia payment to cover a range of costs outside normal policy provisions. A range of claim items from the Opotiki District Council were outside existing policy and special policy precedents. This payment is being made, however, in recognition of the financial circumstances of Opotiki District with its small population which has relatively low incomes overall.

Helen Clark said that Cabinet is inviting the Whakatane District Council and the Bay of Plenty Regional Council to jointly develop a business case for solutions to reduce community risk from the Whakatane and Rangitaiki Rivers. Government will consider contributing to this project in order to help address flood risk at the Awatapu community of Whakatane, and at Edgecumbe.

Cabinet is also inviting Opotiki District Council to discuss options for funding land use studies consistent with its local economic development initiatives with the Ministry of Economic Development.

Helen Clark said that today's announcement has rounded out one of the most comprehensive packages of central government assistance yet provided for any region following flooding.

"Last year's Bay of Plenty floods caused widespread damage to both rural and urban areas. It has taken the local councils some time to compile the costs of their responses and to decide on what infrastructural repairs were required. The government has been willing to contribute to this work, provided that it was undertaken in a way that improves the resilience of the affected communities,” Helen Clark said.
