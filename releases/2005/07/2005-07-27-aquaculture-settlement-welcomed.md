The newly signed aquaculture agreement will signal new opportunities for Maori in the marine farming industry according to Te Tai Tokerau MP Dover Samuels.

The signing between Te Ohu Kai Moana and the Crown, by Fisheries Minister David Benson-Pope and Te Ohu Kai Moana chair Shane Jones formalised the agreement.

Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Ltd is now Trustee of the Maori Commercial Aquaculture Settlement Trust, and will take responsibility for allocating assets from the aquaculture settlement to iwi.

“I am encouraged to hear the commitment made by the Trust that the aquaculture allocation to iwi will flow and will not be bogged down like the Maori Fisheries allocation,” said Dover Samuels.

“It is difficult to understand why the Maori Party chose to vote against this agreement that sees the transfer of a significant resource back to Maori. My challenge to Hone Harawira is to front up and explain why his organisation joined the National Party to oppose this legislation."

“This agreement will allow iwi to get on and develop marine farming in their regions and provide opportunities to their own and also contribute to the economic wellbeing of their members.

“We have been determined to reach agreement on aquaculture so there was certainty within the industry and it could be development-focused because it has the potential to become one of the biggest fishing industry earners.

“It is another positive step forward in the journey of Maori development that is seeing iwi, hapu and whanau move into development mode,” Dover Samuels said.
