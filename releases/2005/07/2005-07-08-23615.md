Prime Minister Helen Clark said tonight that she has been in direct contact with the New Zealand High Commission in London following news of terrorist attacks in London.

Helen Clark said she was shocked by the attacks and has asked the [New Zealand High Commission](http://www.nzembassy.com/home.cfm?c=14) to convey the sympathy and deep concern of the government and people of New Zealand to the office of British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

“All staff at the New Zealand High Commission have been accounted for, and the High Commission has activated an incident room so that it can deal with calls from within the United Kingdom.

“The High Commission is also in touch with the Metropolitan Police in London. At this point it has no advice of any New Zealand casualties.

“The [Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade](http://www.mfat.govt.nz/) in Wellington is working tonight to field calls from New Zealanders wishing to make inquiries. An 0800 number will be available shortly,” Helen Clark said.
