Minister of Women’s Affairs Hon Ruth Dyson reiterated her support of  
Women’s Refuge today when she launched its annual appeal at Parliament and accepted a petition containing 200,000 signatures.

“We are all striving for the same results – to protect vulnerable women and children from the impacts of family violence, while at the same time addressing the complex task of understanding and tackling its underlying causes,” Ms Dyson said at the launch.

Accepting the petition calling for increased government funding, Ms Dyson acknowledged Women’s Refuge’s significant contribution to the community through the protection of victims alongside prevention of family violence.

“Reducing violence against women and children is very high on our government’s agenda. We will give careful consideration to the request for more funding, and are committed to ensuring that Women’s Refuge continues to be viable, so that its essential services can continue.”

Ms Dyson said government work to address family violence consisted of several complementing strategies and initiatives including Te Rito: The New Zealand Family Violence Prevention Strategy and the Crime Reduction Strategy.

Domestic violence is a major focus for the Ministry of Women’s Affairs which is currently undertaking research into the effectiveness of protection orders as well as evaluating possible improvements to the Domestic Violence Act 1995, building on recommendations made by Women’s Refuge last year.
