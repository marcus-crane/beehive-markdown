The prosecution, conviction and $12,000 fine of the Home Shop Ltd for selling counterfeit clothes is welcome news for trade mark owners, says Associate Minister of Commerce Judith Tizard.

"It sends a clear message that trading in counterfeit goods is a criminal activity and will not be tolerated," Judith Tizard said.

The prosecution was brought by the Commerce Commission under the Fair Trading Act 1986.

Home Shop Ltd gave consumers the impression that they were buying genuine goods. The Associate Minister of Commerce also noted that the Trade Marks Act 2002 provides an avenue for trade mark owners to enforce their rights, with counterfeiters facing fines of up to $150,000 or imprisonment for up to five years.

"Innovative New Zealand manufacturers and businesses should not have their investments in producing quality goods undermined by unscrupulous counterfeiters who seek a free ride from that investment," Judith Tizard said.

Clothes are not the only goods that are targeted by counterfeiters and pirates, and fake products may include bags, watches, wallets, car parts, CDs, videos and DVDs.

"I urge consumers to check that branded goods being offered for sale are the genuine article before purchasing them, because chances are if it seems too good to be true – it probably is," Judith Tizard said.
