Transport Minister Pete Hodgson today signed a landmark agreement allowing New Zealand airlines to operate unlimited flights into and out of the UK.

The agreement was co-signed by British High Commissioner Richard Fell today in Wellington.

"Until now, Air New Zealand has only operated a single daily service into and out of London," says Pete Hodgson, "The agreement means Air New Zealand has the opportunity to introduce a second daily service into London as soon as it is ready to do so.

"This agreement is the most liberal signed to date by the UK. It is yet another example of the success this government is having in opening up international transport and trade links."

In allowing for extra services in and out of the UK, the agreement removes restrictions on:

Routes which New Zealand airlines can operate to, from and within the United Kingdom, and

The right to pick up and offload passengers and freight in other countries, including Hong Kong, on UK/New Zealand routes.

The UK has retained the right to cap the number of passengers carried by Air New Zealand between the US and Heathrow and Gatwick, but this is not expected to adversely affect the airline's ability to offer extra services.

"The timing is great news for the New Zealand tourism industry and for Air New Zealand given its long-haul fleet upgrade and enhanced product offering."

The full name of the agreement is: the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of New Zealand concerning Air Services.
