"Today we are celebrating a milestone in the history of Maori education in this country.

Parekura Horomia was attending the 130th Birthday celebrations for Hukarere Girls College today.

"Hukarere's future has been built on its history. Originally founded in 1875 by the first Bishop of Waiapu, Bishop William Williams, along Hukarere Road, the school was closed temporarily on two occasions, once after a fire in 1920 and then again after the 1931 Napier earthquake.

"Hukarere today stands proud in Eskdale. From here, pupils are given the guidance to participate and succeed in a range of academic, cultural and sporting activities. Hukarere endeavour to provide Maori girls with the firm belief that they can be successful in whatever career they pursue.

Parekura Horomia says research shows that regardless of a student's background, quality teachers can and make the biggest difference to student achievement.

This year the government will spend over $93 million on teacher professional development initiatives.

Happy Birthday Hukarere!
