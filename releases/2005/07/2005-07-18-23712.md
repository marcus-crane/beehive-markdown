"Encouraging the participation of Maori children and their whänau in high – quality early childhood education including Kohanga Reo continues to be a key priority" for this government", Associate Education Minister Parekura Horomia said today in releasing the Education Review Office's (ERO's) Evaluation Indicators and Review Package.

"The aim of the Köhanga Reo movement has always been the development of a well-educated young generation, comfortable and fluent in te reo and tikanga Mäori, living as Mäori in the 21st century. To a degree this has been achieved".

"In its reviews of Köhanga Reo ERO focuses on what is important to the children – the quality of their day-to-day experiences and the quality of the programme delivered in te reo Maori" said the Associate Minister

ERO has worked with Te Köhanga Reo National Trust to develop and implement a specialised education review process that reflects and supports the philosophy of köhanga reo. Evaluation indicators for kôhanga reo are crucial to this process.

“We have enjoyed working with the Education Review Office on this project”, said Ned Ihaka, Chief Executive of the Köhanga Reo National Trust.

“The end product is a tool that should be very useful for our köhanga reo.”

The Acting Chief Review Officer, Mike Hollings, is delighted that copies of the indicators will be sent to all Köhanga Reo.

“We hope that kaiako and whänau will choose to use the indicators when reviewing the effectiveness of their own Köhanga Reo.”

ERO’s review officers use evaluation indicators to help them make judgements when they are reviewing in schools and early childhood education services.

Evaluation indicators are prompts or reminders about the things ERO believes are important in köhanga reo.

"This is an important document, as it will provide a strong platform to support kaiako to provide quality teaching and learning experiences for our tamariki and mokopuna. I congratulate the joint effort between ERO and the Te Kohanga Reo National Trust in producing this document" said Parekura Horomia.

He ai ki ngā kōrero a Parekura Horomia, Te Minita Tuarua mo Te Mātauranga i te ra nei, i roto i tana tuku i nga tohu Aro Mātai me te Mōkihi Arotake a Te Tari Arotake Mātauranga, “Ko te haere tonu o te mea e matua ana ki tēnei kāwana, arā, ko te akiaki i te whai wāhi a ngā tamariki Māori me o rātou mātua i roto i te mātauranga o ngā kounga teitei mo te hunga kōhungahunga, ā, tāpiri atu ki ngā Kōhanga Reo”.

"Ko te kaupapa e whāia ana e Te Rōpu Matua o Te Kōhanga Reo mai rāno, ko te whanake i te reanga taiohi e matatau ana, e māhorahora ana, ā, e mātau ana ki te kōrero i te reo Māori, e mōhio ana ki ngā tikanga a te Māori, e noho Māori tonu ana i roto i tēnei rua tekau ma tahi rau tau. Ki a au nei, kei te taea haere tēnei".

I mahi ngātahi a ERO i te taha o Te Rōpu Matua o Te Kōhanga Reo ki te whanake me te whakahei he kaupapa arotake mātauranga motuhake e whakaatu mai ana, ā, e hāpai ana i te rapunga whakaaro o te kōhanga reo. E whai wāhi nui ana ngā tohu aro mātai mo ngā kōhanga reo i roto i tēnei whakahaere.

He ai ki a Netana Ihaka te Āpiha Matua o Te Rōpu Matua o Te Kōhanga Reo, “ I harikoa mātou ki te mahi ngātahi i te taha o Te Tari Arotake Mātauranga i runga i tēnei kaupapa. Ko ngā hua mai i tēnei, he taonga e tika ana kia whai hua ki a tātou kōhanga reo”.

E harikoa ana a Mike Hollings, Te Āphia Matua Whakakapi mo Te Tari Arotake Mātauranga, ka tukua atu ngä tauira o ngā tohu aro mātai ki te katoa o ngā kōhanga reo.

“Ko ta mātou tumanako, ka whakamahia e ngā kaiako me ngā whānau ngā tohu aro mātai nei i roto i ta rātou arotake i te whai hua o ngā whakahaere a o rātou ano kōhanga reo”.

E whakamahia ana e ngā āpiha arotake a ERO ngā tohu aro mātai hei āwhina i a rātou ki te whakarite i a rātou whakataunga i ngā wā e arotake ana rātou i roto i ngā kura, ā, i ngā wā e arotake ana rātou i ngā ratonga mo te hunga kōhungahunga.

He tohu akiaki, he tohu whakamaharatanga ngā tohu aro mātai mo ngā mea e whakapono ana a ERO e whai hua ana i roto i ngā kōhanga reo.

He ai ki a Parekura Horomia, “He pepa tino whai hua tēnei, notemea, ma tēnei e whakarato te papa pakari hei āwhina i ngā kaiako ki te whakarato i ngā kounga pai o te whakaako me ngā wheako akoranga mo a tātou tamariki me a tātou mokopuna. Ka mihi au ki ngā kaha i whakapaua e ERO me Te Rōpu Matua o Te Kōhanga Reo i roto i ta rātou whakatinana i ēnei tuhituhinga”.
