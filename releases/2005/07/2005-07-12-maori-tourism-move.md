The first inaugural conference of the Maori tourism sector to include Maori tourism organisations right around New Zealand is to be hosted by National Maori Tourism Council and the Associate Minister of Tourism Hon Dover Samuels.

The conference is to be held at Waipuna and Conference Centre in Auckland on Thursday and Friday (14/15 July).

"This government has recognised the importance of the Maori cultural component in promoting a national Maori Tourism footprint, unique to the New Zealand tourism industry. The Maori tourism sector will be competitive and market driven to ensure they get their share of the tourism dollar. Maori Tourism’s key objective is to offer a quality authentic product and to achieve excellence in its presentation”, said the Minister.

“The New Zealand tourism sector has surpassed traditional heavy weights dairy as the major export earner for New Zealand's economy. In 2003 international tourism's contribution to total exports was $7.4 billion – close to 18 percent of New Zealand's total exports. Combined with strong domestic market, total tourism spending represents nearly 10 per cent of GDP ($16.5 billion) and is also responsible for one in ten jobs. We will strive to capture our fair share of that market”, Dover Samuels said.

Johnny Edmonds Chief Executive for the New Zealand Maori Tourism Council said, "given that this is the first year of operations for the Council the primary objective for this year's conference is for existing and developing Maori Regional Tourism Organisations to discuss and learn about sustainable operating models from leaders in the field".

"The second objective for this conference is to provide a major opportunity to put a national Maori tourism picture in front of the tourism industry in the "industry Showcase". We want to celebrate and acknowledge the growing importance of Maori tourism to the industry, said Johnny". The Council will launch its logo, website and statement of intent during the industry showcase.

Minister Samuels said, "Maori Tourism is moving forward and beyond and we have gone from cooking with hangi stones, we’re now cooking with gas”.
