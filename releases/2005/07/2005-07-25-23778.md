Prime Minister Helen Clark [announced today](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F23779) that the 2005 general election will be held on Saturday 17 September.

Helen Clark said that she had advised the Governor General today to dissolve Parliament on 11 August. She said that writ day will follow on 17 August and nomination day on 23 August.

Helen Clark said that this election is about leadership, credibility, and values.

"It’s about who can be trusted to run a strong economy, create jobs, lift living standards, and invest back into the basics of health, education, services for older citizens and families, infrastructure, and law and order," Helen Clark said.

"It’s about who has credible policies to deliver those results for the future, and who will keep their word on the promises they make to the people of New Zealand.

"It’s about who can be trusted to stand up for New Zealand and for the values and principles which New Zealanders hold dear at home and abroad.

Helen Clark said that Labour would campaign both on its strong record of achievement and on new policies for the next three years which will be released in the coming weeks, including the key commitments on its pledge card for the election.

"We are proud of what we have achieved in our first two terms in government, but we know there is much more to do to lift living standards for all our families. Our country is on the way up, and the journey must continue.

"This election offers a stark choice as two very different futures for New Zealand are on offer.

"The future with Labour sees New Zealanders moving forward together, optimistic about what New Zealand can achieve and proud of what we are already achieving in so many fields. Economic strength, very positive trends in socio-economic indicators, and success in the creative and many other areas characterise New Zealand today. Our government is proud of all the peoples who have contributed to making our small country one of the most dynamic, innovative, and creative on earth.

"The alternative is a return to the days of asset sales, big borrowing, spending cuts, growing poverty, instability and the deeply divided society of the 1990s. National would take New Zealand backwards not forwards.

"My judgement is that New Zealanders are not looking for a radical change of direction at this election. That is why I am entering this election campaign full of optimism and seeking the opportunity for Labour to continue its work to build a stronger fairer New Zealand for all our people," Helen Clark said.
