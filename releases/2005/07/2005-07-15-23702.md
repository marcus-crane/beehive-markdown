Today’s launch of the [New Zealand Business Consultation Website](http://www.businessconsultation.govt.nz) is another achievement in the government’s on-going commitment to enhance the quality of regulation and reduce business compliance costs, says the Minister for Small Business Rick Barker.

“The website will provide a convenient way for government agencies to ask business owners, operators and people interested in business their opinions on proposed or existing government regulations. This should mean that when regulations are recommended, government Ministers can be told with greater certainty what impact they are likely to have on businesses,” Mr Barker said.

When government agencies want to find out business’ views on proposed or existing regulations, they apply to the Ministry of Economic Development for the names of business people who want be contacted on that topic.

“We realise that business people’s time is precious so the website designers have ensured that this time is respected,” he said.

The site has been designed to filter inquiries. Database members will only be asked for their opinion on areas of regulation in which they have indicated an interest and they will only be consulted the number of times per year they specify.

The website will automatically notify people on the database of any relevant public consultation documents covering their areas of interest.

The initiative is based on the successful Small Business Service launched in the United Kingdom in 2003.

“I am looking forward to people with business interests registering with the database so they can put forward their views on regulations. I also invite business organisations like Chambers of Commerce and Business New Zealand to register so they can be involved in consultation.”

Previous government initiatives in this area include: the Ministerial Panel on Compliance Costs and the government responses to their report; the establishment of the Small Business Advisory Group; the nation-wide Small Business Day events in 2004; and the announcement of 104 additional compliance cost reduction achievements in May 2004.
