More students are leaving school with higher qualifications thanks to the Labour-led government's work and investment in education, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

"The government's hard work in education is paying off for students, and these statistics show we are successfully raising education standards in our schools. Fewer students are also leaving school with no qualification at all.

"In 2004, 32 per cent of all students left school with NCEA Level 3 / University Entrance compared to 29 per cent in 2003 and 27 per cent in 2002.

"And in the communities which have really been lagging behind in educational achievement, our education policies are also paying off.

"Since 2002, the number of Pasific Island students leaving schools with the university entrance or NCEA level 3 qualification rose from 8.5 per cent to 14 per cent. Since 2002, the number of Maori students leaving schools with the university entrance or NCEA level 3 qualification rose from 7.7 per cent to 11.7 per cent.

"These statistics fly in the face of opposition attempts to undermine our education system and the hard work students around the country are doing.

"We are seeing a significant increase in the number of students gaining the necessary qualifications to go on to tertiary study. This is hugely important to individual students and gives them a real chance to reach their full potential - both academically and in the workforce. It is equally important to us as a country, as we need highly skilled and innovative thinkers if we want to compete globally.

"The statistics also back up feedback from schools reporting higher levels of retention in senior secondary school, and adds to evidence that NCEA encourages students to stay in school longer, to aim high and attain a qualification," said Trevor Mallard.

"The aim of the Labour-led government is to create successful school leavers who have the knowledge, skills, attitudes and values to contribute positively and actively to society and the economy. These statistics are hugely encouraging," Trevor Mallard said.

The monitoring and attainment of school leavers is based on the annual 1 March survey of secondary and composite schools. These statistics include all students that left school during the period 1 March 2004 – 29 February 2005. The data is comparable from year to year.
