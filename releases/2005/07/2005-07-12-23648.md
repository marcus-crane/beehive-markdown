Over 2000 schools will be eligible for funding to help them purchase accredited student management administration systems during the next three years.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard today announced an $8 million funding package designed to encourage schools to use accredited Student Management Systems (SMS), which increase administrative efficiencies, enabling schools to spend more time on teaching.

“If schools can access reliable and accurate systems, their administrative staff can work more efficiently; management can use the information in the systems to make better decisions; and teachers can use the assessment, reporting and curriculum management functions to improve educational outcomes for their students,” Trevor Mallard said.

Trevor Mallard said the funding will be structured so schools can choose the best system for their needs.

“There are seven accredited systems available as well as the e-SMS solution and funding is available for all of them so schools can choose the one that’s right for them,” he said.

A particular focus of the funding is to provide a web hosted Student Management System solution. In addition, around 400 schools already using an accredited system will be able to access funding for professional development.

Schools will receive details of the funding package in the first week of Term 3.
