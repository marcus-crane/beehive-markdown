The government has approved a $9.49 million funding increase for the Total Mobility scheme say Minister of Transport Pete Hodgson and Minister for Disability Issues Ruth Dyson.

The new money will allow for improved services and a 60 per cent increase in the number of users from 43,000 to 69,000 over the next three years.

Operated by local authorities and jointly funded by central and local government, the scheme provides a subsidised taxi transport service to people with serious mobility constraints.

Today's announcement means that the government's share of funding would be boosted from 40 to 50 per cent in the current year and to 60 per cent in subsequent years provided local authorities do not reduce their contributions.

The scheme's total budget will rise from $9.18 million to $18.67 million. The extra money will see the scheme improve and expand.

"This larger scheme will give those in our community with serious mobility problems the support they need to get around or to work," said Ruth Dyson.
