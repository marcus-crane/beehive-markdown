New Zealand’s next Consul-General to Shanghai will be career diplomat Wen Chin Powles, Foreign Minister Phil Goff said today.

“Shanghai is one of China’s main commercial centres. It has a population of nearly 20 million, and sits at the head of the Yangtze River valley, the source of 40 percent of China’s agricultural and industrial output," Mr Goff said.

“The primary role of New Zealand's Consul-General in Shanghai is to foster a wide range of links in the commercial, political, consular, cultural and education sectors.

“Almost half of New Zealand’s exports to China are destined for this region and there are believed to be 2000 New Zealanders based in Shanghai.

“Shanghai has experienced double-digit GDP growth for more than a decade and is gradually becoming an economic hub of North Asia. The city and its hinterland have some of the China’s highest levels of disposable income,” Mr Goff said.

Wen Powles joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in 1988. Her previous postings have included Beijing and New York. She will take up her appointment in December, replacing Pam Dunn.
