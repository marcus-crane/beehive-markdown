Don Brash's centrepiece policy to cap the amount of Crown Account spending on transport over the next three years would result in a $635 million cut under a National government compared to a Labour-led one.

"This Labour-led government has committed to spend $1.235 billion from the Crown Account on transport over the next term of government. National will only commit to cap spending from the Crown Account on transport at $600 million over the same period," says Transport Minister Pete Hodgson.

"If National get in it is clear that transport spending in Auckland, Wellington, the Bay of Plenty, the Waikato would crash. This would be terrible news for our economy, businesses, commuters, local communities and contractors.

"This Labour led government has committed the money and it is being spent. In Auckland for example, the value of major projects underway last year was up ten fold to $1.3 billion compared to activity in National's final year."
