"Let me start by saying Maori Tourism is on the move, we are making unprecedented progress in staking out our territory in this exciting industry. This government is committed to Maori Tourism, and I am committed to ensuring that delivery takes place".

These are the words of Associate Minister of Tourism Dover Samuels today speaking to Te Waipounamu Maori Regional Tourism Organisation (MRTOs) and their Maori Tourism operator base for the southern south Island.

MP for Te Tai Tonga Mahara Okeroa also spoke at the Maori regional tourism hui which took place at the Millennium Hotel in Queenstown, "We are not only here to speak with Maori tourism operators but we are also here to encourage and celebrate the creation of Maori wealth" said Mr Okeroa.

Mr Samuels said, "this regional hui is the ninth so far in a series of 10, that have taken me from Kaeo in the north to Ruatoria in the east, New Plymouth in the west, here in the south and quite a few places in between. He further added that these hui have provided him and government officials with a good insight into issues facing Maori tourism today".

There has been a heck of a lot of very positive developments in Maori Tourism over the last 3 years; Firstly there is indigenousnewzealand.com – that provides visitors with information on Maori tourism activities.

"In June, we had the release of the Rough Guide to Maori New Zealand II. We have seen the government working to strengthen the regional presence of Maori in tourism by supporting the development of MRTOs. There are now 13 MRTOs covering much of the country. We have seen the New Zealand Maori Tourism Society (represented by Council) grow out of these regional groups. The Council are an important cog in the Maori tourism wheel. They have government support and are strongly focused on empowering MRTOs to add value to Maori tourism operators," said Mr Samuels.

Mr Samuels also announced at the hui, the newly developed Maori Tourism Facilitation Service. "The launch of the Maori Tourism Facilitation Service will help operators to assess a range of issues that prevail in the tourism industry from product development through to management and operational issues." He further commented that the next step as part of this service would be to provide mentors that work directly with each organisation. The net effect of this will be Maori organisations that are sustainable, and have the ability to generate real wealth for their whanau, hapu or Iwi."

"The Maori tourism sector will be competitive and market driven to ensure they get their share of the tourism dollar. Maori Tourism’s key objective is to offer a quality authentic product and to achieve excellence in its presentation”, said Mr Samuels.
