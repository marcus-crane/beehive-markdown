Tourism Minister Mark Burton attended Whitianga's first annual Scallop festival today.

Mr Burton commended the organisers, and the people of Whitianga, for their innovative and proactive approach to attracting visitors to the area.

"The future success of our tourism industry will, in significant part, depend on communities who build on their point of difference to raise awareness of their town as a visitor destination.

"We know that the visitors who come to our country are looking for unique, authentic experiences. Experiences that involve real interaction with our people and environments, and that is exactly what festivals such as this offer. Who would be able to resist a festival that focuses on food, wine and the arts?

"I applaud your initiative in taking a hands-on approach to attracting visitors to the area. I welcome the fact that guests, both international and domestic, will now have a chance to get off the beaten track and discover some of the country's less explored places."

While there, Mr Burton presented a cheque for $40 000 to the Mercury Bay regional museum.

The money, which is part of the latest round of Tourism Facilities Grants, will go towards the development of navigation displays and the building of an access ramp. The navigation exhibition will include displays highlighting the differences and similarities between early European and Polynesian maritime navigation and also a construction of Kupe's waka.

The Tourism Facilities Grants Programme, administered through the Ministry of Tourism, aims to enhance overseas visitors' understanding and enjoyment of New Zealand through increasing the quality and number of nationally significant tourism facilities.
