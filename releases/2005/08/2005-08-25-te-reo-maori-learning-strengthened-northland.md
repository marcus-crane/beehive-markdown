Two new Kura Kaupapa Mâori are to be established in Northland, Associate Education Minister Parekura Horomia announced today.

They are Te Kura Kaupapa Mâori o Te Tonga o Hokianga (Whirinaki, South Hokianga); and Te Kura Kaupapa Mâori o Pukemiro (Pukepoto, Kaitaia).

Both kura have been operating as satellite schools in recent years, but will operate as stand-alone kura from 1 October this year.

“The Education Review Office has made it clear that both these kura have the ability to deliver a high quality education in te reo Mâori,” Parekura Horomia said. “This decision will add strength to education in the Mâori language in the Far North.

“Whanau support in both communities has been critical to the schools’ success and I congratulate everyone concerned on all the hard work they have undertaken on behalf of their local children,” Parekura said.

Both kura will deliver the national curriculum in te reo Mâori and operate under the teaching and learning philosophy of Te Aho Matua.

Mr Hohepa Campbell, Tumuaki (President) of Te Rùnanga Nui o Ngâ Kura Kaupapa Mâori o Aotearoa, said, “We are delighted that two kura in Tai Tokerau have achieved full status as kura kaupapa Mâori. We congratulate those families and children involved. The approval of Pukemiro and Te Tongo o Hokianga will encourage the other ten communities around the country that are working towards establishment as kura kaupapa Mâori.”

Te Kura Kaupapa Mâori o Te Tonga o Hokianga currently has a roll of 53 students, which is projected to grow to around 85 students within three years.

Te Kura Kaupapa Mâori o Pukemiro has a roll of 43 students and is also likely to expand to over 80 students by 2008.

The Ministry of Education will provide up to $500,000 in additional property funding to each kura to provide for new facilities to accommodate the expected roll growth, as per the funding formula used for all schools throughout the country.
