Claims that the microchipping of some dogs required [under law from next year](http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Resource-material-Dog-Control-Index?OpenDocument) will create massive new compliance costs for farmers and dog owners are a beat up, Local Government Minister Chris Carter said today.

"Microchipping does not apply to all dogs from July next year as consistently claimed. It only [applies](http://www.dogsafety.govt.nz/dogsafety.nsf/wpg_URL/Your-Council-Registration-&-Microchipping-Index!OpenDocument) to dogs registered for the first time, particularly new puppies, or dogs declared dangerous, menacing, or consistently impounded," Mr Carter said.

"If New Zealanders have dogs which are already registered, and they are not dangerous or roaming, they won't ever have to get their dog chipped unless the dog causes trouble.

"Contrary to claims, the Dog Control Act does not require vets to insert the chips therefore incurring a vet fee. Insertion is a comparatively simple procedure which could actually be done by a council officer or a farmer if he got the insertion checked," Mr Carter said.

"Some councils are thinking of providing microchip insertion clinics for free or at a significantly reduced cost. This may mean microchipping may only cost the $12 to $20 dollars it costs for the chip.

"The advantages of microchipping are numerous. It is a permanent means of identification, which permanently links a dog to an owner. This makes life a lot easier for authorities if a dog attacks somebody, goes roaming or is stolen," Mr Carter said.

"The problem with the dog tags we have at the moment is they can be easily removed, lost, or swapped among dogs.

"Given top heading and huntaway dogs can cost thousands of dollars, I would have thought $12- $20 for a microchip would be a reasonable investment for a farmer if it guarantees ownership," Mr Carter said.

"It is worth remembering that the gradual introduction of microchipping also enables New Zealand to move to a more efficient and effective [national dog database](http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Resource-material-National-Dog-Database-Project-Index?OpenDocument)."
