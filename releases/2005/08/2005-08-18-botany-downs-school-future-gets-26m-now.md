The government has approved an additional $2.635 million for three new teaching blocks at Botany Downs Secondary College in East Auckland, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

Botany Downs College is one of only two secondary schools to have been built since 1979. The school is state-of-the-art and opened in January 2004 with 306 Year 9 students and teaching space for 750 students. The three new teaching blocks, which form stage two of the school's development, will allow Botany Downs to cater for 1500 students by the beginning of 2008.

“The government is committed to ensuring a high quality environment for students to learn in and for staff to work in," said Trevor Mallard. "I am very pleased the extra $2.635 million will allow the completion of this new school as a top class learning facility for our students.”

The original estimate in the early planning stages for the cost of stage two was $9.815 million. The additional funding will increase the total budget to $12.45 million.

"Botany Downs is a school for the future. I’m delighted for the Botany Downs community and for the students, because this new funding will ensure the second stage of the college will include the educationally innovative features that were developed in the first stage.

"Internal glass, operable walls allow the changing shape and size of classrooms to accommodate the needs of different classes, and the school has been built to maximise the use of ICT for enhanced learning.

"It has also been built with several energy sustainability features that will be carried through into stage two, including increased use of windows for natural lighting, additional insulation to save on heating costs, and a natural ventilation system.

"The government is committed to providing strong public services such as schools that are modern, up-to-date, enjoyable learning environments. Every New Zealander is entitled to access quality public education,” Trevor Mallard said.
