Tourism Minister Mark Burton today handed over a $72,000 cheque to the McCahon House Trust to go towards displays in the artist's former residence at French Bay in Waitakere City.

The Tourism Facilities Grant will go towards the installation of interpretative displays in the house where McCahon lived with his family between 1953 and 1960.

Mark Burton paid tribute to the Waitakere City Council for gifting the property to the McCahon House Trust and to the trust for their vision in restoring the house, which is due to be open to the public later this year.

He also paid tribute to the Waitakere community for their "commitment to preserving their environment and cultural heritage and to fostering the arts.

"Waitakere City has a proud record of promoting the arts – almost every year you have cleaned up at the Creative New Zealand Creative Places Award.

"Cultural tourism is an important part of the New Zealand Tourism Strategy. Research tells us that our ideal guest -the "Interactive Traveller", a visitor who is looking for unique, authentic experiences that involve real interaction with our people and environment.

"This house, in such a stunning setting, is certainly a perfect fit with such visitors. Because of the international status of Colin McCahon, and his interpretation of the New Zealand landscape, this project will be a valuable addition to the New Zealand cultural tourism trail."
