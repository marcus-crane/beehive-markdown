The burning of four government cars and the trashing of a school are worrying indications of the high level of tension in Tonga, says Foreign Minister Phil Goff.

"It is important in the current situation for steps to be taken to resolve the long-running public sector strike, which has contributed to this tension," Mr Goff said.

"We urge all parties to avoid actions or comments that may be inflammatory. This applies to outsiders as well as those involved in the dispute.

"At the invitation of the government of Tonga, New Zealand is willing to assist in any way that may be helpful in resolving the strike. Should parties in Tonga regard it as helpful, we would be more than happy to assist with a mediator to facilitate the parties reaching agreement.

"New Zealand would be pleased to work alongside other friends of Tonga, including Britain, Australia, the Commonwealth and the Forum Secretariat to respond to any request for assistance from Tonga," Mr Goff said.
