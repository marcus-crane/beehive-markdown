This government's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol is set to result in more clean, green power flowing. HG Leach and Company Limited's Tirohia landfill gas project has been awarded 28,000 internationally tradable emissions units under the government's Projects to Reduce Emissions programme.

"This government is taking a responsible approach to climate change and managing our economy. The key to this is the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. Under it we are transforming our economy for growth in a world where greenhouse gas emissions are priced," says Convenor of the Ministerial Group on Climate Change Pete Hodgson.

"The Programme would not exist if we were not in Kyoto. It alone is forecast to help us save over 11 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions and has helped bring forward hundreds of megawatts of power projects."

HG Leach' proposed project would install and operate four modular electricity sets to produce power from landfill gas that would otherwise be flared at the Tirohia landfill near Paeroa. The electricity generated would be primarily fed into the local power supply network with some power being used on-site. The project is forecast to offset the emission of around 30,288 tonnes of carbon dioxide between 2008 and 2012; the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.

"By tackling climate change in this way, this scheme is helping to protect the environment and the unique Kiwi lifestyle for future generations. At the same time, it will help meet the power needs of a growing regional economy in a sustainable way."

Under the Programme, units are awarded to projects that lead to a net reduction in emission against business as usual that would otherwise not go ahead and that are successful in a tender round. To date, 10 million units, which are internationally tradable, have been put out for tender.

The proposal is subject to normal planning processes.
