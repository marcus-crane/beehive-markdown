Education Minister Trevor Mallard today released evaluation reports for the first Digital Opportunities Pilot Projects in education.

The reports evaluate several Ministry of Education "DigiOps" projects from 2001-2003 that were conceived as three-way partnerships between schools, government and business to trial the use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) to enhance learning.

Trevor Mallard released the reports at Te Papa while watching one of the new DigiOps projects, the CHAoS project, in action with Brooklyn School students using portable technologies, such as hand-held personal computers, to undertake research.

“One of our key education priorities is to build an education system that will equip New Zealanders with 21st century skills,” Trevor Mallard said. "The evaluations highlight the need for grassroots school development of project ideas, to get a strong match between school priorities and the potential of information technology.

"ICT is an incredible tool for learning and ICT skills are essential for work and for life in the modern world. The pilot projects were most successful for schools where they strengthened and extended existing school programmes, and likewise built on professional links between teachers.

“These evaluations emphasise the importance of setting a clear framework to promote innovation from schools. Because of these evaluations we know a lot more about setting up successful ICT projects in schools and are using this information to develop the next round Digital Opportunities projects, which will run from 2005 to 2007.

"In 2001, getting businesses, schools and government to work together with a common goal of encouraging the use of ICT in schools was a new concept. Those businesses have stayed on board for the new projects and the partnerships are now even stronger," said Trevor Mallard.

The pilot projects evaluated encompassed online resource sharing and collaboration (FarNet), laptops for senior secondary students (Notebook Valley), an ICT boost to after school learning centres (Digitally Boosted Study Support Centres), and software training (Generation XP).
