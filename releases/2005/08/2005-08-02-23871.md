Courts Minister, Rick Barker, today announced that for the past twelve months to 30 June 2005, there has been a reduction of 5674 in the number of criminal summary cases that are waiting for resolution in the District Court system.

"This is great news, the Ministry of Justice has been working very hard to resolve the issue of outstanding cases and we can now report that this work is having a positive effect," said Mr Barker

This is a reduction of about 20% from 29,550 at 30 June 2005 to 23,786 as of 30 June 2005.

"The improvement in criminal summary cases can be attributed partly to improved practices in the Registries, with regard to managing cases, and to increased judicial capacity to hear the cases," Mr Barker said.

"The judiciary have also had a significant role to play, it's a team effort, this is no easy task and I am pleased about the focus judges have taken to reduce the number of cases we have on hand."

Mr Barker was also pleased to note that the number of cases on hand in the Youth Court has decreased by thirteen percent from 1180 at 30 June 2004 to 1022 at 30 June 2005.

"This is particularly pleasing, as the speed with which cases are resolved in the Youth Court is important to young people realising the link between their actions and the consequences" he said.

"There are still areas within the Courts system that remain under pressure, but the achievements made in key areas of the workload is very pleasing and is indicative of the continuing focus being given by this government to instigating significant improvements across the Courts network."
