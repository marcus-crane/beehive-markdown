Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia today congratulated Prime Minister Helen Clark on Labour's pledge requiring all historical Treaty claims to be lodged by 1 September 2008, with the aim of settling all claims by 2020.

"Labour's pledge to set a timeframe for achieving resolution of Treaty claims is welcome news and a further step in Labour's commitment to move Maori forward," he said.

"I acknowledge the very important kaupapa of settling the long-standing grievances of our people – however the days of keeping Mâori in the dungeons of doom and gloom are over. This is all about progress.

"Mâori want to complete their Treaty Settlements as soon as possible, but without rushing, and this pledge achieves this while ensuring that the agreements reached remain durable.

“Labour is proud of its history with respect to Treaty settlements. Since this government came into office eight major claims have been settled and discussions and negotiations towards settlements have occurred with another 26 groups.

"This pledge supports Mâori moving forward and will assist iwi, hapu and whanau to focus on the next phase of their development,” Parekura Horomia said.
