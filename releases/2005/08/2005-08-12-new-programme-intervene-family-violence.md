Work and Income case managers will be trained to better identify and support families affected by violence, Child, Youth and Family Minister Ruth Dyson said today at the Christchurch launch of the Family Violence Intervention Programme.

“Family violence is one of the most pressing issues we face as a country. Every year, 12 women and 10 children die in New Zealand as a direct result of family violence – this cannot be tolerated in our society. The programme I'm launching today in Christchurch is a further step in our work to support victims of family violence," Ruth Dyson said.

The $18.9 million programme was launched in Auckland last month, with the East Coast to follow later this year. By 2007, it will be in operation in every region in the country.

The programme will see Work and Income case managers trained to better identify and support families affected by violence. Case managers will develop an income support plan for victims of family violence. In addition, referral processes will be streamlined to make sure clients can more easily access community-based violence prevention services. Work and Income will not record any information or make referrals without their clients’ consent.

Since the 2002 publication of Te Rito – New Zealand's family violence prevention strategy – the government has made significant progress in addressing family violence. Initiatives include:  
·a $12 million service for children who witness family violence;  
·the New Zealand Family Violence Clearinghouse website;  
·the establishment of Family and Community Services within the Ministry of Social Development, providing leadership and co-ordination of government and community services to families;  
·a $3 million elder abuse and neglect prevention programme; and  
·the Family Violence Funding Circuit Breaker to streamline funding and auditing processes for service providers.

Ruth Dyson said strong community leadership was also needed to eliminate family violence, and the programme had been developed with guidance from a number of community-based agencies.
