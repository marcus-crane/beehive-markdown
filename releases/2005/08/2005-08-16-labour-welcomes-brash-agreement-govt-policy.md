The government has welcomed the news that National will reimburse homecare workers for their mileage costs, but says it is already in hand.

"I am delighted that Don Brash agrees with government policy. Home based support services should have a fair travel reimbursement policy. Negotiations to achieve that are currently underway."

"We saw a substantial increase in funding in the May Budget which is currently being used by DHBs to negotiate new home based support services contracts. No contracts will be signed unless home care providers have a fair travel policy."

"Variations in how that is calculated are both allowable and inevitable given the various business models under which home based support services are provided. The changes Dr Brash supports will, however, be in place long before National's timeline of 1 April, 2006."
