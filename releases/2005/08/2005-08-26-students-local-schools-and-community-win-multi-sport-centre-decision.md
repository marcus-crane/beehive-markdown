Funding has been approved for the extension of Gore’s multi-sport centre in return for subsidised use of the facilities by schools, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

“I am pleased to announce that this funding of $358,000 towards the Centre will provide local schools with affordable sport and recreation facilities,” Trevor Mallard said.

“The government is committed to ensuring every person in every community has the chance to benefit from sport and physical activity. The centre will provide local schools with subsidised use of the ice skating facilities for 15 years and subsidised use of other sports facilities for 25 years."

Schools will be able to use the facilities for netball, basketball, tennis, prize-giving ceremonies and school fairs.

"I see real wins in this decision for our students, for schools, and for the wider community," said Trevor Mallard.

This last stage of the sports centre’s extension proposal involves the construction of a four-court indoor stadium attached to the existing ice skating and aquatic centre facilities.

"The government through SPARC (Sport and Recreation New Zealand) is investing more than $32 million annually into a range of initiatives to encourage New Zealanders to be more active," said Trevor Mallard.

"More than 2 million people die worldwide each year from inactivity, and our increasingly sedentary lifestyle is estimated to account for 8 percent of all deaths in New Zealand.

"We've placed a real emphasis on encouraging young people to participate in physical activities and hope they will carry this attitude with them through their whole life.

"Support for the extension of Gore’s multi-sport centre also fits into this bigger picture."
