Commerce Minister Pete Hodgson today announced the appointment of Vivian Kloosterman to the Standards Council.

“I am confident that Vivian Kloosterman’s skills and knowledge will be an asset to the Council. As New Zealand and other economies move towards greater adoption of environmental standards, it is to the Council’s advantage that it can now depend on the expertise of an environmental engineer among its members,” says Pete Hodgson.

“Ms Kloosterman has a strong understanding of standards and how they relate to economic growth, international trade, and public health and safety. As a business owner, she has a strategic understanding of how standards drive innovation.”

Vivian Kloosterman is a Chartered Professional Engineer with 24 years of engineering experience. She is the Managing Director of VK Consulting Environmental Engineers Ltd, an environmental engineering and planning consultancy firm she established in Whangarei in 1989.

Ms Kloosterman was recently elected a Fellow of the Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand. She is also a board member of the Chartered Professional Engineers Council, Chair of the University of Canterbury’s Natural Resources Engineering Advisory Board and Member of its Civil Engineering Advisory Board.

Ms Kloosterman replaces architect Roy Wilson who served on the Standards Council for over seven years.

The Standards Council is the governing body of Standards New Zealand, the national organization with statutory responsibility for the development and promotion of standards and related products. Through the voluntary participation of about 2,000 New Zealanders on its boards and committees, the Council is able to draw on the knowledge and expertise of many sectors of the population in carrying out its work. Professional and consumer bodies are also able to nominate members to the Council ensuring a broad representation of membership.

The Council is a Crown entity under the Standards Act 1988. The primary functions of the Council are to develop standards and to promote, encourage and facilitate the use of standards in New Zealand with the object of:

improving the quality of goods and services;

promoting standardisation in industry, trade and commerce while encouraging industrial development;

encouraging and facilitating industrial development, trade, or commerce; and

promoting public and occupational safety, health and welfare.

The Council is a user-funded Crown entity. It does not receive public funding for its operation.

The Standards Act requires the Council to have up to twelve members. Of the twelve members:

up to four members may be appointed by the Minister of Commerce; and

up to eight members may be appointed by the Minister of Commerce from nominations made by professional or consumer bodies.

In appointing members of the Council, the Minister must have regard to candidates’ knowledge of, and experience in, management and the development and use of standards.
