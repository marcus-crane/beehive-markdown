A new government initiative is helping 85 students at two small schools around Great Barrier Island to tap into the online world.

The schools are Kaitoke School (Claris), and Okiwi School.

The local schools are some of 300 small schools nationwide that don't yet have network infrastructure, that will soon be able to access resources such as digital learning and multi-media materials to help students learn.

Auckland Central MP Judith Tizard says the schools will all be eligible for new funding announced by the government to help small schools buy computer network infrastructure.

"This infrastructure is often difficult for small schools to provide, but our students have a right to learn 21st Century skills so the government has targeted them with this package," said Judith Tizard.

"The government is working to make sure children and families in the more remote spots get the best quality education.

"Information and Communications Technology is an incredible learning tool and ICT skills are essential for work and for getting along in the modern world. I'm sure our local schools and their students will benefit greatly from this initiative," said Judith Tizard.

The $11 million government package, announced by Education Minister Trevor Mallard, subsidises installation of cables and other hardware to meet the needs of small schools. Financial assistance will be made available to schools at a 4:1 contribution for schools with fewer than 77 students, and at a 3:1 contribution for schools with between 78 and 187 students.
