A new code of conduct for social workers was welcomed today by Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey and Associate Social Development and Employment Minister Ruth Dyson.

The code sets out the minimum professional standards of behaviour, integrity and conduct that apply to registered social workers.

"This is an important step forward which will formalise standards of practice in New Zealand's social work profession," Steve Maharey said.

"This government has had a huge programme of work since 1999 to strengthen the social work sector in New Zealand, including enhancing the standing of the profession and investing significant new resources in the sector.

"We have introduced new areas and opportunities for social workers in New Zealand, for example the successful Social Workers in Schools programme. There are now 106 social workers in schools compared to only 12 in 1999.

"Since 1999 we have increased CYF's baseline funding by more than 50 per cent, with CYF social worker numbers going up by 26 percent between December 1999 and June 2005, from 924 to 1161.

"Through the Budget we are investing an extra $5.4 million to help NGO workers undertake study towards social work degrees."

Ruth Dyson said the social work sector had been supportive of the changes to strengthen the sector.

"The social work sector has been vocal in its desire for change and members have supported the growing expectation that social workers are more accountable in their work, and that people in vulnerable positions need to be protected from any harm that might result from social work practice."

The Social Workers Registration Board has also established a Complaints and Discipline Tribunal to deal with complaints about registered social workers. The Chair of the Tribunal will appoint Complaints Assessment Committees in consultation with the Board in relation to particular cases when required.
