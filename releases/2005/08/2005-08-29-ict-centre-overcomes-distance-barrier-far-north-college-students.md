A new centre that offers an innovative way of learning and eliminates arduous travel times for a group of college students has been created in the Far North, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

“The new e-learning centre will use information and communication technologies, (ICT), so that the college students who live at Te Hapua can study close to home instead of travelling for four hours on the school bus every day,” Trevor Mallard said.

"One of our key education priorities is to build an education system that will equip New Zealanders with 21st century skills. Our vision is of a networked and flexible education system offering accessible, high quality and relevant learning opportunities for all New Zealanders.

"The Te Hapua Centre will have videoconferencing, broadband internet connection, and computer technology, giving the students access to the secondary school curriculum without needing to travel 100 km each way to Kaitaia College every day."

Trevor Mallard said that the satellite classroom, situated at Te Hapua School, would initially be for Year 9 and 10 Kaitaia College students, and there would be a full-time teacher on site.

“Since visiting Te Hapua in 2003, I have been concerned about the effect on students of travelling for two hours each way on the bus to college,” Trevor Mallard said. “A great deal of planning has gone into the new centre and I am very happy to see it now underway.

“If an initial three-year period with Year 9 and 10 students is successful, the centre could subsequently cater for Year 11 to 13 students as well,” Trevor Mallard said.

The centre is expected to be ready for the start of the 2006 school year. Hui will be held with the Te Hapua community over the next few months to ensure it is fully involved in decisions about what the centre will provide and its expected benefits.

In 2005/06 the Government will spend around $69 million directly on ICT initiatives in schools. Separate to this, some $46 million has been allocated to project PROBE over the last two years, through which high-speed internet access for all schools and their communities in regional New Zealand is being rolled out. Approximately $10.7 million is also provided each year on a per student basis for ICT support through the school operations grant.
