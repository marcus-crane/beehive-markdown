Transport Minister Pete Hodgson highlighted today the vital importance to the nation's infrastructure of being ready, willing and able to work with other political parties under MMP.

Mr Hodgson says the near-ninety per cent increase in transport funding by the current government was a case in point.

"National's Gerry Brownlee has underlined why the party is incapable of forming a stable government under MMP," said Pete Hodgson.

"The last National government fell apart after it so spectacularly failed to hold things together with a political partner.

"Now National's deputy leader is attacking Labour and the Greens for having successfully worked together to deliver an 89 per cent increase in transport funding compared to that in National's final year."

"Brownlee and the National party are stuck in the past. They are incapable of working with others to make things better for all New Zealanders and can't stand it when others, like the Labour Party and the Greens, show them how it's done."

Compared to 1999/00, spending on roads has grown from $855 million to $1426.7 million, in passenger transport it has gone from $41 million to $251 million. This is the result of Labour working with the Greens on transport.
