Transport minister Pete Hodgson says the current Opposition leader Don Brash has made another mistake when talking about transport funding.

"Hot on the heels of the National Party releasing [four transport polices in one day on Friday](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F23939), Dr Brash was on the radio this morning understating the amount this Labour-led government spends on roads," said Pete Hodgson.

Dr Brash declared the government currently spends just $400 million a year on road construction, but the real amount to be spent on roads this year is $1.352 billion.

"Its hard to fathom how the ex-governor of the reserve bank could make such an elemental mistake with his arithmetic," said Pete Hodgson.

"It's not as if he can't get hold of the numbers, after all [Land Transport New Zealand](http://www.ltsa.govt.nz/index.html) had a copy of its plans sent to him and the document is also [available on the internet](http://www.ltsa.govt.nz/funding/nltp/publications.html). All he had to do was turn to page 27 and read from the table. How difficult can it be?"
