Around 300 small schools with no computer network infrastructure will be able to join the online world thanks to $11 million of government funding to help them build new computer networks, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

“’Being connected’ is fundamental to learning in the 21st century,” said Trevor Mallard. "Our vision for New Zealand is that all schools can benefit from information and communication technologies wherever they are located. This project is about reducing the wide variation between schools and bringing school networks up to [Ministry of Education network standards](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/index.cfm?layout=document&documentid=9680&data=l).

“A survey of schools conducted in 2004 revealed that small schools face disproportionate costs in building computer networks. These small schools are therefore much more likely than larger schools to have no network infrastructures.

“This initiative will help teachers and students in small schools access a wider range of resources, such as digital learning and other rich multi-media materials that help students learn. These resources are increasingly available through websites such as the Ministry of Education’s [Te Kete Ipurangi](http://www.tki.org.nz/).

“Schools can also expect significant productivity gains from using reliable and fast networks. There will also be administrative efficiencies from being able to use on-line student management systems and improved learning outcomes from access to Ministry of Education assessment tools such as [asTTle (Assessment Tools for Teaching and Learning)](http://www.tki.org.nz/r/asttle/).”

The proposed network upgrades complement the recently completed [Project Probe](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/index.cfm?layout=document&documentid=7328&data=l), which has brought broadband capability to hundreds of small schools across New Zealand. This, in conjunction with the rollout of thousands of [teacher laptops](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/index.cfm?layout=document&documentid=8568&indexid=6919&indexparentid=1024), has increased the need for well designed network infrastructures in schools.

The Ministry of Education will partially fund schools to upgrade their networks. Financial assistance will be made available to schools at a 4:1 contribution for schools with roll sizes less than 77 students, and at a 3:1 contribution for schools with roll sizes between 77 and 187 students. Trevor Mallard said that funding to provide assistance to more schools would be considered in the future.

Torque IP, a specialist division of [Connector Systems Limited](http://www.connectorsystems.co.nz/WebBrowseProd/Browse1.jsp), has been selected as the prime contractor to install cabling, switching and a server, aimed specifically at meeting the needs of small schools.
