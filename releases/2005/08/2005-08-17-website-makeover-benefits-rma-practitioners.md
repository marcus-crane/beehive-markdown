A major revamp of the popular Quality Planning website was launched today by Environment Minister Marian Hobbs.

The website [www.qualityplanning.org.nz](http://www.qualityplanning.org.nz/) provides a fast, one-stop shop for people who work with the [Resource Management Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=395573687&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7BF82ABA07%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC).

“New features will help users better navigate the site and go directly to guidance material on all aspects of RMA practice, from plan preparation and consents, to monitoring and enforcement,” Marian Hobbs said.

“Users now have very fast access to supporting information such as council contacts, RMA enforcement guides, plan status information and an extensive library of articles.

“The use of the Quality Planning website has increased from a thousand hits a month when it was launched four years ago to more than 300,000 a month now; and this upgrade reflects the government’s on-going commitment toward continuous improvement in implementing the RMA.”

Also unveiled at the launch was a major RMA enforcement resource providing key practical guidance templates on all common enforcement mechanisms and case law examples available under the RMA.

Quality Planning is a key tool for the [Ministry for the Environment](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/) and its partners in improving RMA practice. The original website was [launched in August 2001](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F11566).

The new website complements the government’s other RMA initiatives including a major amendment to the Act that came into effect on 10 August, extra resourcing for the [Environment Court](http://www.courts.govt.nz/environment/index.html), a programme of national policy statements and environmental standards, and training workshops for RMA decision makers and council staff.

The website is run by the Ministry for the Environment in partnership with the New Zealand Planning Institute, New Zealand Institute of Surveyors, Local Government New Zealand, and the Resource Management Law Association.
