Communications Minister David Cunliffe today congratulated the Telecommunications Carriers Forum (TCF) on the signing of its milestone SMS Anti-Spam Code.

The Code, signed today at the first TCF Board meeting for 2005, addresses the issue of unsolicited text and binary messages between message services.

"As most of us are aware, the use of SMS and other message services is expanding in New Zealand. Like other Spam, unsolicited, large-scale advertising and marketing via message services is annoying and intrusive.

"By establishing this Code the TCF has recognised the need for additional regulatory support to protect SMS users from such unsolicited messages," Mr Cunliffe said.

"This Code is a useful step forward and should complement other anti-Spam legislation to be introduced this year."

The SMS Anti-Spam Code is voluntary, but today's signing confirms support and commitment to the Code by all of the members of the Forum covering all the key telecommunications providers, Mr Cunliffe said.
