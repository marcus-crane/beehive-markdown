Police Minister George Hawkins today issued an invitation to all members of the public who have concerns and complaints about specific emergency 111 issues to contact the Police Commissioner.

"It is clear that the recent focus on the 111 system has revealed a number of incidents which warrant further scrutiny. The best way for this to happen is for people to put in a written description of what they believe happened to the Commissioner personally.

I am confident the Commissioner will refer complaints to the independent Communications Centre Review Panel where the incidents disclose less than satisfactory performance on the part of the police. I anticipate they will be dealt with promptly" concluded the Minister.

The Police Commissioner's contact details are:

P O Box 3017  
WELLINGTON

Ph (04) 474 9499  
Fax (04) 498 7400
