The latest version of a ground-breaking teaching and assessment tool designed to provide vital information about students’ reading, writing and mathematics skills was launched today by Associate Education Minister David Benson-Pope.

“Version 4 of the Assessment for Teaching and Learning tool (asTTle) is a significant component of the government’s drive to lift education standards and the quality of education in our schools, in particular lifting achievement in literacy and numeracy,” David Benson-Pope said.

“AsTTle beats anything else available because it shows what a student has learned. It also compares their results to the rest of the class and the rest of the country so that goals for the next stage of learning can be set.

“The government has committed $9 million to the development of asTTle. Since its launch in 2001, more than 95 per cent of primary schools and 25 per cent of secondary schools have requested asTTle.

“Version 4 of asTTle is even more powerful as it includes assessment for reading and writing for secondary schools, has a multi-user function so schools can network asTTle and share data across the school, integrates with existing school data management systems, and reports on a number of tests in the same subject.

“On top of this, version 4 is even more user-friendly with data only having to be entered into the programme once. The developers have listened to the advice and feedback from teachers who have been using the innovative asTTle and have improved this new version accordingly.

“Another feature coinciding with Version 4 is the redevelopment of the asTTle website. Teachers can now order asTTle online. Interactive tutorials will assist them to install and use it.

Mr Benson-Pope launched Version 4 of asTTle at Pakuranga College in Auckland.
