The government today released Building a Strong and Sustainable Public Broadcasting Environment for New Zealand, a framework to guide the future of broadcasting in New Zealand.

"The government's current work programme in broadcasting has now largely been completed. This document sets the scene for the development of a new programme of broadcasting work for the next six years," Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey said.

"The government intends to work with broadcasters to develop new policies and to ensure we continue to strengthen public broadcasting for the benefit of all New Zealanders."

The framework is underpinned by a set of goals aimed at ensuring that broadcasting policies:  
·reflect public broadcasting principles  
·strengthen public broadcasting as a key element in the broadcasting “mixed economy”  
·maintain a healthy private broadcasting and production sector  
·provide a foundation for community and regional broadcasting

The document outlines six priorities to guide public broadcasting over the next six years. These priorities are:

·achieving adequacy and certainty of public funding for broadcasting  
·strengthening public broadcasting  
·facilitating the succesful development of digital broadcasting services  
·enhancing regional and community broadcasting  
·enhancing independence and responsibility in broadcasting  
·enhancing the incentives for producing higher-quality content and schedules

Each priority contains a range of proposals to be investigated as the programme unfolds over the next six years.

The document was developed in consultation with public broadcasters as part of a process begun in 2003 with the release of Broadcasting in New Zealand: A 2003 Stock-take and the conference A New Future for Public Broadcasting.
