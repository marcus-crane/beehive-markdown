Associate Education Minister David Benson-Pope has asked the New Zealand Qualifications Authority for a report on 2004 scholarship results.

Mr Benson-Pope says he is aware that concerns have been raised by some school principals about the results achieved by students.

He says NZQA has also made him aware of an early trend in the interim results data that the number of scholarships achieved is lower than in previous years.

"I have asked NZQA to undertake a full analysis of the 2004 results and to prepare a report for the Government," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"This analysis is to be given priority. If their report identifies an issue then I will take action to resolve it."

Mr Benson-Pope says he expected the NZQA report would be prepared expeditiously and he assured candidates that final scholarship results will be published in April, as in previous years.
