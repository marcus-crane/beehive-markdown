There have been an average of 152 more New Zealanders in employment every day since the Labour-led government has been in office, Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

The latest Household Labour Force Survey revealed that employment increased by 87,000 last year, taking the total increase in employment since the Labour-led government took office to 264,000.

"New Zealanders can be proud that we now have the lowest unemployment rate in the OECD," Steve Maharey said.

"With record low unemployment, we now need to focus on raising productivity and addressing skill shortages. We are looking at all relevant policies - including industry partnerships, support for working parents and the benefit system - to see how we can best move ahead.

"Next week I will be announcing the direction of further reforms to the benefit system, which will focus on helping even more New Zealanders into jobs."
