6 February 2005Media Statement  
Foreshore and seabed policy strikes right balance

Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen today released polling data showing a clear majority of all New Zealanders and a plurality of Maori believe the Foreshore and Seabed Act is fair.

The Act removes the possibility of gaining customary title but provides that any group which would have been able to demonstrate such a claim is entitled to redress and that the government has a duty to negotiate that in good faith.

“The UMR Research result, based on a representative sample of 750 people, shows 56 per cent consider the legislation strikes a balance between the rights of Maori and those of the general population,” Dr Cullen said.

“Among Maori this was also the most commonly held view with 45 percent support,” he said although adding that the Maori sub-sample was very small comprising only 65 people.

Dr Cullen quoted the poll in a Waitangi Day speech on the meaning of the Treaty.

He said the Treaty was a living document which provided an orderly framework for the settlement of historical grievances and the resolution of ongoing debates about the rights of Maori as the original inhabitants and owners of the land.

People worried that the grievance settlement process would go on forever. It would not but it would take some years yet as settlements were complex and to rush them was to risk getting them wrong.

“What is reasonable is to put a time limit on the lodging of claims so that people can see there is an end point,” he said.
