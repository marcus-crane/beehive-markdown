The government and gold mining company, OceanaGold, have successfully concluded negotiations for a Negotiated Greenhouse Agreement (NGA).

Through NGAs, businesses whose international competitiveness might otherwise be at risk from an emissions charge agree to move to world's best practice in greenhouse gas emissions management in return for relief from the charge. Companies that exceed their targets can earn tradable emissions units.

"NGAs deliver a triple benefit. They help businesses become more competitive, they typically result in reduced energy consumption (and lower bills) and cut emissions. They are an excellent example of how business and government can work constructively together for mutual benefit," said, Convenor of the Ministerial Group on Climate Change, Pete Hodgson. "The prospect of NGA companies earning tradable emissions units is yet another direct business benefit of New Zealand's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol."

"We are pleased to have finalised this agreement with the government. The  
NGA is important for OceanaGold because we are investing heavily in our  
business and an NGA mitigates some of the risk in that investment." commented  
the Chairman of OceanaGold, Kerry McDonald.

The Government has also signed an NGA with the New Zealand Refining Company, and is in negotiations with ACI Glass Packaging, Carter Holt Harvey, Fletcher Building Limited, New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Limited, Newmont Waihi, Norske Skog Tasman and Silicon Metal Industries Limited.
