"Information I have received today about allegations made in Parliament by Maori Party Member Tariana Turia disclose a sitution which I find to be completely unacceptable," the Minister of Police George Hawkins said tonight.

"There is no excuse for a Police staff member to suggest to a victim of an alleged sexual assault that they should make their own way to a police station.

"I have conveyed this view to the Commissioner of Police and expect that he will take the appropriate action and report back to me so I can pass on the report to Mrs Turia," concluded the Minister.
