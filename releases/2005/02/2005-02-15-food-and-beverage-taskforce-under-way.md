"A high performing, innovative food and beverage sector is fundamental to achieving higher sustainable living standards for all New Zealanders," Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton told the inaugural meeting of the Food and Beverage Sector Taskforce in Wellington today.

The largely private sector, 20 member taskforce is co-chaired by Jim Anderton and managing director of Griffin’s Foods Tony Nowell.

"The Food and Beverage sector is the most economically significant sector in New Zealand's economy and therefore forms a key component of the Government’s strategy for growth through innovation," Jim Anderton said.

"While the sector has shown consistently high levels of growth and innovation over the last decade, there are still significant opportunities as well as challenges to address.

“The taskforce is as a unique opportunity for government and industry to work together on those challenges to identify how the food and beverage sector can achieve its full potential.

“I expect the taskforce’s work to include fundamental strategy work to build on our understanding about markets, access, opportunities and growth, as well as addressing such things as skill and labour shortages, and research and development spending.”

“The sector has been through a significant transformation over the past 10 to 15 years based on innovation, ingenuity, new product development and smarter marketing. The sector has done well. I know it can do even better,” Jim Anderton said.

**Background information**

The taskforce (list of members attached) is the first to be appointed under the government’s new approach to sector engagement (see [Sector Strategy paper](http://www.med.govt.nz/irdev/econ_dev/growth-innovation/fab/index.html)

It follows partnerships with other industries, including textiles and apparel, wood processing, information and communication technology, biotechnology, design and screen production, all established to meet the challenges of business growth and to provide developmental assistance to sectors.

The food and beverage sector’s total exports were nearly $14 billion in the year ending March 2004. On the domestic front, sales of non-alcoholic beverages and food were around $9 billion in 2001, while alcoholic beverages contributed a further $1.2 billion.

Across the board, the industry employs about 13 per cent of the total workforce and 63,000 people in manufacturing alone.
