The Legislation Advisory Committee was established in 1986 to improve the technical quality of law making. Its primary roles are to advise government agencies on the drafting of legislation and build public sector awareness of legislative guidelines.

"Many of the Legislation Advisory Committee nine members have commitments precluding them from attending all committee meetings," Margaret Wilson said. "These new appointments will allow for a higher level of representation when some members cannot attend meetings and enhance the committee's breadth of experience."
