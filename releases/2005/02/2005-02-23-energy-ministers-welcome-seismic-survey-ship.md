Energy Minister Trevor Mallard and Associate Energy Minister Harry Duynhoven today welcomed the arrival of the vessel "Pacific Titan" to New Zealand - the ship which is about to start the first ever government-funded seismic survey off the North Island’s East Coast.

"We’ve made remarkable progress to have the Pacific Titan in New Zealand waters only four months after Cabinet approved the concept of funding seismic data acquisition to promote petroleum exploration," Trevor Mallard said.

"We have already acquired data for the Northland and Outer Taranaki basins from private organisations, but commissioning this survey will create new data for one of our key frontier basins, and play an important role in attracting investors here."

The survey is the first of its kind under the $15 million fund established by the government last year as part of a package of incentives to lift exploration in New Zealand. The ministers today visited the ship, currently berthed in Wellington and due to sail to the East Coast tonight.

"New ideas are needed and establishing this fund demonstrates our government's commitment to take an innovative and fresh approach - to ensure additional reserves are found to replace Maui," Trevor Mallard said.

"This data - which will be supplied free - is being acquired to stimulate exploration in New Zealand - whether it is from existing domestic explorers or new companies from overseas.

"Equally industry - which after all has a vested interest in exploration - also has a role to play here and our government also welcomes input and suggestions from the sector."

Associate Energy Minister Harry Duynhoven said the seismic survey project not only had the potential to help address the national problem of dwindling gas reserves, but could also be hugely beneficial to the East Coast regional economy.

"Regional development in Taranaki has benefited from the petroleum industry over several decades and, while it is too early to predict the outcome here, a major find in the East Coast could be a great boost for the region" said Mr Duynhoven.

Mr Duynhoven said that the survey would be followed by other surveys, but the basins had yet to be decided.

"There will be further initiatives over the next few years to promote New Zealand as a petroleum destination that was both safe and highly prospective for new explorers."

The vessel will be used by Norwegian company, Multiwave Geophysical to conduct the survey.

It will commence surveying on 25 February. The survey will cover 100,000 sq. km off the East Coast, from Wairarapa to Bay of Plenty, and is expected to take four to six weeks, with the data expected to be released in July 2005.
