Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey today urged the sporting community to take the lead in encouraging responsible, moderate drinking by New Zealanders.

Speaking at "Sport and Alcohol: Understanding the Mix" in Palmerston North, Steve Maharey said that New Zealand's drinking culture – especially the one often promoted by advertisers and broadcasters – has a close relationship with sport and athletes.

"As Broadcasting Minister, I'm constantly under pressure to review the rules relating to alcohol advertising on television and radio," Steve Maharey said. "I've made it clear that I believe the industry should police itself as much as possible, but pressure will remain if we don't continue to see progress towards a culture where alcohol is not abused.

"Advertisers often make use of sport to sell alcohol. On one hand, this makes sense – celebrating a win or coming together with friends after a loss usually means a few beers after the game. It is part of our sporting tradition.

"At the same time sport is about health. Athletes who are serious about winning know that they have to use alcohol responsibly or not at all.

"I hope that the sporting community can combine these two roles and take a lead in encouraging a drinking culture of responsibility and moderation. Athletes play a big part in New Zealand society and they do a lot of positive work in their communities.

"The government is working hard to combat alcohol abuse with a number of initiatives including the Culture Change programme. Help from the sporting world could go a long way to promoting a positive message on alcohol use in New Zealand."
