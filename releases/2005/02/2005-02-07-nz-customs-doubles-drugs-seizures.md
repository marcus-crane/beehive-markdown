Customs Minister Rick Barker today revealed that the annual Customs drug seizure statistics for the 2004 calendar year show a steep rise in seizure of pure methamphetamine (ICE), and the precursors that are used to make pure methamphetamine, or "P".

In conjunction with Police, Customs made 53 significant drug seizures, compared with 28 intercepts in 2003. Rick Barker says the Customs teamwork is top class and is really making a dent in what gets across our border.

"The staggering increase in the amount of crystal methamphetamine seized - in excess of 17.5 kilos in 2004, up from 748g in 2003 - is evidence that this life wrecking drug is in demand in New Zealand," said Rick Barker.

"In addition to these significant operations, the flow of precursors used in the manufacture of "P" continues, with double the amount of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine seized, which again confirms, sadly, the market for methamphetamine. "

In 2004 Customs seized 1,857,692 capsules of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, in 525 separate incidents.

The major seizures for 2004 total: 17.5 kgs of Crystal Methamphetamine, 734g of Amphetamine, 18.4kg of Cocaine, 197.6g of Heroin, 44.2l of GBL, 35,775 tablets of MDMA (ecstasy), 200 tickets of LSD.

"Customs will be relentless in their effort to stop illegal drugs coming across our border and proactive Drug Enforcement Team operations will be in full force this year.

" Last year the government elevated ephedrine and pseudoephedrine to a Class C controlled drug status to provide Police and Customs with more powers to respond. Those importing these substances can face a jail term of up to seven years.

" The Misuse of Drugs Amendment bill, currently before the Heath Select Committee, will further enhance Customs and Police to powers.

" Customs and Police methods are getting more sophisticated and communications networks across borders, tracking transnational crime syndicates, are proving effective in catching traffickers," he said.
