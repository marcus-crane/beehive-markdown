National's Finance Spokesman, John Key, last night led the National party in voting against more than $2 billion in transport funding for the regions.

National's vote against this $2 billion boost to land transport funding comes just one week after Transit published its draft state highway plan. The plan details spending priorities in every region. Many projects on the plan have been brought forward in anticipation of the $2 billion in regional funding being made available.

Key signalled National's no money for transport policy in January when he said "this is not the time to be ramping up government spending."

"National is stating loud and clear that it will not invest in making our roads safer, do anything to reduce congestion, to help business or to make things better for everybody that relies on their car, the bus or the train to get to work," said Transport Minister, Pete Hodgson.

"This government thinks that fixing our transport system is important. That's why its backing it with the largest land transport spending package ever, $18.9 billion over ten years.

"This government is investing in improving things for all New Zealanders. But in transport, as in so many other areas, all National wants to do is slash spending that will benefit all New Zealanders."

The Customs and Excise (Motor Spirits) Amendment Bill had its second reading last night. The Bill will enable around $2 billion to be raised all of which will be diverted into the National Land Transport Fund.

National and Act voted against it.
