The new cycle bridge at Pukerua Bay is great example of how local communities can make it easier for people to get active, Sport and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard said at the official opening of the bridge today.

The bridge completes Ara Harakeke (The Flax Pathway) which provides a link for cyclists and pedestrians between Plimmerton and Pukerua Bay.

"I'm a keen cyclist myself - and a cycle bridge like this is a good incentive to get active and do your thirty minutes of Push Play a day as it's a safe and scenic environment.

"And wearing my new hat as Energy Minister, anything we can do to encourage alternative forms of transport to oil-burning vehicles has to be a good thing. Ara Harakeke is a great asset to the local community.

"I was amazed to hear that since the Pathway was first established just two years ago, there has been a 400 per cent increase in foot and cycle traffic in the area. People had to drive before, now they’re making the most of the area and making physical activity part of their daily lives by walking or cycling to work.

"We need more purpose-built areas like this throughout the country to encourage people to get out there, get moving and enjoy their local environment with family and friends.

Trevor Mallard said that the completion of the bridge was timely given that National Bike Wise Week starts on Saturday 12 February.

"This pathway is a real gem. I hope it will inspire locals to get out there and get active for many generations to come," he said.

The first stage of the path was completed in 2002. In 2004, the project received two national awards: Best Cycle Facility Project at the New Zealand Cycling Conference and a bronze award for Sustainable Design from the New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects.

The bridge is 10 metres high and 45 metres long and extends over the railway cutting. It is located 150 metres from the corner of Teihana Road West and State Highway One, Pukerua Bay.
