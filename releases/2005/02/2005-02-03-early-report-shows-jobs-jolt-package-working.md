Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey says an early evaluation of the government's Jobs Jolt package shows it is on track and achieving its goal of getting more people into work.

Jobs Jolt was introduced in 2003 to accelerate people into jobs. The package includes programmes to help people get off benefits and into employment, as well as specific changes to the benefit system to ensure beneficiaries capable of work are active in their search for employment.

The early report, which provides an overview of the performance of the Jobs Jolt package for the 2003/04 financial year, showed that the rate at which participants were exiting benefits was higher than forecast.

"There has been a significant increase in people moving from benefits to jobs over the period in which Jobs Jolt has been operating," Steve Maharey said. "This early evaluation shows that 12 out of the 13 Jobs Jolt initiatives are either performing well or delivering above expectations."

Programmes which have delivered above expectations include:

·The Jobs Partnership with Industry initiative, which saw 58% of participants move into a job in the first year as compared with a forecast of 30%  
·The Mobile Employment Service, which saw 44% of people move into jobs over the year, compared with a forecast of 22%

"A report due shortly will provide further analysis of the early impact of the package. It will also include recommendations on what changes are needed to the package given the much higher than expected fall in unemployment from 4.7% to 3.8% over the period June 2003 to September 2004," Steve Maharey said.

"The early evaluation shows that one of the projects, which delivers IT training to long-term unemployed in three disadvantaged communities, has not delivered as well as expected. I have asked for further advice on this programme as part of the next report."
