Police Minister George Hawkins has suggested to Police it would be helpful to the public if a media statement was issued explaining progress in the investigation into the alleged firearms offences by Tuhoe activist Tame Iti.

"It is clear there is considerable public interest in this matter.

"The Police, as a matter of course, issue statements to the news media about the status of current investigations. It would be helpful if the Police in charge of the matter took these usual steps today.
