Fisheries Minister David Benson-Pope is calling for nominations of recreational fishers to form an advisory panel that will provide him with advice on issues facing the recreational fishing sector.

Mr Benson-Pope announced in January two new initiatives to give recreational fishers a greater voice in fisheries decision-making. These were the creation of regional recreational fishing forums and the other was the establishment of a Ministerial Advisory Panel.

Mr Benson-Pope says advertisements will appear in national newspapers this weekend asking for nominations for the Ministerial Advisory Panel.

The Minister is calling for up to six fishers from around the country to advise him on recreational fishing. Mr Benson-Pope says he recognises the importance of recreational fishing to New Zealand society.

"The creation of an expert panel will allow me to receive fishers' perspectives on the strategic issues confronting the recreational sector," he said. "The Government is committed to all fisheries stakeholders having opportunities to participate in fisheries management processes."

Panel members will be appointed by the Minister and meet up to four times a year.

Anyone interested in being on the Recreational Advisory Panel should provide their name, postal address and an email address or contact phone number to:  
The Administrator  
National Recreational Advisory Panel  
Ministry of Fisheries  
PO Box 1020  
Wellington

The Ministry of Fisheries will provide further details of the intended operation of the panel, and information required from applicants. Nominations will close on 14 March, with the Minister saying it is his intention to name panel members shortly after.
