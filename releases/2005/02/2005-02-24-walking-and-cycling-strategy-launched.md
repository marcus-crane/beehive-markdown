Efforts to encourage more New Zealanders to walk and cycle received a double boost today with the publication of the first national [walking and cycling strategy](http://www.transport.govt.nz/business/land/getting-there/index.php) and the announcement of $1.15 million for national walking and cycling initiatives in addition to that provided through the National Land Transport Fund (NLTF).

The strategy, Getting there – on foot, by cycle, sets out to make walking and cycling more accessible, safe and popular. The $1.15 million (excluding GST) will cover the promotion of walking and cycling. The money, to be administered by the [Health Sponsorship Council](http://www.healthsponsorship.co.nz/), will be split across an expansion of the existing [Bike Wise](http://www.bikewise.co.nz/) programme and a new set of walking initiatives over the 2005/06 financial year.

The government acknowledges the valuable contribution of the Green party in the development of the strategy.

In the past three years 65 significant walking and cycling infrastructure projects have received, or are about to receive, funding. NLTF funding for walking and cycling projects is on track to reach $5 million in the current financial year. Over the next ten years, $65 million has been budgeted from the NLTF for walking and cycling projects.

"Walking and cycling offer many advantages as transport choices," says Transport Minister, Pete Hodgson. "Through this strategy our goal is to help local transport planners think about the role walking and cycling can play in a better integrated transport network.

"Walking school bus programmes, improving pedestrian access to bus and train stations, providing secure cycle parking facilities, dedicated cycling lanes or improving street lighting can all make walking and cycling more accessible and safer options for the travelling public. This strategy will help local communities and councils do so."
