Associate Education Minister David Benson-Pope has dissolved the Board of Trustees of Glenfield College and has directed the Secretary of Education to appoint a commissioner to replace the board.

The Minister has the authority to do this under s78N (1) of the Education Act 1989.

The commissioner is Gail Thomson, an education consultant and an experienced secondary school principal. She has previously been a limited statutory manager at Cambridge High School and continues to work with the commissioner in that school.

“In making this decision I have taken into account advice from the Ministry of Education and the findings of a special review undertaken late last year by the Education Review Office. The ERO review followed complaints by staff and board members about work-place safety and board procedures,” David Benson-Pope said.

"The Ministry of Education has advised me that there are reasonable grounds to believe there is a risk to the operation of the school should the existing board remain.

“I want to reassure both students and parents that the quality of education will not be impaired by this decision. I want to see governance at Glenfield College strongly focussed on the College’s educational function and on addressing the findings of the ERO special review report.”
