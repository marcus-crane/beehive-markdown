Figures released today by the Radio Broadcasters Association show that  
New Zealand music accounted for 18.6% of music played on commercial radio in 2004, an increase of 4.6% from 2003.

"This is a fantastic result for the New Zealand music industry which demonstrates the huge success of the voluntary quota system," Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey said.

Airplay of New Zealand music has nearly doubled since March 2002 when the government and the Radio Broadcasters Association launched a Code of Practice for New Zealand Music content, agreeing to a target of 20% of local music by the year 2006.

"This year's results exceed the initial target of 16% and are a huge jump from 1995 when New Zealand music accounted for less than 2% of music played on commercial radio," Steve Maharey said.

“Radio broadcasters deserve to be congratulated for their commitment to growing New Zealand music and for their willingness to work together to achieve this result.

"New Zealand music enjoys10 times more airplay than it did a decade ago. This result demonstrates what we've known all along – that New Zealanders want to tune in to more of their own music."

“The obvious success of this initiative is great news for the New Zealand music industry which continues to go from strength to strength. At one stage last year Kiwi singles accounted for 6 of the top 10, a new record for New Zealand music.

"I am optimistic we will achieve the target of 20% by 2006."
