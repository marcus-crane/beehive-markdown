Moves by Auckland City Council to foster the growth of affordable housing were welcomed today by Housing Minister Steve Maharey.

"I am delighted that the Auckland City Council has firmed up its commitment to addressing Auckland's pressing housing issues," Steve Maharey said.

"The Council's approach of working with private and public sector developers is a good fit with the government's current initiatives to address barriers to affordable housing in Auckland.

"For example, the government's Housing Innovation Fund provides more affordable housing for low to moderate income households by empowering community organisations to buy, build or modify rental accommodation and to develop affordable home ownership opportunities.

"Six community based organisations and one local authority have already received loans and grants totalling $6.12 million. In Central Auckland alone we have provided loans to the value of $1.7 million and grants of $300,000. Other grants and loans are in the pipeline.

“I am looking forward to a productive partnership with the Council as we work to solve the acute shortage of affordable housing in the city.”
