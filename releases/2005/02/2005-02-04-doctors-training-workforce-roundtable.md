Objective

The Roundtable is established by the Minister of Health to provide her with agreed solutions to short-term issues relating to the work and professional development of doctors in training. The prime purpose is to facilitate the training of doctors, in the numbers and of the type required, who are highly motivated, well prepared and committed to practice in New Zealand.

Issues

The Roundtable will address the following issues:  
·sustainability of the current preparation of medical practitioners  
·recruitment and retention  
·deployment  
·career guidance and vocational training  
·incentives and career development  
·a supportive workplace environment.

In addressing these issues the Roundtable will consider:  
·the central focus on patient care;  
·safety and quality of patient care;  
·effectiveness and efficiency in the use of human resources;  
·objectives for training and links to service delivery;  
·hours of work, work/life balance, and vocational guidance;  
·communication, team work, service and workforce design and staffing arrangements;  
·the designation, accreditation, funding and allocation of training posts; and  
·the use of incentives and other means to facilitate the career development and retention of doctors in training in New Zealand, in both the short and longer term.

The Roundtable may also identify issues that are more appropriately progressed through the work of the Health Workforce Advisory Committee (HWAC) or its Medical Reference Group (MRG).

Membership

The Roundtable will comprise leaders and decision-makers directly involved in medical education and/or the delivery of medical services and include representatives from DHBs, HWAC and the Medical Reference Group, Council of Medical Colleges, Medical Schools, Medical Council, NZMA, New Zealand Medical Students Association and the Ministry of Health.

Working arrangements

The Roundtable is distinct from the structures and processes whereby employers and employees negotiate employment contracts for resident medical officers and specialist staff. The Minister of Health will appoint an independent Chair. The Ministry of Health will provide secretarial and administrative support.
