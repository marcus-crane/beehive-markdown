Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced the appointment of two additional Parliamentary Private Secretaries.

Lianne Dalziel has been appointed as PPS to the Minister of Youth Affairs Steve Maharey, and to the Minister of Ethnic Affairs, Chris Carter.

Russell Fairbrother has been appointed as PPS to the Attorney General, Michael Cullen.

"The Parliamentary Private Secretaries have non-executive positions, and carry no extra remuneration," said Helen Clark.

"Lianne Dalziel and Russell Fairbrother will use their skills and expertise to support their ministers' portfolio and administrative work.

"Ministers can not delegate statutory functions or powers to their PPS, and no additional funding is required for the Parliamentary Private Secretaries to carry out their duties," Helen Clark said.

The appointments take to five the number of Parliamentary Private Secretaries.

In August 2002 Tim Barnett was appointed as PPS to the Minister of Justice on human rights issues, and to the Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector. Nanaia Mahuta was appointed as PPS to the Minister of Education and the Minister of Local Government. In August 2003 Luamanuvao Winnie Laban became PPS to the Minister for the Environment and Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs (ODA), and the Minister for Trade Negotiations.
