Prime Minister Helen Clark and Germany’s Foreign Minister, Joschka Fischer, today signed the New Zealand-Germany Film Co-Production Treaty.

Helen Clark said that the Treaty provided formally for New Zealand and Germany to co-operate in film production, and to facilitate co-productions.

“A joint commission will be established, made up of officials and representatives of the film, television and video industries from both countries, to oversee the implementation of the agreement,” Helen Clark said.

“Under the agreement, both countries undertake to treat an approved co-production as a ‘national film’.

“A co-production which qualifies as a ‘national film’ then has access to reciprocal benefits, such as through funding sources like the NZ Film Commission and equivalent sources in Germany.

“It also means that, where applicable, an official co-production will have access to the same distribution incentives and opportunities as national films. This means that New Zealand/German co-productions will qualify as local content in Germany and throughout the European Union.

“A co-production requires at least twenty per cent involvement from both the New Zealand and German parties in the performing, technical, artistic, and creative participation in a film’s production.

“This treaty has the potential to facilitate new projects and employment in the screen production sector.

“*Whale Rider*, although not an official co-production between New Zealand and Germany, was financed from both countries.

“The international success of the film has encouraged us to progress this agreement with the aim of encouraging similar ventures in the future,” Helen Clark said.

To celebrate the signing of the Treaty, the New Zealand Embassy in Germany and the NZ Film Commission are hosting an event on Sunday, 13 February, in Berlin during the city’s film festival.

Kathleen Drumm, head of sales at NZ Film and Gary Hannam, producer of  
Roger Donaldson's new film *The World's Fastest Indian*, starring Anthony Hopkins, will present an exclusive preview of scenes from that movie.
