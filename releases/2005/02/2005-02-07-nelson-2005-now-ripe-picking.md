Associate Minister for Employment and Social Development Rick Barker urges anyone young or old to consider doing some work in the pip-fruit industry.

He says there are plenty of jobs there now and more to come in a few weeks, so people from all around the country could soon get some pay in their pockets while staying in a beautiful New Zealand city.

Tonight, Associate Minister of Agriculture, Damien O'Connor will launch the Seasonal Work Pack for employees and the employer which has IRD forms, Immigration forms, fast track visa information for short term work and information about holiday entitlements and employment relationships.

Rick Barker says this one-stop-shop approach developed following the formation of the industry and government seasonal working group. The information packs are part of a roll out of the Seasonal Worker Strategy which is tailor made for each region to prepare for a smooth season.

" In Nelson a seasonal coordinator works in partnership with Work and Income and industry to manage job applications and then arranges job placement where the seasonal work is," he said.

"The co-ordinator is supported by Work and Income and the Pipfruit industry and has their finger on the pulse to avoid delays in getting people out to the crops and also to be sure the numbers of people called for to do work are actually going to jobs as promised by the orchardists.

" Work and Income are working hard to get those on the unemployment register into jobs. The growers are also beginning proactive measures to attract workers into their industry.

" I also encourage our senior citizens to call 03 907 0239 to find out what work is going, because they can choose to earn some money and still keep their pension if they wish. Many seniors have said to me they like to get outdoors and keep fit and employers report seniors are some of their best workers," he added.
