Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that Australian Prime Minister John Howard will visit New Zealand from 19 to 21 February.

Helen Clark said Mr Howard is visiting for the annual bilateral meeting between the New Zealand and Australian Prime Ministers.

“I look forward to discussing a wide range of issues with Mr Howard, including the regional implications of the Tsunami disaster, developments in counter terrorism, and our ongoing joint efforts to develop good governance and stability in the Pacific,” Helen Clark said.

“Our talks will also cover the Closer Economic Relations treaty and ways in which we are further extending and deepening our two countries’ economic co-operation.

“The government looks forward to welcoming Mr Howard. New Zealand and Australia are close neighbours and longstanding friends, and our relationship is underpinned by common values, shared history, and an ever growing economic partnership,” Helen Clark said.

Mr Howard arrives in Auckland on Saturday evening.

His programme will include weekend engagements in Auckland, including a function with local community and business leaders.

On Monday 21 February Mr Howard will meet with the New Zealand Cabinet, attend a state luncheon at Parliament, and lay a wreath at the National War Memorial.
