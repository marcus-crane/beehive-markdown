Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard says the latest National Bank Regional Trends survey, which recorded 3.8 per cent growth for Auckland in 2004, is something for everyone in the region to be proud of.

The survey showed that every region in the country enjoyed strong economic growth during 2004, ranging from 2.7 per cent in Wellington to a whopping 6.2 per cent in Taranaki. The national average was 3.9 per cent.

"The National Bank survey follows on from last week’s news that New Zealand has the lowest unemployment in the developed world," said Judith Tizard.

"Our drop in unemployment is being matched by a huge surge in job growth – and that is why we are seeing the economic good times continue to roll."

Judith Tizard says that the Labour-led government was fostering the growth, with huge increases in support for industry training and apprenticeships, better access to quality childcare and a strong focus on lifting workplace productivity.

"The modern apprenticeships scheme is very popular and there are over 2000 Modern Apprentices in the Auckland region, with 1242 in Auckland City and 761 in Manukau. They are engaged in all kinds of trades and skills from sports turf making to Aeronautical Engineering to the more traditionally learned trades like building and plumbing."

"We are confident as a government that we will continue to enjoy good growth if we maintain the current mix of polices," said Judith Tizard.
