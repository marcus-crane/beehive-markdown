Building Issues Minister Chris Carter has announced the establishment of a new national diploma in building controls.

The diploma has been initiated by the Department of Building and Housing and will be provided by the Wellington Institute of Technology (WelTec). It will likely be a two-year course available from 2006.

“The work of building inspectors is crucial. Every homeowner and office worker lives or works in buildings that are the legacy of their decisions," Mr Carter said.

"Until now there has been no national qualification covering the full range of skills and knowledge that building inspectors need. It is time that changed.

"The government's aim is to ensure an effective housing and building sector, with competent practitioners undertaking all critical work. More formal education of building inspectors will provide further assurance to the public that buildings will be designed and built right first time."

Mr Carter said the diploma would also provide much needed recognition of building inspectors as a distinct profession.

"We face a growing shortage of building inspectors, and this diploma should help solve that problem in future by attracting new and younger people into the industry through a clear and explicit training path.

“I congratulate the Department of Building and Housing and Wellington Institute of Technology for this excellent initiative and I look forward to following the progress of building inspectors undertaking the diploma,” Mr Carter said.

The diploma's development is part of a wider education and training strategy for building inspectors, which includes a package of initiatives to help those already working in the sector assess their skills and knowledge against the national qualifications for the new diploma. Infratrain has been contracted to consult with the building controls sector to develop and register the national qualifications.
