National's new welfare spokesperson Judith Collins got off to a bad start this morning when she denied having suggested that beneficiaries "sit around all day watching Sky TV, living off the taxpayer, letting their children run riot and getting stoned", Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

The comment was made by Ms Collins during a speech to the Clevedon Lions club in 2002.

"Ms Collins also says that she knows of particular instances where this is happening. If this is true then she should notify Work and Income immediately so these people can be contacted and dealt with," Steve Maharey said.

"Judith Collins should admit she is wrong and develop a more positive approach to the many New Zealand families who find themselves needing income support for a period of time.

"If she can't remember making the comment then she should visit her website www.judithcollins.co.nz where the full text of the speech is available."
