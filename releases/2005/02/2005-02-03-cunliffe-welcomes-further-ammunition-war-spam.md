Communications Minister David Cunliffe has welcomed further ammunition in the war on Spam after the establishment of a joint working party to look at reducing email Spam in New Zealand.

The Direct Marketing Association (DMA), Internet NZ (INZ) and Telecommunications Carriers' Forum (TCF) announced today they had formed a joint working party tasked with developing an industry Code of Practice to deal with the increasing problem of email Spam.

"This is further good news in the war on Spam," he said.

"Yesterday we had the signing of the SMS Anti-Spam Code and today we see the establishment of an email Spam working party working towards a Code of Practice which will hopefully limit Spam on our computers."

Mr Cunliffe said the Code of Practice would sit alongside legislation on spam he plans to introduce this year.

"The Ministry of Economic Development is currently working on legislation so 2005 is shaping up as a good year to hit Spammers where it hurts," he said.

Mr Cunliffe said INZ were an excellent choice as convenors of the working party given their expertise in Information and Communications Technology, marketing and policy development. He has directed officials to liaise closely with the working party to ensure alignment of industry efforts with draft legislation.

"Spam is a lose-lose for business, the community and Government. This is a positive step to work together on win-win solutions," Mr Cunliffe said.
