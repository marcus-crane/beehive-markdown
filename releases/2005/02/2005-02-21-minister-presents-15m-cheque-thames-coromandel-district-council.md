Civil Defence Minister George Hawkins today presented a cheque for $1,580,000 to support an integrated flood management plan for the Thames Coast. The cheque covers $690,000 for purchase and removal of 25 properties on the Thames Coast and $890,000 for flood engineering works.

The Thames Coast has experienced five major flood events since 1981, including the January 2002 storm, the June 2002 'weather bomb', and the Easter 2003 floods.

The steep and hilly catchments of the west coast of the Coromandel Peninsula have high annual rainfall, much of which falls as intense downpours. Along the Thames Coast, a number of small urban centres are on the narrow coastal plains at the bottom of the catchments. These communities are very vulnerable to flooding during periods of heavy rain. Flash floods often occur with little warning.

Mr Hawkins said a range of factors - including steep and hilly terrain, high and intense rainfall, the occurrence of flash floods and the poor condition of vegetation and catchments due to pests - compounded problems in the area.

"Environment Waikato and the Thames Coromandel District Council integrated flood plan is supported in critical areas by central government. These include state highway bridge upgrades, flood protection works and house removals, and pest management measures. Together, local and central government can reduce the risk to life in this particularly vulnerable area," Mr Hawkins said.
