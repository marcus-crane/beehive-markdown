New Zealand has ratified the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, which regulates international trade in certain types of Genetically Modified Organisms known as "Living Modified Organisms" or LMOs, Environment Minister Marian Hobbs said today.

New Zealand's ratification means 114 countries had now ratified the protocol, Marian Hobbs said.

"New Zealand is not currently trading in LMOs, except for research purposes. However, our ratification will ensure we can participate fully in this new multilateral approach to managing the potential risks of LMOs," she said.

New Zealand deposited its instrument of ratification to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety today with the United Nation’s Secretary General in New York. This means the Protocol will enter into force for New Zealand on 25 May.

"Ratification allows us to ensure the best interests of New Zealand and other agricultural exporting nations are taken into account in the development of the Protocol," Marian Hobbs said. "It means we have an inside track in helping determine international practice for governing trade in these products, and that we have an active voice in the future development of the protocol."

New Zealand will participate as a full member, with voting rights, at the next meeting of parties to the protocol in May 2005.

The decision to ratify was taken after an extensive public consultation in mid 2004. An Order in Council under the Imports and Exports (Restrictions) Act 1988 will ensure New Zealand can comply with the requirements of the Protocol.

"New Zealand already had rigorous controls in place covering importation of LMOs. The Order in Council addresses a number of requirements in the Protocol in respect of exporters," Marian Hobbs said.
