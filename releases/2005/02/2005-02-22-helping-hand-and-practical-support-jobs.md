Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment Rick Barker is today meeting staff running the Work Wise, Reach programme in Hamilton and the Mental Health Service Employment Strategy Pilot at Waikato Hospital.

He says these programmes are providing practical, hands on help to people with greater personal challenges who want jobs, but need a structure and solid support to get them on their way.

"I am very impressed with the Reach Programme, they have 98 new participants this year and have placed 64 into employment. These are people who have been on an invalids benefit," he said

"Jacqui Graham and Warren Elwin are doing ground breaking work and Work Wise has now expanded to work with people on a sickness benefit. They are finding part or full time jobs for them and creating a field of "supported employment" and this is changing lives.

" For a person to make the leap from not working and not being confident about their job skills and into employment is a gradual one for people who have been unwell.

"These programmes are removing the obstacles to employment by educating potential employers about potential new staff, whilst boosting the skills and confidence of the beneficiaries. It is a recipe for success built in partnership with government, " said Mr Barker.

At Waikato Hospital this afternoon Rick Barker is meeting Work and Income Case Managers who are dedicated to helping people with disabilities or who are mental health clients to improve employment outcomes for them.

" The government wants as many people working as possible. People are happier in work too and we are investing in one on one case management to reach that goal," he added.
