The Minister of Veterans' Affairs, George Hawkins, and the Minister of Defence, Mark Burton, today said they have established a joint working group to further consider issues raised in dialogue with Vietnam veterans and the Royal New Zealand Returned Services Association (RSA) following a recent Health Select Committee report.

The announcement has been welcomed by the National President of the RSA, John Campbell, who will be a member of the group.

In addition the working group will comprise officials from the offices of the two Ministers as well as a representative of the Vietnam veterans.

"Ministers welcome the positive dialogue which has developed since the Government's response to the report of the Health Select Committee inquiry into the use of defoliants during the Vietnam war.

"We are confident the group will enable the work to continue in a positive direction," concluded Ministers Hawkins and Burton.
