New Zealand’s pavilion for the 2005 world expo at Aichi Japan, due to open in a month, has attracted strong sponsorship support of about $2 million dollars in value, Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton said today.

Mr Sutton said he was pleased so many companies had elected to take advantage of the opportunity provided by the country’s participation in the expo to strengthen existing trading links and open new opportunities.

“It’s becoming a NZ Inc. effort. It’s a good example of Government taking a lead and the private sector pitching in to add value to the initiative.”

Mr Sutton said the pavilion would have five “foundation partners”, each investing around $ 300 000. They are Solid Energy, Zespri International, Air New Zealand, Toyota New Zealand, and ANZCO Foods/Itoham Foods Inc.

“Sponsorship partners”, who will invest around $100 000, are Rinnai Corporation, Daiken Industries Ltd. and Wood One Co.

Other sponsors will be Fonterra, Carter Holt Harvey, Snowy Peak, and Interface New Zealand.

Mr Sutton said there were still opportunities for export-focussed firms to take advantage of New Zealand’s participation in the expo.

He said a leveraging project, designed to ensure there was on-going benefit from participation in the Aichi expo, was now in full swing.

Among its initiatives is a series of seminars, designed to identify the “next generation” of exporters to Japan, a study into possible Japan-New Zealand collaboration in bio-technology and a campaign to promote positive perception of New Zealand as a creative, innovative high-tech nation.

The expo, which is expected to attract over 15 million visitors over its six-month life, opens on March 25.
