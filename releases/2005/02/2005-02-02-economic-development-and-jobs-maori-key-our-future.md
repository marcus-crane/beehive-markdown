Last night in a hard hitting speech supporting the Prime Ministers statement to Parliament, MP for Te Tai Tokerau and Associate Minister of Economic Development Dover Samuels said, “That Mâori were cooking with gas and no longer with hangi stones”.

Mr Samuels referred to the upcoming Hui Taumata, focussing on Maori Economic Development and its progress since the first hui called by the Hon Koro Wetere in 1985.

The MP said that the Prime Ministers statement of the upcoming Hui and the need to reassess the progress of Maori in contributing to the nation’s economy, is one that should be supported by all the Party’s in the House.

The Hui Taumata in 1985 clearly set down its objectives for Maori and the government tio work together so that our people can play a constructive and meaningful role in the economic future of our country.

That conference in 1985 clearly recognised the major disparities and the underachievement of Maori across many sectors and 21 years later we witness the Maori nation moving forward and the major indicator of the lowest Maori unemployment rates in a decade is clear evidence of how we have progressed.

There is more we can do. Whilst we have the National Party bleating away over the negative statistics that have haunted Maori over the years, they have no problems in identifying Maori in a negative context, but when the government targets resources to address those disparities and use the word ‘Maori’, the leader of the National Party, Don Brash says it’s special treatment and discriminating against Pakeha.

“I know that our people are fully behind Hui Taumata, and I will work with the government and my people to meet the challenges and create opportunities for the future”, said Dover Samuels.
