An independent adviser will be available to help people have their say on the draft Waitaki Catchment Water Allocation Regional Plan, Environment Minister Marian Hobbs said today.

Yesterday the Waitaki Catchment Water Allocation Board released its draft plan for public comment.

"The community has an important stake in how water in the Waitaki River, and its tributaries, lakes, wetlands and groundwater, will be allocated," Marian Hobbs said. "It is therefore very important locals take part in the plan's development.

"I encourage them to obtain a copy of the plan and consider making a submission. Community input will help ensure the final plan will be the best result for everyone."

An independent resource management professional – Bianca Sullivan from Kingett Mitchell Consultants – has been engaged to provide advice to individuals and community groups on making a submission and how best to put their views on the plan to the Board.

Marian Hobbs said she was pleased the Board had delivered the draft water allocation plan on time.

"I look forward to studying the draft plan and will consider it carefully. Like members of the local community and others with an interest in water allocation issues, the government intends to make a 'whole of government' submission on the plan," Marian Hobbs said.

The independent adviser is being made available following a review of a fund set up in December 2003 to help community groups take part in the Waitaki water allocation process. The Community Participation and Advice Fund has ceased because circumstances have changed – including the passing of special Waitaki legalisation to establish a board to develop the water allocation plan, and the withdrawal of Meridian Energy’s Project Aqua consent applications.

"This will be the first time some in the community have made a submission on a plan," Marian Hobbs said. "They will be able to talk to the adviser about the process, what is required and how to make their submission as effectively as they can.
