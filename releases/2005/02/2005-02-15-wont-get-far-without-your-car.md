Minister for Courts Rick Barker today said to people owing fines to make a payment now, or risk having their car taken by the courts to pay what's owed.

The Ministry of Justice today began their annual collections campaign called the 'Confiscated Car Club'. Mr Barker explained how easy it is to join the club.

"Just leave your fines unpaid, the Ministry of Justice may seize your car and then you become a member of the club until you pay them. It's not the type of club that anyone would want be part of," he said.

"The Ministry is targeting young men who are thumbing their nose at the law, but I say to them it won't be much fun doing that when you can't drive to your mates place or get to work on time.

"Many young men look on their car as more than a means of transport, it's a means of expressing who they are and to catch the attention of women. For these people, no car – no sex appeal. This is a good incentive to pay their fines," he said.

This campaign targets the worst fine defaulters. Approximately 60,000 young men owe in the region of $104 million to the Courts. This is a third of the total amount of fines overdue.

These men are in their twenties, likely to be employed and own a car.

Last week 160,000 letters were sent out to fine defaulters to alert them to the campaign and encourage them to make a payment within the next to weeks to avoid their car being taken and sold to pay the fine.

"Over the next few weeks the Confiscated Car Club recruitment drive is on. If these blokes want to enjoy the freedom of a car and to drive their girlfriends around or get to work easily, they'd better do something about their fines because I am getting a bit towie," said Mr Barker.

Last year's Confiscated Car Club campaign generated $10.18 million and seizure of 324 cars.
