"The Textiles, Carpet, Footwear and Apparel (TCFA) sector has been pledged support of $1.125 over the next two years to meet the sector's need to adapt in light of lower tariffs and potential trade agreements with China," the Minister for Economic Development, Jim Anderton announced today.

The government funding is subject to the sector collectively contributing an additional $250,000.

"We need to ensure that New Zealand’s TCFA sector maintains and enhances its ability to develop high-value products and improve the sector’s already growing contribution to New Zealand’s economy.

"The introduction of lower tariffs and the development of a Free Trade Agreement with China means many TCFA firms will need to adjust their focus from commodity manufacturing to high value products by developing advanced textile technologies. That means they will need to build up their research and development capability," Jim Anderton said.

Textiles New Zealand, the industry development organisation, will work with TCFA firms to determine the projects to be undertaken, and the funds will be administered by the Foundation for Research Science and Technology. This will ensure the projects are supported by the industry, market driven and thoroughly monitored.

This support complements the $2.3 million package the government provided to Textiles New Zealand and the TCFA sector as part of the 2004/05 budget.
