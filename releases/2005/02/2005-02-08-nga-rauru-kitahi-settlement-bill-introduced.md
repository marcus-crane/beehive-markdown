Associate Treaty Negotiations Minister Mita Ririnui is delighted to support the first reading of the Nga Rauru Claims Settlement Bill in Parliament today.

"This Bill settles all of the historical claims of Ngaa Rauru Kitahi and I urge all members of parliament to support its passage into legislation," said Mita Ririnui.

This Bill will end longstanding claims against the Crown and provide a platform upon which Ngaa Rauru Kitahi and the Crown can build a relationship of mutual trust and cooperation.

The history of Ngaa Rauru Kitahi is filled with regrettable actions by the Crown in the nineteenth century. These actions contributed to the dismantling of Ngaa Raurutanga, and resulted in:  
·Much loss of life and property for Ngaa Rauru Kitahi during the Taranaki wars, including the lives of unarmed children killed by government militia at Handley’s Woolshed in an unprovoked attack  
·The virtual landlessness of Ngaa Rauru Kitahi

"I commend this government for introducing a Bill to this House that contains a formal apology to Ngaa Rauru Kitahi for the breaches of the Treaty acknowledged by the Crown," said Mita Ririnui.

"The Bill contains an unreservedly apology to Ngaa Rauru Kitahi for the Crowns actions which have caused hardship and suffering to the present day."

Nga Rauru Kitahi is one of eight generally recognised Iwi of Taranaki with about 3000 members.
