Prime Minister Helen Clark today launched Project ACTIVate, an educational network that will link together schools from Auckland and Southland through the use of interactive whiteboards and high-speed internet connections.

Helen Clark took part in a demonstration lesson with students at St Mary's School in Auckland's North Shore with a live link to students at Southland Girls' High School.

"Project ACTIVate provides a large screen interactive workspace where teachers and students around the country can work together through video conferencing and computers," Helen Clark said.

"This interactive whiteboard technology will allow teachers and students to combine the power of computers with the learning capability of the internet.

"This is another one of the Digital Opportunites projects which are great examples of the education sector, business and government working together to support student learning in the dynamic and challenging area of information communications technologies (ICT)."

Education Minister Trevor Mallard launched another Digital Opportunities project, MOTIS, in Wainuiomata this morning.

Auckland University’s Faculty of Education CODE Centre will provide professional development for teachers in the ACTIVate project.

Massey University will lead the research into ACTIVate and assess how this technology helps teachers to collaborate and teach more effectively and in turn how student learning is improved.

Venture Southland is co-ordinating the South Island schools, and is supporting the project by funding the technologies involved for the Southland schools.

This ACTIVate pilot runs over the next two years, with a possible extension to include more schools in 2007.
