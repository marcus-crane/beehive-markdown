Tana Umaga has been appointed as an education ambassador to front a new long-term information programme aimed at encouraging and helping parents to get more involved in their children’s education, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

“I’m incredibly pleased Tana is on board to offer inspiration and help to get information to parents that will enable them to get more involved in their children's education, and help them to learn," Trevor Mallard said at the launch of the project at Wellington's Lyall Bay School.

"Who better to promote this message than a successful Kiwi role model like Tana. He is not only a parent himself but also an inspiration to many people - young and old - because of his commitment, and determination when it comes to rugby. They're qualities that are just as important when it comes to education.

“Like many parents, Tana is passionate about the importance of education for our young people and for our country as a whole," Trevor Mallard said.

"Research clearly shows that parents who are involved in their children’s learning and who encourage their children to be the best they can be, make a real and positive difference to how children learn.

"Families have a role in their children’s education that no one else can play. The influence and involvement of parents, in addition to effective teachers, has a significant and incredibly positive impact on how children achieve. As a government we have focused on and invested heavily in supporting teachers and quality teaching. Now we want to focus on helping parents to get more involved."

Associate Education Minister David Benson-Pope said the project was a fantastic opportunity for the Ministry of Education, with Tana’s help, to give parents, families and communities the necessary support and information to get involved in their children's education.

“The government is committed to lifting the education standards of every single student and we are intent on using all the means possible to do this. Parent involvement is crucial and that’s why we’re investing $15.9 million over five years in this project.

"The success of the Te Mana campaign, in using role models to encourage kids to stay on at school, shows the potential of a high profile information campaign in changing attitudes and behaviours," he said.

Trevor Mallard said the programme would target three main areas.

"First, we want parents to have high and accurate expectations about their children's ability to achieve at each stage of their education - from early childhood education onwards. This would be tied into building their knowledge of how and what their children learn.

"We want parents to understand the positive contribution they can make to their children's education and future success, and encourage them to seek out the information that will help them actively support and get involved in their children's learning.

"Finally, we want parents to understand how the education system works and to be confident about interacting in a meaningful way with the teachers who teach their children."

The programme will be launched later this year once a detailed strategy has been developed by the Ministry of Education. It will include mainstream advertising and information and resources to help parents get involved in their children’s learning.

The programme will run alongside existing education information initiatives such as the Te Mana programme, the recently announced edCentre education sector portal and the assessment information that will be made available to parents in coming months which will help them understand how their children are doing at school.

Other government information initiatives for families include the Strategies with Kids Information for Parents (SKIP) programme managed by the Ministry for Social Development, and the Parents as First Teachers (PAFT) programme which helps parents to be more active in their children’s early development and learning.

**Questions and Answers**

**Q1. Why is an information programme for parents being introduced?**  
The primary purpose of the programme is to *encourage, support and empower parents to support their children’s learning.*  
Research is clear that in addition to the role that teachers have, the family and community environment has a significant impact on the educational achievement of children . The quality of interactions that parents and caregivers have with children, a positive and nurturing home environment and the knowledge that parents have about how to support their children’s learning, can all affect children’s achievement.  
Families that encourage children to do their best, are involved in their children’s schools and classrooms either formally through parent-teacher interviews or informally, who monitor their children’s progress and have access to educational resources are more likely to have children who are successful learners.  
Information is a key mechanism to support family and community involvement and experience from existing government information programmes, for example the Te Mana campaign, shows information provision can alter attitudes and involvement , particularly when supported by one-to-one contact.  
This programme aims to give parents more information and resources to support their involvement in their children’s learning and to help them understand the education system so that they have confidence to talk to teachers and ask the right questions.  
It will also help parents and the community to understand the changes happening in early childhood and schools, and the growing information that is available about student achievement, for example how to interpret NCEA results.

**Q2. What will the information programme look like?**  
The proposed programme, will include the following elements, while supporting and underpinning existing investment in information and initiatives for parents:

- Mainstream advertising to communicate with parents and communities about the information that is available.
- Print and web-based information and resources to help families and communities, particularly parents, get involved in their children’s learning.

**Q3. When will the programme be launched and why?**  
The information programme is expected to be launched in the last quarter of 2005, following a period of market research with different audiences (parents, teachers etc) to inform the details of the programme and to establish benchmark indicators against which the programme will be evaluated throughout its implementation.  
Media activity is not expected to commence until the final quarter of 2005, and into 2006 (ongoing).  
Links will be made with relevant ongoing communications programmes, including the launch of information for parents on assessment, which shows how teachers find out what children know and can do, in order to tailor their teaching programmes. This information can also be fed back to parents so they can be involved in their children’s learning.

**Q4. How much will the programme cost?**  
Funding averages $3.18 million per year for the first five years, with ongoing funding of $3.91 million per annum.

**Q4. Why have an education ambassador and what will their role be?**  
Other government programmes have provided significant evidence of the effectiveness of role models in communicating with the community. These include the well-established Te Mana campaign, which is targeted primarily at Mâori audiences and has a focus on engaging individuals in learning.  
The involvement of a high profile New Zealander as an education ambassador will help reach parents with the key information they will need to help their children learn. This could include inspiring audiences through advertising and connecting parents to information and resources, delivering education messages through print media, including school newsletters, and by making personal appearances at significant events to promote education. However, note, these activities will be informed by the market research being undertaken in coming months.  
We are confident that our education ambassador will be an appropriate role model for parents and the community because he has huge mana in New Zealand, has personal attributes and values that align with the programme, and is an inspirational example of someone who contributes to his children’s learning and to the learning of others in his community.
