New Zealand will seek to ensure women’s rights remain a priority at the 49th Session of United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) starting in New York tonight (NZ time).

The meeting marks the 10th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration which adopted a Programme for Action for the global advancement of women. New Zealand’s delegation is being led by Women’s Affairs Minister Ruth Dyson.

“New Zealand strongly supports that programme and the international commitment to women’s rights. That may sound a bit obscure, but the Declaration, and the obligations and scrutiny that go with it, do influence the way policies for women are developed around the globe.

“International obligations under the Beijing Declaration and the Convention of the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) have helped guide New Zealand’s progress in areas such as pay and employment equity. They also provide critical protection for the basic human rights of women.

“Reaffirmation of the Beijing Declaration this week will help keep gender equality central to the wider United Nations agenda and, ensure appropriate attention when the UN celebrates its 60th anniversary later this year and reviews the Millennium Declaration and Millennium Development Goals, which deal more broadly with human rights.

The New Zealand delegation includes unusually both public servants and representatives of civil society.

“We believe that the advancement of women can only occur when governments work closely with non-government organisations. We are one of only a few countries that regularly includes women from the wider community in our delegations.

“These representatives bring invaluable perspective, reminding us that while we are negotiating international agreements, they need to have meaning for ordinary women.”

While in New York Ruth Dyson also took part in the Commonwealth ‘Beijing+10’ Ministers’ meeting, on Sunday 27 February, and will have a number of bilateral meetings with other delegations attending CSW.
