Contrary to inferences made today in the media and by the Canterbury Chamber of Commerce, no new rules have been drawn up around the reporting requirements on private companies of any size says Commerce Minister, Pete Hodgson.

Two options have been put up for comment as part of a review of the Financial Reporting Act instigated in March 2004. The first is to introduce limited public reporting obligations on large private companies in line with international accounting practice; the second is to allow shareholders to decide on withholding their company's financial reports.

Submissions on the review close on Friday, 25 February. Officials will then make recommendations to Ministers. No decisions have yet been made by government on what rules should apply.
