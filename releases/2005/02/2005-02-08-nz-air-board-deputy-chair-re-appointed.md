Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey today announced the re-appointment of Judy Callingham as Deputy Chair of the NZ On Air Board for a further three-year term ending on 31 December 2007, and welcomed her contribution to the Board since her initial appointment in 2002.

"Judy Callingham is a hard-working board member and I'm pleased that she'll be continuing in her role as deputy chair," Steve Maharey said.

Ms Callingham has been involved in an extensive range of media for the past thirty years, and has wide experience as an interviewer, newsreader, presenter, weather forecaster, current affairs reporter and producer on both radio and television.

As an award-winning dramatist, Ms Callingham has specialised in television drama. She currently runs a media training business for senior management in business, the public service and politics. Judy currently sits on the NZ Writers Guild Board (since 1991) and chaired the NZ Academy of Film and Television Arts (1999-2001). She was appointed Deputy Chair of the NZ On Air Board in September 2004.

NZ On Air is established pursuant to section 35 of the Broadcasting Act 1989 to reflect and develop New Zealand identity and culture by promoting programmes about New Zealand and New Zealand interests and by promoting Mâori language and culture.
