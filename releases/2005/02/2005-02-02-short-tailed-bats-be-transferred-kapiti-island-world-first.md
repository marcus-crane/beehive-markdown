Twenty bat pups from a threatened, isolated colony of short-tailed bats in the Tararua Forest Park are to be transferred to Kapiti Island, in the most ambitious conservation project involving bats attempted in New Zealand, Conservation Minister Chris Carter announced today.

"It is fair to say the Department of Conservation (DOC) is on tenterhooks about this project because bats (pekapeka) have never been successfully transferred from one location to another before," Mr Carter said.

"Unlike most birds, bats have an extraordinary homing instinct and when we've tried to transfer them in the past they've simply flown back home. A cunning solution to this problem has been developed and is being trialled in this project. If it works it could prove enormously helpful in the preservation of native bat species."

The aim of the project is to establish on predator-free Kapiti Island a secure population of short-tailed bats, which carry the genes of a unique population found in the Waiohine Valley in the Tararua Forest Park.

The Waiohine population, discovered in the 1990s, is the last remaining population of short-tailed bats in the south of the North Island. It was isolated from other bat populations about 90,000 years ago by volcanic activity, and as a result is genetically distinct. Unfortunately, it is under siege from predators. Perhaps as few as 300 individuals remain.

"To ensure the survival of the unique genetics of this population, DOC set out in December to catch 25 pregnant females from the Waiohine Valley using nets," Mr Carter said.

"These females were then transferred to Pukaha Mount Bruce National Wildlife Centre where they successfully gave birth to 20 pups in captivity over a fortnight between Christmas and early January. This in itself was a major achievement, but the real test is still to come," he said.

To avoid the problem of the bat homing instinct, DOC intends to transfer only the pups to their new location on Kapiti Island. The females will be returned back home to the Waiohine Valley. The transfer of the young will start from this week as the pups are weaned and begin to fly.

"Our hope is the pups are young enough to lack a homing instinct and will remain on Kapiti Island. In time, Kapiti will become the location they home to," Mr Carter said.

"The research suggests this could work. If it doesn't, then the bat husbandry techniques developed for the project will still prove valuable in future. A willingness to push boundaries and try new things is exactly what conservation in New Zealand needs. It is becoming a hallmark of DOC's efforts to save our natural heritage."
