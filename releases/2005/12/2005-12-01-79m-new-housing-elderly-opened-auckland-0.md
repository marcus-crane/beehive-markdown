Housing Minister Chris Carter today opened a new $7.9 million housing complex for the elderly in Auckland.

The new homes were built by Housing New Zealand Corporation in New Windsor Road, on vacant land previously owned by Auckland City Council.

The site was part of 1700 other properties, including 1542 housing units for the elderly, brought from the Council by the Government in 2003. At the time, the government also committed $75 million to improving and rebuilding some homes over five years.

At New Windsor Road, 61 new one-bedroom units have been built for elderly people, replacing the 50 council bed-sit units which had once been on the site.

"These new units offer people a more modern living environment with a community atmosphere. Particular features include an onsite common room and the well designed outdoor living areas throughout the complex," Mr Carter said.

"The complex demonstrates the government's commitment to proving good quality housing for older people, and our willingness to invest in state housing to meet growing demands and population change.

"Over this and the next three years the government expects to add a further 3288 state and community houses, 2400 of which will be in Auckland where demand is greatest," Mr Carter said.

"Work is also progressing well on upgrading other former Auckland City Council units. Many of the homes were in very poor condition and in desperate need for an upgrade when we purchased them," Mr Carter said.

To date around 460 former Auckland City housing units have been refurbished or rebuilt across Auckland, in addition to the 61 new units at New Windsor Road.
