Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Helen Clark, today announced the winning design for the New Zealand Memorial in Hyde Park Corner, London.

The winning design, selected from a short-list of twelve, is by Palmerston North sculptor, [Paul Dibble](http://www.gowlangsfordgallery.com/artists/atom/pdibb.asp), in association with Athfield Architects of Wellington.

Rt Hon Winston Peters visited the site designated for the Memorial during his recent visit to London and today expressed his pleasure that the project was proceeding in honour of the role New Zealand has played alongside the United Kingdom in time of war.

Helen Clark said the memorial will commemorate the special relationship between New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

"This memorial will symbolise the contribution and sacrifice made by New Zealand during armed conflicts alongside the United Kingdom. The memorial is expected to become a particular focus for ANZAC Day commemorations in London each year," Helen Clark said.

"I am pleased that we have the strong team of Paul Dibble and Athfield Architects working on this project. Their proposal is for a distinctive New Zealand design, and I am sure New Zealanders visiting the memorial in London will take pride in it.

"The design is a fitting memorial to the more than a quarter of a million New Zealanders who served in the wars of the last century and indeed back to the South African War. It evokes and reflects the courage, determination, and loyalty of New Zealanders who served in, and supported the war effort, as well as the accompanying grief, loss and suffering which New Zealand experienced.”

"The memorial will be located at Hyde Park Corner, diagonally opposite the Australian Memorial which was completed in 2003. The official dedication of the New Zealand memorial is likely to take place in late 2006," Helen Clark said.

Paul Dibble said that the memorial will include 16 cross-shaped vertical bronze sculptures, each adorned with text and images.

"We deliberately set the memorial in a position where the main pedestrian route runs through the memorial so that visitors will walk amongst the sculptures, encouraging people to stop and explore. Through the words and images, any New Zealander visiting the memorial will recognise home, and British people may learn something of the relationship between our two countries,” Paul Dibble said.

**BACKGROUNDINFORMATION**

The United Kingdom and New Zealand share close family, historical, cultural, sporting and economic ties. A special bond was forged when New Zealand answered the United Kingdom's request for troops to serve in various armed conflicts, especially World War One and World War Two. 250,000 New Zealanders served in various roles during the world wars – soldiers, nurses and support staff. On the home front, the country's industry and economy went on a war footing, and contributing to the war effort dominated the lives of many New Zealanders. Our agricultural shipments to the United Kingdom were vital to that country's wellbeing.

In London there are many monuments to the fallen and to military leaders. Among these are now important memorials to Commonwealth contributors. The Canadian memorial is situated at Green Park, and gates on Constitution Hill have been erected in honour of the contributions from Africa, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sir Lanka and the Caribbean. Australia also unveiled its own memorial in Hyde Park Corner on 11 November 2003.

English Heritage, in conjunction with other authorities is currently refiguring Hyde Park Corner. The first and second stages of development are complete and resulted in the refurbishment of the Wellington Arch, reconfiguration of the ‘lower-bowl' and the installation of the Australian War Memorial. The later phases of the plan include the development of the ‘upper bowl', which is where the New Zealand Memorial is to be sited.

The project is being managed by the Ministry for Culture and Heritage in consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, New Zealand Defence Force and Veterans’ Affairs New Zealand. It will also be carried out in cooperation with English Heritage and the Westminster City Council.

The New Zealand Government is funding this $3 million project.

**QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS**

What is the memorial for?  
The New Zealand Memorial will commemorate the relationship between New Zealand and the United Kingdom and serve as a focus of remembrance of the shared sacrifice during two world wars, and other military engagements from the South African War to the present day.

***Why London?***  
The capital is the ideal place for such a memorial as the seat of government and where there is the greatest number of ex-pat New Zealanders living. It is also home to a number of other Commonwealth memorials.

***Why Hyde park Corner?***  
The site was suggested by English Heritage with the support of Westminster City Council. Hyde Park Corner is an important ceremonial space and along with the recently completed Australian Memorial, on the opposite corner of the site, the New Zealand Memorial will provide a much needed focus for ANZAC Day and other commemorations.

***Why now?***  
In a globalised world it is all the more important that people are able to assert their own national identity. The development of memorials such as this reflects New Zealand’s strengthening national identity by recognising the significant part we played in wars overseas and the impact that participation had on this country. Related to this is an increasing demand by young New Zealanders, particularly when they are overseas, to express their national identity on occasions such as ANZAC Day. This memorial will provide a place for the many thousands of New Zealanders living in London to do that.

***How much will it cost?***  
The budget for the design and construction of the memorial is $3 million or approximately £1 million.

***Who designed it?***  
The memorial is a collaboration between Dibble Art Co and Athfield Architects Ltd, led by sculptor Paul Dibble and architect John Hardwick-Smith with Jon Rennie as the team’s London representative.

***How was the design selected?***  
In October 2004, 12 designs teams were selected from the 86 who submitted expressions of interest. The 12 teams were invited to submit actual designs for the memorial, and from these 12 a selection panel, appointed by the Ministry for Culture and Heritage, selected the final design. Since that time, the design has been refined and submitted to Westminster City Council for planning approval. This approval has now been received.

***What does it look like?*** What words and images are going to be on it?  
The design is based around 16 bronze sculptures set out in a formation across a grassy slope overlooking Hyde Park Corner. The sculptures, which are each configured as a cross when seen from above, will feature words and images that evoke the theme of the memorial. Images of the overall design of the memorial are available on the Ministry for Culture and Heritage website: www.mch.govt.nz. The exact words and images to adorn the memorial will remain under wraps until it is unveiled.

***When will it be finished?***  
It is hoped to complete the memorial within the next year.
