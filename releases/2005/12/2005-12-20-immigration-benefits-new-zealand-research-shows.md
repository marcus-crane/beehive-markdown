New research shows the benefit of immigration to New Zealand, Minister of Immigration, David Cunliffe said today.

Findings of the research report showed an increased focus on skilled migrants, a strong relationship between temporary work permits and residence and a well-balanced spread of both countries of origin and regional settlement within New Zealand.

"This provides evidence that the current immigration programme is delivering benefits to the New Zealand economy," Mr Cunliffe said.

The Department of Labour's Migration Trends report, just published, showed that 87 per cent of principal applicants for the Skilled Migrant Category had a job or offer of skilled employment in New Zealand.

"These are typically high quality applicants contributing immediately to the labour market," Mr Cunliffe said.

"In the coming year I want to see an even stronger focus on skills that will contribute even more to New Zealand's productivity and growth as well as address significant labour shortages."

The report found that 88 per cent of principal applicants approved for residence in 2004/05 had previously held visitor, work or student permits.

“It suggests that temporary migrants are choosing to keep their much needed skills in New Zealand."

The report also showed that of the principal applicants under the Skilled Migrant Category, who recorded their region of employment, 62 per cent had job or job offers outside Auckland.

“This research is useful because the more we know about the type of migrants that come here, what they do and where they settle, the better it will be for New Zealand and future migrants,” Mr Cunliffe said.
