Housing Minister Chris Carter today opened a new housing development for older people during a visit to Housing New Zealand's Community Renewal project in Clendon, Auckland.

The $2.25 million housing development in Templeton Place, Clendon, consist of nine two-bedroom units built on land purchased from Habitat for Humanity.

Mr Carter said the new units signified a major physical achievement for the renewal project in Clendon.

"They have clearly made a significant difference to the local area," he said.

"In addition to offering tenants a modern living environment close to the local reserve, these new unis have a definite community feel with their shared courtyard and individual lawns.

"These new homes and other initiatives I have had an opportunity to see in Clendon today show how HNZC can work with communities to ensure the supply of quality housing and that a partnership like Community Renewal can be successful in generating positive change in the community.

"It shows that by working together we all can have confidence in the future of Clendon," Mr Carter said.

The Community Renewal project is a three-way partnership between Housing New Zealand, Manukau City Council and the Clendon Resident's Group. The Community Renewal Programme operates in five other locations throughout New Zealand in areas witch high levels of disadvantage and a significant HNZC presence.

The primary focus of the project in Clendon is a combination of physical improvements and community development initiatives.
