“The two reports gather together all we know about the tsunami threat. It’s bigger than we had thought, but effective preparation by New Zealanders can greatly reduce the risk of death or injury,” said Mr Barker.

The reports, commissioned by the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management from the government-owned research agency GNS Science, note that preparedness can reduce the risk of death and injury from tsunami by 90-95%. But if tsunami strike communities there could be significant numbers of deaths, comparable to those predicted for earthquakes.

Mr Barker says work is underway to improve monitoring for tsunami, so there will be better alerts and more warning time for people to move to safety.

“I have asked my Ministry to report to me by 30 July on the outcome of discussions with local Civil Defence Emergency Management groups, local authorities and other government agencies about further action that can be taken to protect New Zealand communities from tsunami. A public education programme is underway to promote awareness of all hazards.

“The reports draw on our existing information about tsunami. The effects of tsunami are very difficult to predict and our existing information is limited. These reports help our understanding but do not answer all questions. Government agencies are continuing to work on this and CDEM groups around the country already incorporate tsunami in their planning.

“The risk of tsunami has not changed, but we now know more about it. My advice to families over the holidays is to continue to enjoy life on the New Zealand coast - but to be aware of the tsunami risk and know what to do:

\*There’s civil defence information on the inside back cover of the Yellow Pages.  
\*You should have a plan for you and your family.  
\*If you are warned of a tsunami move to higher ground, do not go to the beach to watch.  
\*If you see the sea receding or rising rapidly, move immediately to higher ground.  
\*If an earthquake continues for a long time (more than 10 seconds) and you are at or near the coast, protect yourself against a possible tsunami by moving to higher ground once the shaking stops. It will not be safe to return until civil defence or emergency staff tell you to because the tsunami threat may continue for many hours.

“ A public education programme is underway to promote awareness of all hazards, and these reports don’t change the basic message: everyone needs to discuss civil defence risks with their families and neighbours, and have a plan for all major hazards in your area,” said Mr Barker.
