Over 100 people who help to protect New Zealand's fish populations from over-fishing by playing a voluntary role as Honorary Fisheries officers, were thanked by Fisheries Minister, Jim Anderton, on International Volunteer Day.

International Volunteer day was on Monday 5 December.

"The Fisheries Ministry has 144 Honorary Fisheries Officers (HFOs) who, after a period of training, give up their weekends and public holidays to ensure recreational fishers are well informed about fishing rules, and to assist them in achieving high levels of compliance with those rules.

"New Zealand's coastline is long and many parts of it are remote so the help of these volunteer honorary Fisheries Officers is essential in ensuring our fisheries resource is protected.

"If New Zealanders who fish are well informed about the rules, and follow them, we, and future generations, will all be able to continue to fish thanks, in part, to these generous and thoughtful volunteers," Jim Anderton said.

Over 20 per cent of New Zealanders go fishing for recreation.
