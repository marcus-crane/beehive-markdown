The new Nature’s Flame wood pellet plant that produces pellets from pine offcuts, follows the success of another plant at Rolleston in the South Island. Ms Mahuta commended those involved in the plant’s development, which was encouraging an efficient fuel alternative and minimising environmental impact.

“Air quality in New Zealand is good the majority of the time. However, we do have some problems with air quality – particularly over winter, when people use open fires and wood burners to heat their homes. Fine particles are the air pollutant of most concern causing significant health problems. Research suggests more New Zealanders die prematurely from fine particle pollution than are killed on our roads. We need to act now, particularly to protect the most vulnerable – our children and elderly.

“This is why the government introduced the first set of National Environmental Standards for Air Quality on 1 September this year. These standards ensure that there is bottom line protection for all New Zealanders' health,” Ms Mahuta said.

"The 'Warm Homes' pilot set up a trial to convert a number of homes in Tokoroa to cleaner forms of heating. The work in Tokoroa provided valuable insights into people's heating choices and what they know about the quality of the air they breathe. Community engagement is vital in the first steps of raising awareness about air pollution, energy efficiency and how to keep your home warm.”

The government will be working on another pilot in Timaru and Nature's Flame wood pellet burners will be used here as well.

“I would like to congratulate Solid Energy and Nature's Flame team for their efforts towards a more sustainable and efficient way to heat our homes, which provides overall health benefits to people and the environment.

“As a Huntly girl I know that this is a brave move – especially when in both my home town and places like Invercargill, coal is still used to heat many homes.”
