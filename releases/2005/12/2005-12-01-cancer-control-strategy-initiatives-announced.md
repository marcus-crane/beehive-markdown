Funding has been awarded for 15 projects that will advance the goals of the Cancer Control Strategy Action Plan, Health Minister Pete Hodgson announced today.

"The Cancer Control Strategy Action Plan outlines how to achieve a reduction in the impact of cancer across the board – from prevention to treatment,  
palliative care, support and rehabilitation, and research," Pete Hodgson said.

"The reality is that we'll only succeed in fighting cancer if we're willing to take all the small steps that are needed. The initiatives we're announcing today represent some of the small steps we have to take.

"The fifteen projects include studies to map cancer patient journeys and a review of cancer patient information resources."

The projects will be funded through the extra $40 million per year of new cancer funding announced in March. The 15 projects represent a total investment of $1.2 million.

District Health Boards (DHBs) and Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) were invited to apply to the Ministry in the first funding round. 57 proposals were received with 15 selected for funding. A second round of proposals is currently being considered.
