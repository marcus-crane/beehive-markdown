A new Youth Transition Services for Hamilton was launched by Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta today

[Speaking at the launch](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F24609), Ms Mahuta said the service will provide a valuable resource of support and guidance for Hamilton's young people and their families.

Hamilton Youth Transition Services (YTS) will offer skills training, housing support, counselling, careers mentoring, and alternative education.

“Youth Transition Services brings together these services with others like financial literacy, into a package that suits the needs of each young person who is at risk of falling through the cracks once they leave school.

“At any one time, between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of New Zealand’s young people face the risk of a poor transition, and as a result face the longer-term risk of problems like unemployment, depression, and criminal activity,” Ms Mahuta said.

"For most young people, the biggest goals are education, skills training and jobs. This is about making sure that our young people can achieve those things,” she said.

Hamilton has more than 10,100 young people aged between 15 and 17. Last year, 2,219 young people were stood down from school, 174 were excluded and 562 were suspended . Last month, 3,044 people aged 16-24 years were on benefits in Hamilton.

Hamilton Mayor Michael Redman said the city is committed to improving quality of life for the young people within the community.

“It’s pleasing that the Youth Transitions Services objectives are closely aligned with those of the Mayor’s Taskforce for Jobs. Each initiative is dedicated to supporting young people in their educational, training and employment endeavours while enhancing participation in their community.

“Council is pleased to partner with the Ministry of Social Development to provide enhanced opportunities for our city’s youth which will also benefit our business and wider community,” Mayor Redman said.

Seven other Services are already underway in Waitakere, Porirua, Far North, Rotorua, Whangarei, New Plymouth, and Gisborne with two more due to open early next year in Manukau and the Hutt Valley.

The Services are funded by central government and implemented in partnership with the Mayors’ Taskforce for Jobs. The YTS providers in Hamilton are Te Runanga o Kirikiriroa. Whai Marama Youth Connex is a service delivery arm that will be responsible for the co-ordination, operation, and delivery of the Service.
