Conservation Minister Chris Carter has decided not to close the Buller River to anglers this fishing season as part of efforts to control Didymosphenia.

"Fish and Game have asked me to use my powers under the Conservation Act to close the Buller River to anglers as a way of limiting the spread of Didymo to tributaries of the river which are currently unaffected by the alga," Mr Carter said.

"I have come to the conclusion that if the purpose of closing the river to anglers is to prevent the spread of Didymo, then there is no point in doing so unless other users who could spread the alga are also unable to use the river.

"While I have the power to close the river to anglers, only Biosecurity New Zealand has the power to close the river to all users, such as rafters and kayakers. It has chosen not to do so, and focus instead on pursuing other methods of dealing with the problem.

"That means at this point in time, the interests of anglers are not served by my closing the Buller, as requested by Fish & Game. In fact to do so would unfairly penalise anglers," Mr Carter said.
