Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor today announced the recipients of seven Tourism Research Scholarships for 2006 worth $105,000.

The scholarships, valued at $15,000 each, were awarded to support postgraduate researchers investigating topics of real interest to the New Zealand tourism industry, Mr O'Connor said.

The projects cover exciting areas and will help tourism in New Zealand develop in a sustainable way, particularly when it comes to our natural environment, he said.

"Research of this kind is vital for New Zealand tourism to keep ahead of the pack. Some of the projects will help identify developing markets and find new ways to reach our customers while others will provide information to enable us to protect the outstanding natural environment for which New Zealand is deservedly renowned.

“The scholarship recipients are all high calibre Masters-level students with strong support from the tourism industry and their respective university departments."

The scholarship programme, launched in 2004, was set up to help develop a research culture in New Zealand tourism. It seeks to encourage research that is applicable and accessible to the tourism industry through the researchers’ engagement with the industry and through their reporting to meet both academic and sector requirements.

The scholarships are supported by the Ministry of Tourism and Visa International Limited.

Mr O'Connor said the continued partnership between the Ministry of Tourism and Visa International helped strengthen the programme.
