A New Zealand Sign Language-interpreted zoo encounter, multi-cultural Pacific festival, art expo, afternoon of film and dance, and pub poetry reading are among events planned around the country during December to celebrate tomorrow’s International Day of Disabled People (3 December).

Disability Issues Minister Ruth Dyson said the international day, which has been observed by the United Nations since 1992, provided a great opportunity to reflect on progress to uphold the rights of disabled people.

“Since the Labour-led government came into office in 1999, we have appointed a Minister for Disability Issues, an advocate on all policy issues. We have developed the New Zealand Disability Strategy, a framework of action based on a human rights model, for removing barriers to inclusion in society. And we have set up the Office for Disability Issues to help government departments and agencies prepare their plans to implement the strategy and monitor its delivery.”

Ruth Dyson said achievements included:

- progress on legislation to make New Zealand Sign Language an official language;
- establishment of a telephone relay service for people who are deaf, or have hearing or speech impairments;
- a lead role for New Zealand in developing a United Nations convention on the rights of disabled people;
- a doubling of the budget for the Total Mobility subsidised-taxi scheme, which would lead to better services and a 60 per cent increase in the number of users over the next three years;
- a review of long-term disability support services; and
- work to improve employment opportunities for disabled people.

“Our government is committed to building a nation where disabled people are valued and able to contribute to their full capacity. Our approach to disability issues will continue to be based on an ongoing commitment to human rights, partnership and inclusion,” Ruth Dyson said.

The fifth progress report on implementing the [New Zealand Disability Strategy](http://www.odi.govt.nz/nzds/) will be tabled in Parliament this month.
