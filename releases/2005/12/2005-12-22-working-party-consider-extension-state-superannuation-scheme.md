State Services Minister Annette King has announced a working party to consider options for extending the [State Sector Retirement Savings Scheme](http://www.superscheme.govt.nz/) (SSRSS) to entities in the wider State sector.

Current SSRSS employers are the 35 ministries and departments in the Public Service; five non-Public Service departments; State or State-integrated area, primary, intermediate, secondary or special schools; free kindergarten associations (registered teachers only); and a few entities in the wider State sector (on the basis of funding the employer subsidy from their existing budget).

Ms King says the working party has been asked to report on the costs and processes required for any extension of the SSRSS to the wider State sector.

“The SSRSS has been a very successful initiative, prompting many public servants to start saving for their future retirement. The Government has previously signalled that it intended to consider an extension of the scheme, and I expect the working party’s final report will be delivered by 15 September 2006.”

Angela Foulkes has been appointed as chair of the working party.

Other members nominated for the working party are:

- Helen Kelly , vice-president, NZ Council of Trade Unions;
- Eileeen Brown, policy analyst/programme organiser, CTU;
- Glenn Barclay, policy adviser, PSA;
- Glenda Alexander, industrial adviser, NZ Nurses Organisation;
- Sharn Riggs, national secretary, Association of Staff in Tertiary Education;
- Andrew Norton, general manager, human resources, Auckland District Health Board;
- Nick Economu, manager, superannuation plan, NZ Post;
- Ellen Dunster, group manager, human resources, AgResearch Ltd;
- Murray Costello, manager, agency group, Culture and Heritage Ministry;
- Hauraki Greenland, principal adviser, social policy, Treasury;
- Helen Moody, manager, SSRSS, State Services Commission;
- and a representative, yet to be named, from the New Zealand Vice Chancellors’ Committee.
