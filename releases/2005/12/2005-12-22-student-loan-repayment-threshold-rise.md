The income threshold at which students must begin repaying their loans will rise at 1 April next year from $16,588 to $17,160, Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne announced today.

“And, thanks to the [interest free student loan policy](http://www.studylink.govt.nz/financial-assistance/student-loan/new-interest-free-policy.html) [legislated](http://www.knowledge-basket.co.nz/gpprint/docs/bills/20050012.txt) for last week, repayments from borrowers living in New Zealand will go entirely toward paying off the principal – not to paying interest.

“That will [save them thousands of dollars in many cases, and knock years off their repayment times](http://www.labour.org.nz/Docs/loan_repayment_model6.htm),” the Ministers said.

The new threshold is based on annual movement in the [September Consumer Price Index](http://www2.stats.govt.nz/domino/external/pasfull/pasfull.nsf/web/Hot+Off+The+Press+Consumers+Price+Index+September+2005+quarter?open) of 3.36 per cent.

The change was approved by Order in Council today.
