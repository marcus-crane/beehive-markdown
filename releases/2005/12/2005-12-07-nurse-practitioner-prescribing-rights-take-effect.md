Nurse practitioners will be able to prescribe a range of medicines under new regulations which come into effect tomorrow.

Health Minister Pete Hodgson said the new regulations are part of the government's wider work to build a more flexible and responsive health system.

"We're committed to building a health system where all New Zealanders have timely access to high quality services," Pete Hodgson said.

"The new regulations will empower nurses to apply their knowledge, skills and their years of experience. The result will be improved access to services, improved patient education and a reduction in secondary illnesses."

The regulations coming into force tomorrow give qualified nurse practitioners – who have met rigorous requirements set by the Nursing Council – the right to prescribe a range of prescription medicines and controlled substances.

Previously only nurse practitioners in aged care and child family health had limited prescribing rights. They will now be able to prescribe medications in a range of new areas including treatment of chronic conditions such as diabetes and cardio-vascular disease.

There are currently 17 nurse practitioners in New Zealand. One nurse has already obtained prescribing rights and around 100 are in the process of being assessed by the Nursing Council.

Nurse Practitioners have to complete a clinical masters programme and a specific prescribing course of study at masters level, then be approved as prescribers by the Nursing Council. Nurse Practitioners have to demonstrate advanced practice skills in order to be approved by the Nursing Council and have to demonstrate ongoing competency as part of their regulatory process.

The Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act requires nurses to demonstrate their competence on an annual basis and apply for an Annual Practising Certificate.

The Ministry of Health will be responsible for maintaining and updating the list of medicines nurse practitioners can prescribe.
