New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to Niue will be career diplomat Anton Ojala, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

“New Zealand and Niue have a special relationship founded on close historical ties, people to people links, unique constitutional arrangements and a common citizenship and currency.

“Niue has been self-governing in free association with New Zealand since 1974.

“A key role for Mr Ojala will be to take forward the close cooperation between Niue and New Zealand under the Halavaka ke he Monuina Arrangement (HKHMA),” Mr Peters said.

The Arrangement was signed in October 2004 by Prime Minister Helen Clark and Niue Premier Young Vivian and covers a new Programme of Strengthened Cooperation (SCP) with Niue for a five-year period.

“This programme and additional funding covers mentoring, training, policy advice, and other support from government departments and agencies in New Zealand.

“New Zealand agencies work to their Niue counterparts to increase capacity in the Niue Public Service to meet the range of demands.

“The Arrangement also assures continued budgetary support for Niue and an additional programme of capital and infrastructure projects,” said Mr Peters.

Mr Ojala is currently First Secretary at the New Zealand High Commission in Canberra.

He has had previous postings in the Cook Islands and Papua New Guinea (where he managed the New Zealand Liaison Office on Bougainville).

Mr Ojala takes up his position in February next year, replacing Kurt Meyer.
