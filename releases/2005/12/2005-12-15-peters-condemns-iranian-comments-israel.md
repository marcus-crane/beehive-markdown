Foreign Minister Winston Peters has responded to comments by the Iranian President casting doubt on the Holocaust, and calling for Israelis to be relocated to Europe and North America, describing the comments as "aggressive and totally unacceptable to the international community."

"As recently as 01 November the United Nations General Assembly – including Iran – adopted a Resolution (co-sponsored by New Zealand) that rejected 'denial of the Holocaust as a historical event, either in full or in part.' The President's comments are at odds both with history and the contemporary reality of Israel's right to live within secure borders," Mr Peters said.

"As I said in response to a similar statement by Iran's President in late October, comments attacking Israel in this manner cut across efforts to build a lasting and just peace in the Middle East. New Zealand joins in the international condemnation of these recent comments made by Iran's President," Mr Peters said.
