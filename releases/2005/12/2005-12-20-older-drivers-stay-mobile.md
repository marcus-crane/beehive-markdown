The new licensing system for older drivers should make it easier for more of them to keep driving and to stay on the road for longer, Transport Safety Minister Harry Duynhoven said today.

"The new system will help more older people keep their independence and to retain contact with their social networks and communities.”

Under the new older driver system the medical checks for driver licences for older drivers will be just as robust as at present. They are required at age 75, 80, and two yearly thereafter. It is expected that 80 - 90% or more older drivers will pass their medical easily and proceed directly to renew their licence.

A new education package will be targeted at GPs to make sure they understand the older driver system, including their ability to recommend licence restrictions and to refer drivers for specialist assessment, Mr Duynhoven said.

For those few older drivers whose medical fitness is confirmed but for whom the GP has concerns that they may not be safe drivers, there will be a new provision allowing GPs to refer a driver for an on-road safety test. It is expected that this will affect a very small number of drivers.

“With the end of the mandatory on road test which many older drivers found stressful, more older drivers should be encouraged to renew their driver licences. We could see more over-80 year olds on the road able to enjoy the fuller lifestyle that comes with increased mobility," Mr Duynhoven said.
