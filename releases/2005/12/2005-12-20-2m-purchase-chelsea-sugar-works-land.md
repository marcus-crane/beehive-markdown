The government will contribute $2m to the public purchase of the historic Chelsea Estate bordering Waitemata Harbour, Prime Minister Helen Clark and Conservation Minister Chris Carter announced today.

"The Chelsea land provides some spectacular and accessible recreation opportunities for the public. It includes grassy opens spaces, walkways, regenerating native bush, artificial ponds and five heritage buildings," Prime Minister Helen Clark said.

"The government is proud to be able to assist the Chelsea Park Trust in bringing the Chelsea land in to public ownership, and I would like to thank the Trust for the wonderful service they have done for Aucklanders in negotiating this purchase."

The government has contributed $2m to the $20m purchase price, $1m each from the Department of Conservation and the Department of Internal Affairs.

Chris Carter said the Chelsea land would make a valuable addition to a network of forested parks and Crown land on the Uruamo Headland.

"It makes up the eastern-most portion of the largest area of native bush left in urban Auckland, and as such, it will make [a terrific regional asset](http://arc.govt.nz/index.cfm?80E48FB4-11F9-433C-A79D-C15870DB8811)," he said.

"This is a significant purchase that a small group of people, led by retired judge Sir David Tompkins, have made happen by dedicating countless hours of their time. The Trust and the Chelsea Sugar Company, which has forgone the opportunity of developing the land, deserve the thanks of all Aucklanders."
