“The final costings for the interest free [student loans](http://www.ird.govt.nz/studentloans/) [policy](http://www.labour.org.nz/news/hot_topics/hot-topic-050726/index.html) justify Labour’s confidence in the policy’s affordability,” Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

The operational costs are estimated at

- $32 million in 2005-06;
- $218 million in 2006-07;
- $256 million in 2007-08;
- $286 million in 2008-09 and
- $269 million in 2009-10.

“This is is line with, although a little lower, than the Labour Party’s costings and significantly lower than the Treasury scenario released during the election campaign,” Dr Cullen said.

“The figures published today were finalised on 6 December. They are the result of a lot of work by officials in the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Social Development, Inland Revenue and the Treasury and are higher than the version supplied to the Cabinet on 14 November and referred to by me on 16 November in the House during debate on the interest free loan legislation.

“The earlier estimates assumed a cost on the operating provision of around $200 million a year from 2006-07. The difference between the two sets of costings reflects changes in technical assumptions and refinements to the forecasting model.”

The official costings also provide for an annual cash impact of $157 million in 2005-06; $293 million in 2006-07; $360 million in 2007-08; $367 million in 2008-09 and $308 million in 2009-10. This represents the cost to the government of increased borrowings and slower repayment rates. The volume of voluntary repayments, for example, is expected to reduce over four years to 20 per cent of current levels.

The third component in the costings is the reduction of around $1.5 billion in the value of the student loans portfolio held by the Crown.

“This is less than the $2 billion adjustment signalled last month and includes around $500 million from a shift in accounting approach to fair value – a change the government had to make in 2007 anyway and has simply brought forward,” Dr Cullen said.
