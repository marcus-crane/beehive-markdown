Three new marine reserves have been approved as part of ongoing [efforts to preserve and nurture New Zealand's marine life](http://www.fish.govt.nz/sustainability/index.html), Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton and Conservation Minister Chris Carter announced today.

New marine reserves will be formed at:

- Whangarei Harbour (231 hectares)
- Volkner Rocks in the Bay of Plenty (1290 hectares)
- Parininihi in North Taranaki (1759 hectares).

All have received the approval of the Ministers of Conservation, Fisheries and Transport, and will now be surveyed and recommended for gazettal.

"These reserves are located in spectacular marine environments, and will add some significant new dimensions to New Zealand's network of marine protected areas," Jim Anderton said.

The reserves contain nationally important marine life and marine habitats, such as volcanic reefs, rare corals, distinctive and rare sponge gardens, tidal flats, and a vast array of fish species. One is at the southern limit for Maui's dolphin, and another offers superb diving in the midst of an increasingly important tourism spot.

Chris Carter said the new additions would bring the total number of marine reserves around New Zealand to 31. The area now protected in marine reserves was about 7.5 per cent of New Zealand's territorial sea, although the majority was around remote offshore islands.

"These reserves are a good step forward in improving the extent of marine protection in our vast marine area. They have been under discussion for 10 years or more, and it is terrific to see them finally reach fruition," Mr Carter said.

The new reserves leave just four reserve applications awaiting decisions from ministers under the current Marine Reserves Act.

Once decisions have been made on the remaining four applications, a new system for locating marine protected areas, including marine reserves, is to be introduced. The new system is laid out in a new Marine Protected Areas Policy, due to go to Cabinet shortly.

"In essence the new policy is designed to achieve a greater consensus on what areas in different regions of the country are proposed for marine protection, prior to proposals proceeding to ministers," Chris Carter said.

"In future it is intended that the government will only establish marine reserves after they have been through the regional planning and consultation laid out in the policy."

All three of the new marine reserves have been altered in shape and size in response to concerns from different marine stakeholders.
