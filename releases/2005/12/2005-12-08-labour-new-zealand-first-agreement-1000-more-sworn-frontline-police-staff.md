The Government and New Zealand First are committed to working together to provide an additional 1000 sworn police staff over the next three years.

Police Minister Annette King and New Zealand First law and order spokesperson Ron Mark confirmed today that the Government’s confidence and supply agreement with New Zealand First to provide funding over the next three budgets for 1000 more police staff means “1000 more sworn frontline staff”.

“The 1000 will include 250 community constables who will be working as frontline officers,” Annette King and Ron Mark say.

“Further work with the Police Commissioner’s office and with the Police Association is being undertaken to redefine policing with the community in the 21st century.

“We know communities want to see police out and about on their streets, but in some places around New Zealand this works extremely well and in others it is not so effective.

“We want to ensure the role is defined in such a way that it is effective around the whole country. We have no doubt that the more visible police are, the more likely the public is to feel a sense of safety and reassurance.”

Annette King and Ron Mark say that more work is still being done on other aspects of the agreement. “Clearly there are issues around providing equipment and infrastructure for the extra staff, and you cannot simply add 1000 to the sworn numbers over three years without also adding more non-sworn staff in support. We are committed to doing that, and are working through details.”

Recruitment campaigns have already begun, and more are being organized, Annette King and Ron Mark say.

“We detect there is a real buzz among the police at the commitment. They know that in the future they will have the resources, in terms of people, infrastructure and equipment, to provide New Zealanders with the level of police services that they deserve.”
