Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter today urged [ethnic communities](http://www.ethnicaffairs.govt.nz/oeawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/What-We-Do-Research-Index?OpenDocument) all over New Zealand to ignore a poster campaign calling for race riots in Wellington.

"These posters are pathetic and their hateful message has been treated with contempt by most New Zealanders," Mr Carter said.

"Unfortunately, due to the events in Sydney and the high profile given to them it is probable we will see more adolescent stunts like these posters over the next few weeks. I'd ask ethnic communities to ignore them, and to remember that New Zealand doesn't suffer from the kind of social problems that Australia faces.

"In my time as Ethnic Affairs Minister, I have met a large cross section of New Zealand communities and I can safely say the vast majority would never countenance race riots, quite the opposite. These posters are the work of a tiny, isolated minority, and the police are keeping a close eye on them.

"If there are ethnic communities or families in New Zealand that need assistance at this unsettling time, my door is always open. You can contact my office on ph 04 470 6887."
