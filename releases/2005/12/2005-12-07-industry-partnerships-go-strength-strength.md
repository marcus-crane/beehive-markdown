The government’s award winning Jobs Partnership with Industry programme is proving highly successful in upskilling unemployed people and addressing skill shortages.

Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment Winnie Laban today launched the latest partnership, with the Electrical Contractors Association of New Zealand (ECANZ). She also congratulated Work and Income for its Highly Commended Award for the partnership programme from the 2005 Bearing Point Innovations Awards.

This new partnership with ECANZ will provide entry level training and job opportunities in the electrical industry including the chance of apprenticeships for people on the unemployment benefit.

Ms Laban welcomed the partnership saying that while it is a small initiative with just 24 placements to be filled by June 2006, six people had already successfully completed their training with four of them having found work in the electrical industry.

"The ECANZ partnership brings the total number of industry partnerships to 16,” said Ms Laban. "These partnerships are paying real dividends in getting unemployed people off benefits. As of 30 June 2005, two thirds of people left benefits within 23 months of participating in the partnerships. This equates to 1,188 people no longer on benefits as a result of this programme."

Demand continues to grow amongst New Zealand businesses for these partnerships. Work and Income is working to develop partnerships with the following organisations and industries:  
§Farming (Agriculture Industry Training Organisation)  
§Joinery Industry Training Organisation  
§McDonalds New Zealand  
§New Zealand Flooring Industry Training Organisation  
§Meat & Wool New Zealand

“Job Partnerships with Industry is part of the Government’s Jobs Jolt initiative and demonstrates our commitment to providing real and sustainable careers for unemployed people," said Ms Laban.
