Prime Minister Helen Clark will attend the East Asia Summit (EAS) in Kuala Lumpur on 14 December.

The Summit brings together for the first time leaders from the ten Association of Southeast Asian Nation (ASEAN) countries, ASEAN+3 (China, Japan and the Republic of Korea) and Australia, New Zealand, and India.

Helen Clark said that the New Zealand government welcomes the development of outward-looking and inclusive regional structures, and looks forward to playing a constructive role in the Summit.

“New Zealand is pleased and privileged to be “in the front door” as the EAS develops. The EAS is the first significant addition to regional structures since the establishment of the ASEAN+3 grouping eight years ago.

Helen Clark said she would be visiting New Zealand Trade and Enterprise’s exhibit at the East Asia Business Exhibition 2005 (EABEX) while she is in Kuala Lumpur. The exhibition is being held in conjunction with the ASEAN summit from December 10 - 14.

“NZTE’s participation at EABEX will inform international trade buyers about New Zealand's new thinking in the fields of biotechnology, food and beverages, ICT, and creative design.

"New Zealand exports to EAS countries constitute a significant and growing market for New Zealand – accounting for 53 per cent of all New Zealand’s trade in 2004," Helen Clark said.

Helen Clark will leave New Zealand on 12 December and return on 15 December.
