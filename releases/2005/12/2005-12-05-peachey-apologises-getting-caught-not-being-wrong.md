Steve Maharey says Allan Peachey's apology to Selwyn College does not go far enough.

"All he has done is apologise for getting caught threatening the college, not for being wrong in doing so," Steve Maharey said.

"Clearly he has a view that this college's future would be in question if he were to be a Minister in government at some point in the future. He needs to explain whether he has changed that view or whether the college should continue to feel threatened by him.

"Mr Peachey must provide a convincing statement about how he has changed his view and reassure the college he no longer has a 'knife' in their back. Anything short of this cannot realistically be called an apology."
