Sir John Anderson will be the next Chair of Television New Zealand, Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey announced today.

He has been appointed to the Board as a Director, and will take over as Chair when Craig Boyce retires at the end of April 2006.

“Sir John Anderson is a hugely respected business and community leader, who has demonstrated outstanding leadership over a long career," Steve Maharey said.

“I am delighted that he will be taking up the role of Chair and confident he will provide the leadership and vision to take TVNZ through the next phase of its development.”

Sir John is shortly to retire as the Chief Executive of the ANZ/National Bank. He has had a long and successful career in banking and finance, notable for leading the mergers of the National and Countrywide banks, and more recently the ANZ and National Banks.

Sir John has also held advisory and governance roles for successive governments through the 1980s and 1990s, covering areas as diverse as business, debt management, education and employment.

Sir John has also played a national and international role in sport and the environment. He was appointed Chairman of New Zealand Cricket in 1995 and continues in this role today, as well as being New Zealand’s representative on the International Cricket Council. He became the Chairman of the World Wide Fund for Nature in 1990 and was invited to join the International Board in Switzerland in 1994.

The quality of Sir John’s services was recognised by the conferment of a knighthood (KBE) in 1994, and again in 2005 when he was the inaugural winner of the Blake Medal for demonstrated leadership in many fields – business, sport, environment and the community.
