Prime Minister Helen Clark has marked the tenth anniversary of the Karori Wildlife Sanctuary by presenting a cheque for $80,523 to the Sanctuary Trust, at a ceremony at the 252-hectare site today.

The Karori Wildlife Sanctuary Trust is celebrating its tenth anniversary with the unveiling of a two-metre high bronze sculpture by Wellington artist Jonathan Campbell at the entrance to the site, 10 minutes drive from the centre of the city.

Helen Clark today unveiled the sculpture and presented the cheque to Trust chairman Richard Bentley.

"I am pleased to announce that the government has approved the grant of $80,523 through the Tourism Facilities Grant Programme, for the development of a network of bush and stream trails in the lower valley of the Sanctuary," said Helen Clark.

"The lower valley is the most distant area from the main entrance to be developed, and is one of the largest flat areas in the Sanctuary. The grant will fund a project to build a network of tracks, picnic areas, bird feeding stations, and displays offering interpretations of the stream and rare native plants.

"The Sanctuary attracts around 45,000 visitors every year, and in the last financial year, 15 per cent of visitors were from overseas. It features in the Rough Guide travel publication as one of the top 35 attractions in New Zealand.

"It is a leader in eco-restoration, and has transferred 12 species of birds including little spotted kiwi, kaka, bellbird, and North Island saddlebacks, robins and tomtits.

"The Sanctuary receives significant community support from volunteers and from organisations such as Forest and Bird, and Lions and Rotary clubs. The Department of Conservation has also contributed to resources and expertise in pest control.

"I congratulate everyone involved in the Karori Wildlife Sanctuary Trust on the milestone of the tenth anniversary. The Sanctuary is world-class, and provides a showcase through which visitors from New Zealand and overseas can appreciate more of our unique natural heritage," said Helen Clark.
