The Immigration Advisors Licensing Bill, which would require the mandatory licensing of all immigration advisers, had its first reading in Parliament today.

In his first reading speech, Immigration Minister, David Cunliffe said the Bill would raise the standard of immigration advice and protect the interests of migrants.

"While many immigration advisors provide good services, there are insufficient regulatory constraints or market incentives to prevent some advisers providing unethical or incompetent services," said Mr Cunliffe.

Under the proposed legislation, it would be an offence to provide immigration advice without a licence, unless exempt. Offenders could face a fine of up to $100,000 and or seven years imprisonment.

People exempt from having to hold a licence would include; lawyers, MPs and people providing informal advice, in, for example, a family context.

The legislation would also include offshore advisers who would be able to opt-in to the licensing regime for the first three years, after which it would be mandatory.

The Bill provides for the establishment of the Immigration Advisers Authority, headed by an independent Registrar.

To obtain and hold a licence, advisers must meet competency standards and be "fit" to practise. This includes consideration of any previous convictions.

Licences would need to be renewed annually and details of licensed immigration advisers would be recorded and updated on a public register.

The legislation would bring New Zealand into line with countries such as Australia, Britain and Canada.

Mr Cunliffe said that as a local MP, he had seen the destructive effect of unqualified immigration advice on the lives of constituents.

"This Bill will enhance New Zealand's reputation as a migrant destination," said Mr Cunliffe.

"Migrants, their communities and reputable parties in the immigration sector will welcome it."

The legislation has now been referred to the Transport and Industrial Relations Select Committee.
