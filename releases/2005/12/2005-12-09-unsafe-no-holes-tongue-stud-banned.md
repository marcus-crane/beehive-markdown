The government has banned the sale of the 'No Holes Tongue Stud'.

Recently the Ministry of Consumer Affairs received a complaint from the mother of a nine-year old girl, who inhaled an imitation tongue stud while playing and had to undergo surgery to remove it from her lung.

“Due to concerns about the 'No Holes Tongue Stud', I have issued an Unsafe Goods Notice, banning the sale of this product," Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard said today.

The 'No Holes Tongue Stud' poses a choking hazard and, as seen with the recent incident, it can also be inhaled into the lungs or airways of the wearer causing a potentially serious injury.

“This time the supplier did act responsibly and removed the 'No Holes Tongue Stud' from sale at the request of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs,” Judith Tizard said.

“However, this does not prevent another supplier from importing the product again.”

The Unsafe Goods Notice for the ’No Holes Tongue Stud' is issued under section 31 of the Fair Trading Act. The Commerce Commission is responsible for enforcing an unsafe goods notice in the marketplace. Breaches of an unsafe goods notice attract penalties of up to $60,000 for an individual and up to $200,000 for a company.

"If consumers find the ‘No Holes Tongue Stud’, they should report this immediately to the Commerce Commission by calling 0800 94 3600,” Judith Tizard said.

Consumers can call the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, freephone 0508 627 774 (0508 MAPSS Info) if they find unsafe products or visit the Ministry’s website for further information: [www.consumeraffairs.govt.nz](http://www.consumeraffairs.govt.nz)
