Education Minister Steve Maharey today expressed his support for the New Zealand Qualifications Authority.

"Acting Chief Executive Karen Sewell has assured me she is running an open and transparent process," Steve Maharey said. "I am not prepared to accept criticism of the process from what amounts to three anonymous people emailing the opposition spokesperson, whose open hostility to NCEA makes it difficult to believe he is doing anything other than seeking to destroy the assessment system.

"Karen Sewell has openly requested that any marker who has any concerns to phone her directly so issues can be fixed if they exist."
