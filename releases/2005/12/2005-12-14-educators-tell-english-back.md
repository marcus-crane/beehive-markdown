The education sector is united in its view that Bill English has overstepped the mark in his attacks on the NCEA, Education Minister Steve Maharey said today.

"The education sector has sent a clear message that Bill English should end personal attacks on NZQA Acting Chief Executive, Karen Sewell, stop trying to destroy the credibility of the NCEA, and become more informed about the process," Steve Maharey said.

"The government has moved to reassure people that marking is going according to plan and that when there are problems NZQA is being up front and transparent in dealing with them.

"Karen Sewell has openly requested that any marker who has any concerns phone her directly so issues can be fixed if they exist."

Steve Maharey said he was releasing an email today (attached) that was typical of the many people who were commenting on NCEA and the marking process.
