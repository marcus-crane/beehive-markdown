Education Minister Steve Maharey has reassured students that the NCEA system is working and that there is no cause for concern around this year's biology exam.

"In the case of the Biology exam there has been a routine adjustment made to the marking schedule after looking at a test batch of scripts," Steve Maharey. "The process has not been stopped and the papers have not been reassessed.

"It is very important people understand that issues will arise around NCEA. What is also important is that NZQA is dealing with these issues quickly and as part of the system.

"It is worth reiterating the eight key steps of the marking process, which were introduced following a State Services Commission Report in July this year:  
1\. The examiner writes a draft marking schedule for the paper  
2\. The chief marker marks a number of “test scripts”  
3\. Adjustments may be made if the marking schedule is not clear enough, not comprehensive enough, or too specific  
4\. Markers are then trained using the adjusted marking schedule  
5\. A further batch of papers are marked and checked  
6\. The marking schedule can then be altered if necessary  
7\. Marking proceeds  
8\. If the pattern of results is unexpected marking can be halted and adjustments made to the marking schedule

These are exactly the steps that are being followed for the Biology and English papers on which there has been recent media comment.”
