The formation of Woodco, the Wood Council of New Zealand, is a very positive development according to Forestry Minister Jim Anderton.

"I congratulate the forestry industry on the establishment of their new pan-industry grouping 'Woodco'. By coordinating, cooperating and sharing new ideas the industry will be better able to take a strategic approach to the industry's development into the future.

"This will further enhance the work industry and government are doing together as part of the Forest Industry Development Agenda. The five key work areas under the FIDA are market development; market access; education & training; bio-energy; and excellence in wood engineering design.

"I look forward to working with Woodco on lifting the performance and value of our forestry industry," Jim Anderton said.
