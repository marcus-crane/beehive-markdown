“The issues raised by the Auditor-General are serious and highlight concerns that the government has been pursuing with Te Wânanga o Aotearoa for some while,” Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen said today.

He was commenting on the tabling in the House of the [Auditor-General’s investigation into the wananga](http://www.oag.govt.nz/2005/twoa/default.htm).

“The poor management of perceived conflicts of interest in the awarding of contracts to family members; the lax accounting for credit card and international travel expenses and the frequent failure to prepare proper business cases for property development and purchase decisions are completely unacceptable in a public sector organisation,” Dr Cullen said.

“Some of these problems reflect the wânanga’s rapid expansion between 1999 and 2003 under the funding framework inherited from the previous National government in which funding was dictated by enrolments and organisations had a lot of autonomy regarding course content and the scope of qualifications offered.

“Those matters have been addressed through the establishment of the [Tertiary Education Commission](http://www.tec.govt.nz); the new emphasis on ensuring quality and relevance in courses and the leverage created by the requirement that institutions develop charters and profiles to justify their funding,” Dr Cullen said.

“The government has also introduced a range of policies to control the growth in student numbers. These include funding caps and constraints on the growth and proliferation of new programmes.”

A number of steps had been taken at the wânanga level since August 2004 when the audit was initiated, to strengthen the wânanga’s financial and internal governance structures and to safeguard the interests of the student population.

[These included](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F22314) the appointment of Brian Roche from PricewaterhouseCoopers as Crown Observer in February 2005 to provide advice to the institution’s council. In March the council agreed to appoint Mr Roche Crown Manager and to delegate to him control of all the council’s financial responsibilities.

“I am confident that the current council, assisted by Mr Roche, will address any unresolved issues raised by the Auditor-General,” Dr Cullen said.

Consultations begun [in May this year](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F22945) to appoint a statutory commissioner to the wânanga had been disrupted by a legal challenge to the legitimacy of the council. The High Court turned back that challenge when it ruled recently that former council members had legally resigned.

“But in light of the progress being made at the wânanga, I have decided not to continue the commissioner process at this time. I will, however, monitor developments closely and reserve the right to take such actions as may prove necessary.

“The government has a duty to protect the students at the wânanga and to ensure that the taxpayer’s dollar is well spent. Thousands of learners who had previously been unsuccessful in education have successfully participated in tertiary learning through the wânanga. We need to build on this platform and to ensure the wânanga’s viability into the future.

“I believe it would be in the best interests of the wânanga if Rongo Wetere listened to some of those closest to him and stood aside as chief executive.

“There is every reason to expect that the wânanga is capable of building on the real achievements which have been masked by governance and management failures. It is the intention of the Crown to work in partnership with the current council to constitute a fully representative council in accordance with Te Wânanga’s constitution,” Dr Cullen said.
