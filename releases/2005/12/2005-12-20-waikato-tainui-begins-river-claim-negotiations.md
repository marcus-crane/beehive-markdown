The Crown and Waikato-Tainui have agreed to recommence negotiations to resolve the tribe’s historical Treaty of Waitangi claims.

Mark Burton, on behalf of the Crown, and Waikato-Tainui co-negotiators signed Terms of Negotiation at Parliament this morning. The Waikato-Tainui co-negotiators are Lady Raiha Mahuta and Tukoroirangi Morgan.

The Terms of Negotiation set out the objectives to guide the negotiations of Waikato-Tainui’s historical Treaty claims. Certain Waikato-Tainui’s claims relating to confiscation of land (raupatu) have already been resolved in a Deed of Settlement signed between the Crown and Waikato-Tainui in May 1995.

In May 2005, the Crown recognised the mandate of the Waikato Raupatu Trustee Company Limited to negotiate the Waikato River claims and to facilitate a process that will provide the opportunity for all hapû and marae of Waikato-Tainui to enter into negotiations with the Crown over their remaining historical claims.

“The Crown is committed to giving priority to negotiating the Waikato-River claims and all remaining claims of Waikato-Tainui,” Treaty Negotiations Minister Hon Mark Burton said today.

“We look forward to progressing negotiations together.”
