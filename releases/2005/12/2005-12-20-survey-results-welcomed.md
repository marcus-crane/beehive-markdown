Finance Minister Michael Cullen today welcomed a [World Bank survey](http://www.doingbusiness.org/EconomyRankings/) rating New Zealand the easiest place of 155 countries to do business. Australia was sixth.

“These international surveys provide an important reminder that, although there is always more work to be done in reducing compliance costs, New Zealand has a lighthanded regulatory regime and a strong pro-business environment.

“The fact that we have been able to combine these with good environmental standards, health and safety protections and respect for workers’ rights is something of which we can all be proud,” Dr Cullen said.

New Zealand ranked first in property registration; second in licensing; fourth for starting a business and for ease of hiring and firing and seventh in getting credit.
