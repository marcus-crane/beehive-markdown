State Services Minister Annette King has announced that the 2005 Mainstream Employer of the Year is the Ministry of Social Development, Work and Income, Oamaru.

Mainstream is a supported employment programme provided by the State Services Commission to people significantly disadvantaged by disability.

Ms King said the Mainstream Programme is a world leader in the development of supported employment programmes. “Mainstream is currently celebrating 30 years of supported employment provision within New Zealand’s State Services.

“The Mainstream Programme plays a big role in delivering one of Government’s key disability strategies, fostering an aware and responsive Public Service. The programme is also closely aligned with the recently launched Development Goals for the State Services.

“ A key role for the State Services is promoting leadership and the development of State servants. The Mainstream programme helps to promote the State Services as employer of choice for all, through its support of workforce diversity. I want to acknowledge all Mainstream participants who have seized this employment opportunity, with just a little help and a lot of determination.”

Mainstream Programme participant Deborah Gracie nominated the 2005 winner, and other Mainstream awards were presented today at a ceremony in Parliament’s Grand Hall to:

Runner Up for Employer of the Year: Cosgrove School, Papakura, nominated by Virginia Olsson.

Merit winners for Employer of the Year: New Zealand Police, Porirua, nominated by Catherine Morrison, and Accident Compensation Corporation, Palmerston North, nominated by Philip Spring.
