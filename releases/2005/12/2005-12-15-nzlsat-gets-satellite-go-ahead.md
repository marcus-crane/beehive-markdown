"Faster broadband and improved broadcasting are just two benefits consumers may see, as the result of the Government approval of a satellite application," says Minister of Communications David Cunliffe.

The conditional approval of the application, submitted by New Zealand company, NZLSAT Limited, is the first step toward the establishment of New Zealand's first satellite network.

"The venture could mean increased capacity for broadband, broadcasting and civil and government communications," said Mr Cunliffe.

In the application, NZLSAT indicated that a New Zealand registered satellite network would enhance competition and choice for the telecommunications industry in New Zealand.

"Better access to ICT is a priority and is an integral part of the Government's Digital Strategy, " said Mr Cunliffe.

Other potential benefits included improved access to satellite services for military and civil emergency agencies.

A conditional contract between NZLSAT and the Ministry of Economic Development has been formally signed, with NZLSAT beginning a programme of work towards a launch in 2010.
