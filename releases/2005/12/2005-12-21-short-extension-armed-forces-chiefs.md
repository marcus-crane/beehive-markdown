The Chief of Defence Force and chiefs of the Army and Air Force will have their contracts briefly extended until 30 April next year, Defence Minister Phil Goff announced today.

Planning commenced last month to find replacements for the Chief of Defence Force, Air Marshal Bruce Ferguson, the Chief of Army, Major General Jerry Mateparae, and the Chief of Air Force, Air Vice Marshal John Hamilton. All three contracts were due to expire in February.

"The short extension will assist with managing the transition process as well as providing more time to complete a thorough selection and appointment process, given the approaching holiday period," Mr Goff said.
