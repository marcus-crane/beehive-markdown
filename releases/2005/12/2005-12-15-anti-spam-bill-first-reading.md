The Unsolicited Electronic Messages Bill, which aims to regulate Spam, had its first reading in Parliament today.

In his first reading speech, Information Technology Minister, David Cunliffe said that in just a few years Spam had gone from being a minor nuisance to being a significant social and economic issue.

"The degree of public concern and growing cost to our economy have made it clear that it is now time for specific anti-Spam legislation, "said Mr Cunliffe.

The legislation would see mass-marketing emails and text messages only being sent to people that have "opted–in" – or consented to be on the mailing list.

Senders of non-commercial promotional messages would be required to stop sending their material if a recipient wanted to "opt-out" of further mailings.

Mr Cunliffe said recent data showed that electronic bulk mail accounted for 65% of all email traffic, up from just 8% in 2001.

"Spam is also being used for phishing attacks, identity theft and for delivering computer viruses," said Mr Cunliffe.

Not only will the Bill support New Zealand's participation in international initiatives to fight Spam, it will also prevent overseas Spammers viewing New Zealand as a safe haven.

Maximum penalties of $500,000 for organisations and $200,000 for individuals aim to deter professional spammers looking to operate from New Zealand.

The Department of Internal Affairs would enforce the legislation as it already has expertise in carrying out laws relating to electronic content.

The Bill has been referred to the Commerce Select Committee
