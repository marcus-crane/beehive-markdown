A new resource to help community and voluntary organisations manage their legal risks and responsibilities will be launched today at the Community Law Centre by Winnie Laban, Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector.

"Keeping It Legal: E Ai Ki Te Ture" is a joint initiative between the New Zealand Federation of Voluntary Welfare Organisations (NZFVWO) and the Office for the Community and Voluntary Sector (OCVS).

"Government is committed to working with community to achieve shared goals in order to strengthen communities. This resource is an example of such a partnership. It will be much sort after from sporting, recreational and environmental clubs to community and social service agencies." says Winnie Laban.

The resource was developed to meet a need identified by a range of community organisations, groups, trusts and societies for a simple, accurate, centralised source of information about their legal obligations.

"It is designed as a starting point for people in voluntary and non-profit organisations who want to know about laws that may affect them and what they need to do to meet their legal obligations." says Winnie Laban.

Keeping It Legal: E Ai Ki Te Ture consists of four brochures that cover how the law affects community organisations; legal entities; laws covering people, premises and the environment; and compliance and insurance. These brochures are supported by 17 fact sheets.

"The fact sheets summarise information about legal requirements and responsibilities and list useful references. They cover topics such as incorporation; trusts and boards; national, local and branch structures; companies and other structures; the Charities Commission; taxation; health and safety; insurance; and the Human Rights Act." says Winnie Laban.

A limited number of hard copies have been printed, but due to the fact that legislation changes, this resource is seen primarily as an online resource. Updates will be available online.
