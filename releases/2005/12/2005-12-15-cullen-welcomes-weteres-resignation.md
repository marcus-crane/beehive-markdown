Rongo Wetere’s decision to resign as chief executive of Te Wananga o Aotearoa was today welcomed by Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen.

“Dr Wetere’s contribution to the wananga and to Maori education in general was large but his departure will make it easier for the wananga to move on.

“The current wananga council and the Crown Manager have made huge progress in dealing with the governance and management failures highlighted in the Auditor-General’s report.

“I am confident that they will now be able to bring these issues to full resolution,” Dr Cullen said.
