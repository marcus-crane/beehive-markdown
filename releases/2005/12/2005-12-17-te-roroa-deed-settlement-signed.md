The Crown and the Te Roroa Negotiators have today signed the Deed of Settlement for the settlement of Te Roroa’s historical claims, Treaty Negotiations Minister Mark Burton has announced.

The signing of the Deed of Settlement follows its ratification by the people of Te Roroa during November and December 2005. The Deed was agreed between the Crown and negotiators on 10 September 2005, and was based on an Agreement in Principle signed on 20 December 2004. Te Roroa have also ratified a governance entity to receive the settlement assets. The settlement was supported by 92 per cent of those who voted. The settlement will be implemented through legislation during 2006.

The settlement includes:  
·acknowledgements of, and a Crown apology for, historical breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles;  
·a cultural redress package including the transfer of several sites of cultural significance to Te Roroa; and  
·financial redress totalling $9.5 million, which Te Roroa will receive as a combination of Crown-owned properties and cash.

"Te Roroa and the Crown have been in negotiations over many years since the release of the Waitangi Tribunal’s Te Roroa Report in 1992. The Te Roroa claim has often been viewed as a wahi tapu claim, reflecting the number of significant cultural and archaeological sites across their rohe," Mark Burton said.

"The negotiations have been long and comprehensive. I am very pleased to able to announce the signing of the Deed settling Te Roroa’s historical Treaty claims.

"Achieving a signed Deed within 12 months of the Agreement in Principle is remarkable, and I commend the dedication of the negotiators in working so hard towards this goal. I am also pleased that the people of Te Roroa have shown such clear support for the settlement, with good participation in the voting, and resounding approval,” Mark Burton said.
