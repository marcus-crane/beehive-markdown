The Minister for Transport Safety, Hon Harry Duynhoven, today challenged New Zealanders to reach the end of 2005 with fewer than 400 road fatalities.

Mr Duynhoven said New Zealand was on track to achieve the lowest road toll in over 40 years.

Over the past 10 years, the road toll has been trending downwards; in 1995, there were 582 fatalities. So far in this calendar year 382 road deaths have occurred.

“If the current trend is maintained until the end of 2005, the road toll could be less than 400 deaths which would be a great achievement by road users.

"If New Zealanders can maintain or improve on their current driving performance in the remaining days of 2005, then at least 35 more families than last year will be enjoying their New Year’s Day instead of dealing with the trauma of a fatal road crash,” said Mr Duynhoven today.

He encouraged motorists to keep the following tips in mind over the holiday period:

Always ensure everyone is wearing their seat belt.

Ensure you get enough sleep before driving. If you feel tired, pull over somewhere safe and secure and take a short nap.

Don’t drink and drive – even one drink can affect your judgement.

Slow down and drive at a speed suitable for the conditions, watch your following distances and look out for vulnerable road users such as children, pedestrians and cyclists.

Be patient and courteous.

Be visible – ride or drive with headlights on.

The Government’s Road Safety to 2010 strategy aims for no more than 300 deaths and 4,500 hospitalisations by the end of 2010.
