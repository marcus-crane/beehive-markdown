The Minister of Agriculture, Biosecurity and Forestry, the Minister for Trade Negotiations and the Minister of Trade received the [ObjectID=EF987074-98D7-4539-850DA634D7805A82"&gt;]()

long-awaited draft Import Risk Analysis (IRA) on New Zealand apples from the Australian High Commissioner, Allan Hawke, at the Beehive today.

The Ministers have welcomed the release of the draft apples IRA by Biosecurity Australia, the body that sets that rules for imports, “even though this has taken far too long.”

The Ministers indicated that the draft IRA recommends that the Australian Government grant market access to New Zealand apples under certain conditions to all states except Western Australia.

“Although the draft IRA acknowledges in principle that New Zealand apples should be allowed in to Australia, we have some serious concerns around the conditions that have been put on access.” The Government will study the document further and prepare a detailed submission.

A decision by the Australian Government to allow importation of New Zealand apples would overturn the 84-year ban on New Zealand apples imposed on the grounds that apples might be vectors for transmission of the plant disease fire blight.

This release of the IRA was the next step required in the process to get New Zealand apples accepted for import to Australia.

“New Zealand will work co-operatively with Australian officials to expedite this process and get New Zealand apples into Australia,” the Ministers said.

[Biosecurity New Zealand](http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/) would now need to study the detail of Biosecurity Australia’s conditions for market access and will respond within the comment period, which ends 30 March 2006.

**Questions and Answers**

***What is in the report?***

The draft IRA is a very detailed analysis of the risks of importation of New Zealand apples to Australia.

Officials will need time to analyse the draft report in depth.

This analysis will have to be undertaken before further comment can be made.

***Why has Western Australia been excluded?***

Western Australia claims to be free of apple scab (black spot).

The draft IRA finds no risk management measures to adequately address this disease except for a complete prohibition on access.

***How does this relate to the Japan apples case?***

The New Zealand Government has argued for a good many years that the grounds for removing the import ban on New Zealand apples were compelling, as study after study has found no scientific evidence that apples in commercial trade carry fire blight.  
The New Zealand position was vindicated earlier this year, following the ruling by the World Trade Organization (WTO) in the US-Japan apples dispute, which found that apples in commercial trade do not pose a risk of transmission of fire blight.  
New Zealand took part as a Third Party in the dispute, presenting evidence to the WTO Dispute Settlement Panel demonstrating that Japan’s fire blight-related import controls on apples were not technically justified.

Officials will need to look closely at the draft IRA in order to make an assessment of the consistency of the Australian measures with established WTO jurisprudence.

***What about the WTO?***  
All options remain open at this stage.

***What happens next?***  
The comment period for draft IRAs is usually 60 days. However, in this case, Biosecurity Australia has extended the comment period until 30 March 2006.

These are the next steps:

- Consideration of stakeholder comments on the revised draft IRA report and preparation of a final draft report
- Consideration of the final draft report by an independent Eminent Scientists Group to ensure all stakeholder comments have been taken properly into account
- Preparation of the final IRA report
- Release of the final IRA (30 day appeal period)
- Consideration of appeals, if any
- If there are no appeals or the appeals are rejected, the Director of Animal and Plant Quarantine makes the policy determination
- Notification of the proponent/applicant, registered stakeholders, and the WTO of the policy determination
