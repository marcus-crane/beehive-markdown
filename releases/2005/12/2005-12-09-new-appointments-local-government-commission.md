Local Government Minister Mark Burton announced today that Sue Piper had been appointed as the new Chair of the Local Government Commission.

"Sue Piper has extensive local government experience. She has spent nine years as a Wellington City Councillor for the Southern Ward and as National Councillor for Local Government New Zealand.

"She has governance experience through roles as President of the Public Services Association and as a Government Appointee to the Prostitution Law Review Committee.

"She has also served as the Executive Director of the National Collective of Independent Women's Refuges and she has held various leadership positions in the National Youth Council and New Zealand Young Women's Christian Association."

Mark Burton said that Sue Piper had developed good relationships through her work with these organisations.

Sue Piper replaces Grant Kirby as Chair who has now completed his term of appointment.

"I would like to thank Grant for his time as the Chair of the Commission, and I wish him well with his future endeavours."

Mark Burton also announced the appointment of Wynne Raymond as a member of the Local Government Commission.

"Wynne Raymond is a consultant with Raymond Sullivan McGlashan Solicitors and is a member of the Disciplinary Tribunal of the Canterbury District Law Society. He also has a background with the Timaru District Council that spans 28 years, including most recently serving four full terms as Mayor.

"Local government is an important interface between central government and the real communities of New Zealand. I look forward to working closely with and engaging with the sector," Mark Burton said.

The Local Government Commission is an independent statutory body constituted under the Local Government Act 2002. Its principal task is to make decisions on the structure of local government and representation arrangements of local authorities.
