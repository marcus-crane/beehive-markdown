Education Minister Steve Maharey today responded to further attempts by "lone critic" Bill English to undermine confidence in the exam system.

"NZQA is running an open and transparent marking process which will ensure the results are consistent and fair," Steve Maharey said.

"NZQA's Monitoring and Marking Update issued today is correct. To date, marking has been suspended (and resumed), for 11 out of 335 standards.

"NZQA will continue to release details of remarking as soon as a need has been identified and will do so until all standards are marked.

"All markers have been fully advised of the marking process. If any markers have concerns about the process, including instructions they receive from lead markers, NZQA has processes in place for them to make these concerns known, including, if they wish, contacting Acting Chief Executive Karen Sewell directly."

"The process does not involve any 'unofficial' or 'secret' re-marking as Mr English has suggested. In fact this is the most open and transparent exam process this country has ever seen.

"The fact that NZQA is remarking some standards after adjusting the marking schedule means students, parents and teachers can have confidence that the outcomes this year will be fair and consistent, and that the safeguards put in place are working, and working early."

Steve Maharey said he had forwarded the attached documents to Bill English to assist him to better understand the NCEA system and the marking process.

Note: a 'standard' is only part of an exam paper, not the whole paper
