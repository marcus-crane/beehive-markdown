A project to prevent diabetes and an initiative to link rural people to health services through video conferencing are among the 25 finalists for the 2006 Health Innovation Awards announced today by Health Minister Pete Hodgson.

"The Health Innovation Awards showcase excellence in health treatment and rehabilitation services that benefit all New Zealanders," Pete Hodgson said.

"They recognise and celebrate those working throughout the health sector to develop better products, services and processes to improve disease prevention, treatment, care and recovery. "

The awards were started in 2003 and are a joint project of the Ministry of Health and ACC with support from Telecom. This year 111 expressions of interest for the awards were received which have been narrowed to a group of 25 finalists.

The 2006 Awards have two categories: Innovation and Process Improvement. The innovation category is divided into two sections, large and small innovation, depending on the number of people involved in developing the innovation.

The process improvement category was introduced this year to respond to the large number of process improvement oriented entries received in previous years.

The finalists will now be asked to prepare a detailed application to be submitted by February for evaluation and judging. The New Zealand Business Excellence Foundation manages the independent evaluation process, using international criteria and evaluation processes.

The winners will be announced at a gala Awards Dinner ceremony and presentation in Wellington on 29 June next year.
