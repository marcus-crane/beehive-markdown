Environment Minister David Benson-Pope says briefings released today highlight the value of the natural environment to New Zealand.

The Minister emphasised that environmental policy affects everyone in New Zealand in some way: "It goes well beyond economic value. It is also about the environment's value to our identity and place in the world, and it's intrinsic value – the importance we place on knowing that we have space and natural resources in good condition.''

He acknowledged the tension between those who seek to access natural resources for infrastructure development, irrigation and other human uses and those who want to protect biodiversity and natural landscapes.

"Much of the criticism of resource use decisions comes from the very fact that we must weigh up competing demands and there is often one side left feeling dissatisfied with the outcome.

"The significant package of improvements to the RMA that were recently passed by Parliament were about improving processes and giving people more certainty around costs. But that fundamental tension between groups wanting different outcomes for a resource will always remain."

Mr Benson-Pope says the briefings highlight a need for a more joined-up approach by government with policies which affect rural communities: "The appointment of one Minister responsible for the primary production portfolios in Jim Anderton represents a strengthened focus by government in this regard. I look forward to working closely with him."

The briefings note a priority for the Minister to find a replacement for Barry Carbon, the Ministry's Chief Executive, who has indicated his intention to stand down from the position.

"I have asked Mr Carbon to stay a few months longer whilst we await progress towards his replacement, and he has agreed," Mr Benson-Pope confirmed.
