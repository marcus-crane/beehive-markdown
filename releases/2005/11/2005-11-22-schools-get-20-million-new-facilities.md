A total of $20 million will be provided to 28 schools to build new facilities, Education Minister Steve Maharey announced today.

"This investment will ensure that schools facing high roll growth can build the new facilities they need," Steve Maharey said.

“Schools are able to decide for themselves how the money is best put to use, for example for a new library, hall or teachers' work area."

Steve Maharey said the government had invested $330 million since1999 to clear a backlog in schools needing new facilities. A further $70 million would be invested over the next 2-3 years.

"This investment is making a huge difference to schools around the country. When the programme started in 1999 many schools badly needed additional facilities and were dealing with a system that was unresponsive to their individual needs.

"We are now in a position where schools are well resourced to respond to roll growth and to provide the facilities their students need."

The funding is part of a $400 million property programme for the 2005 financial year - the largest annual investment programmes in school property ever. Grants range from $215,000 to $2.2 million per school.
