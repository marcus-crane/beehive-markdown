From 2007, Children’s Day will have a head start on Mother’s and Father’s Day, Child, Youth and Family Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

Announcing a change in date for National Children’s Day from the last Sunday of October to the first Sunday of March, Ms Dyson said the change was being made to avoid Labour Weekend and take advantage of better summer weather.

“In past years, the last Sunday of October often fell on Labour Weekend, ruling out a number of potential organisers, participants and activities. The change of date will increase community participation and ensure that Children’s Day is an enduring event.”

As a result of the date change, there will be no Children’s Day in 2006.

Ruth Dyson said the change was being announced now so that people could plan ahead.

“People all over New Zealand work hard for months to make the event a success, and some media have made Children’s Day a regular feature. We want to give everybody prior warning and work towards creating a Children’s Day that is even bigger and better in 2007.

“Beginning the year with events that celebrate our children and remind us that the best thing we can give them is our time and love will increase the impact of a day New Zealanders have widely embraced.”

Child, Youth and Family is the implementation agency for Children’s Day. For the last six years, it has been supported by the Children’s Day National Steering Group made up of government and non-government agencies.
