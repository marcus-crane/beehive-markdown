Energy Minister David Parker today released briefings from the [Ministry of Economic Development](http://www.med.govt.nz), the [Electricity Commission](http://www.electricitycommission.govt.nz/) and the [Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority](http://www.eeca.govt.nz).

They are available on the organisations' websites today.

Mr Parker said as the new Energy Minister he had several key areas he would be looking at and these had also been raised in the briefings.

"Energy policy is in a state of flux worldwide due to dramatic price increases and the wide consensus that recognises the threat climate change poses. As a consequence energy is one of the most important issues facing the world. New Zealand is no exception.

"The Speech from the Throne last week showed how committed the government was to addressing energy issues and also outlined the government's plan to develop a National Energy Strategy," Mr Parker said.

"As a country we need to develop alternatives to oil as production peaks and prices rise over the next few decades. The recent volatility of oil prices has shown how dependent the economy is on oil."

Mr Parker said he would be looking at whether the electricity wholesale and retail markets were sufficiently competitive and provided secure supply through new generation plans and transmission upgrades. Energy efficiency was also important.

"Last I week I received the Climate Change Policy review, which looks at our current policies in relation to meeting our emission targets and international commitments. I am considering the review and it will go to Cabinet for consideration in due course.

"In addition, the confidence and supply agreements with NZ First and United future include an undertaking to review the proposed Carbon Tax. As Minister Responsible for Climate Change Issues, I will be taking options to Cabinet shortly to get this underway."
