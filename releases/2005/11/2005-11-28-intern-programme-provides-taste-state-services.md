State Services Minister Annette King says the expanded pilot summer internships are proving to be a big hit with university students.

Ms King, who today met the more than 40 students beginning summer internships with 13 government agencies in Auckland and Wellington, said there was great interest in the internships, with 300 applicants far exceeding the places available.

“The State Services Internship Programme gives students a taste of the variety and challenge of government jobs through summer work related to their studies. The programme is designed to increase student awareness of the State Services as a great career option. The programme promotes the diversity of jobs and huge opportunities available in the government sector.”

The interns are from a range of disciplines, with many expecting to enrol in honours or post-graduate courses in 2006, and this summer’s expanded programme aims to build on the success of last summer’s Victoria University pilot.

Ms King says six of last year’s interns have successfully applied for permanent positions in the public sector, and two others are working on a contract basis.  
Auckland, Waikato and Otago universities have joined Victoria this summer, and the State Services Commission, which coordinates the programme, hopes to include other universities next year.

The 13 host agencies for 2005-06 are Archives NZ, the Civil Aviation Authority, Corrections, Economic Development, Housing New Zealand, Inland Revenue, National Library, NZ Police, Research, Science and Technology, Social Development, State Services Commission, Statistics NZ and Transport.
