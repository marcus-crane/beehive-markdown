Rt Hon Winston Peters, the Minister for Racing, has written to the recognised racing industry organisations inviting nominations for appointment to the New Zealand Racing Board.

Nominations have been invited due to the expiration of a member’s term on 31 July 2005. Because the term ended during the pre-election period, the previous Racing Minister asked them to continue in office until they are either re-appointed or a successor is appointed.

Mr Peters stressed the importance of nominees having a good knowledge of, or expertise in, the racing industry, and/or expertise in business, marketing or economics.

“Racing makes a very significant dollar input into the New Zealand economy. It is, therefore, vital that people wishing to sit on this board have the skills and experience to develop and enhance this important industry.”

The Minister has invited all racing supporters and other interested people to make nominations. “It is important to bring this opportunity to the attention of as many suitably qualified people as we can to ensure we have a strong pool of candidates from which to make this appointment,” Mr Peters said. “We are looking for people who will be able to guide this industry into the future.”

Mr Peters said he has also written to the chairs of NZ Thoroughbred Racing, Harness Racing NZ, and the NZ Greyhound Racing Association requesting their nominations for appointment to each of the available code positions.

“I am confident the three code bodies will nominate people with sound industry knowledge and experience. I am also optimistic that they will bring other relevant skills to the boardroom table.”

Nomination forms and further details about the board’s membership, functions and powers can be obtained from the Department of Internal Affairs website (www.dia.govt.nz) from early next week, or by calling (04) 495 9313.

The closing date for receipt of nominations is 9 December 2005.
