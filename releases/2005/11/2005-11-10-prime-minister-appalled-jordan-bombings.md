Prime Minister Helen Clark today condemned the terrorist attacks which killed more than fifty people in three explosions in Amman, Jordan.

Helen Clark has sent a letter of condolence to the Jordanian Prime Minister, Adnan Badran.

"Terrorist attacks of any kind must be condemned, but those which target innocent bystanders are particularly abhorrent," Helen Clark said.

"As always, our sympathies go first and foremost to the people of Jordan, and those suffering as a result of this attack."

"No New Zealand casualties have been reported. Around seventy New Zealanders are known to live in Amman, where we have an honorary consul.

"Jordan is a strong supporter of stability and peace in the Middle East, and New Zealand recognises and values the role it plays.

"New Zealanders are advised to follow MFAT advice when contemplating travel to the Middle East," Helen Clark said.
