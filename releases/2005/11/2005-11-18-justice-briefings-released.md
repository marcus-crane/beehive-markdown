Justice, Law Commission and Treaty Of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Mark Burton released briefings from the Ministry of Justice, Legal Services Agency, Privacy Commissioner, Electoral Commission, Law Commission, the Human Rights Commission and the Office of Treaty Settlements today.

They are available on the organisations' websites.

Mark Burton said that the government has a responsibility to protect the rights of its citizens, safeguard their security and ensure that the justice system is fair.

"A safe, secure and just society gives every citizen the opportunity to succeed. I am looking forward to building on the resources this government has already committed to fighting crime and the causes of crime, to crime prevention and to early intervention," Mark Burton said.

"In Treaty Settlements the pace of settlements has increased dramatically since the 1990s, when one settlement was reached only every one or two years. Given the complex nature of these negotiations, this government and the groups in negotiations have accomplished a significant amount in the past five and a half years.

"Labour has placed high priority on timely and just settlements, and we are now signing an average of two settlements a year, and progressing legislation faster to implement those settlements.

"The government is continually looking for ways to improve the historical Treaty Settlement process. Our recently announcement policy is to have all historical claims lodged by September 2008 and to settle all claims by 2020," Mark Burton said.
