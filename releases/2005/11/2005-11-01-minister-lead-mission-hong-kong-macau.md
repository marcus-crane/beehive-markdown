The opening of a New Zealand Focus Centre in Hong Kong would be a good showcase for New Zealand business, Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton said today.

Mr Sutton left New Zealand today to lead a short trade mission to Hong Kong and Macau.

He said New Zealand Focus provided a business platform for New Zealand exporters to reach Hong Kong and greater China markets, before committing to a major export drive.

“Getting established in Hong Kong can be a valuable means of securing access to the Chinese market. Hong Kong offers exposure to the growing numbers of Chinese that travel here and can be a gateway to the Mainland.”

Mr Sutton said New Zealand Focus was one of a number of initiatives planned in the North Asia region to help our businesses take advantage of export opportunities in these markets.

“North Asia is an important market for New Zealand goods and services. It is a growing and dynamic region, with a lot of potential for our businesses now and in the future.”

Mr Sutton will also visit Macau to promote New Zealand export opportunities there.

He returns to New Zealand on Sunday, November 6.
