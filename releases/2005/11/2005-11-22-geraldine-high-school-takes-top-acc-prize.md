A student project to identify the extent and impact of violence at their school has won Geraldine High School the top award in an ACC school competition, ACC Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

Presenting the 2005 ACC ‘Look Out for Each Other’ awards at Parliament, Ms Dyson said the project had won the overall winner’s prize as well as the secondary schools prize.

“The students at Geraldine High School had the confidence to address an issue that many find hard to tackle. Through a survey of fellow students, they discovered that violence was a cause of unnecessary injuries and related trauma. They then created an education kit that was used at the school, and followed up with further research that showed the situation had improved.

“The competition’s judges said the students followed the same procedures as ACC in developing and evaluating its own injury prevention programmes. The student’s final evaluation showed they had not only developed good ways of dealing with the issues identified at the school, but that they were working.”

Ruth Dyson congratulated all the award winners in the three categories - early childhood centres, primary schools and secondary schools - for their original and worthwhile solutions to injury prevention.

“The practical nature of many of the entries is most encouraging. For example, some entries will have real benefits in the areas of road safety, sunburn prevention, and school-wide hazard identification.”

She said about 250 school-age children were injured badly enough every week to have to go to hospital, and ACC continued to run the competition so that more young people could learn to experience life fully but safely.

The winners receive prizes of $3000 for first place, $2000 for second place and $1000 for third place. Geraldine High School gets an additional $2000 for being first overall.

**2005 ACC ‘Look Out for Each Other’ school competition winners**

SECONDARY SCHOOLS

- 1st prize: Geraldine High School, for identifying the extent and impact of violence at their school, developing an education kit, and evaluating the results of their efforts, which showed that the situation had improved.
- 2nd prize: Wellington East Girls’ College, for the Bug’s Eye View group’s novel approach to sunburn prevention.
- 3rd prize: Whangarei Boys’ High School, for work by the Sportec Crew who identified that sport injury severity can be reduced if participants use effective padding, and went one step further by combining the padding with polypropylene thermals to make a product that keeps you warm and protected – all in one.

PRIMARY SCHOOLS

- 1st prize: Levin Intermediate, for student-led efforts to make their playground safer. Students portrayed the important issue of child falls in a video involving fellow students, staff and members of their local community in efforts to turn their dangerous playground into one that will be user-friendly and exciting to use.
- 2nd prize: Whau Valley School, Whangarei, who have made their school safer by focusing on the speed of traffic outside their school gate. This is an issue that local councils are now able to address by setting lower speed limits where they think it appropriate.
- 3rd prize: Fendalton School, Christchurch, for their efforts to make the journey safer for students who ride scooters to school, and for getting the wider community on board, with parents contributing their time and energy.

EARLY CHILDHOOD CENTRES

- 1st prize: Bluff Kindergarten, for a novel, colour-coded method of raising awareness of the relative risks posed by various fixtures and features within the centre’s environment.
- 2nd prize: Casa Dei Bambini Foundation School, Christchurch, for a comprehensive slips and spills education package for children and staff.
- 3rd prize: Poppies Early Childhood Centre, Auckland, for improving road safety outside their centre.
