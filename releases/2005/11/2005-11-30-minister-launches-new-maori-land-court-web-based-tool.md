"This great new tool continues our progress in modernising New Zealand Courts to be able to cope in a modern age with higher demands for information," said Mr Barker

From today, Maori landowners will be able to log on to the Maori Land Court's website at www.justice.govt.nz/maorilandcourt and conduct a search of their Maori-land shares. Lists of current owners, names of trustees and reports giving details of activities on blocks will also be available.

"There have been significant changes to the way administration of the Maori Land Court is managed with major investments in technology being made in the last ten years. Maori Land Online is one of the benefits of that investment," he said.

"Since 1995 the Maori Land Court has been modernising its core functions and moving from a predominantly paper-based system to electronic processing of applications and enquiries.

"The Maori Land Information System was introduced to the court in 1999 and includes a database of all Maori land blocks. Until recently records of the court were kept on more than 12 million pages of paper within seven district offices. This information could only be viewed by traveling to the district office where it was housed and in some cases it was necessary to protect documents because of their age and significance. The Maori Land Information system enables Courts to preserve these precious records for their historical significance.

"The court maintained paper-based processes that were almost 140 years old and it could take days, weeks and sometimes months to collate information between regions, this also involved inconvenience and expense to the client.

"Maori Land Online is a link to duplicate data taken from the Maori Land Information system. The technology means the Court is able to make the information it uses available to all Maori landowners via the Internet," said Mr Barker.

The decision to activate Maori Land Online relied largely on the positive reaction received for the proposal during consultation and the feedback collected at demonstrations of the pilot application. Submissions from key groups like the Maori Land Court Consultation Forum, Maori organisations and Maori land administrators were also included in the process.
