Leader of the House Michael Cullen announced today that the government would support Margaret Wilson to be returned as Speaker and National list MP Clem Simich as Deputy Speaker.

“It is hoped that this balanced approach will assist toward a more disciplined and constructive spirit in Parliament,” Dr Cullen said.

He said that, as Assistant Speaker in the last Parliament, Mr Simich had gained a reputation for impartiality.

The government’s nominations for Assistant Speaker will be Ross Robertson and Ann Hartley.

Ann Hartley was Deputy Speaker in the last term and Ross Robertson an Assistant Speaker.
