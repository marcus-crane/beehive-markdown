New Zealand’s next Ambassador to France will be career diplomat Sarah Dennis, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

“New Zealand’s relations with France are excellent. This year marked 60 years of diplomatic relations.

“France is one of New Zealand’s key partners in Europe and our economic links are significant. Two-way trade exceeds $1 billion and investment flows and business networks are expanding.

“In addition there is a rich cultural dimension to the relationship and extensive people-to-people contacts.

“New Zealand also welcomes the growing cooperation it has with France in the Pacific in areas such as maritime surveillance and disaster relief. As a founding member of the European Union, France remains an important voice in the enlarged Union.

“While we have differences in some areas of agricultural trade, New Zealand attaches importance to the dialogue it has with France on these issues,” Mr Peters said.

The New Zealand Ambassador to France is also New Zealand’s Ambassador to the OECD and to UNESCO.

Ms Dennis joined the Ministry in 1968, and has previously served in Paris, London, New Caledonia, Ottawa and as High Commissioner to Malaysia.

She is currently Director of the Europe Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

She takes up her appointment in April next year, replacing Adrian Macey who is returning to Wellington.
