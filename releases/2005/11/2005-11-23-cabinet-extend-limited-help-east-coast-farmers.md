Further Taskforce Green help and the rural assistance and New Start programmes are to be extended if necessary to cover growers affected by recent floods in Gisborne and Tolaga Bay, and the Government would pay up to $25,000 as its share of a feasibility study on the establishment of flood protection measures in Tolaga Bay, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said today.

However, Cabinet has decided not to fund a full agricultural recovery package.

“Farming is vulnerable to a wide variety of weather events – frost, hail, floods, drought, tornados, and so on. This Government stands with people in need, but there is serious need for discussion between central government, local government, and the primary sector and land-based industries about risk management and the role that central government will play in funding recovery costs for such events. Government aid has been provided on the basis that no regional economy is left devastated by serious weather events, but the scale of the recent East Coast event is not considered significant enough to meet current criteria.”

Mr Anderton said work was being done by Government departments, including the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, to develop a long-term framework for assistance to communities hit by natural disasters.

“Representative organisations of all stakeholders will be consulted on the development of a comprehensive plan for such decisions so that everyone is crystal clear as to what central government will or won’t be responsible for and how weather risk will be managed by the industry and individuals affected.

In the meantime, MAF and Social Development Ministry officials will continue to carefully monitor how people in the affected areas of the East Coast are coping, and if situations change, the Government would be prepared to re-visit assistance requests, he said.

“The Government has already provided a $150,000 flood assistance package to assist the recovery process.

“This package includes $70,000 for Enhanced Task Force Green personnel, $20,000 for heavy equipment hire and $60,000 for unforeseen costs.”
