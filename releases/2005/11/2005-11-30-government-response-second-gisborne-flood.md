The second Gisborne flood event is not a significant enough regional or national weather event to justify a full central government agricultural recovery assistance package. However, individual cases where growers have been hit twice, by this event and the Labour weekend event, may be assessed for special assistance, according to Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton.

"It is tragic that some growers in Gisborne, who have replanted since the first flood, have now been hit again. I think it is only reasonable to take a careful look at the cumulative damage in these instances and consider what additional assistance may be appropriate.

"This flood event is smaller than the Labour weekend one and does not meet criteria for assistance in terms of a full agricultural recovery package. These criteria are difficult to meet and require that the event is rare, extreme, economically significant at a regional and national level, and that government assistance is essential for recovery.

"In the interests of being fair to all New Zealanders, we must draw a line across previous flood damage responses and now look to the future. It is quite possible that New Zealand will suffer adverse weather events more frequently than in the past because of climate change and therefore a new response plan must be drawn up in consultation with local government, and industry representatives.

"The assumption that the government will help out every time people are affected by bad weather has gained currency so expectations have to be lowered. But there are opportunities for central government to work in partnership with the primary sectors and local government to reduce the potential level of damage caused by such events.

"Standard assistance includes enhanced task force green workers, income support, flexible tax provision by the IRD and new start grants aimed at acutely affected individuals and businesses who may be contemplating exiting the industry," Jim Anderton said.
