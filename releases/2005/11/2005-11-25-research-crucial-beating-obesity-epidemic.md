Research crucial to beating obesity epidemic  
The work of the New Zealand research community is critical in the fight against obesity, Health Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

"There are many ways we can address obesity, but the foundation for all solutions lies in an excellent evidence base," Pete Hodgson said. "Research is the best tool we have in beating the obesity epidemic."

Speaking at the inaugural Otago Obesity Research conference in Dunedin, Pete Hodgson encouraged researchers to continue to build strong links with each other and with the work being carried out as part of the government's Healthy Eating, Healthy Action strategy.

"The epidemic of obesity that is upon us requires research findings to be turned into actions. Communities urgently need 'how to' and 'can do' messages. Solutions range from families playing together more often and committing to eat healthy foods.

"We should be under no illusions about the risks associated with obesity – it is among the most pressing challenges faced by our health system and by our society.

"The challenge of obesity requires researchers from across New Zealand to work together. Only through collaboration will we develop the solutions necessary to beat the epidemic."
