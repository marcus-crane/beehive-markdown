Minister Responsible for the Law Commission Mark Burton announced today that he had recommended Sir Geoffrey Palmer for appointment as the new President of the Law Commission.

"I have recommended the appointment of Sir Geoffrey to the Administrator of the Government, the Rt Hon Dame Sian Elias," Mark Burton said.

"I believe Sir Geoffrey's many years of eminent experience in the law will be a tremendous asset to the Law Commission.

"As a former Prime Minister, Sir Geoffrey is both well known and highly respected throughout New Zealand. Sir Geoffrey was a foundation partner of the public law firm Chen & Palmer. From 1984 to 1989 he was the Attorney-General and the Minister of Justice. He was formerly a professor of Law at Victoria University in Wellington and a Distinguished Visiting Lecturer at the University of Iowa, USA. Sir Geoffrey is currently the Chairperson of the Legislation Advisory Committee," Mark Burton said.

The principal statutory functions of the Law Commission are:  
·To take and keep under review in a systematic way the law of New Zealand  
·To make recommendations for the reform and development of the law of New Zealand.  
·To advise on the review of any aspect of the law of new Zealand conducted by any Government department or organisation and on proposals made as a result of any review  
·To advise the Minister of Justice and the responsible Minister on ways in which the law of New Zealand can be made as understandable and accessible as is practicable.

"The Administrator will formally confirm the appointment of the President of the Law Commission on Monday," Mark Burton said.

Sir Geoffrey will replace Justice Bruce Robertson, who resigned in June following his appointment to the Court of Appeal.
