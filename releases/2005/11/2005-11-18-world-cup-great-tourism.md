The Minister of Tourism, Damien O’Connor, says that the win for the Rugby World Cup will be a boost for tourism operators all over New Zealand.

"The Rugby World Cup will be of benefit to far wider regions than just where the games are held. We saw with the Lions Series that visitors really spread themselves over the country, they didn’t just limit themselves to places where the games were held, they travelled around and experienced the country, they really got out there and explored. With that many more people coming for the Rugby World Cup this effect will be even more pronounced," Mr O'Connor said .

Tourism is now an integral part of the economy, from the smallest most remote settlements to the large urban centres like Wellington, Christchurch and Auckland. It directly and indirectly accounts for one in 10 jobs in New Zealand.

While New Zealand is seen as a 'hot destination', it can not afford to rest on its laurels.

"What impressed me with the Lions’ Series was the way that New Zealanders really got behind it, welcoming the visitors and ensuring that they went home really happy with their experience here.

"We now have to make sure we do it again, by preparing well so that we can provide the rugby fans with a memorable, quality experience. New Zealanders really laid out the welcome mat for the Lions, and I hope they will do the same for the rugby fans that come here for the World Cup". Mr O'Connor said.
