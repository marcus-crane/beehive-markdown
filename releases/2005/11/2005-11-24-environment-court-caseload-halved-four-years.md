"The caseload faced by the Environment Court at the end of June 2001 was some 3,137 cases. As at the end of June 2005 the caseload had been reduced by over 50% to 1,566," said Mr Barker

The labour-led government has implemented several initiatives including a new case management regime, extra judicial and administrative resources, and contemporaneous digital evidence recording.

"We have put in a substantial effort to try and assist the Environment Court in getting its caseload down. The court has been overburdened with complex historical appeals on District Plans from the 1990s.

"Dealing with this backlog has been a difficult process but with the efforts of the Judiciary, extra resources provided to the court in 2002/03, and these recent initiatives the caseload has been more than halved.

"This is great news.

"Further enhancement to the operating environment of the court will include a new database in March 2006 that will enable an even more effective case management process.

"Congratulations to members of the Judiciary and to Ministry of Justice officials for their contribution and hard work to achieving this successful result," said Mr Barker.
