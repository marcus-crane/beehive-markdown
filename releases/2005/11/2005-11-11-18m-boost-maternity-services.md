An extra $18 million per year will be invested in primary maternity services, Health Minister Peter Hodgson announced today.

The increase represents a 17 per cent funding boost under the Section 88 Maternity Services Notice.

"This is a significant increase that recognises the demands placed on maternity service providers," Pete Hodgson said. "This is the first price increase since 2002 and comes after extensive consultation with Lead Maternity Carers."

The Ministry of Health began consulting on a proposal to vary prices in the Section 88 Maternity Services Notice on 20 June 2005. The consultation period lasted twelve weeks and concluded on 15 September 2005.

During the consultation period the Ministry met with the New Zealand Medical Association and the New Zealand College of Midwives. Forty submissions were also received.

Approximately 88 per cent of the additional funding will be applied to prices affecting Lead Maternity Carers. The new prices will be effective from 16 December 2005.

Pete Hodgson said the latest funding increase was just one step in an ongoing process to meet the needs of the evolving maternity care sector.

"I recognise that more needs to be done in the sector. The Ministry of Health is aware of the issues affecting maternity services and is working to address them. Work is currently underway to complete a detailed work force analysis."

The review of Section 88 was conducted in two parts to ensure that the increase in prices was available to the sector as soon as possible. Part 2 of the review will involve changes to business rules, service specifications and quality requirements.

The Ministry hopes to have a proposal for consultation with the New Zealand Medical Association and the College of Midwives early next year.
