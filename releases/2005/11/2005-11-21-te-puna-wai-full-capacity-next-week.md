Te Puna Wai, the new youth justice residential centre at Rolleston, will be operating at full capacity by the beginning of next week, less than a month after it opened, Child, Youth and Family Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

The residence opened on 26 October with the capacity for 32 young people. It replaces the youth justice wing at Kingslea Residential Centre and increases the total number of youth justice beds around the country by 12.

“Child, Youth and Family has increased the number of residents in Te Puna Wai gradually over the last four weeks in order to ensure the safety of both the young people and staff.

“Since its opening, the residence has been fully-staffed for the appropriate number of young people in care. However, a staggered approach was always the department’s intention. The numbers of young people have increased as quickly as possible, given the need for site-specific training of the new staff in the routines, systems and safety procedures of the new residence.

“Last Friday, 18 November, there were 28 young people in the residence. Tomorrow (22 November) there will be 30 young people, and by next Monday (28 November) there will be the full complement of 32.

“When the residence is running at full capacity, I expect to see a reduction in the number of young people in police cells. I have also asked Child, Youth and Family to pursue every other safe option to reduce the number of young people being held in police cells inappropriately,” Ruth Dyson said.
