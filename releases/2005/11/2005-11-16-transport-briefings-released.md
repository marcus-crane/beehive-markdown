Transport Minister David Parker today released briefings from the [Ministry of Transport](http://www.transport.govt.nz/publications/briefing-2005/index.php), [Transit](http://www.transit.govt.nz/), [Land Transport New Zealand](http://www.ltsa.govt.nz/), [Maritime New Zealand](http://www.maritimenz.govt.nz/) and the [Civil Aviation Authority](http://www.caa.govt.nz/).

They are available on the organisations' websites today.

Mr Parker said an effective transport system was vital to New Zealand's continued prosperity.

"These briefings make it clear that the transport sector as a whole has benefited greatly from the Labour government almost doubling land transport funding over the last four years. More money than ever before is going into new roads, maintaining existing ones and public transport."

Mr Parker said the briefings also showed there were several issues that needed attention. These included:

- Balancing transport needs with available funding
- Road safety
- Tolling
- Auckland's transport needs.

Mr Parker said he would be in Auckland on Friday to meet representatives from the Auckland Regional Council, the Auckland Regional Transport Authority, ONTRACK, and central government transport agencies. He expects to broadly discuss the region's transport issues.

Mr Parker will also tour several major Auckland roading projects, including the Central Motorway Junction. On Saturday, he will open the Albany and Constellation Park and Ride Bus Stations.
