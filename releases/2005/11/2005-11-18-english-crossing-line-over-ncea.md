Bill English's ongoing efforts to undermine confidence in the NCEA during exam season are bordering on unethical, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

Mr English claimed today that post-election briefing papers from NZQA 'confirm the worst kept secret in the education system'.

"He must be the only person who thinks these issues have been a secret," Steve Maharey said.

"The briefing to the incoming minister is nothing more than a record of the issues that are well known and well aired.

"Right now NZQA is focussed on making sure we have a good exam season for the 156,000 young New Zealanders who are out there sitting exams.

"Mr English should heed his own advice given on National Radio, and let students get on with their exams without him constantly trying to undermine their confidence."

Excerpt from interview, Morning Report 8 November 20005:

ROBINSON: Okay. So given that you don’t want to undermine confidence in the system at this moment you just make your point, do you, and wait for next year to take it up with them  
ENGLISH: Yes I think that’s right and we need to next year have a very thorough discussion about what they’re doing.
