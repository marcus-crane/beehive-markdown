Revenue Minister Peter Dunne today urged calm on National's finance spokesman, John Key, who 'seems to have worked himself up into a lather' over the proposed carbon tax and the shifting of tax thresholds.

"I recommend that Mr Key take a deep breath and pause for thought before rushing into the very complicated area of lasting tax reform.

"Last week he was discovering capital gains taxes on property where none existed, this week he's moved on to carbon taxes. What will next week's speculation be?

"The fact is that Labour and United Future have entered into a confidence and supply agreement which says a thorough independent review of the carbon tax proposal will be carried out to see if it has any real benefit for New Zealand before going ahead with it," said Mr Dunne.

"When that review is finished will be the appropriate time to see what effect its abolition or otherwise will have on the government's revenues and what the likely flow-on effects are on other tax reforms.

"As always, I welcome Mr Key's positive contributions to the tax debate, but on this issue, I urge him to bide his time," said Mr Dunne.
