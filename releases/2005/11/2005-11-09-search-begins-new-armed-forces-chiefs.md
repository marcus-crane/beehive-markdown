The process for selecting a new Chief of Defence Force and chiefs of the Army and Air Force will begin this month, Defence Minister Phil Goff announced today.

"The Chief of Defence Force, Air Marshal Bruce Ferguson, had advised me that his contract, and those of the Chief of Army, Major General Jerry Mateparae, and the Chief of Air Force, Air Vice Marshal John Hamilton, end in February next year and that succession planning should now commence," Mr Goff said.

"The appointments process will be professional and merit-based, and overseen by the State Services Commissioner and the government.

"The government expects to be able to notify the Governor-General of the recommendations for appointments early in the New Year.

"I'd like to acknowledge the huge contribution that Air Marshal Ferguson has made to the NZDF over the last four years, and equally the contributions of Major General Mateparae and Air Vice Marshal Hamilton.

"Air Marshal Ferguson brought with him to the post of CDF a vision of the Defence Force as being 'Three Services, One Force'. His strong advocacy for this over the past four years has resulted in the NZDF transforming into a truly joint military organisation," Mr Goff said.
