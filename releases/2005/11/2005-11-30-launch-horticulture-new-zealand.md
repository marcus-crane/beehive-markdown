The amalgamation of VegFed, New Zealand Fruitgrowers and New Zealand Berryfruit Growers Federation was completed today with the launch of Horticulture New Zealand. Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton was there to speak at the celebrations.

"You don’t have to be a rural-based MP to recognize that New Zealand’s primary sector industries provide approximately 2/3rds of New Zealand’s exports of goods, and agricultural and horticultural industries combined, contribute over half of New Zealand's total export earnings.

"Here in New Zealand we spend $623 million a year on fresh vegetables and $100 million a year on processed vegetables. The horticulture industry contributes about $4.7 billion a year, including $2.2 billion of export earnings, to New Zealand's economy.

"On top of that, there are more than 7,000 commercial fruit, berry, and vegetable growers, together with the 50,000 workers in permanent and seasonal employment, including those in various processing industries.

"Let us be very clear about this fact. Primary industries are the main drivers of New Zealand’s economic well-being," Jim Anderton said.
