Revenue Minister Peter Dunne tonight moved to correct the very many mistakes made by National's welfare spokeswoman, Judith Collins, in her criticism of reforms to the liable parent debt scheme.

"Mrs Collins is under the misapprehension that the government is planning to wipe half a billion dollars of the money owed. Nothing could be further from the truth.

"The facts are that the debt owed has risen past the $1 billion mark – about 55% of which is made up of penalties for non-payment and the rest from the original payments owed.

"What the government is planning is to encourage more parents back into the habit of paying up by removing the penalties where parents enter into a regular payment scheme.

"If we were to follow Mrs Collins' draconian plan of ruthlessly pursuing all liable parents to the full extent of their debt, then even fewer people would pay up and the half billion dollars of penalty payments would not go to the children involved, but would be a windfall revenue to the government."

Mr Dunne said the eminently commonsense policy is aimed at getting more support to New Zealand children and more liable parents back into the scheme.
