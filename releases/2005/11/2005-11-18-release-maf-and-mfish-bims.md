Primary industries are the only industries New Zealand has that have comparative advantage internationally. They are critically important if the wellbeing of every New Zealander is to be improved, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said today.

Mr Anderton released the Briefings to the Incoming Minister on fisheries, agriculture, biosecurity, and forestry. MAF’s briefing also covers rural affairs and food safety.

He said that sustainable development was an important issue for all primary industries and one that he had asked MAF to take a lead role in focusing on across the sector.

“The efficient allocation of limited resources, while still enabling people to realise their aspirations, is going to be an increasingly difficult issue in the future. We are already seeing conflict over freshwater allocation.

“As the briefing says, land and water resources have significant environmental and social as well as economic value, and rural land plays a key role in recreational activities. The growth potential of the agriculture and horticulture sectors is constrained by the availability of and competition for land and access to water.

“On top of that are the concerns by some groups about the effects farming and cropping can have on the environment and people’s social activities.”

Mr Anderton said sustainability issues were important in fisheries as well.

He said that as a new minister, he was still coming to grips with his new portfolios. But his aim was to work in partnership with our primary industries in order to help them make an even greater contribution to economic growth.
