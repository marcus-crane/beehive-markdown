State Services Minister Annette King has released the report of the State Services Commission into international recruitment arrangements for Public Service chief executives and their application to Paula Tyler, Chief Executive, Department of Child, Youth and Family Services.

Ms King said the report provides a comprehensive summary of practices followed by the SSC when it implements international recruitment for public service chief executives and the circumstance applying to Ms Tyler’s appointment.

“The report makes clear that Paula Tyler has acted professionally and within the terms of her performance agreement. As the State Service Commissioner’s report states: ‘Ms Tyler has made a strong contribution. In hindsight, even with her early departure, she has proved to be a very good appointment and New Zealand had very good service from her.’”

Ms King says the fact that Ms Tyler has decided to leave behind as a donation to charity all the household goods purchased as part of her relocation funds is “a reflection of her goodwill and her integrity.”

The SSC has managed the successful appointment and relocation of nine chief executives from overseas since 1988, when the State Sector Act took effect, Ms King says. The circumstances of Ms Tyler’s early resignation were unique and raised issues that the SSC had not previously had to consider.

“The Government does not object to the payment of relocation costs where it is fair and reasonable in helping a new chief executive to take up their position in another country or city. However, I am concerned with the absence of a contract clause that looks to recover some of the relocation costs in the event of a chief executive leaving their position early. I believe such a clause would help to protect the interests of the New Zealand taxpayer.

“I am assured by the State Services Commissioner, Mark Prebble, that he is taking steps to address the Government’s specific concerns and that future performance agreements will contain a form of repayment clause for relocation expenses in the event of a chief executive choosing to leave early,” Ms King said.
