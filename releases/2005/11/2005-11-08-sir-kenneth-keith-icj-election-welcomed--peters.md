Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters has today congratulated Sir Kenneth Keith on his election to the International Court of Justice.

“This is a well-deserved appointment and fitting tribute to a distinguished legal career.

“I would like to acknowledge the strong support Sir Ken's campaign received from both Australia and Canada, which both lobbied internationally on his behalf, as well as from the Pacific Islands Forum leadership, which endorsed his candidature early in the campaign.

“The result culminates a well-run professional campaign over two years, coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Wellington and involving New Zealand diplomats in most of our overseas posts,” said Mr Peters.
