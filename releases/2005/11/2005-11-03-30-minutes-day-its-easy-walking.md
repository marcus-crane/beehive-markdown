Throughout New Zealand events are being organised to promote active and healthy lifestyles. National Push Play Day is on Friday, November 4 which focuses on getting active.

"I know that getting active is a simple part of my day that keeps energy at a good level and we can all encourage our families to get out and get active," said Nanaia Mahuta.

Your Regional Sports Trust or local council are running Push Play programmes and events right now. For more information about activities in your area, call 0800 ACTIVE (0800 22 84 83).

"Push Play Day is a great way to 'walk the walk' and why not encourage those around you as well, its as simple as walking," said the Minister of Youth, Nanaia Mahuta.
