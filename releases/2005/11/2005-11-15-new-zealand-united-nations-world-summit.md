An official New Zealand delegation is travelling to Tunis (Tunisia) today to attend the United Nations’ second World Summit on the Information Society.

Hon David Cunliffe, Minister of Communications and Minister for Information Technology, said that New Zealand’s participation in the Summit is essential.

“The Summit is about the way that information and communications technologies are changing people’s lives, across the globe.”

The first Summit, held in Geneva in 2003, adopted a Declaration of Principles, focusing on social, economic and cultural aspects of the Information Society, and a Plan of Action for the application of information and communication technologies.

The World Summit principles have been incorporated into New Zealand’s Digital Strategy, which was released in May this year.

“Governance of the Internet has been a major theme going into this Summit. The Internet is an incredible tool to share knowledge and encourage freedom of expression, and it is very important to let it develop as it has done – from the bottom up. New Zealand has been working with a wide range of countries, ranging from our Asia-Pacific neighbours to South America and Africa – where much of the growth and benefits of the Internet will be realised in the coming years – to come up with a consensus for agreement at Tunis,” said Cunliffe.

Winston Roberts of the National Library of New Zealand Te Puna Mâtauranga o Aotearoa will be heading the six-person delegation.

“New Zealand will also be receiving two special mentions as part of the World Summit Awards, which celebrate the best examples of global digital content,” said Cunliffe. “These are Fencepost.com, a unique community/business channel used by Fonterra dairy farmers throughout New Zealand, and the eyeMagic project at the University of Canterbury's HIT Lab NZ, which explores the application of augmented reality technology to children's literature.”

The second phase of the World Summit on the Information Society will be held from 16 – 18 November in Tunis.
