Education Minister Steve Maharey says he wishes students all the best for this year's NCEA and Scholarship exams.

"The huge operation that is NCEA gets underway today," Steve Maharey said.  
"Over 150,000 students will be sitting around 2 million personalised exam scripts over the next few weeks, watched by 5,000 supervisors.

"50,000 students alone will sit level one English this Wednesday.

"I want to wish students all the best with this year's exams. I know they can be a stressful and challenging time."

Steve Maharey said NZQA had worked hard to ensure the process for assessing exams was robust and would meet the expectations of parents and students.
