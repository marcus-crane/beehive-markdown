"I'm pleased about my new portfolio responsibilities and I am looking forward to the challenges in them" said Mr Barker.

"I am looking forward to addressing the issues these portfolios face and in particular I note the importance of the Veteran's Affairs portfolio as 2006 is highlighted as the Year of the Veteran.

"Next year marks a watershed for our returned servicemen and women, it is a significant recognition of the contribution they have made to making our country the wonderful place that it is to live.

"Next year also marks the 90th anniversary of the Royal New Zealand Returned Servicemen's Association and I am looking forward to taking part in the celebrations and marking this important occasions with the dignity they deserve.

"The Civil Defence portfolio is also a responsibility I am pleased to receive. There is a significant amount of work being undertaken to ensure that in the event of a disaster, our nation has the capability to manage itself out of distress.

"The Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management's new National Emergency Management Plan is a much needed standard we need in times when environmental volatility threatens our small island nation with floods, earthquakes and other disasters.
