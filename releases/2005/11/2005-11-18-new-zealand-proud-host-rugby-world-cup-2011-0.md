Prime Minister Helen Clark and Sport and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard said kiwi supporters and rugby fans around the world have much to look forward to after the announcement today that [New Zealand will host the Rugby World Cup in 2011](http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/EN/Home/News/051117+dk+rwc2011.htm).

"This is an incredibly proud moment for New Zealand, thanks to the successful government-rugby union partnership that underlined the New Zealand Rugby Union's bid for the hosting rights. The contest to host the competition was particularly competitive this time, and we are honoured that the International Rugby Board today chose New Zealand to showcase this tournament," Helen Clark said.

Helen Clark took part in the final bid presentation to the International Rugby Board in Dublin earlier today, along with New Zealand Rugby Union Chairman Jock Hobbs and Chief Executive Chris Moller, All Blacks legend Colin Meads and All Blacks captain Tana Umaga.

"It is an enormous vote of confidence in our country's ability to host major events, and also shows the important role that small countries like New Zealand can play in international sporting events," Helen Clark said.

"Like the Rugby Union, we believe this event will be a spectacle to remember - for everyone who loves rugby - the players, and fans and spectators from around the world."

Trevor Mallard praised the commitment and hard work undertaken by the bid team and the many other hard workers who contributed to today's success, not to mention the support from the New Zealand public.

"It is time to celebrate and savour this announcement, before we move to the next stages of work that will lead up to 2011.

"This is hugely positive for not only kiwi rugby, but also because the tournament will deliver significant economic benefits and tourism spin-offs. It's estimated it will attract around 60,000 visitors to New Zealand, generate an extra $408 million to the economy, plus an extra tax take exceeding $90 million," Trevor Mallard said.

The government and NZRU will make cash contributions towards costs of $20 million and $10 million respectively. The cost of bidding is estimated at $3.2 million to date, with the government contributing half.
