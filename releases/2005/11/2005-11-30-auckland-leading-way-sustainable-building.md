Auckland is leading the way in sustainable building Minister for the Environment David Benson-Pope said today.

“There is a compelling case for high quality and well designed buildings that reduce waste and make efficient use of key resources such as land, energy, water and materials," Mr Benson-Pope told gathered guests at the launch of the Sustainable Public Buildings project in Auckland.

"These buildings offer natural light and ventilation, are fresher and healthier, and cost less to run over their lifetime. I am encouraged by the number of sustainable buildings being built in Auckland. Good urban design values contribute to the fabric of the city. The Auckland region is well placed to lead and promote a new sustainable building era."

Mr Benson-Pope singled out the Waitakere City Council for particular praise saying the council had demonstrated public responsibility in incorporating sustainability into their new buildings and community facilities. Over the last seven years, the Council has built four libraries, two community centres, a sports stadium, a swimming pool, and a soon to be completed Civic Centre and transport hub.

“It is heartening to see a local council take the lead in achieving this vision of a more sustainable environment," said Mr Benson-Pope. "I congratulate Mayor Bob Harvey and the bold work achieved by Waitakere City Council.

“Other local councils and public sector agencies are contributing to sustainable building in Auckland and across New Zealand. I look forward to their future successes."

The Sustainable Public Buildings project aims to achieve a public sector commitment to building more sustainable buildings in the Auckland region by 2007. The project is a work strand of the Auckland Sustainable Cities Programme – a three-year regional partnership between central government and Auckland’s seven local councils and the regional council.

Sustainable development is a key priority for central government, which launched the Sustainable Development Programme of Action in 2003. The Ministry for the Environment plays a key role in the Programme, and has contributed $200,000 funding over the last two years.
