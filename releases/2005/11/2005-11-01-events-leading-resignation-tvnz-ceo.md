Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey today received a report from the Board of TVNZ explaining the circumstances of the resignation of CEO Ian Fraser.

"The Board's report explains the circumstances of his departure and makes it clear his resignation was the result of a difference of opinion between CEO and the Board regarding the process for negotiating senior presenter salaries," Steve Maharey said.

"It is unequivocally clear that there was no breach of the editorial independence protocol, enshrined in the 2003 TVNZ Act, nor was there any inappropriate interference in the day to day operations of the company.

"Having been reassured on this matter, I am confident the Board can now get on with appointing an Acting Chief Executive and begin the process of recruiting a new Chief Executive.

"TVNZ is an organisation that has continued to perform extremely well in a competitive environment. Under Ian Fraser, they have made the difficult transition from a Crown Company that was to be sold in the 1990s to a dynamic and profitable public service broadcaster."
