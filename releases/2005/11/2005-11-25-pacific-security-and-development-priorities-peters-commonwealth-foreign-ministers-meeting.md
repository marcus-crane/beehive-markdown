Foreign Minister Winston Peters leaves Malta today having attended the meeting of Commonwealth Foreign Ministers that preceded this year’s Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM).

“At the Foreign Ministers meeting I emphasised the need to provide assistance to vulnerable small states, and to develop effective international strategies against terrorism. I also highlighted the vital importance of concluding the Doha round negotiations.

“I had very good bilateral meetings with New Zealand’s Pacific partners, including Fiji, PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. I also had useful discussions with counterparts from Bangladesh, the Maldives, Pakistan and South Africa, focussing on international security and development issues.

“It is clear from my meetings this week that New Zealand’s contribution over many years to international organisations like the Commonwealth is held in high regard. This was reflected in the support received for our successful candidate for the International Court of Justice. I was pleased to note that in the ICJ vote all 53 Commonwealth member countries voted for Sir Kenneth Keith.

“I briefed the Prime Minister on the outcomes of the Foreign Ministers meeting when she arrived in Malta yesterday. The scene is now set for a successful CHOGM”, Mr Peters said.

From Malta Mr Peters travels to the United Kingdom to undertake a bilateral visit and participate in ministerial-level consultations with the European Union Presidency (currently held by the UK) – a meeting that was scheduled earlier this year.
