Suggestions by John Key that the government is considering imposing a capital gains tax on investment property are “absolute nonsense,” Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

“The claim is without any foundation at all and should be completely ignored,” he said.

“John Key knows this. He’s just playing silly politics and should grow up.”
