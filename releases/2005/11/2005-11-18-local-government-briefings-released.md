Local Government Minister Mark Burton said today that he is looking forward to continuing the close, collaborative working relationship the government has built with the sector over the past six years.

"Local government is an important interface between central government and the real communities of New Zealand. I look forward to working closely with and engaging with the sector, and building on the working relationships I have formed with many local government leaders during my six years as Minister of Tourism, " Mark Burton said.

"The legislation we passed in our previous term supports local government in exercising strong local leadership. This term, we will continue to work closely with local government for the benefit of all our communities.

"We are committed to involving local government at an early stage in policy development, and being open to submissions and suggestions from local government on how policy can be improved."

The briefing to the incoming Local Government Minister from the Department of Internal Affairs was released today. It is available on the organisations' websites - www.dia.govt.nz, www.lgc.govt.nz
