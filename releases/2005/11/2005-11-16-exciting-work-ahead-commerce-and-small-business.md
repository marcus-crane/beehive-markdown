Commerce and Small Business Minister Lianne Dalziel said she is looking forward to a busy time ahead, as the government looks to progress a number of key initiatives.

These are detailed in both the Commerce and Small Business briefings to the Incoming Minister, which were released today.

"I have often felt that there are untapped synergies between the two portfolios, so I am looking forward to working with the business community to explore the potential that is there,” Ms Dalziel said.

"The government’s vision is for New Zealand’s enterprises to be innovative, well-managed and world-class. This requires a high-quality business-law framework, benchmarked against the rest of the world and which underpins a sound and efficient financial sector coupled with high quality regulation that supports innovation and entrepreneurial risk taking, without imposing unnecessary compliance costs on business. The synergy lies in the recognition of the exponentially greater costs that can be imposed on small business, who do not have the economies of scale afforded to large enterprises.

"Given that New Zealand is rated number one by the World Bank as the easiest country of 145 nations for doing business, I have a good starting point for what I hope to be an ongoing dialogue as we develop proposals for improving business and management capability, growing our next generation of entrepreneurs, improving communication and making transactions between business and government easier, and minimising compliance costs.

“New Zealand already has an international reputation as a place for ease of doing business, and my mission is to continue to seek ways to make doing business here easier than anywhere in the developed world,” she said.

The Commerce portfolio includes many of the laws needed to advance the government's objectives around innovation and growth and also has a significant international focus, particularly in relation to trans-Tasman or international harmonisation of laws. These areas include tariff policy, trade remedies, government purchasing, standards and conformance, intellectual property, competition policy, insolvency and the regulation of securities markets. A major priority in the Commerce portfolio is detailed work on KiwiSaver, announced as part of Budget 2005.

“The Associate Commerce Minister, Judith Tizard, will continue to play a crucial role in overseeing legislation and policy relating to intellectual property,” the Minister said.
