One million young New Zealanders have now received their first dose of the Meningococcal B vaccine, Health Minister Pete Hodgson announced today.

"This has been New Zealand's largest ever mass immunisation campaign," Pete Hodgson said. "And it has been tremendously successful."

As at 4 November, public health nurses had administered more than 1.8 million doses of MeNZBTM vaccine in schools, with 77 percent of all school students having completed all three doses.

The figure will rise in the coming weeks as the last schools to start the programme complete the final doses and others run "mop-up clinics" for students who missed a dose.

Nationally, 95 percent of Meningococcal B Immunisation Programme consent forms were returned, with 89 percent of those parents/caregivers opting to have their children immunised at school. Others also consented to vaccination but had it done at their doctor's office and in community clinics.

Pete Hodgson visited Wellington College today to hand-deliver a letter being posted to all schools to update them on the success of the schools-based vaccination campaign and to acknowledge their contribution.

"Vaccinating our young people in schools across the country has been a major effort. The campaign has involved 2,600 schools, 750,000 students and the cooperation of tens of thousands of staff members.

"My thanks to all the people who have made this campaign such a huge success."
