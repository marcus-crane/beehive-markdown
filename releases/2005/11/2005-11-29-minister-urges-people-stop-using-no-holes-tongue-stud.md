A recent case of a nine-year old girl having to undergo surgery, to remove an imitation tongue stud from her lung, highlights that people wearing a ‘No Holes Tongue Stud’ should stop using them immediately.

The ‘No Holes Tongue Stud’ was removed from sale last week at the request of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, after the Ministry received a serious complaint from the mother of the girl who had inhaled it into her lung while playing.

“I’m concerned that people, who may have bought a 'No Holes Tongue Stud' before it was removed from sale, may still be using them. I urge people who may have this product to stop wearing it and throw it away. I am particularly concerned that children may have purchased this product,” said Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard.

“I am considering issuing an Unsafe Goods Notice for the ‘No Holes Tongue Stud’, which in effect is a product ban and means it can’t be sold in the future,” said Judith Tizard.

“Businesses have a responsibility to provide safe products and address issues of safety when they arise. I am pleased that the importer of the product acted quickly to remove the ‘No Holes Tongue Stud’ from the shops they supplied it to.

“The Consumer Guarantees Act places a general obligation on suppliers to provide products which are of acceptable quality and safe,” said Judith Tizard.

Under the Consumer Guarantees Act, if there is a problem with a product a consumer has purchased, they have the right to seek their own redress from either the retailer or manufacturer who supplied the goods. The Act states that goods must be safe, they must be of acceptable quality, must be fit for any particular purpose, and match the description or sample.

Consumers can call the Ministry of Consumer Affairs toll free number 0508 627 774 to report unsafe products.

“The Ministry is keen to hear from anyone who has bought a ‘No Holes Tongue Stud’ in the last week,” said Judith Tizard.
