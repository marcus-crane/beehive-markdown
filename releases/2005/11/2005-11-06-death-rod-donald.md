Prime Minister Helen Clark today paid tribute to Rod Donald, Green Party co-leader, who passed away this morning.

Helen Clark said she was shocked to hear of the news and deeply saddened by it.

“My thoughts are with Rod’s partner, Nicola, his family, friends and Green Party colleagues, who have suffered a tremendous loss.

“I have known Rod Donald since he entered Parliament in 1996, and worked with him for the past six years during which Green Party support and goodwill has been indispensable for our government.

“In all that time Rod has been a very honourable person to deal with. He always impressed me with both the strength of his convictions and his ability to work within the parliamentary system to resolve issues.

“Rod Donald was unfailingly pleasant, likeable, and always looking for a constructive way forward.

“Rod committed his life to environmental and community causes, becoming active in many issues from his teenage years. His interests spanned decent housing, urban recycling, fair trade, and electoral reform.

“Rod gained a national profile from his work on the electoral referenda in the early 1990s. He was a strong advocate for MMP, and entered Parliament as a Green Party member within the Alliance in 1996.

“Rod Donald had remarkable energy and great zest for life. It is a cruel fate indeed which strikes down someone with so much to give in the prime of his life. He will be greatly missed,” Helen Clark said.
