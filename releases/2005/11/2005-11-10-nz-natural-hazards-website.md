*Address at the launch of the New Zealand Natural Hazards website.*  
*Te Papa, Wellington*

Thank you for inviting me here tonight for the launch of the [Natural Hazards New Zealand website](http://www.naturalhazards.co.nz/nathaz/index.jsp).

Tonight is a celebration of the level of specialist expertise in New Zealand brought together in this business cluster – and of its potential to do substantial offshore business – both helping to prevent loss of life, and earning export dollars for New Zealand.

Our country is vulnerable to so many natural hazards, from earthquakes to tsunami, floods, storms, coastal erosion, and volcanoes. We are exposed to the natural hazards of living on a land which straddles the boundary between two of the Earth's great plates - the Australian and Pacific tectonic plates.

Those of us who spend time in Wellington are regularly reminded of that. I am reminded on the several occasions most years when Parliament and Premier House are shaking!

Awareness of our vulnerability has led to New Zealanders developing a lot of expertise in the management around natural hazards, in engineering and science, and in emergency planning. We are fortunate to have some of the world’s top scientists and specialist engineers in this field. This website puts the expertise we have on show, and will be a powerful marketing tool.

It also serves as a valuable resource for individual members of the clusters. In the fast-moving world when responding to major events, members can draw on the wealth of information contained within the site and in the links to other members of the cluster.

Natural Hazards New Zealand is a consortium of New Zealand professionals and companies specialising in this area. It is of considerable interest internationally, with its expertise in risk management, recovery, and mitigation.

In recent years, international agencies involved in natural disasters and recovery – such as the UN and the World Bank – have moved from simply rebuilding what might have been in place prior to an earthquake, or tsunami, or flood, to ensuring that what replaces the old is designed to withstand future natural hazards.

A New Zealand team of specialists led by Beca International Consultants have been involved in a World Bank programme to earthquake strengthen multi-storey residential apartments in earthquake-prone regions in Turkey. I visited the New Zealand team in an Istanbul suburb in April, where they were taking samples from local buildings.

New Zealand base isolation technology has been used in the design of a new hospital in Gujurat in India. In turn, Natural Hazards’ work there will no doubt benefit the construction of Wellington’s own new hospital.

Members of the Natural Hazards New Zealand cluster have also worked widely in the Pacific, through Asia including Aceh, India, Vietnam, the Philippines, China, and elsewhere.

In New Zealand, we must continually update our strategies and plans for natural hazard management.

Our 2002 Civil Defence and Emergency Management legislation requires regional plans to be prepared for managing the risks associated with natural hazards. This involves a broad consultative process between councils, the community, and emergency services.

Over time, New Zealand has made significant progress in modifying infrastructure and facilities to better cope with natural hazards, where it is not possible to site development away from them.

Mt Ruapehu, for example, presents a continuing challenge. A decade ago, a thirteen month period of eruptions ejected some 60 million cubic metres of volcanic ash. The ash ruined crops, killed some 2,000 sheep and, combined with snowmelt, caused $22 million worth of damage to turbines at the Rangipo Power Station.

In response, we now have improved emergency management procedures, a better understanding by businesses of their vulnerability to eruptions, and a volcanic ash advisory service for the aviation industry. The expertise of members of this cluster has contributed to these enhanced measures.

There is now improved scientific monitoring of Tongariro National Park, and an increased ability to detect volcanic unrest and put emergency plans in place. The objective is to ensure no loss of life from a lahar or other activity.

New Zealand Trade and Enterprise has been able to assist some of this cluster’s offshore initiatives, and I am sure more could be done through our international networks to promote awareness of what Natural Hazards New Zealand has to offer.

I hope the new website will assist you in the promotion of the significant expertise contained within this cluster.

It gives me great pleasure to formally launch the new Natural Hazards New Zealand website.
