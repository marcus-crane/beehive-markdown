Social Development and Employment Minister David Benson-Pope has welcomed publication of briefing documents, which he likens to a "social encyclopaedia".

The Minister says they are rich with data about most aspects of New Zealand's social well being and will have considerable value to stakeholders beyond their immediate reference point for government.

Mr Benson-Pope says the reports highlight improving social indicators, especially around New Zealanders moving off benefits and into work.

"New Zealand's rate of unemployment is the lowest in the OECD," said Mr Benson-Pope. "This is important news because I firmly believe that helping people capable of work into meaningful jobs carries huge benefits to that individual, and to social cohesion generally. It is no coincidence that as we've helped an extra 300,000 New Zealanders into work in the past six years, we've also seen the rate of crime drop significantly."

Mr Benson-Pope says the briefings also highlight challenges: "Our current low unemployment rates have produced changes in the nature of the beneficiary population. The report notes that people receiving benefits are now likely to be more difficult to place in employment and therefore the changes we are making to the welfare system to an enhanced case-managed approach are timely and important."

Another issue is the change in ratio of people over 65 to those of working age, which will rise from 18:100 in 1999 to 43:100 by 2051. An ageing population will place greater demands on government expenditure and on key health and social services.

"This changing demographic is both a challenge and an opportunity for society. An older population represents a valuable resource of knowledge, skills and experience and we need to be sure that older people are participating in our communities because that will benefit us all. The ties that bind of family and community are in many cases much weaker today than in the past. I think that as a nation we need to have a strong dialogue on how we can reinvigorate the meanings of these words.

"We must value the contribution of all New Zealanders. Alongside providing opportunities and incentives for people to move into paid work there is greater scope for us to recognise and celebrate the unpaid contribution people make to social well being, including raising children, working in the home and contributing to the wider community."
