The Prime Minister Helen Clark today met the Irish Taoiseach, Mr Bertie Ahern, TD, at Government Buildings in Dublin.

The two leaders discussed ongoing developments in the bilateral relationship, which has been extremely positive in recent years. They agreed on the importance of strengthening mutual trade between the two countries.

The Taoiseach also welcomed the increase in tourism from New Zealand, which is an important issue for Ireland, and reaffirmed that Ireland, together with its EU partners, wishes to deepen trade and economic relations between the EU and New Zealand.

Both the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach agreed that it was vitally important that there should be a successful outcome of the current round of global trade negotiations. They also discussed a range of international issues, including UN matters and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.

The Prime Minister and the Taoiseach also agreed that their officials will commence early discussions on the terms of an Agreement on the Co-production of Films, the objective of which will be to expand and facilitate the co-production of films in a way that benefits the film industries in both countries, and to develop cultural and economic exchanges.

This will build on discussions initiated during the recent meeting in New Zealand of Mr John O'Donoghue, T.D., Minister for Arts, Sport, and Tourism, with Helen Clark. There is already broad agreement on the principles of the Agreement.
