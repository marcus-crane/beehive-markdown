The government will invest $600,000 to trial three innovative new programmes in schools, Education Minister Steve Maharey announced today.

"The funding will the give schools involved opportunities to trial new ideas for tackling old issues such as truancy, underachievement and physical isolation," Steve Maharey said.

"To receive funding schools need to demonstrate that their idea is based on good evidence and has the potential to improve standards and lift the achievement of their students."

The new programmes to be trialled are:

The extension of Coronet – which involves video conferencing and sharing of ICT resources between 10 remote schools in Coromandel. The programme includes sharing of teachers and lessons by videoconference to increase subjects available for students. The Schools are Te Aroha College, Morrinsville College, Paeroa College, Waihi College, Whangamata Area School, Mercury Bay Area School, Coromandel Area School, Thames High School, Edgecumbe College and Te Wharekura O Ruatoki.

A programme to address relative underachievement in boys - to be piloted in five Nelson schools: Nelson College, Nelson College Preparatory School, Victory School, Nelson Intermediate School and Nelson South Kindergarten.

The use of Nurture Groups at Linwood School in Christchurch to support at-risk children and reduce truancy. This is based on a programme that has been hugely successful in the UK and involves classes of 6-8 students who spend up to two terms with a specialist teacher before being transitioned back into mainstream classes as they meet certain objectives.

Schools are able to apply annually for the funding which is available for up to three years.
