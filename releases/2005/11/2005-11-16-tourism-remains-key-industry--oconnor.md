The government will continue to promote and assist the development of a sustainable, prosperous and profitable tourism industry, Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor said today.

His comments follow the release of the Ministry of Tourism’s Briefing to the Incoming Minister today.

"Over the last six years, Labour has worked with key tourism industry players and wider stakeholders to develop a clear, shared direction,” Damien O’Connor said.

"Tourism is a major contributor to the New Zealand economy, with annual export earnings of $7.6 billion in the year to March 2004. The industry supports one in ten jobs in New Zealand. International visitor expenditure accounts for 17.8 per cent of New Zealand's total export earnings.

"New Zealand is one of the world's premiere tourist destinations, and it is important that to maintain that momentum, and that we strive to give our visitors the best possible experience.

"I am looking forward to working with the industry and across government departments to ensure that we can continue to work together on skills and training, quality assurance, and on the development of the industry.

"As a former tourism operator I am aware of some of the key issues facing businesses within the industry.

"In the next 12 months there is important work to be done. As outlined in  
Labour's pre-election pledge, the New Zealand Tourism Strategy will be reviewed in light of current progress. I will also be convening a group to explore the options available to increase domestic tourism within New Zealand and the government will be making decisions on the future investment in offshore marketing of New Zealand as the premiere visitor destination.

The government is committed to continuing to invest in tourism so that it can continue to be a growing contributor to economic growth for New Zealand."
