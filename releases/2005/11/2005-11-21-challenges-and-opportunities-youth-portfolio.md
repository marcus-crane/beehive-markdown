“Recognising and developing young people’s potential is the way forward.

“We have a dynamic youth population that has greater access to information and is more mobile, culturally diverse, and technologically aware than ever before. This offers great potential for the future of our country and our communities,” Ms Mahuta said.

The Minister said that by using a youth development framework, there are huge opportunities to bring about positive change for young people by:  
·fostering youth innovation and talent  
·listening to young people and creating policies, programmes and services that work for them  
·supporting young people with quality information to make good lifestyle choices  
·harnessing the energy, enthusiasm, and freshness that young people bring.

"Our young people today are tomorrow’s innovators, parents and leaders. Investing in future growth by improving educational, employment and social opportunities is one of the best investments we can make to secure a strong future as a nation," said Ms Mahuta.

“There are some exciting opportunities in this portfolio, but I’m also aware that young people today face many challenges. It’s important that as a community we work to support and help them overcome those challenges.”
