Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard says that the creative industries report launched by Auckland City Council today recognises the economic importance of creative businesses for the Auckland region.

*Snapshot: Auckland's Creative Industries* was released by Auckland City Council, and is an economic view of the creative industries developed through statistical analysis and feedback from over 400 stakeholders.

"This is a hard-edged economic study of the present state of creative industries and their potential. Auckland City Council clearly understands the interconnected networks between community, culture, research, creative businesses and exports," Judith Tizard said.

"Auckland City Council is also demonstrating that the cultural well-being of its community is being looked after, in accordance with the Local Government Act 2002, as cultural well-being is a purpose of local government.

"The creative industries are important as they promote New Zealand's unique culture and capabilities. The creative sector is diverse, ranging from film, television production, fashion design, music, and the visual arts to publishing and multimedia arts.

"Creative industries across Auckland and the whole of New Zealand will benefit from this study. The City Council's approach will strengthen Auckland's creative businesses and ensure that Auckland remains a vibrant place to live," Judith Tizard said.
