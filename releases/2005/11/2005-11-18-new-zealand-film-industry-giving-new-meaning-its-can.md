Environment Minister David Benson-Pope today praised the New Zealand screen production industry for it's adoption of ‘green’ guidelines in its daily practices.

The government and screen production industry have been working jointly on a practical toolkit titled Greening the Screen. This toolkit, a website and a booklet were launched this morning at the annual conference of the Screen Production and Development Association (SPADA).

“The environment is one of New Zealand’s unique selling points,” says Mr Benson-Pope. "For overseas film makers the stunning scenery and amazing outdoor landscapes provide a natural stage. Therefore, it is vital that the industry looks after the environment to maintain and enhance our competitive advantage."

Greening the Screen is designed for people working in the screen production industry. The toolkit makes people aware of the environmental impacts of their work and provide tips on how to cut back on waste and energy use.

“When government approached the industry to start a joint initiative we found that this sector didn’t need much encouragement,” said Mr Benson-Pope. "They saw the potential benefits of ‘green’ screen productions.

"These guidelines are the next step on a journey to extend good environmental practice into the many activities involved around production."

Greening the Screen is developed by the Ministry for the Environment, SPADA, South Pacific Pictures, Landcare Research and Waitakere City Council. The web address is www.greeningthescreen.co.nz.
