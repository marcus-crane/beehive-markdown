A new booklet designed to prompt older drivers to think about their post-driving years, was launched by Transport Safety Minister Harry Duynhoven today.

Mr Duynhoven welcomed the Kapiti Coast District Council project as a great resource for the region’s many older drivers.

“It is fantastic to see the Council supporting its community by providing what I am sure will be a valuable resource for those who may have to give up driving in future years.

“The ability to drive is a huge factor in a person’s independence and mobility. This booklet ensures that drivers think about alternatives, so that when they eventually do stop driving, they do not stop being independent and mobile.

“I am sure drivers in Kapiti, young and not so young, will find this guide valuable. It is thought-provoking, it is practical and informative, and lays out clear alternatives to driving.

“I wish to especially acknowledge the significant role the council’s road safety co-ordinator Sue Johnson, has played in getting this booklet published. I would like to congratulate both her and the District Council for their work and support for this project,” Mr Duynhoven said today.
