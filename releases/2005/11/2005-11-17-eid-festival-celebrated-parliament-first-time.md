Parliament celebrated the Festival of Eid for the first time last night demonstrating the government's continued commitment to recognising and respecting New Zealand's different cultures.

"More than 150 Muslim New Zealanders attended the function, which opened with the first public reading of the Koran in Parliament Buildings," Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter said.

"The extract from the Koran was particularly appropriate for the event and spoke of the importance of acknowledging and accepting diversity, and of finding sanctuary in dark times.

"The intention is that the Festival of Eid will now be celebrated annually in Parliament alongside Diwali and Chinese New Year. It is telling that prior to the arrival of the Labour government, none of these festivals were celebrated in Parliament at all.

"I hope this change demonstrates again the government's continued commitment to cultural and religious tolerance. We are here to represent and govern on behalf all New Zealanders, and we will seek to serve the social, educational and cultural interests of all communities."
