Bill English's claim that NZQA is backing down on standards is completely unfounded and he knows it, says Education Minister Steve Maharey.

"It's unfortunate that seven days out from the start of exams Mr English is trying to undermine students' confidence in the NCEA by playing political games," Steve Maharey said.

"The principle of the NCEA is standards based assessment. Nothing has changed in this regard and Bill English knows it.

"The New Zealand Qualifications Authority has worked extremely hard to fix the problems that arose last year. This year there will be much closer monitoring to ensure that the results fairly and accurately represent each student's performance.

"NCEA sets standards for all young New Zealanders and we will not compromise on anything other than the best.

"This government is uncompromising in its drive to raise standards in education and we invite healthy debate from anyone, including Mr English, who has something to offer. But we have little time for people who want to play games with the future of our education system by undermining the confidence of students, parents and teachers in standards based assessment.

"Mr English needs to remember that this is a policy which began with broad cross-party support."
