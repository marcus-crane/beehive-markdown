Acting Prime Minister Michael Cullen has welcomed former German cardinal Josef Ratzinger’s election as Pope Benedict XVI.

Dr Cullen said that New Zealand would be conveying its congratulations to Pope Benedict XVI, who besides being leader of the Catholic Church, is also head of state of the Holy See.

Dr Cullen noted that Roman Catholics in New Zealand and around the world were hailing Pope Benedict XVI as a worthy successor to Pope John Paul II.

“The New Zealand Government wishes the new Pontiff well in the immense  
responsibilities he is about to assume on behalf of Roman Catholics round the world,” Dr Cullen said.
