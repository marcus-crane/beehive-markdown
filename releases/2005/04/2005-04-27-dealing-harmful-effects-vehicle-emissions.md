Associate Transport Minister Judith Tizard said today that results from the pilot testing programme for vehicle emissions indicated that methods other than the 'simple idle test' needed to be investigated to reduce the harmful effect of emissions.

“I have listened very carefully to feedback from the consultation and have been advised that research shows it is more expensive than originally envisaged, and is unlikely to deliver the improved health outcomes we want," Judith Tizard said.

“The government remains determined to reduce the harmful health and environmental effects of vehicle exhaust emissions.

"I have asked Ministry of Transport officials to investigate other initiatives to clean up the New Zealand vehicle fleet’s harmful emissions. This includes focusing on finding ways to hasten the uptake of ‘clean’ technology vehicles and encouraging the removal and disposal of ‘end-of-life’ vehicles from the fleet.

"Another initiative that will be explored is the 'visual smoke test' as part of the warrant and certificate of fitness check, which could essentially move the ‘10-second’ rule from the roadside into the workshop.

"I want the Ministry of Transport to fully concentrate on this job at hand so we get the best results for reducing harmful emission levels.

"We know that poor emissions contribute to health problems such as premature death, heart disease, cancer, and respiratory illnesses such as bronchitis and asthma – particularly in children and older people. This government is committed to tackling the health and environmental impacts associated with vehicle exhaust emissions in New Zealand," Judith Tizard said.

**Questions and Answers: Vehicle Emissions**

**1.What has been done to reduce New Zealand’s harmful vehicle emissions?**

From 1 January 2004, vehicles entering the country have been required to meet an approved emissions standard applying in the country of manufacture, at the time of manufacture.

From 1 January 2006, revised diesel fuel specifications will lead to the reduction of the sulphur content in diesel fuels to 50 parts per million, making New Zealand diesel cleaner and bring it into line with European standards.

The Ministry of Transport is working toward removing the barriers to the introduction of renewable transport fuels – including ethanol petrol blends and bio-diesel.

**2.What did the Ministry’s preliminary proposal entail?**

The Ministry’s preliminary proposal entailed the emissions screening of all vehicles in the New Zealand vehicle fleet as part of their Warrant of Fitness or Certificate of Fitness check using simple testing. Complete details of the preliminary proposal are set out in the New Zealand Emissions Screening Programme discussion document.

**3.How many submissions were received on the discussion document?**

The Ministry released the New Zealand Vehicle Emissions Screening Programme discussion document in November 2004. This was sent to over 800 groups, organisations and individuals. 127 submissions were received from:

- The inspection and repair industry (seven submissions).
- Central government agencies (three submissions).
- Other government entities (three submissions).
- Local government (13 submissions).
- Classic/vintage car clubs (nine submissions).
- Other organisations including various equipment suppliers and a wide range of transport groups, community groups and environment groups (27 submissions).
- The general public (65 submissions, thirteen of whom identified themselves as being involved in the vehicle repair and inspection industry).

**4.What did the submissions say?**

Submitters endorsed the policy aim of reducing the harmful health and environmental effects of vehicle emissions.

Submitters gave conditional support for the Ministry’s proposal, with the following provisos:

- That the ‘simple idle test’ for petrol vehicles and the ‘snap acceleration test’ for diesel vehicles identify the worst polluting vehicles;
- That real, measurable improvements in air quality and health outcomes result;
- That costs to vehicle owners are kept low – and set up costs to the industry are manageable;
- That there is flexibility according to vehicle age, type and engine technology, including exemptions; and
- That the public and industry are kept informed, and given plenty of notice.

**5.Why is the preliminary proposal not proceeding?**

Scientific and technical research undertaken by the Ministry in New Zealand conditions, and overseas research, shows simple testing produces an unacceptable level of false-positive and false-negative results. Research also shows simple testing is unlikely to achieve significant and measurable improvements in air quality and health outcomes. It was necessary to subject simple testing to rigorous examination to inform the decision to proceed with it or not.

**6.What is simple testing?**

Simple testing employs the ‘idle test’ for petrol vehicles and the ‘snap acceleration test’ for diesel vehicles. For petrol engines, the idle test tests emissions of engines at idle and for the high-idle test at 2,500 revs per minute. For diesel engines the snap acceleration test requires the rapid acceleration of the engine and uses the engine’s resistance to simulate the conditions where smoke is produced.

**7.How are these tests conducted?**

A probe connected to an analyser is inserted in the vehicle’s exhaust pipe. The vehicle’s exhaust emissions are read and a print out produced. The results on the print out are compared with the set standards for emissions, and the vehicle is either passed or failed.

**8.Why target smoky vehicles?**

It is estimated that 10 percent of vehicles account for up to 40 percent of New Zealand’s harmful vehicle exhaust emissions. Removing the ‘smoky vehicles’ from the road, either by requiring they be repaired or retiring them from the vehicle fleet, will significantly reduce harmful emissions, without unduly penalising the vast majority of responsible motorists.

**9.What is the ‘10-second’ rule?**

Known as the 10-second rule, Regulation 28 of the Traffic Regulations came into force in March 2001. The rule makes it an offence to operate a vehicle producing excessive visible exhaust smoke for a sustained period longer than 10 seconds. Enforcement is a matter for the Police.

**10.What is a visual smoke test?**

In general terms, a visual smoke test is a subjective, visual examination of the opacity of a vehicle’s exhaust emissions carried out by a trained vehicle technician. A petrol vehicle with an engine out of tune or in need of repair produces ‘blue smoke’ and a diesel vehicle with an engine out of tune or in need of repair produces ‘black smoke’ (under load).

**11.How will a vehicle pass or fail the visual smoke test?**

The details are yet to be decided and will be the subject of consultation with the motor industry and other interested parties. It is envisaged the visual smoke test will be subjective and based on the current 10-second rule and appropriate guidelines developed by the Ministry. It is expected that the test will draw on guidelines in place in the UK where the visual inspection forms part of their in-service testing.
