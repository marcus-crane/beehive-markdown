The government today welcomed the publication of the findings of the Wellington western transport corridor study undertaken by Transit and Greater Wellington Regional Council (GWRC).

"For the first time, a comprehensive and costed picture of options for improving transport links along the region's western corridor is available. The government agrees that the region needs an enduring transport solution that improves performance and reliability. The solution will need to be affordable, have community buy-in and will most likely involve a mix of modes," says Transport Minister Pete Hodgson.

Government spending on transport in the Wellington region is up by more than 88 per cent this year on 1999/2000. This was given a $225 million boost from the Crown Account in January and will be augmented by $220 million in regional funding, both over ten years.

Central government is already providing record sums for the region's transport infrastructure, some of which may be considered for western corridor projects. Other potential sources of funding include:

·Contribution from territorial authorities, either from rates or debt  
·Tolling  
·Road pricing, and  
·Additional Crown funding.

"The government is not going to pick an option for Wellington. We want to agree possible funding pathways with the region so the debate around the various scenarios can be better informed.

"Greater Wellington Regional Council has indicated that it wants to consider the report in detail. Once this has been done, the government looks forward to an approach from the region to discuss possible funding options."
