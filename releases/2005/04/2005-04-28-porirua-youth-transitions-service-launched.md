The new Porirua Youth Transitions Service (YTS) will be a valuable resource for young people, their families and the wider Porirua community, Youth Affairs Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Speaking at the launch of the Service at the Pataka museum, Steve Maharey said that a number of young people in Porirua were at risk of falling through the cracks as they left school.

"Around six-hundred 15-19 year olds in Porirua are not involved in education, training or work," Steve Maharey said.

"The Youth Transitions Service being launched today shows that the government and the local community are taking this problem seriously. The Service will provide the support and guidance that Porirua's young people deserve."

The service will provide career training, job seeking advice, information on educational opportunities and customised support for at-risk school leavers.

The Porirua YTS is unique as it is the first service to be run by a City Council in partnership with the wider community. The Porirua City Council will oversee the service and help facilitate the close involvement of secondary schools and community agencies.

"Porirua YTS will be owned by the whole of the community," Steve Maharey said. "One of the reasons the government decided to establish a service here was the determination of Mayor Jenny Brash, the City Council and local groups to do something to help young people in the City.

"I'm confident that this community has what it takes to succeed for its young people."

The Porirua YTS is the third service to be launched, following Waitakere and Whangarei. A total of 14 services will be rolled out over the next three years as part of a $56.9 million package to help meet the government's goal of having all 15-19 year olds in work, education or training by 2007.

Youth Transitions Services are funded by the government and implemented in partnership with the Mayors Taskforce for Jobs.
