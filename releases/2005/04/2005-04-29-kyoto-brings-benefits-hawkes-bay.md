A Hawke's Bay renewable energy project is set to receive 46,000 internationally tradable emissions units under the government's Projects to Reduce Emissions programme, which if sold at $15 each would be worth $690,000.

"The benefits this project is set to deliver are a direct consequence of New Zealand's decision to be part of the global effort to tackle climate change through the Kyoto Protocol," says Convenor of the Ministerial Group on Climate Change, Pete Hodgson.

The proposed project, being developed by Esk Hydro Power Ltd, comprises a 2.5 MW wind farm and a 2 MW small hydro-electric scheme. Together, they will have a combined output sufficient to supply around 2,800 homes and offset the emission of around 67,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide between 2008 and 2012; the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.

"By tackling climate change in this way, this scheme is helping to protect the environment and the unique Kiwi lifestyle for future generations. At the same time, it will help meet the power needs of a growing regional economy in a sustainable way."

The developers plan to sell output from both schemes to local electricity users. Both are set to be brought on line next year and are subject to the normal planning application process.

Under the Programme, units are awarded to projects that lead to a net reduction in emission against business as usual that would otherwise not go ahead and that are successful in a tender round. To date, 10 million units, which are internationally tradable, have been out for tender.
