"I want to reassure New Zealanders about Creative New Zealand's grants policies," Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard said today.

"Rodney Hide is misleading New Zealanders, when in reality the facts about Creative New Zealand grants are very simple.

"Creative NZ has a robust funding application process and knows exactly who has been provided with funding, what it is for, and what results it expects to achieve. All arts funding must be consistent with Creative NZ’s publicly available Strategic Plan.

"Reporting on completed projects is an administrative matter for Creative NZ (which is an independent statutory body). The Ministry for Culture and Heritage monitors its performance and last year, as a matter of routine practice, a review was commissioned that examined Creative NZ's grants practice and procedures.

"The reviewer, Chris Prowse, stated that Creative NZ has effective and appropriate systems in place for allocation of grants. In the area of project reporting requirements, Chris Prowse identified some issues with current practice. I am advised that Creative NZ has considered all of the recommendations and that some changes to processes have been made.

"This government supports funding for the arts, because they offer a unique and valuable contribution to New Zealand culture and identity. Rodney Hide's unsupportive comments are simply a waste of time and money.

"I am very confident in the work that Peter Biggs undertakes at Creative NZ and fully support its role in strengthening New Zealand's arts sector," Judith Tizard said.
