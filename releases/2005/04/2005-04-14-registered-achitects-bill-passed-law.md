Parliament last night endorsed changes set out in the Registered Architects Bill, with the majority voting to pass the Bill into law.

Minister for Building Issues Chris Carter welcomed the legislation's passage.

“This legislation is a companion measure to the Building Act 2004 which aims to ensure that buildings are designed and built right first time and reinforces the importance of each element of the building process from design to inspection.

“It repeals the Architects Act 1963 and introduces a modern regulatory framework for the regulation of the occupation. This will help to ensure that buildings are designed right first time. It also meets the desire of the current architects registration board and the New Zealand Institute of Architects to modernise the legislation”, Mr Carter said.

“I believe that the legislation represents a balanced path for the regulation of architects that both industry and consumers have been seeking”, Mr Carter said.
