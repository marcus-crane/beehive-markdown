This year's Confiscated Car Club collections campaign saw $10.47 million in fines paid in full or put under an instalments arrangement.

Courts Minister Rick Barker, when launching the 2005 collections campaign in mid-February, warned that the target age group of men between 20 and 30yrs (who owe 60 per cent of all fines) could have no wheels if they didn't pay overdue fines.

“This campaign works because it targets a man's most prized possession and the potential loss of a car poses a serious threat to their current way of life and social life," said Rick Barker.

"New Zealand's least popular car club recruited 330 new members and some of those cars were sold to pay overdue fines, but I am pleased most people wanted to get out of the unpopular car club by paying in full or by making an arrangement to pay over time.

"The fact that Collections seized three BMWs and the owners then paid their fines, and one Auckland man paid $6000 in cash to get his Mercedes Benz released, shows these men do have the money to pay fines.

"The successful campaign, which saw more fines collected than last year's campaign, shows collections are determined that these people will pay their fines just as the rest of us do.

" Just as fines won't go away, the campaigns to get them paid won't stop, I am getting 'towie' and urge people to call 0800 4 FINES to sort their fines out," he said.

The Courts Minister also highlights that more information came through on people collections were having difficulty finding, and others are going on-line to pay their fines by credit card.

"During the campaign 1149 fines defaulters, against whom warrants to seize property were raised, fully resolved their overdue fines and more fine defaulters are still being followed up due to new information obtained on thousands of people who can now be issued with the Warrant to Seize notice".

" Some 21,000 calls were made to the 0800 4 FINES number during the campaign and March saw the highest ever amount collected by credit card payment of $164,650 via the Ministry’s fines website www.fines.govt.nz ," Mr Barker added.
