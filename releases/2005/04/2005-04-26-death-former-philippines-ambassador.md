Foreign Minister Phil Goff today expressed his sadness over the death of former Philippines Ambassador to New Zealand, Alicia Ramos.

Ms Ramos, 64, was murdered by intruders who broke into her home in Makati, Manila, on Sunday.

"Alicia Ramos was the Philippines Ambassador in Wellington for six years, from 1996 to 2002. I met Alicia in that capacity on many occasions and in her subsequent position back in the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila, where she continued to have responsibility for New Zealand.

"She was a warm, pleasant and likeable person with many good friends in New Zealand. All of us who knew her are devastated by her loss and the circumstances of her death.

"Alicia was a skilled diplomat who earned widespread respect. She was a quiet yet tenacious advocate of Philippine interests while in New Zealand, and someone who brought real warmth to her role as Ambassador.

"Alicia's relationship with New Zealand continued after she returned to the Philippines, where she was appointed Assistant Secretary for Asian and Pacific Affairs at the Department of Foreign Affairs in 2003.

"In her new position, Alicia's strong links with New Zealand were seen in the way she encouraged and supported New Zealand's relationship with the Philippines and our bid for closer engagement with the member nations of ASEAN.

"Alicia Ramos will be greatly missed by all who worked with her and knew her. I have sent my condolences to her family and to the Philippines Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Alberto Romulo," Mr Goff said.
