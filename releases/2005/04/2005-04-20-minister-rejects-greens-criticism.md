The Green Party is mistaken about the process of negotiating and implementing trade agreements, Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton said today.

Mr Sutton said the process was that the negotiators operated to a mandate from ministers and governments, which operated on a mandate from Parliament, which got its mandate from the people.

“The negotiators initial the agreement, and if the Government approves, ministers sign it. If Parliament approves, the agreement is ratified.

“Only then is it implemented.”

Mr Sutton said the Green Party always opposed every trade agreement.

“They would like to interfere with the exercise of the consitutional democratic mandates of ministers and officials alike, every step of the way.

“Fortunately, the people of New Zealand have more sense and cast an overwhelming majority of votes for parties and candidates who support progressive, prosperity-enhancing trade initiatives.”
