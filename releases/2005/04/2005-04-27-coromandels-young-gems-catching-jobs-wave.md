Young adults in Thames are getting jobs at a rapid rate. Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment Rick Barker released figures today showing the number of Thames 18-24 year olds on the unemployment benefit has dropped by a staggering 81 per cent over the last 6 years.

There are now only around 49 young adults requiring an unemployment benefit in Thames compared to 258 people at the beginning of 1999.

For the whole of the Waikato region the drop in youth unemployment since the beginning of 1999 has been an impressive 62 per cent.

" Areas like Cambridge, Matamata and Te Awamutu have seen youth unemployment drops above the regional average. Overall in Waikato the numbers on the dole have gone from 4,367 in 1999 to around 1678 now, a drop off of 2,689 young people no longer dependent on the dole," said Mr Barker.

"The low youth unemployment figures for Waikato are part of a significant national trend of young people getting off the dole and into work. In Jan 1999 there were 54,144 young New Zealanders (16-24) on the dole and that figure now is 35,302, a reduction of around 65 per cent.

"Latest figures also show there were 14,624 Waikato people involved in industry training during 2004, 1,248 more than in 2003. Around one in five of the 2004 figure are Maori, so this means young people are getting practical skills that lead to jobs in Waikato where there are skill shortages," said Mr Barker.

"Each week I read stories about young men and women who are gaining qualifications through industry training or modern apprenticeships. Photographers have snapped them beaming with pride at their achievement, no longer are they on the scrap heap of the dismal 90s. Youth are motivated and enjoying the economic high too,"

Last year across New Zealand 10,000 young adults joined the workforce.

"The Basin reserve full of youths may be a scary thought for some, but that's how many young people are now out working in small local businesses, the construction industry or designing and teaching for example. There has never been a better time to be young and wanted.

"I also want to acknowledge the companies that are part of gateway and apprenticeship training and anyone else who employs a young person. It is tough for young people to be taken seriously sometimes and to be given a chance; your help can be the beginning of a great life for that person, "said Mr Barker.
