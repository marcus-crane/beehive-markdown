Associate Minister of Education, David Benson-Pope says that Dr Brash has shown a complete lack of judgment in endorsing the actions of an illegal school.

“Dr Brash has given his clearest signal yet that National has no regard for quality standards in education, or even the law which protects parents and students from poor quality education.”

"Dr Brash clearly has no interest in quality control and in the process that ensures good education for all,” says Associate Education Minister David Benson-Pope.

These comments are in response to Dr Brash's endorsement of an illegal school, which insists on operating with no qualified or registered teachers, no classrooms, and no registration to operate.

“The Education Act is there to ensure that children receive quality education. According to Dr Brash, anyone can do whatever he or she likes. He clearly thinks there should be no rules regulating quality in our education system.

This is the sort of outfit that would be the result of his policy proposals. No doubt, this illegal school would be one of the beneficiaries of Dr Brash’s voucher proposal. “This is National's endorsement of ‘backstreet’ education,” says Associate Education Minister David Benson-Pope.

“Dr Brash discloses his true agenda – the end of quality education for all, and the dismantling of the state education system along with the agencies which safeguard the quality of our education. This fits in with National’s dislike for agencies such as the Teachers Council and the Education Review Office, which are there to ensure the quality of our education system.”
