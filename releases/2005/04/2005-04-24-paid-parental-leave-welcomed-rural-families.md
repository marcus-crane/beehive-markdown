The extension of the [Paid Parental Leave scheme](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F22813) to self-employed parents will be good for rural families, Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton and Rural Affairs Minister Damien O’Connor said today.

The two ministers welcomed an announcement by colleague Ruth Dyson that the scheme, which gives government funding for 14 weeks to new parents, would be extended to self-employed parents as well.

Mr Sutton said he was pleased the Labour-Progressive Government had been able to deliver on its promise to rural communities by extending the scheme.

“This Government has a practice of delivering on its promises.”

Mr O’Connor said a reality of the New Zealand economy is that we are increasingly reliant on women’s skill and abilities as much in the rural sector as elsewhere.

“The new extension is a recognition of the importance that rural women play in our economy and communities.”
