Communications Minister David Cunliffe announced today that the Ministry of Economic Development has released an [engineering discussion paper](http://www.med.govt.nz/rsm/spp/uwb/discussion/index.html) on spectrum allocations for [ultra wide band](http://www.med.govt.nz/rsm/spp/uwb/index.html) (UWB) technology for public comment.

"UWB is a new wireless technology capable of transmitting large amounts of data over short distances. Applications of UWB include high-speed wireless networking in the workplace or at home, imaging systems, and anti-collision vehicular radar. UWB offers potential for New Zealand firms to develop and employ new and innovative solutions based on this technology," Mr Cunliffe said.

The paper considers the [spectrum](http://www.med.govt.nz/rsm/) allocation options for UWB along with its technical compatibility with existing services. It seeks the views of industry and other stakeholders on the spectrum arrangements to accommodate the new technology.

[Submissions](http://www.med.govt.nz/rsm/spp/uwb/discussion/discussion-10.html) close on 8 May 2005.

To assist with the preparation of submissions, the [Ministry of Economic Development](http://www.med.govt.nz/) is holding seminars on 15 April 2005 (Auckland) and on 20 April 2005 (Wellington).
