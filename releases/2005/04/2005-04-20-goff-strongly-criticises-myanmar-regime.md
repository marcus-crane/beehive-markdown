New Zealand has been, and will continue to be, an outspoken critic of the military regime in Myanmar as long as human rights abuses and the suppression of democracy continues, says Foreign Minister Phil Goff.

Mr Goff met this afternoon with exiled political leaders opposed to Myanmar's military rulers to listen to their views and to outline actions New Zealand has undertaken.

"New Zealand's opposition to the suspension of democracy and human rights abuses in Myanmar, including the ongoing detention of Aung San Suu Kyi, has been strong and consistent," Mr Goff said.

"We have expressed this view directly to the Myanmar government and publicly in front of Myanmar's ASEAN partners. Last year at the ASEAN Regional Forum the Myanmar Foreign Minister, seated alphabetically next to New Zealand, walked out on my speech criticising actions taken by the regime.

"New Zealand will continue to work with others to apply pressure for change in Myanmar, although so far neither direct punitive action through sanctions nor positive inducements to change have had any effect on the behaviour of the military rulers.

"However New Zealand, in common with most other countries including the European Union and the United Nations itself, has not agreed to impose economic sanctions on Myanmar.

"Our trade with Myanmar is overwhelmingly exports of dairy products. At a time when New Zealand is working with other countries through the World Food Programme to alleviate malnutrition in Myanmar, withholding products needed by families for basic nutrition makes absolutely no sense.

"We would simply be punishing ordinary people in Myanmar for the sins of their government, when they are already victims of the repressive nature of that government.

"The sanctions we are applying are targeted directly against military leaders and their families through denial of visas for travel or education.

"The UN Secretary General has described economic sanctions as a blunt instrument. 'They raise the ethical question', he said, 'of whether suffering inflicted on vulnerable groups in the target country is a legitimate means of exerting pressure on political leaders whose behaviour is unlikely to be affected by the plight of their subjects'. UNICEF has opposed economic sanctions for the same reason.

"New Zealand will continue to help victims of repression in Myanmar, including through accepting 125 refugees this year from Myanmar as part of our annual refugee quota.

"Myanmar is scheduled to host the ASEAN Regional Forum and Post Ministerial Conference in 2007, which dialogue partners of ASEAN including New Zealand, Australia and the US attend.

"The decision as to where these meetings are held is ASEAN's to make. Not holding them in Myanmar would indicate concern by ASEAN and its dialogue partners about the lack of progress towards the restoration of democratic processes and human rights there. Myanmar may opt out of chairing ASEAN for this reason, and New Zealand would prefer this outcome.

"If, however, the Forum is held in Myanmar, this would provide the opportunity to bring unprecedented pressure on the regime, allowing exposure and direct criticism of the Myanmar government in its own country," Mr Goff said.
