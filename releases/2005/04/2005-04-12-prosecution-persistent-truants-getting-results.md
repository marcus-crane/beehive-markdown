A South Auckland trial of a streamlined process to prosecute parents who condone the truancy of their children is having encouraging results, says Associate Education Minister David Benson-Pope.

Mr Benson-Pope says the trial began late in 2004 and is being jointly undertaken with a Crown Solicitor's Office. The trial simplifies the prosecutions process for non-attendance by providing schools and District Truancy Services with a template, which records all the evidential paperwork necessary for a prosecution to go to court.

"When the paperwork is streamlined in this way, the matter can be referred directly to the Crown Solicitor and heard in the Manukau District Court within two to three weeks," he says.

A total of eight cases have been heard in the District Court so far. Outcomes have been, conviction resulting in fines, and convictions with sentencing deferred to allow for improved attendance at school.

However, Mr Benson-Pope says the greatest success has been in the number of cases that have not proceeded to court because of improved attendance following the commencement of the process. Of the initial 30 students whose attendance was being monitored as part of a trial, over half (16) have shown a significant improvement in attendance following a prosecutions warning letter being sent to parents.

"Bearing in mind that all these cases involved chronic truancy and had previously involved considerable efforts by schools and attendance officers to get these students back into school, this is a very significant result.

"While it is still too early to tell, the initial evidence from the trial suggests that, when used appropriately, prosecution can help to reverse patterns of chronic truancy and re-engage students in learning. The cases which have been heard so far also suggest that prosecution is a relatively cheap intervention option, with the average cost of hearings being between $300 and $500."

The prosecutions project is part of a four-year $8.6million programme announced in October 2003 to support student engagement in schools through a suite of initiatives known as the Student Engagement Initiative (SEI).
