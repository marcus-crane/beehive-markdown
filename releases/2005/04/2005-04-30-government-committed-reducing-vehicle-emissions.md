Associate Transport Minister Judith Tizard said today that the government remains committed to improving vehicle emissions and air quality standards across New Zealand.

"It's essential that we come up with a workable and effective way of cleaning up vehicle emissions. The Pilot programme showed that the simple test as proposed would not be effective," says Associate Minister of Transport, Judith Tizard.

"That's why government, through the Ministry of Transport, will continue to work with Councils, a range of government agencies and the motor industry to develop effective ways of improving emissions."
