The establishment of a new artist in residence programme centred on the heritage of Gallipoli is being discussed with Turkish authorities, Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today.

Helen Clark made the announcement after formal talks with the Prime Minister of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in Ankara.

“The New Zealand Government and the Cannakkale 18 March University are discussing a “Gallipoli Fellowship” that would involve a New Zealand artist in residence in Cannakkale for several months each year,” Helen Clark said.

“Discussions are underway between the Ministry of Culture and Heritage and the Ataturk and Gallipoli Campaign Research Centre at the University, about how best to establish the residency.

“It would encourage a broad spectrum of New Zealand artists and writers to develop close links with Turkish artists, writers, and scholars, to provide new perspectives on this important chapter of our collective histories.

“Turkey and New Zealand are linked by the tragic experience at Gallipoli, which was a seminal event in the nationhood of both countries.

“New generations are now learning about our shared heritage, and the proposed residency would enhance the people to people links between our countries,” Helen Clark said.
