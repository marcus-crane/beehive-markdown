Acting Foreign Minister Marian Hobbs today welcomed the news that agreement had been reached at the United Nations on the text for an international convention to suppress nuclear terrorism.

"New Zealand believes strongly in international efforts to eliminate the scourge of terrorism," Marian Hobbs said.

"The adoption by the United Nations Ad Hoc Committee on Terrorism of the text of an International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism is a significant step forward. It will make a very real contribution to the security of New Zealand and the wider world.

"In his recent report on UN reform, Secretary General Kofi Annan urged all countries to complete work on this convention. Today's announcement by the Ad Hoc Committee is a welcome answer to his call.

"This agreement by the Ad Hoc Committee opens the way for signature by leaders in New York later this year."

The International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism will become the 13th international anti-terrorism treaty.

New Zealand is a party to all of the existing 12 treaties.
