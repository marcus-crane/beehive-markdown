Radio New Zealand will demonstrate a new digital broadcast system for the first time in New Zealand today when it hosts 75 top broadcasters from around the world for a 3-day symposium.

Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey welcomed the initiative, saying the government had invested $2.6 million to fund the purchase of the new digital shortwave transmitter which will begin transmitting to the South Pacific next year.

"The purchase of this technology is an important part of New Zealand's contribution to improving broadcasting services and current affairs available across the Pacific region," Steve Maharey said. "The new DRM technology will allow Radio New Zealand to transmit high quality digital programming to the South Pacific."

Digital Radio Mondiale technology (DRM) is a digital radio transmission system currently in use for shortwave transmissions in Europe and the Americas, allowing international shortwave broadcasters to transmit FM quality audio over long distances.

Radio New Zealand has been investigating the potential of using DRM on medium wave in the Southern Hemisphere where there is twice the bandwidth that is currently available to European broadcasters.

Radio New Zealand’s DRM Symposium is being held in Wellington Wednesday Thursday and Friday this week. The symposium will allow Radio New Zealand to demonstrate the system in operation and to inform New Zealand, Asian, Australian, and Pacific Island broadcasters about the technology and the potential it has to offer.
