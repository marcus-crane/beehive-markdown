Every intermediate and secondary school in the country will access a new electronic student enrolment system by the end of term one 2006, Associate Education Minister David Benson-Pope announced today.

From now on when a school enrols a student, or when a student leaves for another school, schools will fill in a single electronic form over the internet. This central register of enrolment information will reduce the time taken to identify non-enrolling students.

"Students who have been out of school for more than 20 days will be quickly and accurately identified by the system as non-enrolled and will trigger an alert for the Ministry of Education and other services to begin tracing them," said Mr Benson-Pope.

"We need to be sure all students who should be at school are there. By automating this process and taking time delays out of the system, we will be more effective at getting students back into school."

Mr Benson-Pope says development of the project has been underway for a year with a pilot in six Manurewa schools set to begin in August. He says an allocation of $4.8million in Budget 2005 means the system will be rolled out into every New Zealand intermediate and secondary school from 2006. Primary schools will be included later.

In 2003 there were approximately 6000 non-enrolments notified to the Ministry of Education and in 40 per cent of cases the students were already enrolled in another school or had legally left the compulsory school sector.

"Removing the inaccurate notifications will free up resources at schools and within the Ministry that can be directed into other truancy reduction activities," said Mr Benson-Pope.

Mr Benson-Pope says the student tracking project sits alongside several new initiatives known collectively as the Student Engagement Initiative (SEI) that will have a positive impact in reducing truancy. This afternoon he issued updates on a messaging pilot that alerts parents if their child is absent by text message, and early results from a streamlined parent prosecution pilot in South Auckland.
