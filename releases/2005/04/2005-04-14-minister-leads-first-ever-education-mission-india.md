Education Minister Trevor Mallard is to lead the first ever education mission by a New Zealand government to India, aimed at significantly advancing the New Zealand-India bilateral education relationship.

Trevor Mallard, who departs today, will be accompanied by Deputy Secretary for Education Rob McIntosh, Chair of the Education New Zealand Trust David Caygill, Pro-Vice Chancellors of New Zealand universities, and other representatives of tertiary institutions.

"This is the largest education mission to leave New Zealand in recent years, and is another important step in the development of the international education industry - which is worth more than $2 billion annually to New Zealand," Trevor Mallard said.

"Discussions between our governments, officials and sector representatives will help deepen our knowledge of policy and market trends in Indian education.

"A key part of the April 19 to 22 India visit will be the signing of an Education Cooperation Arrangement between New Zealand and India. This provides a way to strengthen and deepen the ties between our education institutions, and academics.

The mission will meet with some of India’s leading universities, and tertiary institutions in Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai, as a step in strengthening educational and academic engagement between the two countries.

"The delegation will build understanding around the programmes for international students available from New Zealand educational institutions. It will also support and publicise existing New Zealand education initiatives and consultancy work in India. Creating or extending opportunities for collaboration on research will also be a focus of the mission," Trevor Mallard said.

Trevor Mallard will also be travelling to the Gulf States, including Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar, from 24 to 28 April. This mission follows up on his earlier visit to the Gulf in 2003 and is another step in further strengthening cooperation in education between the Gulf countries and New Zealand. As Associate Finance Minister he will attend the World Bank conference in Washington from April 15 to 17.
