MP for Te Tai Tokerau Dover Samuels accompanied the Prime Minister to commemorate the 90th Anniversary of the Gallipoli landings.

"I believe it was an absolute honour to be amongst fellow New Zealanders paying homage to those that fought in the Great War. By the time the war ended, over 100,000 young New Zealanders had served overseas and some 18,000 had lost their lives. Sacrifice of this magnitude evoked enormous emotion", says Dover Samuels.

"I was privileged enough to attend the 60th anniversary of the Monte Cassino battle last year. I was amongst a contingent from the 28th Maori Battalion and WWII vets. It was a proud moment for me to watch these great heroes of our past, striding forward, though with more frailty, but still carrying the mana and expectation of a generation of New Zealanders" says Dover Samuels.

Maori also contributed with their own lives in the great war and a contingent of Maori Battalion veterans were also in attendance with the Prime Minister at Gallipoli. The veterans that attended were; Sonny Sewell, Nolan Raihania, Paora Kruger, John Thomas and William Follett.

"Many families today still fondly remember how their great great grandfather or uncles fought in that campaign. It's a real shame that we can't take relatives of those great heroes with us, because many have never had the opportunity to visit this sacred place where they fell. I recited a special karakia on Chunuk Bair for the families who couldn't be there as I felt that their sacrifices were just as important", says Dover Samuels.

"I am heartened to see that ten essay winning secondary school students were chosen to Travel to Gallipoli, one being Northlands very own Alice Krzanich from Kaipara College. I was absolutely taken by Alice's essay, it really touched a nerve as I know what it's like to lose whanau in the World Wars.

Her winning essay was chosen from 222 entries titled:

This is a tale of two brothers. My Journey is inextricably linked to theirs. Through me their spirit lives. Through my Family their history continues. May their memory journey on…"

I had spoken to many of the young Kiwi's and Aussies prior to the ANZAC service and many had said that Gallipoli has become somewhat of a pilgrimage for young backbacking New Zealanders and Australians, and I would hope that this continues, because now, it is the young generation and their stories and their experiences from visiting Gallipoli, to continue to provoke the emotions of loss, so that we can continue to burn the fires of the memories of those great people that laid down their lives for us".

This was more than evident with the presence of 10,000 young Kiwis and Aussies battling the elements just like their ancestors 90 years before them," says Dover Samuels.

"Now, 90 years after Gallipoli, the direct memory of those tragic days is held by an ever-decreasing number of New Zealanders. As fit young men and women with all their lives before them, they answered their country’s call. They sacrificed their youth, and in many cases their lives, for our future, we will be never forget, and we will always remember", says Dover Samuels.
