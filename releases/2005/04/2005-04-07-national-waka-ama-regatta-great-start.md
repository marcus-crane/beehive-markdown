Earlier today the Minister of Maori Affairs, Parekura Horomia paddled his way across Lake Okareka from Acacia Bay to Boyes Beach for the powhiri for the National Secondary School Waka Ama Regatta.

"There were about 900 paddling students, parents and supporters at the powhiri this morning. It was magnificent and, I am happy to report that I fulfilled my paddling duties without error!

Over the next 3 days, this regatta, being hosted by Te Waiariki Purea Trust, will see students from 70 or so schools compete in 14 different categories.

"I was pleased to be on the Lake this morning, reliving momentarily my waka ama days – waka ama has come along way since those early days! It was great to see so many of our young people actively involved in such a dynamic and growing sport.

"I wish all the paddlers and organisers a successful regatta, confident that a very competitive couple of days are in store.

This regatta runs through until Saturday afternoon. In March 2006 Aotearoa New Zealand will host the 12th World Outrigger Canoeing Sprint Championships at Lake Karapiro.
