Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton and Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey announced today an investment of $5.4 million to support export growth of the New Zealand music industry.

The package, which includes $2 million for the NZ Music Industry Commission and $3.4 million for NZ on Air, has been developed in response to the report of the Music Industry Export Development Group.

"Recommendations proposed in the Music Industry Export Development Group report, *Creating Heat*, have largely been supported and I thank the industry for its commitment to this group," Jim Anderton said.

"This comprehensive package of support aims to build a strong, sustainable, music industry, with good access to export markets. It represents significant government support, and builds the conditions for growth in the sector. It is a call to action for the industry to work in partnership with the New Zealand Music Industry Commission (NZMIC) and take the music industry to new heights’, Jim Anderton said.

"Over the next three years $444,000 per year will be provided to the New Zealand Music Industry Commission (NZMIC) to fund a music specific market development grants programme aimed at encouraging both domestic and international market growth. NZMIC will also receive additional funding of $178,000 per year, starting 1 July 2005, to undertake new domestic initiatives and to support artists to become ‘export ready’," The Minister for Economic Development, Jim Anderton said.

Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey said new funding of $850,000 a year would be delivered to NZ On Air for its International New Zealand music airplay strategy.

"This strategy aims to increase the amount of New Zealand music being broadcast domestically and internationally," Steve Maharey said. "Raising the profile of Kiwi music overseas will help to strengthen the New Zealand music industry and ensure we get to hear more Kiwi music at home."
