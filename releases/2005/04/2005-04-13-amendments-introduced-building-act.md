Parliament today passed amendments to the Building Act 2004 resolving a range of technical issues with it.

The amendments were attached to the Incorporation By References Bill, which now only requires royal assent from the Governor-General to become law.

“The Building Act 2005 is a huge piece of legislation containing some 450 sections. Inevitably some drafting issues became apparent when practical implementation of those sections began earlier this year," Mr Carter said.

"Like any good manager, the government has moved swiftly and sensibly to resolve those issues in the interests of the building sector."

Mr Carter said foremost among the new changes were improvements to Section 363, which makes it an offence to use a public building if no building consent or code compliance certificate has been granted for it.

“Issues have arisen with this section relating to the purpose, scope of application, transitional arrangements and staged use and occupation of buildings during development," Mr Carter said.

“Those issues have now been resolved in consultation with the building sector."

Mr Carter said other refinements to the Act had also been introduced, relating to:

·Private cable cars  
·Sub-divisions  
·Alterations and upgrades to existing buildings  
·The Building Practitioners Board – complaints and investigations

“The building sector makes a significant contribution to New Zealand’s economic prosperity, and it is important that this investment is strengthened by good law," Mr Carter said.

"The Labour-Progressive government is focussed on identifying and fixing problems for the benefit of every one, as is evident from today's amendments."
