Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Judith Tizard, said today that the government will continue to support the development of high-quality New Zealand films.

Judith Tizard said the [New Zealand Film Commission (NZFC)](http://www.nzfilm.co.nz/) remains the government’s preferred means for public funding of films.

"In 2004, we provided an additional $10 million per annum to the NZFC to continue the support of local film in a range of initiatives, including Signature Television and the digital film initiative. The creation of the Film Fund in 2000 was a one-off opportunity and the government has been very pleased with the results," Judith Tizard said.

"Indeed, this government is more committed than ever to New Zealand films. We instituted the Large Budget Screen Production Grant fund, and have also provided additional support for both the establishment of the Screen Council and funding for Film New Zealand.

"The Government believes that the NZFC plays an important role in the development of the New Zealand film industry and looks forward to its continued support of high-quality NZ films," Judith Tizard said.
