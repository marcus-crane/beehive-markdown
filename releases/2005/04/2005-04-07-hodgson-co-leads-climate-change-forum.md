The Australian Minister for Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, and Convenor of New Zealand’s Ministerial Group on Climate Change, Pete Hodgson, will host a climate change forum between the countries in Sydney across the 7th and 8th of April. Almost 100 industry and government leaders will attend the invitation only event.

“We need an effective global response to climate change and Australia has committed to playing a leadership role in this process,” Senator Campbell said.

“Industry and government leaders from both countries will meet to find common ground on the most effective ways of combating climate change, to exchange ideas on the latest low emissions technology and agree on what we can do in a regional sense that will feed into the global strategy.”

Convenor of New Zealand's Ministerial Group on Climate Change, Pete Hodgson, said the Kyoto Protocol had just come into force and governments and industry were starting to consider what would come next.

“The forum provides an excellent opportunity for Australian and New Zealand industry and other stakeholders to offer local perspectives on possible future global responses to climate change. For New Zealand this means exploring options for action in addition to the Kyoto Protocol,” said Pete Hodgson.

"Options for further action range from voluntary cooperation on technology development to mandatory frameworks embracing all countries. Discussion at the forum will consider the advantages and disadvantages of all these approaches."

The Australia-New Zealand Climate Forum will be facilitated by the Pew Centre on Global Climate Change, a leading US think-tank, which is conducting a series of high-level international dialogues on future global action on climate change.
