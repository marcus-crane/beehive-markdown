Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard said today's announcement of $5.4 million to support export growth of the New Zealand music industry will strengthen the role of the [New Zealand Music Industry Commission (NZMIC)](http://www.nzmusic.org.nz/).

As a result of the report of the Music Industry Export Development Group, 'Creating Heat', the government today announced that the NZMIC will receive additional funding of $622,000 from 1 July 2005.

Of this funding, $178,000 will be used to enhance NZMIC’s current domestic activities on an ongoing basis. These include the provision of legal advice, coordination of resources for touring and Maori music and support for music industry bodies such as Independent Music New Zealand.

"This extra funding will enable NZMIC to undertake new activities, such as working with government and sector organizations to encourage a greater use of New Zealand music in screen production and, significantly, take a central role in the development, promotion and support of ‘export ready’ artists," Judith Tizard said.

For each of the next three years $444,000 will also be provided to NZMIC to fund a music specific market development grants programme. The scheme will be designed to help New Zealand music export projects break into overseas markets by providing support for artists and/or their representatives to undertake market scoping visits, develop international networks and utilize in-market experts.

"Funding the Music Industry Commission recognises the depth of the talent in New Zealand and the huge potential of the New Zealand music industry which makes a unique and valuable contribution to New Zealand culture. This success is demonstrated by the popularity of [New Zealand Music Month](http://www.nzmusicmonth.co.nz) and the dramatic increase of New Zealand music content on radio," Judith Tizard said.
