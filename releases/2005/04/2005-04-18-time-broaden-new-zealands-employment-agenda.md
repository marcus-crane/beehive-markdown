Productivity, participation and skills would be a key focus for the government in a third term as it moved to address skill and labour shortages, Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Addressing a meeting of the Mayors Taskforce for Jobs on behalf of Labour, Steve Maharey said the government's employment priorities were evolving to reflect New Zealand's strong economic position and changing labour market.

"We've spent the past five years working hard to reduce the sustained high unemployment of the 1990s," Steve Maharey said. " As unemployment has dropped the government has shifted its focus to the quality of employment in New Zealand – not just the quantity of jobs.

"This has meant more emphasis has been placed on productivity, participation and the skills of workers. It's now time to recognise that these are the employment issues of the future."

Steve Maharey called on the Mayors Taskforce to join the government in its efforts to adapt New Zealand's employment strategy.

"The government and the Mayors Taskforce for Jobs have always shared the vision of full employment. As we move closer to achieving that vision, we should be working together to improve the quality of jobs for both workers and employers.

"In the coming months, the government will be outlining its vision of a New Zealand where all who want to work, can work; where jobs are sustainable and productive; and where New Zealanders can gain the skills needed to adapt in a rapidly changing economy."
