Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment Rick Barker today announced changes to the unemployment benefit stand-down rules and says the first day of May brings welcome change for seasonal workers.

Last week's passing of the Social Security (Social Assistance) Amendment Bill paved the way for this change, promised during last year's budget announcements.

Rick Barker says from 1 May 2005 benefit applicants will be able to choose an income assessment period of 26 or 52 weeks for the assessment of the initial stand-down. Currently they have to have it assessed only over the last 6 months of work.

"This change recognises that seasonal workers in particular may face a stand–down of two and a half months because they show a high income for the short period they were working, but this income may have to last for the whole year so is not high when considered annually," he said.

"Significantly reducing the stand-down by assessing their income over a 12 month period will be much fairer for these valued workers that the industry needs back next season.

" A married freezing worker with three children told me he currently faces a 4-5 weeks stand down after his final pay and he gets depressed about this because can't provide for his family. He says he drifts into a financial crisis at end of every season.

"This is one of the best pieces of news he has ever had because he can cope with one or two weeks without pay and now isn't being driven away from the industry so this is also good news for industry.  
"The government is working with the horticultural industry to encourage more kiwis into the seasonal workforce by reducing barriers to part time work. This change to benefit stand down rules will be an incentive for people to enter the seasonal work force."  
The government also introduced Seasonal Work Assistance to cover people who move from a benefit into seasonal work but lose income because of the weather.  
This change will advantage approximately 4,500 benefit applicants a year by reducing the length of their initial stand down. The Government is committing $6.3 million to this stand-down change over the next four financial years.
