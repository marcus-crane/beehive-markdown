Minister of Statistics Pete Hodgson has congratulated Government Statistician Brian Pink on his appointment as Chairman of the International Association for Official Statistics (IAOS).

The appointment was confirmed at the annual general meeting of the IAOS in Sydney on Friday 8 April.

"I am confident that Brian Pink's appointment will benefit official statistics in New Zealand by enabling greater access to other statistical expertise, more exchange opportunities and a higher profile for New Zealand statistics," says Pete Hodgson.

IAOS is an international non-governmental organisation, which was created and developed as a specialised section of the International Statistical Institute (ISI). IAOS brings together producers and users of official statistics.

The objectives of IAOS are to:

·promote the understanding and advancement of official statistics and related subjects; and

·foster the development of effective and efficient official statistical services, particularly in developing countries, through international contacts among individuals and organisations, including users of official statistics as well as research institutions.

The chairmanship has a two year term and will be held in conjunction with his existing responsibilities.
