Muriel Newman's claim that benefit spending has increased under the Labour-led government is simply wrong, Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

"Muriel Newman is desperate to show that Labour has increased welfare spending," Steve Maharey said. "The figures she's touting today include superannuation and the veteran's pension. When only benefits are included expenditure has actually fallen slightly from $3.65 billion to $3.59 billion despite annual inflation adjustments.

"I'm sure most New Zealanders would not classify super and veteran's pension as benefits. Does ACT propose to cut these entitlements?

"The truth is that there are fewer people on benefits than there were five years ago and the government spends less on benefits now than it did before the Labour-led government was elected."
