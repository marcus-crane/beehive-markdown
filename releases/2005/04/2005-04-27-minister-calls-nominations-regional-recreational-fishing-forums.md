Fisheries Minister David Benson-Pope is calling for nominations from recreational fishers who want to be part of new regional recreational fishing forums being established by the Ministry of Fisheries.

“This initiative will give recreational fishers greater input into fisheries decision-making, and recognises the importance of recreational fishing to New Zealand society,” said Mr Benson-Pope. “It is likely that the forums will consider such issues as fisheries management; sustainability measures; compliance issues; and research and other fisheries services.”

There is currently one existing forum, South Island - South, with established membership. Applications are invited to participate in the following new regional forums:  
South Island - North to be based in Nelson/Blenheim  
North Island - South East Coast to be based in Gisborne/Napier  
North Island - South West Coast to be based in Wellington  
North Island - Central West Coast to be based in Auckland  
North Island - Central East Coast to be based in Auckland/Tauranga  
North Island - North to be based in Whangarei/Paihia

Mr Benson-Pope said that forum members would be expected to attend around four meetings annually.

"I have attended the existing South Island – South forum and think that these forums have a valuable contribution to make - particularly in bringing a regional perspective to recreational fisheries issues", said Mr Benson-Pope.

"The work of the regional forums will complement the work of the new Ministerial Recreational Advisory Panel", said Mr Benson-Pope.

Further information and application forms can be found on the Ministry of Fisheries website at www.fish.govt.nz. Applications must be received by the Administrator, Regional Recreational Fishing Forums, Ministry of Fisheries, PO Box 19747, Auckland, no later than 5pm on 27 May 2005.

It is expected that the forums will be appointed in June 2005.
