Today will see the first opportunity for a new cultural cluster of Maori owned or operated companies to enter the international tourism market. These companies have come together to actively promote the unique benefits of Maori Culture to key international tourism markets under the banner of “Maori-Experienz.”

This first initiative will see the Maori-Experienz group actively participating and promoting Maori Culture, in conjunction with Tourism New Zealand, at the Emirates Holiday World Travel Show, and the Arabian Travel Mart, which are two major tourism events held in Dubai each year.

This new initiative combines tourism, food, wine, art and contemporary entertainment, wrapped up in authentic Maori experiences.

The Associate Minister of Tourism Dover Samuels says “From the earliest days of our colonial history Maori have played an important role in helping to market a unique image of Aotearoa-New Zealand to the world.”

He continues “With the dawning of a new millennium Maori now own an exciting array of tourist operations, from thermal villages, four wheel drive adventure and premium lodges. The group also includes, voyaging waka, guided walks, indigenous food and contemporary traditional entertainment. Maori-Experience seeks to highlight in a unique style, their tribal stories and recount their history in their home areas, in places where they have, by birth, a special connection”.

The essence of this new group can be found in its core values He Tangata, Kaitiakitanga, Manaakitanga. Simply put, it is the people, caring for the environment, and providing hospitality.

The new national initiative is a bold bid to capture these experiences and to deliver them into the international tourism market place. The resolve of the group focuses on the single belief-in unity, there is strength and that by taking a consistent, long term strategic approach, Aotearoa New Zealand and its peoples will be the beneficiaries.

Mr Samuels concludes “Diversity and authenticity are hallmarks in defining these quite extraordinary experiences and there is little doubt that in the near future when visitors seek a quality cultural experience of Aotearoa New Zealand they will seek out a Maori-tourism experience.”
