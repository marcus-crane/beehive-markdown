National's Families spokesperson Judith Collins should either front up with evidence to support her claim the Families Commission is involved in electioneering, or stop making such ridiculous allegations, says Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey.

"This is a serious allegation to be making about a public body. If Ms Collins has any evidence that the material produced for the 'What makes your family tick' campaign is electioneering she should immediately bring this to the attention of the Auditor General."

Steve Maharey said that the campaign was a public consultation exercise and was clearly in line with the Families Commission mandate to champion families and to commission relevant research.

"I seriously wonder whether Ms Collins has bothered to read any of the material produced by the Families Commission, or indeed anything relevant to her portfolio.

"I suggest she take some time to get on top of her portfolio rather than leaping down every blind alley.

"The Families Commission is getting on with its job – I suggest Ms Collins get on with hers and start telling the public what National intends to do to support New Zealand families."
