Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced New Zealand’s 2006 programme of International Doctoral Research Scholarships in Thailand.

Prime Minister Clark said it was particularly appropriate to announce these scholarships, in Bangkok, at the same time as she officiated over the signing of the Thailand-New Zealand Closer Economic Partnership, and the bilateral Working Holiday Scheme.

“Of all the people-to-people links that underpin the Economic Partnership, education links are by far the strongest” she said, noting that Thai students had been studying in New Zealand since the days of the Colombo Plan. “Nowadays, more students from Thailand than any other ASEAN country study in New Zealand – 4300 last year, at universities, secondary and primary schools, and in English language institutes.”

“We are committed to deepening those educational partnerships” said the Prime Minister. “The Doctoral Scholarship programme is about sharing our academic and research excellence with the rest of the world, and bringing the best from elsewhere to share their knowledge with New Zealand.”

“Up to 40 scholarships will be awarded this year, to provide financial support for students from designated countries, including Thailand, undertaking doctoral degrees by research in New Zealand universities” said Miss Clark.

The Doctoral Scholarships, awarded on the basis of academic merit, are worth up to approximately NZ$40,000 per year. Scholarships are awarded for three years of full time study for a doctoral degree, and funding covers international tuition fees, travel, living and health insurance allowances, and provision for book and thesis costs.

Applications for Doctoral Scholarships close on 15 July 2005. Application forms, and information on eligibility and terms and conditions, can be found on [www.newzealandeducated.com/scholarships](www.newzealandeducated.com/scholarships)
