A pilot anti-truancy project, which automatically notifies parents by text message if their children are not at school, is being evaluated by the government to see if it will be suitable for all schools.

Associate Education Minister David Benson-Pope says the early notification pilot in five schools has just been completed.

"This is cutting edge technology and uses a range of notification techniques - email, text, mobile and landline voice calls," said Mr Benson-Pope. "Anecdotally, I am told schools involved indicated that attendance rates improved significantly once they started sending electronic messages to parents.

"Absence data, recorded by teachers, is combined with contact details in the school's student management systems (SMS), which then generates an instant 'alert' to caregivers. Schools can know if a parent is aware their child is absent within minutes and set about challenging the behaviour of a student who is truant."

All the data gathered during the four-month pilot will be used to determine how or when the technology can be rolled out to all schools that would benefit from its incorporation into school SMS.

Mr Benson-Pope says he is looking forward to seeing results from the pilot to see how effective the project has been. He says that because the software is new in New Zealand it will be important to know if it will be a useful tool here.

"If the system has performed as well as similar systems overseas we think it has the potential to reduce truancy. It will improve the timeliness and quality of school-parent communications about attendance and absence, and will free up resources at schools allowing them to focus on harder cases."

Mr Benson-Pope says he expects to have an evaluation report within a month for his consideration.

Mr Benson-Pope says the early notification pilot is one of several initiatives to combat truancy being worked on by the Ministry of Education. Today he also announced $4.8million of new funding in Budget 2005 for an electronic enrolment system and reported on a successful parent prosecutions pilot in Auckland.
