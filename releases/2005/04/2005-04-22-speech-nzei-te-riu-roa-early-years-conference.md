Kia ora Tatou.

Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for the invitation to join you at your conference today.

I am very pleased to have this opportunity to meet with people involved in both early childhood education and primary education on the same occasion.

I'm pleased to have the opportunity to acknowledge the vital role you play. Your contribution in those formative years remains with children throughout their lives.

I speak with at least a little knowledge of the sector. Many of you will know that I was in the classroom as recently as 1998 - albeit as a secondary teacher – but please don't hold that against me.

And I am following with great interest the education of my own children who have recently made the transition from primary to secondary school.

Rather further back, but not quite in the mists of time, I was President of the Student Teachers Association and remember well leading a march down Lambton Quay to protest that the salary of Kindergarten teacher trainees was less than the unemployment benefit. We won that day!

I haven't lost that commitment to our young people so I would like to talk today about what the Government is doing with the sector to advance our shared interest of delivering and improving teaching and learning outcomes for our children.

I also want to talk a little about the about the political landscape in which we all find ourselves.

You may have noticed the political temperature rising just a little around educational issues.  
That reflects how passionate we all are about education, but also reflects significant differences in approach between the political parties as to how we can best provide our children with the opportunities to which they are entitled.

But firstly I would like to acknowledge the road we – you and your union (NZEI - Te Riu Roa) and the Government - have travelled together in recent times – sometimes not seeing eye to eye – but more often, I think, in agreement.

Some of the highlights on that journey have been:

In terms of early childhood education  
·kindergarten teachers returned to the state sector, and a national agreement negotiated  
·pay parity negotiated and funded  
·continued roll-out of the ten year strategic plan for early childhood education, including the staged introduction of stronger requirements on early childhood centres to employ trained and registered teachers  
·significantly increased funding to reflect the costs of hiring qualified teachers  
·20 hours free announced for three and four year olds from 2007 in community-based centres

In terms of schools  
·2,700 extra teachers over and above roll growth – 1,117 in primary schools  
·27,800 laptops in schools  
·the competitive funding model for special education disbanded. SES moved into the Ministry of Education  
·decile funding redistributed to low decile schools  
·the right for children to attend their local school

In terms of valuing teachers and support staff  
·teachers council established  
·bulk funding ended and extra bulk funding money distributed to all schools.  
·principals moved from fixed term IECs onto collectives and made permanent  
·support staff moved back into a national agreement; qualifications recognized, professional development included

Progress we have achieved together and a record I think of which we can be justly proud.

Quality education ensures that every child regardless of who they are and where they come from can achieve their full potential and participate in and contribute to New Zealand’s society and economy.

Every New Zealander is entitled to access quality public education of the highest standard, throughout their lives.

The work of this Government has been a process of rebuilding, and there is much more to do.

Here I would like to acknowledge my colleague Trevor Mallard for the hard work he has done in getting us to where we are today.

For those of you who are unsure of our roles, let me explain. Trevor has delegated responsibility for schools and the compulsory sector generally to me as associate minister, while Trevor as Minister of Education retains early childhood education and tertiary, including teacher training.

To achieve quality education we have to fund it. And maybe we are lucky that Trevor is also the Associate Minister of Finance.

But fund the sector, we have. Though of course there is always more to fund, and more need, as I have noted from your support staff claim!

No one can doubt the Government's commitment to schools and early childhood education has been real, substantial and continuous after a decade of under-funding by National.

Education spending on the schools sector has increased by around one third under Labour, rising by almost $1billion in the past five years from $3.5billion in 1999 to just under $4.5billion in 2004, not including Government spending on property.

Government investment in early childhood education will have increased a massive 97% since 1999.

By 2008 overall funding for Education will have increased by 50% since Labour came into office

New Zealand is now ranked 3rd in the OECD for the amount of GDP spent on state primary and secondary schools (4.3%).

Teacher salaries have also increased by 18.5 per cent in this time, and further increases are still to come. And because the Labour-led Government supports pay parity, this means all teachers, regardless of the shoe size of their students.

Other key facts include:

·14.4% increase in operational funding per pupil in real terms since 1999  
·$700 million increase in property funding  
·$98 million on ICT resources and infrastructure this year  
·$48.3 million on Project Probe to get broadband internet access to every school  
·$111 million in extra resources and support provided to schools (including teacher professional development)  
·$43 million in targeted literacy initiatives  
·$12 million in targeted numeracy initiatives  
·the AsTTle assessment tool giving teachers and parents information on literacy and numeracy skills, and the tools to address any problems  
·From mid-2007, all 3 and 4 year olds will be entitled to 20 hours per week free early childhood education in teacher-led, community based services  
·We have created scholarships for early childhood teachers  
·We have undertaken research to improve teaching and learning

The focus of your conference is collaborative approaches in the early years – a worthwhile and timely topic. I want to extend that approach to include the relationship with government to achieve our mutual goals.

This year our strategies for each part of the education sector – tertiary, schooling and early childhood education will be in place.

These strategies are the result of such collaborative effort.

A key to that strategy is the involvement of parents and whanau.  
In February this year we announced a major new information programme for parents and families.

We want this programme to encourage families to better understand the positive contribution they can make to their children’s learning.

We are very excited to have Tana Umaga on board as the Education Ambassador to assist us with the work.

The importance of relationships is articulated in the Te Whaariki early childhood education curriculum, which at its heart stresses the value of relationships and those of the family and the community.

On 1 April the new early childhood education funding system was implemented. This funding system gives you the wings to fly because it will invest an additional 307 million over four years.

The funding is aimed at recognising staff who have gained qualifications and registration - a key factor in lifting the overall quality of early childhood education. Hiring qualified staff is more expensive and the extra funding recognises that.

Importantly, the new funding system includes a process where centres attest to minimum levels of pay, to ensure that it is the staff who are rewarded for their qualifications.

They are also funded on the basis of rewarding experience, as set out in the Consenting Parties agreement and I expect that good centres will pay at least that rate.

Last week government released its information, communications and technology (ICT) framework for early childhood education – Foundations for Discovery. This framework is aimed at supporting early childhood education services to use ICT to improve the quality of teaching and learning in early childhood education services.

I am thrilled to see great gains in early childhood participation in education continue – enrolments have increased by nearly 10,000 in the past two years. To build on these gains we have put more funding in place to further support communities where participation is low.

The early childhood education exemplars (Kei Tua o Te Pae) will help to build collaborative relationships between teachers and parents and whânau with a focus on learning.

What is really exiting about the exemplars is they include the voices of parents and whanau, alongside teachers and children.

This is a ground breaking and innovative move for early childhood education in New Zealand and I believe for the rest of the world.

Now comes the politics. The National party's announcement of their education policy last week means they are opposed to the fundamental goals of Nga Huarahi Arataki - our "Pathways to the Future" strategy – the goals of participation, quality and collaborative engagement.

Instead of increasing participation National would make participation and access for children increasingly dependent on the size of a family's wallet.

Instead of improving quality National would remove all the safeguards to quality teaching so that the world would be divided between elite providers and 'backstreet" providers.

We have just seen their leader not just condoning but encouraging illegal activity.

Instead of promoting collaborative relationships National would apply the iron law of the market.

We need to be careful lest we find the pathway to the future littered with detour signs.

Parental choice is a good thing – but it is actually about having access to the best quality education wherever you live – and about having the choice of going to your local school – and about your local early childhood centre being top quality.

National Testing – well even Bill English has told NZEI that that won't work. But he was out-voted by Don.

Vouchers - Based on the recent statements of their leader, the National party's real agenda seems to be about using literacy as an excuse to rob schools of funding so their business mates can set up private 'schools' run by unqualified teachers

Bulk funding – forget the bribes, it would be compulsory for schools this time! It would mean a divided teaching community not a collaborative one – and it would mean an end to your national agreement.

The Bureaucracy – the opposition are keen to cut the alleged expanding bureaucracy. They point to increased staff numbers at the Ministry of Education.

Well those extra staff are special education teachers.

In my hometown the alleged increase in the bureaucracy since 1999 consists of the 30 special ed teachers who were transferred to the ministry when Special Education Services was disbanded. No one has bothered to tell Bill they are not policy analysts but hard working teachers.

Which of them would be for the chop I wonder?

The choice couldn't be more clear for the future education of our children. Moving forward, or sliding backwards.

We will have some interesting debates ahead – and I am sure you are all up to challenge – having been at the forefront of these debates in former times.

Thank you for your valuable contribution to our strategies – it is really vital to have the involvement of those working most directly with our young children.

Without that support and involvement we can make no progress.

Your conference is an ideal opportunity for you to share your valuable insight and experiences right across the early years.

I encourage you to keep challenging yourselves, the ministry and people like me in Government.

We have a fine education system in New Zealand. Students and teachers perform at very high levels. We should be proud of our achievements and creativity. But there is always more to do, and the work you do significantly improves the learning and wellbeing of children throughout New Zealand – whoever they are and whereever they are.

I wish you all the very best for the rest of your conference and a happy and successful 2005.
