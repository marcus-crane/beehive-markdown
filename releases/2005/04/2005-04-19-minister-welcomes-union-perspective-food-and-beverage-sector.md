The report, 'The Food and Beverage Sector: A Trade Union Perspective', has been welcomed today by the Minister for Economic Development, Jim Anderton.

"I welcome this report as a sign of the strong commitment of the union movement of New Zealand to work collaboratively with industry to raise the performance of New Zealand's food and beverage sector.

"The sector is a significant employer, particularly in the regions, and with careful development, it will contribute to lifting economic growth and living standards.

"The report will be a useful input into the work of the Food and Beverage taskforce. It highlights the need for upskilling of the labour force and emphasises the positive contribution that trade unions can make to enhancing the sector's strategic direction," Jim Anderton said.

'The Food and Beverage Sector: A Trade Union Perspective' was released today and has been written by Bill Cochrane, Michael Law and Gemma Piercy, for the Centre for Labour and Trade Union Studies, University of Waikato, NZ.
