Communications Minister David Cunliffe announced today the completion of a "reality check" Review by the Ministry of Economic Development into the Radio Spectrum Policy.

Mr Cunliffe says the purpose of MED's Review is to determine the effectiveness of the contribution made by radio spectrum legislation, regulations and policy towards meeting New Zealand's economic, social and cultural needs.

"In 1989 we were the first country in the world to make radio frequencies available as property rights so that users could employ them as assets to be bought, sold, leased or mortgaged," he said.

"There can be no doubt that the tremendous expansion in radiocommunications and telecommunications services in the last decade has been stimulated by the flexibility of the property rights regime."

Mr Cunliffe says in the same decade and a-half there have been innumerable technological breakthroughs such as the serial deployment of 1G, 2G and 3G cellular telephony, digital television and radio are on the horizon while wireless broadband is here.

"Fifteen years on it was time for a reality check. Will the Radiocommunications Act meet the needs of the coming decade? Is the competitive market woring as it should? Can our Regulations cope with the new technologies? Should more spectrum be made available under the property rights regime?"

Mr Cunliffe says the answers to all the questions are being worked on in future work programmes. However, the Review does a good job of highlighting what the real questions are.

"In the coming months we will be addressing the issues and, where necessary, developing new policies and systems as a result of the Review."

A copy of the Review report is available on the MED website at http://www.med.govt.nz/rsm/spp/review/ from Monday, 18 April.
