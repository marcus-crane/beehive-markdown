The government’s rates rebates scheme boost should encourage older voters to look at the record of political parties, not the rhetoric, says Auckland Central MP Judith Tizard.

Prime Minister Helen Clark tonight announced that this year’s Budget will mean up to 300,000 low-income and elderly New Zealanders are eligible from next year for an annual rates deduction of up to $500.

Judith Tizard says Auckland pensioners can always do with more assistance but the rates rebate boost adds to the Labour-led government’s restoration of the pension to a minimum of 65 per cent of the average wage.

"That means a pensioner couple is now $22.41 better off each week than they would have been under National’s 60 per cent of average wage."

Judith Tizard says around 63,300 people in Central, West and North Shore Auckland now receive state-funded superannuation and Labour understands how important it is for them to have the security of their pension guaranteed.

The older community was also among the first to benefit from the government’s primary health care strategy. The Auckland DHB has almost 40,000 people aged 65 and over, who since last July have had access to lower doctor fees and prescription charges capped at $3 per item. Additional funding is also allowing thousands more hip and knee replacements nationally this year.

From 1 July this year, the government will begin to phase out asset testing, which has been long sought by the senior community. This will mean 70 per cent of people in residential facilities won’t have to sell their homes or other assets to pay for their care.

Later this year, a limited driver licence will be an option for around 6000 drivers aged over 80 years living in Auckland. It will allow them to pass a less demanding licence renewal if they only want to drive shorter distances.

Ms Tizard says another key priority this year is to address the low wages of workers who care the elderly and disabled.

"National failed to introduce any of these improvements and other parties are promising policies they'll never have the chance to implement. But with the Labour-led government, retired folk are getting a fairer deal and more opportunities to enjoy life, and they can trust us on superannuation because we've kept our word."
