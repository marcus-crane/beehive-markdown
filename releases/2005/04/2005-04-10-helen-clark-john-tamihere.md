Mr John Tamihere has been under considerable stress. By agreement with the leadership of the Labour Party he is now taking extended leave. He will not be attending caucus this Tuesday.

He has made statements to a journalist which are deeply offensive to New Zealanders. The statements are also offensive and utterly unacceptable to the New Zealand Labour Party.

With respect to the Holocaust, the Labour Party believes it to have been genocide and as such one of the most repugnant and ferocious events of human history.

The pain caused to the Jewish community and to others who suffered in the Holocaust by these thoughtless comments is acknowledged and deeply regretted by the Labour Party.
