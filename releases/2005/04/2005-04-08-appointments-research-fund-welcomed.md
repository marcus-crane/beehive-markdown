Education Minister Trevor Mallard today welcomed the appointment of fifteen top academics as Peer Review Panel chairs for next year’s round of the Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF).

The appointments to the PBRF were announced today by the Tertiary Education Commission. (www.tec.govt.nz)The PBRF aims to promote the development of innovative and productive research environments that produce high quality research, as well as dynamic and effective learning for students.

"It is excellent to see such an impressive array of distinguished academics from universities across New Zealand participating. I believe their commitment to these roles shows the high level of support for the PBRF process," said Trevor Mallard.

"Our government is intent on strengthening our tertiary education system and ensuring that the education people receive is high quality, innovative and relevant to their needs and also to our economy's needs.  
"The PBRF is an example of the government investing in excellence in tertiary education. Using the PBRF, we’re progressively moving toward rewarding tertiary education organisations for their research outputs, rather than paying solely on the number of students.

"The government’s focus is on ensuring strategic investment in high quality research, particularly research in tertiary education organisations relevant to New Zealand’s development goals."

By 2007, when the PBRF is fully in place, more than $180 million per year will be allocated on the basis of measured research quality.

The next PBRF quality evaluation will be held in 2006, with the results reported early in 2007.

"I’m looking forward to highly positive results from the second PBRF evaluation. I think we’ll see a developing research culture with improved performance indicators and increasing numbers of researchers.

"The introduction of the PBRF has been positive for students, researchers and their tertiary education organisations, and New Zealand as a whole," Trevor Mallard said.
