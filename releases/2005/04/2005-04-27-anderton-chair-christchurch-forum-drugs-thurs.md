Jim Anderton will chair a Christchurch public forum on Thursday on alcohol and other drugs, the latest in a series of public meetings on drug abuse he is chairing around New Zealand.

The minister, who chairs the ministerial committee on drug policy, said that as usual an open session will allow for questions to be taken from the floor to the panel of experts that will be attending with him.

"The feedback from other meetings I've convened is that they are considered well worthwhile by the local communities which have so far participated.

"They are an opportunity to gather information about what is being done and where to get help, as well as a good meeting place to share practical advice on how we can together beat drug abuse in our communities," the Progressive leader said.

Jim Anderton's last public meeting was in Nelson last month.

Over the next few months, he will chair meetings in Whangarei, Dunedin, Napier, Levin and Whakatane. He has already chaired similar meetings in Gisborne, Tauranga, Manukau, Morrinsville and Waitakere.

Alcohol abuse is New Zealand's biggest single drug problem and there are concerns about the abuse of legal substances like so-called ‘Party Pills,’ as well as the abuse of dangerous illegal drugs like methamphetamine or P.

The meetings survey measures to reduce both the supply and demand for drugs, as well as prevention and the treatment availability for victims of the drug peddlers.

Christchurch Netball Centre, 455 Hagley Ave, Hagley Park
