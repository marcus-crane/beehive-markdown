The coalition government and key leaders in the forest industry met today and agreed to accelerate their work together under a new relationship to promote the development of the forest industry, Forestry Minister Jim Anderton said today.

"The Forest Industry Development Agenda had its inaugural meeting today, and I am very proud with the progress it has already made.

"FIDA provides a means for the central government and the industry to develop a strategic approach for the industry’s future growth.

It will see the Labour-Progressive government invest $18.1 million (GST excl) to develop the industry, matched with a further $3.8 million (GST excl) contribution expected from industry.

Today's investment has been appropriated in the Labour-Progressive government's budget process and follows last week's announcement by Jim Anderton that Budget 2005 will include an investment of $2.0 million (GST excl) over the next five financial years to help promote excellence in wood design in the construction sector.

"Forestry is a very important industry for New Zealand. It has long been a major export earner – New Zealand's third largest in terms of the contribution to our merchandise exports – and employer in regions. It has the potential to become even more important economically and socially," the Progressive leader said.

Jim Anderton, who is also Minister for Economic, Industry and Regional Development, said forestry is becoming increasingly recognised as a key contributor to enhancing the natural environment via protecting soils, water and climate change.

"This government is very interested in seeing this important industry reach its true potential, and the FIDA is a key step in making sure this happens.

"The forest industry has been going through challenging international market conditions over the last few years. In particular, the value of the U.S. dollar has collapsed which lowers the returns of New Zealand-based exporters, while international shipping rate increases have also put our industry under pressure.

"But, it is important to see the forest for the trees and keep a longer-term perspective.

"Forestry has a bright future in New Zealand, as significant recent announcements of new investment in wood processing attest.

"While securing this future is not without its challenges and probably some causalities along the way, the partnership approach both across industry and between industry and government agencies has a positive role to play in ensuring we get the most value out of our competitive advantages as an economy.

"To thrive, we need to ensure New Zealand has a highly efficient, market-led industry. Effective and efficient government regulation is part of the equation, as are well-targeted transformational initiatives such as those proposed under the FIDA in areas such as market development, market access, excellence in wood design, labour, skills and bio-energy.

"As well as implementing a range of practical programmes funded under the FIDA, the new engagement will provide also the forest industry and Government to jointly:

·Identify and develop strategies to address emerging strategic issues affecting the industry’s development;  
·Enhance collaboration within and between industry and government agencies; and  
·Improve efficiency and effectiveness of government policies, regulations and programmes.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

What is the Forest Industry Development Agenda?

FIDA is a new relationship between the forest and wood processing industry and the Government. It provides a means for the Government and the industry to develop a strategic approach for the industry’s future growth. It will see the Government invest $18.1 million (GST excl) to develop the industry, starting this year with a further $3.8 million (GST excl) contribution expected from industry.

Why is the Government doing this?

The Government’s investment recognises the industry’s significant economic, social and environmental contribution, including in respect of climate change, and its potential to become New Zealand’s number one export earner.

The agreement addresses areas of industry need already identified in the Wood Processing Strategy.

What is included in FIDA?

The FIDA funding package is worth approximately $18 million over five years.

Areas to be funded would be: market access ($1.2 million over five years), market development ($8 million over four years), bio energy ($2.5 million over five years), skills and training ($4.4 million over five years) and wood design ($2.0 million over five years).

Access to the market access, market development and wood design funding is dependent on securing industry co-funding of approximately $3.8 million (excl GST).

FIDA is also about enhanced collaboration within and between industry and government agencies. It should help make government policies more effective by ensuring that their impact on the forest and wood processing industries is well thought through.

Will industry co-funding be secured and where will it come from?  
This remains to be worked out. It could come from the whole industry, from companies or groups of companies. It will be up to the industry to secure the funding if it wishes to access the Government contribution towards market access, market development and wood design. In the market access area the industry, through the New Zealand Forest Industries Council, has already been funding key initiatives with the Government for the last two years. The establishment of a new umbrella body for the industry, if this can be achieved, may also be helpful in this context.

Does FIDA meet industry needs?

FIDA presents a good opportunity to make immediate progress on important industry development issues.

The areas that would receive funding via FIDA include most of the development initiatives that industry has agreed are important.

The market development funding is $3 million less than was offered in last year’s proposed Forest Industry Framework Agreement (FIFA), but the deferred timeline (starting in July 2005) allows the industry more time to get the programme and the required co-funding in place.

Some of the initiatives contained in the FIFA proposals have not been carried forward to the FIDA. However the Government has advised that at the explicit request of the industry and with the agreement of the Ministers of Forestry and Finance, a portion of the funding for the market development initiative can be transferred to other areas of priority.

What does industry need to do in return?  
Industry needs to contribute up to $3 million if it wishes to access government funding for market access, market development and wood design.

The Government also invites the industry to co-operate actively in the governance of FIDA, the development of strategy and the delivery of the programmes. There will be no Memorandum of Understanding required.

What about funding for roading?

FIDA doesn’t include the regional road transport funding from the original FIFA offer. But Minister Anderton has confirmed that meeting the key transport needs of the forest industry in Northland and Tairawhiti through the regional development fund remains a high priority, and that current funding levels ($23 million pa) are expected to continue through until 2007/08 at least, consistent with Transfund's ten year forecast.

In early 2006/07 there will be a full review of regional development transport funding.

Is the FIDA funding confirmed?

Yes, the first release of funding will be available in the current calendar year, except for market development and wood design which will be available from 1 July 2005, subject to the industry’s contribution.

Who will decide how the funding is spent?

A Steering Group has been established to provide governance for FIDA. The Steering Group will will provide strategic input and direction for the FIDA process. It will consider and provide advice on any issue it considers significant to the development of the industry.

The Steering Group will help identify the key strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats facing the industry over the next 5-15 years. The Steering Group will also help relate this strategic analysis to a programme of activities and initiatives with clear objectives and achievable near-time milestones.

Members of the Steering Group are

Hon Jim Anderton (Chair)  
Lees Seymour, Chairman, NZFIC/ Weyerhaeuser  
Peter Berg, President, NZFOA / Pentarch Forest Products  
Gary McVicar, President, NZTIF/McVicar Timber Group  
Bruce Anderson, Pine Pac  
George Asher, Lake Taupo Forests  
Richard Carbines, Jenkin Timber  
Grant Carruthers, Chairman, FITEC

Sheldon Drummond, Juken NZ  
Luke Moriarty, Rubicon Limited  
Murray Sherwin, MAF  
Peter Springford, Carter Holt Harvey  
Ross Wilson, (Jim Jones) Council of Trade Unions

The Steering Group will be advised and supported by a Management Group of senior officials, industry association executives, local government and Union officials.

Other groups will be established to provide advice in specific areas.

What happened to FIFA?

FIDA is a separate agreement from the proposed Forest Industry Framework Agreement (FIFA).

Last year it became clear the industry as a whole had difficulty in accepting FIFA, because of issues around deforestation and carbon credits.

Towards the end of 2004 the Forest Industries Council, the Forest Owners Association and the Farm Forestry Association put forward a new, amended proposal that suggested the Government address industry development and carbon policy issues separately.

FIDA is the industry development result of that proposal. It includes the majority of the development initiatives included in the proposed FIFA agreement.

FIDA does not concern carbon policy issues. Acceptance of FIDA does not involve the industry giving ground on any of these issues. The industry continues to press for resolution of these issues with Government.

How will Kyoto issues be addressed?

The Government is well aware of the industry’s perspective on Kyoto-related issues. Industry organisations will continue to represent member concerns strongly, as will individual companies.

What has happened to the Wood Processing Strategy?

FIDA supersedes the WPS and builds on its earlier initiatives and outcomes.
