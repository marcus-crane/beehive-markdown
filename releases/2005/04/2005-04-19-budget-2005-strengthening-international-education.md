Education Minister Trevor Mallard today announced extra spending of $21 million on international education over the next four years, to further boost the industry in New Zealand and strengthen bi-lateral links offshore.

"This brings the government’s investment in international education to over $70 million across the five years from June 2004 to 30 June 2009," Trevor Mallard said. Trevor Mallard was speaking from India where he is leading the first ever New Zealand education mission to that country.

“This progressive expansion of government's investment in international education underpins our commitment to increasing and strengthening education as a key part of New Zealand's strategic relationships with the rest of the world. It also reflects our desire to help the industry diversify across more markets. "

- The new funding lowers the cost of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) study to domestic fee levels for new international students in New Zealand, where they are supervised by leading researchers at New Zealand universities, from the beginning of 2006.
- It also allows the children of all international PhD students to attend school without paying international student fees.

“This initiative will increase the attractiveness of our universities as study destinations and research locations in the international education market. It will result in greater interest from international PhD students with school-age children who have not previously been able to afford to come here,” said Trevor Mallard.

“There will be direct benefits to universities, particularly as it will help raise the quality and output of academic research. Some of these students may want to stay on and work in New Zealand when they have finished their studies, which will also significantly raise our research and educational capabilities.”

Information on the new policy for international postgraduate students will be included in the universities’ promotional material, and on the industry website targeted to international students. (www.newzealandeducated.com)

- The new funding also speeds up the establishment of the off-shore education counsellor network with three new education counsellors. It allows for expansion of the network from four to at least seven countries or regions by the end of 2006. The network aims to strengthen long-term education partnerships with key countries and regions.
- The first four positions are in Beijing (from February 2004), Washington DC (from mid 2005), Brussels (late 2005), and Kuala Lumpur (early 2006). Decisions on the additional positions will be announced later in 2005.
  
  Trevor Mallard also reiterated changes to student visa policies, announced by Immigration Minister Paul Swain, to make New Zealand a more attractive and secure place to study.  
  These changes include increased opportunities for part-time employment, to help supplement students’ income, and to make post-degree work experience in New Zealand easier to obtain.  
  Today Trevor Mallard also signed a New Zealand-India education cooperation arrangement with his Indian counterpart, Hon Arjun Singh.
