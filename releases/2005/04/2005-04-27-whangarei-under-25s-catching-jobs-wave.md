Young adults in Whangarei are getting jobs at a rapid rate. Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment Rick Barker released figures today that show the number of local 18-24 year olds on the unemployment benefit has dropped by an impressive 70.5 per cent since March 1999.

There are around 686 young adults requiring an unemployment benefit in Whangarei now compared to 2326 people in March 1999.

"The number of young adults from the whole of the central Whangarei region and Kamo on the unemployment benefit has dropped a staggering 75% going from 757 to 186 people and 360 to 120 people respectively," said Rick Barker.

"The low youth unemployment figures for Whangarei are part of a significant national trend of young people getting off the dole and into work. In Jan 1999 there were 54,144 young New Zealanders (16-24) on the dole and that figure now is 35,302, a reduction of around 65 per cent.

Latest figures show 5,540 local people were involved in industry training during 2004 in Northland and more schools here are involved with the Gateway programme.

"Each week I read stories about young men and women who are gaining qualifications through industry training or modern apprenticeships. Photographers have snapped them beaming with pride at their achievement, no longer are they on the scrap heap of the dismal 90s. Youth are motivated and enjoying the economic high too,"

Last year across New Zealand 10,000 young adults joined the workforce.

"Okara Park rugby stadium full of enthusiastic youths may be a scary thought for some, but that's how many people have moved off the dole and are working in small local businesses, construction industry or designing and teaching for example. There has never been a better time to be young and wanted," he said.

"The government will continue to develop youth programmes and started rolling out the successful youth partnerships with Councils and develop the Youth Transitions programme in more centres in New Zealand.

"I also want to acknowledge the companies that are part of gateway and apprenticeship training and anyone else who employs a young person. It is tough for young people to be taken seriously sometimes and to be given a chance; your help can be the beginning of a great life for that person," said Rick Barker.
