A Queen’s Counsel appointment round will be held this year, Attorney General Michael Cullen said today.

“The round was deferred in February on the basis that the Lawyers and Conveyancers Bill was about to be enacted and it was necessary to establish new appointment mechanisms under that legislation.

“As the passage of the Bill has now been deferred, I have in consultation with the Chief Justice decided to hold a round in accordance with the existing processes.

“Those wishing to be considered for appointment as Queen’s Counsel should apply in writing to the Solicitor-General before 31 May 2005 with the information required by the Practice Note dated 12 August 1991.

“Applicants will be notified of the outcome by 30 June 2005,” Dr Cullen said.
