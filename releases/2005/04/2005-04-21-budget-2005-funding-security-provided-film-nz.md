Film New Zealand can now plan its work, secure in the knowledge that it has government funding of $578,000 (excluding GST) a year for two years, Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton announced today. The industry body was established to facilitate overseas productions in New Zealand.

This is a key outcome of a government review of the promotional work of Film New Zealand and Investment NZ. Cabinet approved the funding as part of Budget 2005.

“For the last 10 years, at least, Film NZ’s government funding has been provided on a year by year basis. The latest review of its work convinced Cabinet that greater security was needed to enable Film NZ to continue its work in facilitating domestic and overseas film and television productions and to continue fostering the screen production sector’s rapid expansion,” Jim Anderton said.

Jim Anderton said the review of Film NZ and Investment NZ was conducted because a lack of clarity regarding international promotion activities has frustrated the domestic screen production industry. Cabinet has now agreed to a clearer separation of duties between Investment NZ and Film NZ. The distinct roles will be formalised through a memorandum of understanding between Film NZ and Investment NZ.

"Investment NZ will now have overall accountability for all activities aiming to promote New Zealand as a screen production location. It has a deep reservoir of marketing talent and expertise to put towards the task.

“Film NZ is the national locations office and, with its deep domestic industry networks and excellent appreciation of film makers’ creative needs, is now formally the primary facilitation agency for offshore screen productions in New Zealand, including coordinating regional film offices," Jim Anderton said.
