Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Tariana Turia is delighted that the country's 27 community law centres have earnt a welcome reprieve from the Minister of Justice, Hon Simon Power.

"The work that these law centres do across our communities is vital" said Mrs Turia. "The volunteers and legal practitioners provide legal support for those who cannot afford legal services".

"I met with representatives from the Coalition of Community Law Centres recently, and was greatly impressed at the range of services they provide including legal education programmes; free legal advice and assistance for community groups and resources such as information booklets".

"It's been really positive too, to hear about the impact of initiatives such as the kaimahi-a-iwi which work with whanau in the community to help meet their legal needs".

"The community law centres help ensure that all New Zealanders are able to access legal services" said Mrs Turia. 

"The Minister's decision reflects on the dedication of the community law centres in putting their case to Parliament; as well as the compassion and sound judgment of Minister Power".
