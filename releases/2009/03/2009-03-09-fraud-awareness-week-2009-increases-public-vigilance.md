Fraud Awareness Week 2009 has been a resounding success: people are more aware of fraud in the community and are visiting the Ministry of Consumer Affairs' 'Scamwatch' website - the message is getting out there and reaching people, Minister of Consumer Affairs Heather Roy said today.

"As the slogan for Fraud Awareness Week says: 'Scams Target You - Protect Yourself'.  Consumer Affairs Ministry figures from the week show that people are increasingly aware that if a deal seems too good to be true, then it most probably is," Mrs Roy said.

"On Fraud Awareness Week launch day alone, the 'Scamwatch' website (www.scamwatch.govt.nz) recorded 3,490 user sessions - the highest number ever recorded for one day on the website, and up 139 percent on Fraud Awareness Week launch day 2008," Mrs Roy said.

"This has been echoed by user session numbers recorded for the entire week: 12,750 - a 166 percent increase on the 4,791 recorded during Fraud Awareness Week 2008.  Further, the Consumer Affairs Ministry contact centre receives an average 25 emails a week relating to scams.  During Fraud Awareness Week, this increased 84 percent.

"These numbers show that Fraud Awareness Week is achieving its goal of raising awareness and educating New Zealanders about how to identify scams, protect themselves and others from scams, and report scams via 'Scamwatch'.

"This success can be directly attributed to all the agencies involved - both public and private - who all work hard to help New Zealanders avoid being cheated out of their hard-earned money.

"Fraud Awareness Week 2009 has now drawn to a close, but the momentum of its success will continue on.  When Kiwis are well aware of scams, it is much harder for fraudsters to plot and scheme," Mrs Roy said.
