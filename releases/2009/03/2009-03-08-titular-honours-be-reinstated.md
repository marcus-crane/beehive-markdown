Prime Minister John Key has announced that titles are to be reinstated in the New Zealand Honours system.

This situation existed when the New Zealand Honours system was first established in 1996 and the first two levels of the New Zealand Order of Merit were titular.

This will mean the return of the titles of Knight and Dame Grand Companion (GNZM) and Knight and Dame Companion (KNZM/DNZM).

"The Queen has given approval for the reinstatement of titles. The changes will be finalised and come into effect in time for the Queen's Birthday honours list in June.

"It is my pleasure to be able to reinstate these titles that will recognise the service of outstanding New Zealanders."

There are 85 New Zealanders who were appointed Principal and Distinguished Companions of the New Zealand Order of Merit between 2000 and 2008 who will now be given the opportunity to accept a title.

"Before the election I commented publicly that the granting of titles was a matter that would be looked at by an incoming National Government.

"This is about celebrating success."
