The ranks of the New Zealand police grew by an additional 75 officers today with the newest wing to graduate from the Royal New Zealand Police College at Porirua.

Police Minister Judith Collins joined senior police, the patron of Wing 255, Te Akapikirangi Arthur, as well as family and friends in celebrating the graduation of the new officers.

"I am delighted to welcome into the New Zealand police these fine men and women, who bring a diverse range of qualities, life experiences and skills to the job," Ms Collins says.

"Today's graduation marks the beginning of a challenging and rewarding new career for each new officer."

Ms Collins says the New Zealand Police are renowned around the world for their integrity, professionalism and commitment to making communities safer.

She said it was important to the smooth functioning of society that the public had faith in the Police.

"It is vital that the Police are respected and trusted. It is up to each and every officer to maintain that trust," Ms Collins says.

"I am proud of the New Zealand police and firmly believe they are among the finest in the world. I will be counting on all graduates to uphold the legacy of excellence, professionalism and compassion."

Today's graduating wing is the second group to graduate this year. All of today's graduates will be posted to frontline roles as they begin a two-year probationary period.
