The Government is moving quickly to help businesses retain their workers as they feel the economic squeeze, says the Minister for Social Development and Employment Paula Bennett.

Work is continuing around the Job Support Scheme, which is targeted at businesses with over 100 permanent fulltime employees. It will be a top up allowance designed to help companies struggling with the tougher economic conditions.

Employers and workers will negotiate voluntary agreements to reduce their hours of work to up to 10 hours a fortnight. The Government will pay $12.50 (the adult minimum wage) an hour per worker for up to five hours a fortnight.

"We had to move fast on this because every day we hesitate, jobs are being lost. We have to remember this is not just about redundancy numbers. This is about the people who are losing their jobs and wondering how they'll be able to support their families.

"The idea of a nine day fortnight was one of the most popular to emerge from last month's Job Summit. However we recognised cutting up to 10 hours a fortnight from workers' pay packets simply wouldn't be manageable for many families. To that end, the Government is stepping in to do its bit."

Ms Bennett says it's important to be realistic.

"We simply won't be able to save every job. But this is a practical measure we're taking right now to help otherwise viable businesses get back on their feet. "
