Broadcasting Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman has commended TVNZ and SKY for the announcement this afternoon that from 1 July 2009 TVNZ 6 and TVNZ 7 will be broadcast on SKY.

The Minister commented publicly last week about his desire to see TVNZ 6 and TVNZ 7 on the SKY platform.

"It's pleasing to see the networks cooperating to make publicly-funded television available to as many New Zealanders as possible," Minister for Broadcasting Dr Jonathan Coleman said.

TVNZ 6 and TVNZ 7, which are advertisement free and show minority programmes in prime time, are available to 200 000 households through the Freeview digital platform and from 1 July will become available to another 700 000 households that have SKY.

It has also been announced that TV ONE and TV2 will be available in HD to MYSKYHDi viewers from 1 June, and for TV ONE to have regional advertising breakouts, which will potentially increase TVNZ's advertising revenue.

"In the current economic climate it's good to see TVNZ proactively pursuing further business opportunities. TVNZ's strategy of "Inspiring on Every Screen" is backed up by today's announcement. I am pleased to see that the public will be getting increased value for money, " says Dr Coleman.
