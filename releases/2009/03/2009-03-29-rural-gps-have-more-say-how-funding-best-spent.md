Rural GPs and the Ministry of Health are to jointly look at frontline support for rural primary care.

Mr Ryall told delegates at the NZ Rural General Practitioners' Network conference in Wellington this weekend that the Rural GP Network and the Ministry group would look at how to use the different components of rural primary care funding to best support rural general practice.

"A key focus of the joint work programme will be to ensure we are getting maximum benefit from existing funding - given the current financial environment facing the country." said Mr Ryall.

While this work is being done, rural funding (Rural Bonus $4 million and Rural Premium $11 million) will continue to be allocated using current mechanisms.

An additional $5 million will be shared among general practices active in providing rural after-hours services. This is funding set aside by the previous government.

"Rural general practice faces particular challenges from working in more remote areas, and issues of recruitment and retention remain. The new government has announced additional GP training places and the voluntary bonding scheme for midwives, nurses and doctors," Mr Ryall said.
