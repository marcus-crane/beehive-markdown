Associate Health Minister and UnitedFuture leader Peter Dunne tomorrow leads the New Zealand delegation to the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs in Vienna, spearheading the country's contribution to a new declaration on international drugs control.

"This is an important event because no nation fights drugs on its own. They are a global blight and the fight needs to be conducted at an international level," Mr Dunne said.

He said New Zealand, as a party to all three United Nations Conventions under which worldwide drug control is based, took its commitments in the global fight against drugs very seriously.

Mr Dunne said the declaration coming out of the UN conference would acknowledge the achievements of the last decade, but would essentially be looking towards the goal of eliminating or significantly reducing the manufacture, marketing and supply of illegal drugs.

"This is a case of ‘think globally and act locally'... Ultimately the commitments and advances we make in Vienna are part of how we will deal with the scourge of drugs in New Zealand in the years ahead," he said.

The conference begins in Vienna on Thursday, and the New Zealand delegation includes Ministry of Health officials and a New Zealand Drug Foundation official. Mr Dunne returns to New Zealand next weekend.
