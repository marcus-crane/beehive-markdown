Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson is pleased to see unions recognising the protections available to employees on trial periods, in contrast to Trevor Mallard's scaremongering on this legislation.

"Despite some political posturing, the CTU flyer being distributed across the country recognises the Government has safety mechanisms in place for workers with regard to the 90 day trial period.

"While they might be reluctant to admit it, the unions clearly have a better grasp of the legislation than Mr Mallard. I would encourage him to have a read, it should help dispel his fears," Ms Wilkinson says.

The flyer explains that an employment agreement that features a 90 day trial is voluntary and must be agreed to in writing.

It also instructs workers to seek advice if they feel they have been treated differently or unfairly or have been discriminated against.

"It is important that workers understand how this legislation works and what safety mechanisms are in place.  

"Like Mr Mallard was forced to admit himself this morning on radio, most employers know how to treat people well.

"They are not in the business of hiring to fire and a 90 day trial period will help those on the margins get a shot at a new job."
