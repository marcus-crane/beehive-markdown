New Zealand Special Ambassador and Chair of the WTO Doha Round Agriculture Negotiations, Crawford Falconer, will return to New Zealand in April to take up the role of Deputy Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT), Trade Minister Tim Groser said today.

"I would like to acknowledge Mr Falconer's contribution as Chair, which has been widely recognised as being of crucial importance to the agriculture negotiations.

"Originally scheduled to end in December, Mr Falconer's term in Geneva was temporarily extended to continue negotiations that culminated in a further revised agriculture modalities text. 

"This text provides a strong basis for completion of the agriculture negotiations in the near future," said Mr Groser.

Mr Falconer has been succeeded as New Zealand's Permanent Representative in Geneva by Dr David Walker, one of New Zealand's most experienced trade negotiators.

A decision on a new Chair of the Agriculture Negotiations will be made by the WTO membership. 

"New Zealand would be willing to allow Dr Walker to succeed Mr Falconer in the Chair's role if desired by the WTO membership.

"In whatever capacity he ends up serving in Geneva, Dr Walker will make a significant contribution in taking forward New Zealand's strong commitment to a successful conclusion to the Doha Round of trade talks as soon as possible," Mr Groser said.
