The Minister of Commerce, Simon Power, said today he will recommend to the Governor-General that Dr Mark Berry be appointed as the new Chair of the Commerce Commission.

Dr Berry, a barrister who was Deputy Commissioner between 1999 and 2001, will be appointed for a period of 18 months from 1 April.

He will replace Paula Rebstock who is stepping down after nearly 5½ years as Chair.

Mr Power said the commission was fortunate to have someone as experienced as Dr Berry immediately available for the position as the Commission undertakes new regulatory responsibilities following the passing of the Commerce Amendment Act late last year.

"Given that Ms Rebstock's warrant expires at the end of this month, we had to move quickly to ensure a new Chair is appointed to ensure the Commission has the stability it needs, and we are fortunate Mr Berry was available at such short notice."

Mr Berry is a specialist in the area of competition law and economic regulation, and has acted in several leading merger and restrictive trade practice cases since the enactment of the Commerce Act.

"He brings valuable experience to the Commission's future work, both in relation to trade practices and in the area of regulation of natural monopolies," Mr Power said.

"His agreement to fill this position for 18 months ensures the Commission has the stability it needs to go forward with its busy programme. This will enable the Ministry of Economic development to undertake a competitive recruitment process for the position of Chair.

"I look forward to continuing the excellent work of the Commerce Commission with him."
