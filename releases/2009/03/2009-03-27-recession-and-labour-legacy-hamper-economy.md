The global recession and the previous Labour-led government's damaging economic legacy are behind the economy's fourth consecutive quarter of contraction in December, Finance Minister Bill English said today.

However, the new government is moving swiftly to both manage the immediate challenges of the recession and to build a credible medium to long-term plan for rebuilding the economy.

"Since being sworn in just over four months ago, the government's priority has been to quickly implement its action plan for the first 100 days in office and to ensure we protect New Zealanders from the sharpest edges of the recession," Mr English said.

"We are now moving decisively into the next phase of our Jobs and Growth plan - removing the red tape getting in the way of business and investment, ensuring the state sector delivers better and smarter public services, and bringing forward infrastructure investment that will contribute to a higher productivity economy.

"By contrast, the previous Labour-led government allowed serious structural imbalances to build up over several years. New Zealand's annual productivity growth was an appalling 1.1 per cent between 2000 and 2008; the current account deficit built to around 9 per cent of gross domestic product; and we now have deteriorating fiscal deficits and sharply rising Crown debt.

"The result: New Zealand was one of the first countries to fall into recession early last year."

Gross Domestic Product fell 0.9 per cent in the December 2008 quarter - the fourth successive quarter of contraction - leaving the economy 1.9 per cent smaller in December 2008 than it was in December 2007.

The Budget on May 28 will set out a responsible and credible plan to increase New Zealand's productivity and incomes, Mr English said.

"We will do this in a way that also recognises our pressing need to get the Government's own finances and debt position in order."
