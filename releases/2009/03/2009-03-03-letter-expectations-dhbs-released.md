Health Minister Tony Ryall says the new government's goal of better, sooner, more convenient health care for all New Zealanders will be sharply focused on improving hospital services this year.

Releasing the new Government's first Letter of Expectations to District Health Boards, Mr Ryall says "we want shorter waiting times, less bureaucracy and a trusted and motivated health workforce while keeping within budget."

The Letter of Expectations priorities are: increased elective surgery volumes, shorter emergency department and cancer treatment waiting times, better clinical staff retention and greater clinical leadership.  

The Minister says commitment to the Primary Health Care Strategy is bipartisan and remains important.

"The Government is signalling that the 2010/11 focus will also be on building up the Primary Health Care Strategy by shifting some secondary services to more convenient primary care settings and establishing multi-disciplinary Integrated Family Health Centres," the Minister says.

A copy of the letter is attached.
