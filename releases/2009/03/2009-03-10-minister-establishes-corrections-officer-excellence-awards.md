Corrections Minister Judith Collins has established an award to recognise newly graduated Corrections Officers who have demonstrated outstanding achievement during their training.

The Minister's Excellence Award will be presented at the Corrections Officers' graduation ceremony at Upper Hutt's Rimutaka Prison on Thursday. Two graduates will receive the inaugural award.

Ms Collins established the Minister's Excellence Award to promote and honour excellence.

"This award will be presented to graduates of the Department's Initial Training Course who have shown qualities of leadership, professionalism and all-round excellence," Ms Collins says.

"Corrections Officers perform one of the most important roles in our society. They are charged with keeping the public safe from some of our most dangerous and difficult people.

"All New Zealanders count on them to carry out their duties with integrity, initiative, courage, common sense and professionalism.

"The work of Corrections Officers in making our communities safer is often under-recognised. My wish is that that this award acknowledges not just the hard work of those receiving it, but the contribution of all Corrections Officers."

Forty-one new officers - 12 women and 29 men - will graduate on Thursday. The Minister will attend the graduation, and future graduations, to show her support.
