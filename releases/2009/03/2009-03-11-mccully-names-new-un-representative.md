New Zealand's next Permanent Representative to the United Nations will be Jim McLay, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today. 

"Jim McLay brings a wealth of experience to a position of great importance for New Zealand," Mr McCully said.

"He has had a distinguished political career, having served as Attorney General and Justice Minister from 1978 to 1984 and as Deputy Prime Minister in 1984. He also did an excellent job as New Zealand's representative on the International Whaling Commission from 1994 to 2002, and since then has continued to be an informal member of New Zealand's delegation.

"Since its inception, he has also been a key member of the Australia New Zealand Leadership Forum, a joint government-business initiative aimed at further developing the bilateral relationship and the joint work the two countries do in the Asia-Pacific region.

"At this time of widespread global economic downturn, we need the United Nations to be focussed and practical. The UN, and its institutions, can help chart the way through these difficult times, and its members must work collectively together to that end.

"It has a huge responsibility for developing solutions to global problems which show no respect for international boundaries. Enforcing norms of good international behaviour is more important than ever in these uncertain times. 

"Our Permanent Mission to the UN, based in New York, is our voice in this key international institution, and will, under Jim McLay's leadership, be playing an active role on behalf of New Zealand in pushing forward the UN agenda," Mr McCully said.

Mr McLay, who will be resigning from all his current commercial and related positions, will take up his position in July, replacing Rosemary Banks who is returning to Wellington.
