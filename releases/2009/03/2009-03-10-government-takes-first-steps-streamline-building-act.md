A Bill that takes some useful steps to streamline the building consent process received its first reading in Parliament today.

The Building Amendment Bill (No 2) streamlines the consent process for house designs to be replicated on a substantial scale and streamlines the process for making minor alterations to work already consented.

It also makes obtaining a Project Information Memorandum (PIM) voluntary which will also save time and lower building costs.

The Bill was referred to the Local Government and Environment Select Committee and the public will soon have the opportunity to make submissions on the proposed changes.

Building and Construction Minister Hon Maurice Williamson said: “While this Bill includes some useful initiatives, it is only a start and doesn’t go far enough in addressing the compliance issues facing homeowners, developers and builders.  There’s more to be done.

“This Government will be reviewing the Building Act and looking to make further amendments to cut red tape and better control costs without compromising building quality.”

This will include:

- Having another look at what needs to be consented based on better differentiation between levels of risk.
- Providing better information and education on the building code and how to meet performance standards without “regulating everything that moves.”
- Removing unnecessary building control regulation and putting greater focus on information and education so people make informed choices rather than having them made for them.
- Simplifying building licensing rules, providing recognition for trade qualifications, making it easier to get licensed but not “dumbing it down.”
- Supporting councils to work smarter through use of technology, shared services and on-line systems.
- Helping consumers make better informed decisions about building their homes and choosing products that best suit their needs.
- How to get developers and builders to stand behind their work and put things right where needed.

“The Government will also be looking at how liability and risk around building is distributed between parties and how it might be better managed.  This will include looking at Home Warranty Insurance.”
