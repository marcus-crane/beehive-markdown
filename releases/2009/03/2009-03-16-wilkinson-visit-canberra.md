Minister Kate Wilkinson will meet Australian Ministers and senior government officials when she visits Canberra this week.

High on the agenda for the visit is a meeting with Senator Jan McLucas on Thursday, where the discussion is expected to focus on closer co-operation on food safety regulations and issues.

"The New Zealand Food Safety Authority has formed a close relationship with their Australian counterparts and it's important that we continue to talk about issues facing our primary producers and exporters," Ms Wilkinson says.

Ms Wilkinson will also meet with Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Employment and Workplace Relations Julia Gillard to discuss responses to the recession and developments in employment relations law.
