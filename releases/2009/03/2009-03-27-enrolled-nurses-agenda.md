The new Government has asked the Nursing Council to work with District Health Boards and the Ministry of Health to expand the role and training of enrolled nurses in New Zealand.

This fulfils a pre-election commitment by the National Party.

The Health Minister, Tony Ryall said, "Modern nursing and healthcare teams need another level of nursing expertise than is currently allowed for Nurse Assistants, who primarily work in aged care and rehabilitation facilities."

The Minister has released the September 2008 findings of a Nursing Advisory Committee, called Clinical Workforce to Support Registered Nurses available at www.moh.govt.nz

"Many nurse assistants have argued that their scope of work and training can be broadened, which would allow them to play a stronger role in nursing care, with supervision from Registered Nurses," Mr Ryall said.

"I have asked the Council, with support from the Ministry and DHBs, to review these positions, the education requirements, scope of practice and guidelines to reflect a strengthened role.

"This is a good opportunity to strengthen enrolled nursing, and it is expected the work will take around six months. Responsibility for scopes of practice lies with the Nursing Council."

Yesterday, the Government announced that nurses would have the ability to directly elect members to the Nursing Council in September 2009.
