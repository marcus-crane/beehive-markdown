Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson today welcomed the appointment of former cabinet minister Rt Hon Sir Douglas Graham to facilitate a settlement of historical claims in the Tamaki-Makaurau region.

"Sir Douglas brings enormous experience in government and the Treaty settlement process," Mr Finlayson said. "As Minister in Charge of Treaty Negotiations in the 1990s he was instrumental in starting progress towards resolving the historical grievances of Maori under the Treaty of Waitangi.

"The government remains committed to the goals championed by Sir Douglas of reaching just and durable settlements of all outstanding historical claims."

Sir Douglas is a former minister for Treaty Settlements, as well as holding other portfolios including cultural affairs and courts. He was also Attorney-General. His many achievements include the Waikato-Tainui raupatu claim settlement and the comprehensive settlement with Ngai Tahu.

He was a member of Parliament for 15 years before stepping down in 1999.
