Prime Minister John Key has thanked the three members of the Royal Commission on Auckland Governance for delivering their report to the Government.

Local Government Minister Rodney Hide publicly released the report and its recommendations in Auckland today.

"For New Zealand to grow and prosper, it's critically important we get the governance structure of our largest metropolitan area right. There are significant issues outlined in the 800-page Royal Commission report and the Government is taking some time to examine the detail before releasing its formal response.

"As promised, the Government has moved quickly to release this report because of strong public interest in Auckland, and around New Zealand. Inevitably, the Royal Commission report will foster a degree of community debate, which the Government welcomes.

"We are working on this as a matter of priority because preparations need to be underway within weeks if the Auckland region is to be operating under a new governance structure in time for local body elections in 2010. 

"On Monday, Cabinet will get its first chance to broadly discuss the Royal Commission report, when it will also receive an update from Mr Hide on official advice, feedback, ongoing work streams, and timing."
