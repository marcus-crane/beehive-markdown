Details confirming funding to modernise four Upper Hutt schools announced today showed that the National government delivers on its promises Education Minister Anne Tolley said.

The money will allow these schools to complete essential projects, replacement of buildings and upgrades.

“I’m very happy to say that a total package of $44.6 million has been allocated to fund property upgrades to Upper Hutt College, Heretaunga College, Fergusson Intermediate and Maidstone Intermediate,” Mrs Tolley said. “This package is made up of $14.6 million previously allocated and an additional $30 million.

“None of these four schools received modernisation funding over the five years while the future of the Upper Hutt schools network was being decided.”

The breakdown for the total package is:

- - Upper Hutt College              – $20.635 million;
  - Heretaunga College            – $12.225 million;
  - Fergusson Intermediate     – $6.595 million;
  - Maidstone Intermediate      – $4.145 million.;
  - Contingency for temporary accommodation      $1 million.

“Prime Minister John Key promised that these schools would receive an additional injection of $30 million during the election,” Mrs Tolley said.

“This was in recognition of the difficulties imposed by the Labour government’s school property spending moratorium.”

Funding had been allocated to meet the overall property needs of these schools, in line with the status of their existing buildings and facilities, and the number of students at each school, she said.

Work will begin at the earliest possible time and will support the government’s commitment to fast track school building projects.

 **Modernisation of Upper Hutt Schools - FAQs**

**What is the funding for?**

The funding has been provided for the modernisation of four Upper Hutt schools and will be prioritised as follows:

- completion of essential infrastructure projects;
- replacement building projects that meet the ministry's replacement building criteria for buildings that are beyond their economic life; and
- other modernisation projects determined by the school.

. This is why each school is now receiving substantial funding for this purpose.

**Which schools receive funding?**

- Upper Hutt College                       – $20.635 million;
- Heretaunga College                      – $12.225 million;
- Fergusson Intermediate                – $6.595 million;
- Maidstone Intermediate                – $4.145 million

**How was the level of funding determined for each school?**

Funding has been allocated to meet the overall property needs of these schools, in line with the status of their existing buildings and facilities, and the number of students they serve:

- Fergusson Intermediate will receive $21,500 per pupil – this school has had the least amount of funding over the past 25 years for building upgrades, and around 69% of the school’s buildings, which are old and of poor quality, need to be replaced;
- Upper Hutt College and Heretaunga College are of a similar standard and will receive funding of $17,000 per pupil;
- Maidstone Intermediate will receive $6,400 per pupil – Maidstone has previously received the greatest relative property funding of the four schools and has better quality buildings.

**How will schools decide which projects to fund?**

Funding has been allocated in line with essential projects identified in each school’s development plan and a range of other modernisation projects.

Modernisation funding reflects the school’s school property guide entitlement, which details the amount of property a school is entitled to, based on their roll and year levels, and past expenditure provided for property projects at the school.

**Why is there a need for a  $1 million contingency for temporary accomodation?**

The contingency provides temporary classrooms needed while some of the major building projects on the schools are taking place.  Upper Hutt College and Fergusson Intermediate will be replacing 28 classrooms between them and therefore will need temporary accommodation for students and teachers to minimise disruption while these projects are underway. Any savings from this contingency will be reallocated to the schools.

**How long is the building construction at the schools expected to take?** It is anticipated that planning for the construction work will begin immediately and construction will begin as soon as possible.  The timing of the projects will be determined by each school board.
