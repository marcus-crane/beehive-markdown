New Zealand's next Ambassador to Russia will be career diplomat Ian Hill, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

Mr Hill will also be accredited to Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.

"Russia's standing as a global political heavyweight, and its considerable economic potential, make it an important partner for New Zealand," Mr McCully said.

"New Zealand and Russia are both committed to adding greater depth to our friendly and constructive relationship, and there is certainly potential for growth in the trade and economic area.

"Russia has a growing interest in the Asia Pacific region, and we are also looking forward to its pending accession to the World Trade Organisation," Mr McCully said. 

Mr Hill has previously served as High Commissioner to Tonga, and has had postings to Moscow, London, and Fiji. He is currently Deputy Ambassador in Washington.

Mr Hill will take up his post in early August, replacing Chris Elder who is returning to Wellington.
