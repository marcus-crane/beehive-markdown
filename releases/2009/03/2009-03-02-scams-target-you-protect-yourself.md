Minister of Consumer Affairs Heather Roy today launched Fraud Awareness Week - a joint initiative between the Ministry of Consumer Affairs and the Commerce Commission, as part of the Australasian Consumer Fraud Taskforce, that raises awareness of scams in the community.

"While there's never a good time to lose money, the current global financial situation means that now - more than ever - consumers can ill afford to lose money to scammers, and must be vigilant," Mrs Roy said.

"These scammers will look to make the most of the current climate of financial uncertainty to separate people from their money - from sending ‘phishing' emails to obtain bank account details, to jumping on high-profile events or economic developments.

"As such the Australasian Consumer Fraud Taskforce works together with public, private and community partners to provide co-ordinated information campaign to help consumers protect themselves from scams.

"The majority of the scams we see here in New Zealand originate offshore - once money is sent overseas it is virtually impossible to recover.  Fraud Awareness Week - which runs from today until March 9 - coincides with other fraud prevention activities throughout the world.

"It is vital that consumers are up to date with the types of fraudulent schemes targeting them, and know how to protect themselves.  People should visit the Consumer Affairs Ministry's Scamwatch website at www.scamwatch.govt.nz, through which they can report any scams they might discover.

"It's time to turn the tables on these dishonest individuals and beat them at their own game by simply not responding to their approaches.  Consumers must remember that if a deal seems too good to be true, then it probably is," Mrs Roy said.
