The Minister of Health is advertising for highly capable people to become Chairs of two of the country's largest District Health Boards.

Advertisements appear in several newspapers today for the vacant chair positions at the Waitemata and Waikato DHBs. This is the first time such advertisements have been placed.

"The Government is keen to widen the net of people we can consider for these important roles," says Mr Ryall.

Waitemata DHB has revenue of $1.2 billion and 5500 staff. Waikato DHB has revenue of $800 million and 5000 staff.

"These are big organisations providing very important public services, and that's why we need top flight people putting their names forward for these roles," says Mr Ryall.
