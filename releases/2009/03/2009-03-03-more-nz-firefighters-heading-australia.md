A second contingent of New Zealand firefighters will be farewelled on behalf of the Government by the Minister of Civil Defence John Carter at Whenuapai tomorrow.

The firefighters fly to Australia on March 4 to help contain the bushfires in the state of Victoria.

Mr Carter said the fires had now moved into the water catchments above Melbourne and the firefighters efforts would help alleviate damage that could have a long term effect on Melbourne's water supply.

Mr Carter will meet with the team of 57 firefighters, crew leaders and Incident Management team at about 2pm. The team will be transported to Melbourne in a New Zealand Defence Force Hercules departing at about 3pm.
