Prime Minister John Key will attend the East Asia Summit in Thailand from 11-12 April and will then visit the People's Republic of China.

He will join leaders from the 10 ASEAN countries, China, the Republic of Korea, Japan, India, and Australia at the East Asia Summit (EAS) in Pattaya, Thailand, to discuss the global economic crisis. 

"The summit is also an opportunity to build on the ASEAN, Australia New Zealand Free Trade Agreement signed last month, and support work towards a region-wide free trade deal."

Between 14 and 18 April, the Prime Minister will visit China to meet with Chinese leaders, including President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao. Both meetings will take place in Beijing, before Mr Key travels to Shanghai and then to Boao. 

"China is New Zealand's third largest trading partner, and the visit is an opportunity to reinforce our shared economic interests," says Mr Key.

"It is also a chance to build on the New Zealand-China FTA, particularly in the areas of tourism, aviation, dairy and agriculture, and education."

Mr Key will open the New Zealand Central Concept Centre in Shanghai. The centre is to foster business contacts and develop New Zealand business in China. He will also attend China's Boao Forum, and speak at Peking University on Asia's role in recovering from the global economic crisis. 

He will be joined in China by Ethnic Affairs and Women's Affairs Minister Pansy Wong and a small group of New Zealand business leaders.
