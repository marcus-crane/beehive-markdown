Commerce and Justice Minister Simon Power travels to Australia tomorrow to meet federal and state Ministers for discussions on a range of commerce and justice issues.

Of particular focus will be the trans-Tasman Single Economic Market, which was advanced during recent visits by Prime Minister John Key and Deputy Prime Minister Bill English.

"These meetings will provide an opportunity to further signal New Zealand's support for the trans-Tasman Single Economic Market, and canvas a more ambitious and tangible set of goals than have been pursued so far," Mr Power said.

"I will also meet Australian business leaders and hear their views on priorities for the Single Economic Market agenda as well as encourage the business sector to identify actions that businesses can take to enhance the trans-Tasman relationship.

Discussions will also cover cross-border insolvency proceedings.

Mr Power will meet with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, Australian Securities and Investment Commission, and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.

He will also take the opportunity to discuss justice issues with federal and state Ministers and other groups.
