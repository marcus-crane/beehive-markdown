Housing Minister Phil Heatley says Housing New Zealand Corporation has his full support following news it has taken unprecedented action against antisocial tenants by issuing a swag of 90 day notices against Mongrel Mob members and their associates.

The Residential Tenancies Act provides landlords with the power to give tenants a notice asking them to leave after 90 days. There is no requirement under the law to give a reason for this action.

"Peaceful and respectful behaviour is expected of state house tenants, as it is of all New Zealanders. The vast majority of tenants are wonderful to work with. However, those few who blatantly disregard their tenancy agreement risk losing the opportunity of a state home," Mr Heatley said.

He acknowledged that the presumption has been that because Housing New Zealand houses New Zealand's most vulnerable families its tenancy actions should be tested in the Tenancy Tribunal.

"That will continue to be the case for the vast majority of tenancy issues the corporation deals with. They will still go through the Tenancy Tribunal," Mr Heatley said.

"However, Housing New Zealand believes there are a small number of serious cases where the community deserves a swift and definitive outcome about what will happen to a tenancy, and I agree with them."

"We can't expect witnesses to give testimony in front of people they have been severely intimidated by, and often live next door to."

Mr Heatley endorsed Housing New Zealand's stand that it will in future act against tenants involved in serious anti-social behaviour.

"Time is up for those tenants who have cynically gamed the system by terrorising communities knowing their victims would never complain, or if they did complain they would never give evidence."

The Minister confirmed he is talking to Housing New Zealand about options for sharpening the consequences of terminating a tenancy, such as introducing mandatory stand-down periods before tenants can re-apply for state housing, and probation periods for former offenders who resume state tenancies following a stand-down.

"If such people do not appreciate the opportunity of living in a state home there are plenty of needy families on the waiting list who do," Mr Heatley said.
