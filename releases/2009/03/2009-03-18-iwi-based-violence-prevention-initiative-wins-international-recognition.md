Associate Minister of Social Development and Employment, Hon Tariana Turia, has today praised the Amokura-Family Violence Prevention Consortium for the international recognition they have received in being awarded the Alumni Human Rights Prize by the Leitner Centre for International Law and Justice in New York Centre.

"Tai Tokerau can be very proud today, of their distinguished success in bringing their communities together to address family violence" said Mrs Turia.

"I want to congratulate the Chief Executives of the seven iwi authorities in the Consortium, Te Aupouri, Te Rarawa, Ngati Kahu, Whaingaroa, Ngapuhi, Ngati Whatua and Ngati Wai, for their leadership in making a long term commitment to violence prevention".

"This is a fantastic achievement for New Zealand, that an iwi-led violence prevention programme has been recognised on the world stage".

"This award also reflects the unstinting commitment and vision of Amokura's Executive Director, Di Grennell, who has done so much to advance violence prevention and early intervention activities across Taitokerau" said Mrs Turia.

"I am really encouraged by the success of Amokura, to know that we can make a difference if we provide leadership in our own whanau, hapu and iwi" said Mrs Turia.

"Amokura is dedicated to the goals of promoting safety in all the homes of the North, by innovative strategies to increase community awareness, and to provide simple messages for change. I am delighted for them - and for us all - that their expertise in this area has been given such prestigious recognition".

Background
