Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce today announced that applications are open for access to the Managed Spectrum Park in the 2.5 GHz radio spectrum band.

Mr Joyce says this spectrum band offers potential for new regional wireless broadband services to be rolled out.

"This will ultimately benefit consumers by providing more competitive service offerings, especially in rural areas."

The 2.5 GHz Managed Spectrum Park is a new concept in New Zealand.

It is intended for local and regional broadband services, such as WiMAX, and seeks to encourage a flexible, cooperative, low cost and self-managed approach to allocation and use of the radio spectrum resource.

Mr Joyce says the MSP will be of interest to smaller industry players, local and regional councils and iwi groups who are considering the deployment of wireless broadband services.

Applications close on 4 September 2009 and initial licences will be allocated towards the end of 2009.
