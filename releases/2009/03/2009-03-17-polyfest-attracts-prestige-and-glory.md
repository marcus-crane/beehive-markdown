Pacific Island Affairs Minister Georgina te Heuheu will join thousands of school children for the opening of Polyfest at the Manukau Sportsbowl tomorrow morning.

Sixty secondary schools and 182 cultural groups involving 8,500 performers and tutors will use five stages to showcase the best of Maori, Cook Island, Niuean, Samoan and Tongan cultures.

‘I understand that the quality of the groups who compete in dance and speech in this highly competitive environment is world class,' Mrs te Heuheu said.

‘Reaching that level of excellence and obtaining the honour of first place brings prestige and glory to the students and their school.

‘Polyfest is all about the passion and pride the performers have for their heritage, and the discipline and commitment they have to become the best,' she said.

The four-day event is the largest Maori and Pacific Islands' cultural festival in the world. This year it is hosted by Wesley College at the Manukau Sportsbowl.

‘I'm looking forward to the excitement of seeing proud young New Zealanders showcase their talent,' Mrs te Heuheu said.
