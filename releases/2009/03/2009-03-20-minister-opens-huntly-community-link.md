The Minister for Social Development and Employment Paula Bennett has today opened a new Community Link in the Waikato.

The Huntly site is one of five Community Links operating across the country, where government agencies and community groups combine to offer the public a cohesive and co-ordinated source of information, services and support.

Ms Bennett says the idea is to provide access to a wide range of social services in one setting.

"Quite simply, people can walk into a Community Link and get the help they need under one roof. They may have lost their job, need access to health services or require advice on housing. At a Community Link they will find a range of community services on offer,'' Ms Bennett says.

"It's more than just a new building. It's a way of simplifying for people how they can access the help they need for their particular situation.

"It means someone should only have to tell their story once, to get the support or guidance they need. I believe it's a great opportunity to affect positive change in their lives, their families and their communities, " Ms Bennett says.

Huntly's Community Link joins similar ones operating in Linwood, Christchurch, Flaxmere in Hawke's Bay, Naenae in Wellington and Ashburton in Canterbury.
