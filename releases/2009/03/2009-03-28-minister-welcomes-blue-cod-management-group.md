Fisheries Minister Phil Heatley has used an address to recreational fishers in Waikawa, Marlborough, to announce the formation of a Blue Cod Management Group, whose work he trusts will see the four year ban on fishing for blue cod in the Marlborough Sounds lifted sooner than its scheduled expiry of October 2012.

The group will work with the Ministry of Fisheries to develop a long term management plan for the fishery. Pressure on the blue cod population led to a four year ban on fishing for the species in the Marlborough Sounds being put in place on 1 October 2008.

The Minister acknowledged that the fishery was in decline, saying anecdotal reports and scientific research showed the number of blue cod was low and falling.

“We can all debate to what degree, but I am satisfied that Marlborough Sounds blue cod stocks were under pressure and action needed to be taken. Now I want stakeholders to spend time and energy developing a management plan and getting the fishery open again rather than re-litigating the closure.”

The management group is made up of representatives from various recreational sectors of the Marlborough community who use and value the blue cod fishery, including recreational fishers and charter boat operators.

Many people felt they did not have an adequate opportunity to voice their views during consultation prior to the ban’s implementation.

“I’m conscious that only a small, focussed group is going to get things done in a decent timeframe. However I have suggested the group co-opt special insight or expertise from whomever it sees fit to deliver a workable solution to lifting the ban.

“I want the group to consult wisely to make sure that we have the best chance of a healthy blue cod fishery in the Sounds for generations to come,” Mr Heatley said.

At the Minister’s encouragement the group has agreed to work within a framework to deliver a plan that:

- Would see the fishery opening sooner than the four years, either wholly or partially;
- Is easy for fishers to understand, and practical for them to use;
- Is straight forward for Ministry of Fisheries officers to police;
- Requires some form of recreational catch reporting, so success can be monitored.

“If the group can come up with a plan for managing the blue cod fishery in the Sounds, I support lifting or relaxing the closure early so we can start fishing for blue cod again in a way we know is sustainable,” Mr Heatley said.

“I look forward to receiving advice from the management group in the near future. I’m confident all parties can work constructively together to explore and implement the best options for managing this important fishery.”
