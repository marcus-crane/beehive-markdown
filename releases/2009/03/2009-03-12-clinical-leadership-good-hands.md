Health Minister Tony Ryall has issued a significant document called 'In Good Hands' that will help District Health Boards introduce greater clinical leadership into the public health system.

"The new Government is serious about re-engaging doctors and nurses in the running of front line health services," says Mr Ryall "and we expect DHBs to act on this report.

'In Good Hands', attached, is a report commissioned by the Minister, from a group led by the President of the Association of Salaried Medical Specialists, Dr Jeff Brown. 

Mr Ryall says," The government wants to harness the skills, initiative and commitment of staff throughout DHBs. That's what clinical leadership is about.

"Globally, clinical leadership is recognised as a fundamental driver of a better health service.

"We have instructed District Health Boards to foster effective clinical leadership and we will work with the Boards to make this happen."

"'In Good Hands' provides guidance to DHBs on how they can institute a more participatory and less top down approach for their doctors, nurses and other health staff."

Mr Ryall says the Government will be providing further guidance to DHBs on its clinical leadership agenda in a number of documents, including that from the Ministerial Group which has been formed to advise on improving the quality and performance of the public health system.

"This is not about massive structural upheaval, it is about operating differently to develop and support strong clinical leadership and governance throughout the health system."
