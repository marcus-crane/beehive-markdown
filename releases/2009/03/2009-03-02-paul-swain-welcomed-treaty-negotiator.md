Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson today welcomed the appointment of former cabinet minister Paul Swain as the Crown's lead negotiator in talks with the Ngati Porou iwi around the settlement of historical grievances.

"I am very pleased that Mr Swain has agreed to bring his considerable experience and standing to this important role," Mr Finlayson said. "By engaging talented people like Mr Swain, the government is again demonstrating through action its commitment to reaching full and lasting settlements of historical grievances under the Treaty of Waitangi."

Mr Swain said he felt privileged to be asked to lead negotiations in such an important region to the Treaty of Waitangi settlement process.

A Member of Parliament for Rimutaka (formerly Eastern Hutt) for 18 years before stepping down in 2008, Mr Swain was a cabinet minister in the previous Labour-led government, holding portfolios including Commerce, Immigration, Corrections, and Labour.

Mr Swain is currently chairman of Internet New Zealand's executive board, and runs a consulting company.
