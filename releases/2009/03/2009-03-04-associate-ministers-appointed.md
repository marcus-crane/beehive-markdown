Prime Minister John Key today announced the appointment of two associates in ministerial portfolios.

Kate Wilkinson has been made an Associate Minister of Conservation, and Tariana Turia has been made an Associate Minister for Disability Issues.

"It was clear that with Tim Groser out of the country at times as Trade Minister, he was not able to devote as much time as he would have otherwise been able to on the conservation portfolio," Mr Key says.

"The solution was therefore to appoint an associate, and I'm sure Kate Wilkinson will do a good job.

"Tariana Turia's appointment as Paula Bennett's associate in the Disability Issues area acknowledges that the two Ministers already work closely together in the Social Development and Employment portfolio.

"There are many crossovers with the Disability Issues portfolio, and it makes sense to have some delegation of responsibilities to an Associate Minister," Mr Key says.
