The Minister of Commerce, Simon Power, has announced that Paula Rebstock is stepping down as Chair of the Commerce Commission.

Ms Rebstock will leave on March 31, ending 11 years at the Commission, nearly 5½ of them as Chair.

"It is with regret that I have accepted Ms Rebstock's decision to leave the Commission," Mr Power said.

"The Government was very keen for her to stay on, but she informed me she wanted to pursue other interests in the private and public sectors.

"Ms Rebstock has given 11 years of dedicated service, and I would particularly like to thank her for the focus and determination she brought to the role of Chair since late 2003.

"Her skills and experience were instrumental in raising the effectiveness of the Commission.

"During that time she oversaw the development of the Commerce Commission from an enforcer of competition and consumer law to, among other things, a regulator responsible for key aspects of New Zealand's economic infrastructure."

Mr Power said the Government was discussing with Ms Rebstock how it might continue to use her skills and experience in other senior roles.
