Prime Minister John Key is welcoming a move by Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics of NZ (ITPNZ) to offer free or low-cost training to people who opt into the government's nine-day fortnight programme.

Five institutes of technology and polytechnics have today announced that they are putting up their hands to provide training to employers and employees who take up the Job Support Scheme.

Their offer means that workers on reduced hours in the government nine-day fortnight scheme can potentially use time off to train - in everything from literacy and numeracy to computer skills or upskilling in the trades.

"I am delighted to see these training organisations taking a lead and offering their courses as people go through difficult economic times," Mr Key says.

"Making training a compulsory part of the nine-day fortnight would have been extremely complex - so I am pleased to see these polytechnics and institutes of technology stepping up to the plate.

"I would encourage employees to look at using opportunities to improve their skills," Mr Key says.

ITPNZ today named the five organisations which are offering courses for free or low cost as: Aoraki Polytechnic, Eastern Institute of Technology, Otago Polytechnic, The Open Polytechnic, and Wellington Institute of Technology.
