Prime Minister John Key has congratulated Don McKinnon on his appointment as Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO).

The Queen has made this appointment today, which is Commonwealth Day, in recognition of his outstanding service as Secretary-General of the Commonwealth.

"Sir Donald already holds New Zealand's highest honour, the Order of New Zealand, and it is great to see his service has been personally rewarded by the Queen with the GCVO."

Sir Donald McKinnon served as the Commonwealth Secretary-General for eight years from 2000 to 2008 following a 21-year career in New Zealand politics. He was New Zealand's longest serving Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

"Sir Donald's contribution to New Zealand is well known, and his equally important contribution to the Commonwealth has now been recognised.

"I congratulate Sir Donald McKinnon on this honour."
