Education Minister Anne Tolley announced today that she had dissolved the board of trustees of Otepopo School in North Otago and directed the Secretary of Education to appoint a commissioner to replace the board.

“My decision follows an Education Review Office report finding that important governance and management issues at the school have not been addressed. This means the board is no longer able to govern effectively, and there is a significant risk to school operation and student education performance,” she said.

Otepopo is a decile 7 state co-educational primary school. Local families, including some board members, said they were sending their children to other schools because it was not meeting their needs, and there were ongoing tensions within the community about the school that were impacting on personal relationships. Otepopo’s roll had declined from 41 in 2004 to 13 this year.

The report said students at the school did not receive sufficient purposeful teaching. Deteriorating relationships within the board and with a group in the community had distracted the board from its core role of improving outcomes for students.

It said the board of trustees had not been well supported by the principal in its governance role, resulting in recommendations from earlier reviews not being addressed. Five board members had resigned, including the chair, leaving one elected parent representative, the principal and the staff representative.

Anne Tolley said she accepted the recommendation that appointing a commissioner was the best solution. “It’s clear to me that a skilled and capable outside appointee is needed to restore teaching standards and community confidence in the school.”
