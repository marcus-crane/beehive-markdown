ACC Minister Nick Smith today announced a reconfigured ACC board with the appointment of four new board members in addition to the new chair, John Judge.

“The changes in the Board are part of setting a new direction for ACC to address the significant and serious deterioration in its financial position.

“My priority has been getting top-flight governance skills with actuarial, cost control and investment management expertise. I have also endeavoured to provide for sufficient continuity to ensure a smooth transition to the Government’s new direction.”

The reconfigured Board of ACC is:

- John Judge (Chair)
- Peter Neilson (Deputy Chair)
- Marie Bismark
- Philippa Dunphy
- Rob Campbell (new member)
- Murray Hilder (new member)
- Jane Huria (new member)
- John McCliskie (new member)

“The new Board will need to work hard to get on top of ACC’s escalating costs that risk flowing through into unaffordable levy increases.

“I will be working with the new Board on administrative, policy and legislative changes to ensure we deliver an efficient 24/7 accident insurance scheme that is affordable for New Zealand families and businesses.”

**Questions & Answers**

**Q    What is the term of appointment for the new board members**?

**A**     The new board members (John McCliskie, Jane Huria, Rob Campbell, and Murray Hilder) have been appointed for a term of three years from 1 April 2009 until 31 March 2012.

The terms of the other board members are: John Judge (until 10 March 2012), Peter Neilson (until 22 November 2010), Philippa Dunphy (until 12 December 2009), Marie Bismark (until 1 March 2010)

The new board members announced today replace Ross Wilson, Wayne Butson, Sara Lunam and Ngaruma Karaitiana. Mr Karaitiana offered his resignation on 11 March, which the Minister accepted.

**Q    What happened to Dr Don Turkington, a previous ACC board member?**

**A**     Dr Turkington’s term expired on 11 December last year and he advised the Minister prior to his reconfiguration of the Board that he did not wish to be reconsidered for reappointment.

**Q    Why did the Minister reconfigure the Board?**

**A**     First, the Government’s new direction for ACC requires a different skill set with a strong focus on cost control. This new direction is required to avoid unaffordable levy increases arising from high compound rates of growth in claim costs over recent years.

Secondly, changed economic times and turbulent global markets require that ACC has top-flight investment and actuary skills to oversee ACC’s very large investment and liability portfolios.

Thirdly, there is an issue of accountability and confidence. The previous Board knew of the large blowout in the Non-Earners’ Account and that an urgent injection of $300 million of taxpayer funds was required by Christmas. However, it failed to mention this significant problem in the Briefing to the Incoming Minister that was approved by the board.

**Q    What process has the Minister followed in reconfiguring the Board?**

**A**    The Minister wrote to all Board Members on 3 March 2009 **(copy attached)** outlining his concerns and noting his intention to reconfigure the Board. He sought a response by 9 March, which the Minister received and considered.

On 9 March the Minister announced the appointment of John Judge as the new chair to replace Ross Wilson.

The new chair then interviewed existing and prospective Board members and made recommendations to the Minister. The appointments today reflect those recommendations.
