Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson today welcomed news that Te Runanga a Iwi o Ngapuhi is beginning a process to secure a mandate for the settlement of Ngapuhi's historical claims.

Ngapuhi is the largest iwi in the country, with around 170,000 members.

"Progressing negotiations with Ngapuhi is very important," said Mr Mr Finlayson. "The government is committed to its goal of reaching fair and durable settlements of historical claims under the Treaty of Waitangi."

Te Runanga will begin consulting with hapu from the Ngapuhi iwi with a view towards getting a mandate to negotiate a settlement with the Crown for the whole tribe.

"Once Te Runanga has successfully finished its process to secure a mandate from the people of Ngapuhi the Minister of Maori Affairs and I would recognise it if we considered it to be robust. Negotiations between Ngapuhi and the Crown could then begin. 

The government supports Ngapuhi's mandating process, Mr Finlayson said. It will be conducted alongside the Northland Waitangi Tribunal inquiry in October this year, which will go ahead as planned.
