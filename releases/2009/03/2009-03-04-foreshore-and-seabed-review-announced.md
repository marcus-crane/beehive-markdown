The terms of reference and members of the Government’s ministerial panel to review the Foreshore and Seabed Act have been announced by Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson today.

A review of the Foreshore and Seabed act was provided for in the Confidence and Supply Agreement between the National government and the Maori Party.

The Attorney-General worked closely with members of the Maori Party in setting the terms of reference for the review.

The terms set out the scope, timing, and consultation requirements of the review.

The three-person Ministerial panel will be chaired by former High Court judge and Waitangi Tribunal chair Justice Edward Taihakurei Durie. The other members are barrister Richard Boast, an Associate Professor at Victoria University specialising in property law and Maori legal issues, and Hana O’Regan, an educationalist specialising in Maori culture and identity (see attached biographies).

“The panel will consider the state of the law around Maori customary interests in the foreshore and seabed prior to the Court of Appeal’s 2003 decision in *Attorney-General v Ngati Apa*,” said Mr Finlyson. *“*It will also look at the options that were open to the government in deciding how it chose to respond to the court’s decision.”

The review will look at whether the Foreshore and Seabed Act as it stands adequately balances Maori customary interests and the rights and interests of all New Zealanders in using the beach.

If the panel is not satisfied it does, it will outline options on the most workable and efficient methods by which both customary and public interests in the foreshore and seabed area could be recognised and provided for.

“The panel expects to hold public meetings and hui around the country over the April-May period, and will also hear evidence from prominent commentators on the Act,” said Mr Finlayson.

“Significantly, the panel will reconsider the submissions that were made to Parliament when the original Act was being passed,” said Mr Finlayson.

“It will report to me by 30 June 2009. The Government expects to make a decision on the future of the Act by the end of the year.”

Mr Finlayson said in the event that the review resulted in the Foreshore and Seabed Act being repealed, the government was committed to protecting the public’s use of beaches. 

The government is committed to the deed of settlement the Crown entered into with nga hapu o Ngati Porou under the Act, Mr Finlayson said. Negotiations with other groups under the Act have been put on hold until the review is finished.
