Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Tariana Turia,  has welcomed the leadership of Prime Minister, John Key, in encouraging New Zealanders to donate their tax cuts to charitable and other non-profit organisations that may otherwise struggle in a period of economic downturn.

“I’ve been impressed by the initiative of Matthew Bartlett (with support from the Social Justice Commission of the Anglican Church and Catch Design)” said Mrs Turia.    “They’ve set up a website to encourage people to give their tax cuts to charitable and other non-profit organisations” said Mrs Turia ([http://www.giveitup.org.nz](http://www.giveitup.org.nz/)). 

“Generosity is already a common central tenet of the many cultures and religions here in Aotearoa – it represents a core value to many people”.

“For Maori and Pasifika communities, the notion of ‘giving it up’ is valued as an important cultural obligation; an investment in the collective wellbeing of the community.  It is a way in which we can honour our responsibilities” said Mrs Turia.

“What the Prime Minister is suggesting is another way of further building on a culture of giving and generosity in New Zealand”.

“And it can be a win-win all around” said Mrs Turia.  “”People who have donated to ‘donee organisations’ are now able to claim a tax credit of one third (33.33%) of all donations they have made over the last year”.

Donee organisations include approved charities, kindergartens and schools, universities, religious organisations and overseas aid funds.  Many marae and their associated trusts have also been approved as donee organisations”.

“As 1 April approaches, those who can afford to give a little, might just spend some time thinking about how they can support one organisation, and really make a difference”.

“There are so many amazing groups in Aotearoa, helping out their communities, who would just love to benefit from the support of others” said Mrs Turia.

“I spent yesterday for instance, with a group who have been devoted to the social development issues of families and communities for over three decades”.

“The Awhetu Charitable Trust, works day in, day out, with what they know as the “dislocated, disenfranchised and marginalised community members".  Their focus is on strengthening their community, or aiga, working primarily alongside Pasifika communities in South Auckland”.

“Their doors appear to never shut – it is nothing for someone to turn up at 2am and Te Awhetu – out of the goodness of their great hearts -  will always welcome them in.

“Te Awhetu is just one of literally thousands of community groups, striving to make a difference, for people who need it most”.

“I think it would be really amazing, that in this time of economic stress, those who can spare some resource, be proactive in helping to make our communities strong and safe”.

“A weekly contribution to those in need, would be a great place to start”.
