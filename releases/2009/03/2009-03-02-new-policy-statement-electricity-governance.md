Energy and Resources Minister, Gerry Brownlee, has today released for consultation a revised policy direction for the Electricity Commission.

The draft Government Policy Statement (GPS) sets out new objectives and outcomes expected from the Commission.

"The proposed changes are designed to reflect the new government's policies, and in particular its desire to accelerate prudent grid investment," said Gerry Brownlee.

"An important feature of the draft GPS is bringing forward the section that emphasises security of supply."

"The government believes that disentangling the regulatory overlap between the Electricity Commission, Transpower, and the Commerce Commission is important," he said.

"Getting that right will take some time.  However, the government is taking this interim step with the GPS to ensure transmission investment can happen more quickly," Mr Brownlee said. 

The draft GPS proposes a streamlined, simplified process for transmission investments under $20 million in value.

"Many projects are at risk from delay. This revised process would mean Transpower won't have to seek Electricity Commission approval for projects less then $20 million dollars."

"It will save time, costs, and speed-up important upgrade work," said Mr Brownlee.

"The regulatory function of the Electricity Commission was identified at the Jobs Summit by many sectors as delaying transmission investment and being a blockage to both infrastructure work and the expansion of jobs," he said.

Other changes to the GPS also reflect the government's intention to review the New Zealand Energy Strategy, and assess any duplication with the New Zealand Energy and Efficiency Conservation Strategy.

 "We have allowed two weeks for the Electricity Commission and stakeholders to provide feedback. I appreciate it's a short time frame but the government regards improving our electricity grid as a priority," he said.

The Electricity Act requires the Minister of Energy to consult with the Electricity Commission on the GPS.

Submissions on the draft GPS close on **16 March 2009**.  Written comments can be sent to [electricity@med.govt.nz](mailto:electricity@med.govt.nz).
