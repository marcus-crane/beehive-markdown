A short, simple yet moving ceremony marking the customary laying of the mauri stone took place at the front steps of the new Supreme Court early this morning.

Local Te Atiawa elders Sam and June Jackson joined with the Minister for Courts, Hon Georgina te Heuheu, and judges of the Supreme Court to conduct the ceremony in the early hours.

Mrs te Heuheu said she was very appreciative of the presence of the elders who conducted the ceremony.

The customary mauri stone represents the life force or the essence not only of the building but also of the important work that will be conducted there in the future, she said.

The ceremony saw the laying of three stones from Mt Taranaki.

‘This morning's short, simple yet moving ceremony brought together the mana of Maori with the mana of the Crown,' she said.

The new Supreme Court is expected to be finished early next year.
