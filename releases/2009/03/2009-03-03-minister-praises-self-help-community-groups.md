The Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector - Tariana Turia - is praising the work being done by 'self-help' community groups and believes they will be the groups to help people at grass-roots level through the recession.

Mrs Turia has highlighted two groups working in two low socio-economic areas in Hawkes Bay.

"I am particularly impressed with the 'kapai kai' group in Maraenui a low-income suburb in Napier where for the past five years up to a dozen whanau have dug up their back yards and have been growing fresh produce for the community. I don't usually like to mention individuals - it is not a Maori thing to do - but I feel I must mention 74 year old Pakura Ahuriri."

"Pakura lost an eye in a work accident over forty years ago, he's had a couple of heart attacks, a hernia and appendicitis - but despite that he has dug up his back yard and planted potatoes, tomatoes, and other veges for his neighbours and friends for the last six or seven years. He pays his mokopuna and local kids to catch white butterflies and other insects in the garden rather than use chemicals thus maintaining an organic garden."

"Pakura is the salt of the earth and I am terribly proud of his efforts. I am disappointed to learn that despite making many applications to many agencies, the previous government wouldn't help Pakura and his fellow gardeners and I want to do something about that."

"The second group I want to mention is the roopu lead by Henare O'Keefe from the Te Aranga Marae at Flaxmere - another low income suburb - in Hastings.

"Henare O'Keefe is a popular locally based Hastings District Councillor well known for his community work - and is about to launch an innovative new tool to engage young people at risk in the community and promote an anti-violence message at the same time."

"Henare - with sponsorship from a local power lines company - has built a barbeque on a stainless steel trailer which as well as being available to the community will do duty at night at local trouble spots catching the attention of young people by providing barbequed food and spreading the non-violence message too."

"The mobile kitchen - which actually has two gas-fired barbeques built into it was named Tunutunu - which is the Maori equivalent of 'to grill - by the kaumatua of Te Aranga Marae. I'm certain Tunutunu will do great work in the months and years to come, and I congratulate the people of Te Aranga Marae and Unison lines company for making 'Tunutunu' possible."

"While I've talked about these particular initiatives, I do so in the knowledge that there are many other volunteers out there helping out in their communities and doing a great job; and I believe that as the recession bites in, we - as we have done in other times of hardship - will rally around. I am in awe of self help groups like this and I want to stand by them in the tough times that lie ahead."
