Hon Tariana Turia, Associate Minister of Health, has welcomed a report by Mauri Ora Associates, ‘He Ritenga Whakaaro' which she launched in Auckland this morning.

"The report grew out of previous research which suggests that the barriers that exist for Maori to access healthcare are seen in a different quality of care and less optimal clinical outcomes. Put simply, Maori present as having higher health needs, but receive less health services".

"I was obviously pleased that in general, most of the 651 participants surveyed revealed that Maori were reasonably satisfied with their health services" said Mrs Turia. 

"There were, however, some distressing findings about barriers to healthcare which require further analysis said Mrs Turia. 

"The report describes these as organisational (lack of choice, waiting times, poor experiences); perceptions of negative or racist provider attitudes; cultural fit (perceptions of being patronised) and cost".

"I was concerned that both at the hui, and in the survey, participants were split over whether seeing a doctor was 'value for money'. The evidence clearly suggests that cost poses an ongoing barrier to healthcare utilisation, and may also influence Maori participants in their attitudes towards taking medication".

"It is disappointing to learn that the younger respondents were less likely to report that their relationship with their doctor was good, respectful and enabling of rapport - and they were also more likely to be cynical about the care provided by doctors to Maori patients".

"This same group was more likely to say that they would be better looked after by Maori health professionals" said Mrs Turia. "I think this gives us a 'head-up' about the way in which the younger generation expect a quality of service to be provided which meets their needs".

"He Ritenga Whakaaro will provide us with a useful benchmark, to ensure we have a good basis from which to develop and improve health services, in the pursuit of whanau ora" ended Mrs Turia.
