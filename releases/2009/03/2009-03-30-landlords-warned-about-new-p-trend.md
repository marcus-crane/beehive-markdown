Customs Minister Maurice Williamson says increasingly ‘P' makers are using vacant rental properties as drop-off and pick-up points for illegally imported precursor ingredients.

"Landlords need to be vigilant. Previously they had to worry about their properties being used as ‘P' labs, now vacant properties and sublet rooms are being given as the delivery address for pseudoephedrine-based precursors. 

"These offenders are trans-national criminals whose reach extends across the world and through New Zealand they prey on New Zealanders. Their only motivation is greed."

Customs is currently experiencing a huge increase in the amount and number of intercepts. In the past five to six years border seizures of precursors have increased by 1,200 per cent. 

Bill Perry, Customs Manager Drug Investigations, says generally the offenders involved in the organisation of these importing rings, and who are doing the renting, are aged between 19 and 30. 

"They generally are not working but display obvious signs of wealth."

"We encourage people to look out for anything unusual next door and let us know if they are concerned. We can all help Customs in the war against ‘P' by calling 0800 4 Customs to report any suspicious activity," Mr Perry says.

Mr Williamson says customs is seeing more and more instances of repeat-offenders, including some re-offending while on bail for similar crimes.
