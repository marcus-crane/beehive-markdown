Two reports released today by Associate Minister of Health, Tariana Turia, conclude that practices such as rongoa Maori, have the potential to support sustainable development and health outcomes.

“The reports describe two key benefits of traditional Maori healing in terms of its contribution to Maori wellbeing and development” said Mrs Turia.

“Clearly there are health benefits associated with rongoa Maori and its range of diagnostic and treatment modalities” said Mrs Turia. “The report identifies these as ritenga and karakia; the rongoa itself derived from trees, leaves, berries, fruits, bark and moss; mirimiri (similar to massage) ; wai (water for healing) and surgical interventions”.

 “But another equally significant benefit is the strength that comes for Maori people from retention and revitalisation of matauranga, tikanga and te reo Maori”.

“The report also describes the challenge of sustainability in terms of environmental wellbeing, (the resources supplying the rongoa) and sustainability of the practice” said Mrs Turia.

“These are critical issues – how the unique knowledge of rongoa can be upheld; the practices validated; and the intellectual property rights associated with the traditions protected” said Mrs Turia.

“The report describes the ways in which chemicals, pests and changes in land use threaten rongoa preparations – such as 1080 or aerial spraying”. 

“I welcome these reports in that they provide us with some key issues to consider about how to balance the integrity of the traditional practices of rongoa Maori, while at the same time ensuring health service credibility” ended Mrs Turia.
