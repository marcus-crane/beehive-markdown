Foreign Minister Murray McCully will meet with United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton when he visits Washington from April 6-8.

"The United States is one of New Zealand's oldest friends. We share common values and interests, as well as a commitment to promoting a free, democratic and secure world," Mr McCully said.

"I'm looking forward to discussing with Secretary Clinton ways in which we can advance the relationship. We're always looking for more we can do together - particularly in the Pacific region.

"Bilateral cooperation in the Pacific, the global financial crisis, the role of international trade, New Zealand's involvement in Afghanistan, and the US role in the Asia Pacific region will be among the topics we discuss in Washington."

While in Washington, Mr McCully will chair a session of a ministerial meeting of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. The Antarctic Treaty is 50 years old this year and up to thirty Foreign Ministers are expected in Washington to mark the anniversary.

Mr McCully will also meet members of the US-NZ Council, which will host the next Partnership Forum between New Zealand and the United States in October, and he hopes to meet with Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano.

Before heading to the United States, Mr McCully will attend a high-level conference on Afghanistan in The Hague next Tuesday.

He will join Foreign Ministers from most of the nations contributing to the International Security Assistance Force, as well as major donors, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, Afghanistan's President Karzai, and representatives of neighbouring countries to examine options for further cooperation on Afghanistan's future.

While in the Netherlands, Mr McCully will also hold bilateral meetings with several of his ministerial counterparts.
