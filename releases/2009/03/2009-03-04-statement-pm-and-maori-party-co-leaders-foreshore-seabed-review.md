Prime Minister John Key and Maori Party co-leaders Pita Sharples and Tariana Turia welcome the review of the Foreshore and Seabed announced today which delivers on a central commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement between the National Party and the Maori Party.

The review by an expert Ministerial panel will investigate whether the Foreshore and Seabed Act is the best way to address Maori customary rights, and balance these with all New Zealanders' rights to access beaches.

"The National-led Government recognises the concerns of the Maori Party around the Foreshore and Seabed Act," says Mr Key. "Likewise, the Maori Party recognises the public interest and concern of all New Zealanders to ensure that their usage of the foreshore and seabed is protected."

"Our government takes pride in delivering on this part of the Confidence and Supply agreement between the two parties.

"It's an agreement that was intended to form the basis for an enduring and constructive relationship between our two parties.

"The Maori Party, and Rahui Katene in particular, have worked closely with Attorney General Chris Finlayson on the terms of reference for this review," says Mr Key.

"This review is so important for us," says Dr Pita Sharples. "The issue goes back to the foundations of our party, the identity of our people as tangata whenua, and us fulfilling our promises to the people."

"It is very pleasing to be here today," says Tariana Turia. "We want to put right an injustice that should never have happened, but we do not want to create another injustice for anyone else. We have said the Act should be repealed, and we are certainly open to hear what the panel might recommend about the best way forward for the country."

The three-person Ministerial panel will be chaired by former High Court judge and Waitangi Tribunal chair Justice Edward Taihakurei Durie. The other members are barrister Richard Boast, an Associate Professor at Victoria University specialising in property law and Maori legal issues, and Hana O'Regan, an educationalist specialising in Maori culture and identity.

The panel will provide a written report to Mr Finlayson addressing its terms of reference by 30 June 2009.
