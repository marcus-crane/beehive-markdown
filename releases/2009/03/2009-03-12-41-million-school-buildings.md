Eighty-one schools around the country would get new or expanded buildings through the first allocation of property funding to schools under the government's recently announced infrastructure package, Education Minister Anne Tolley announced today.

"These schools now have the go-ahead to start work to redress their lack of space or need for new buildings," Mrs Tolley said.. 

"Seventy-four schools will receive $30 million to extend existing buildings, and seven schools will receive $11 million to replace buildings that are no longer economically viable to maintain."

A ranking system is applied to ensure that schools with the greatest need have their space deficiencies and building issues addressed first, regardless of school type. 

Mrs Tolley said that further programmes were likely to be announced later this year. "Infrastructure projects like these support the Government's economic stimulus initiatives".

"I am pleased to give these schools the opportunity to improve their properties to help them better manage roll increases, or to build new buildings when they are urgently required to replace outdated facilities," she said.
