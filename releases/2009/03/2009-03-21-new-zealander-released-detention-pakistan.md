New Zealander Mark Taylor has been released from detention in Pakistan, and subsequently deported, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.

"Mr Taylor was detained by Pakistan authorities while they investigated why he was travelling in a prohibited area of the country," Mr McCully said.

"Those investigations have finished, and Mr Taylor is not facing any charges.

"It is completely understandable that Pakistan authorities were concerned by Mr Taylor's presence in a prohibited area, and the New Zealand government is grateful that they kept us informed of Mr Taylor's situation, and his well-being.

"New Zealand's Honorary Consul in Pakistan was in regular contact with Pakistan authorities, and was permitted to speak to Mr Taylor by telephone on one occasion. That allowed us to keep Mr Taylor's next of kin informed throughout his detention," Mr McCully said.

As a result of being deported, Mr Taylor is prohibited from returning to Pakistan.

Mr Taylor's family has asked that no further information is released regarding his current whereabouts, or the circumstances surrounding his detention and deportation.
