Commerce Minister Simon Power has accepted the resignation of Donal Curtin from the position of Deputy Chair of the Commerce Commission.

Mr Power considers that Mr Curtin's offer, in the public interest, is an appropriate resolution of the issues that have been raised recently in relation to his disclosure of interests.

Mr Curtin will remain as a member of the Commission and will continue to use his experience to contribute to its work outside any areas identified as potential conflicts.

His resignation as Deputy Chair is expected to be effective from today.
