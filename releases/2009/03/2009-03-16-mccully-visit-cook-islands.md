Foreign Minister Murray McCully will meet Prime Minister Jim Marurai, senior ministers, and business leaders during a three-day visit to the Cook Islands starting on Wednesday.

"The issue of how small island states in the Pacific can best help shield themselves from the worst effects of the current global economic difficulties will be a major item on the agenda during my talks with political and business leaders," Mr McCully said.

"A point of particular concern is the impact on the Cook Islands of the downturn on tourism, which is the mainstay of the Cooks' economy.

"I will also talk with Prime Minister Marurai about ways in which we can further the relationship between our two countries, including through New Zealand's support for economic development in the Cook Islands.

"We will also traverse a number of important regional issues, including the lack of progress towards democratic elections in Fiji," Mr McCully said.

The Cook Islands is self-governing in free association with New Zealand, which means the Cook Islands has its own government and develops its own laws, while its people retain New Zealand citizenship.
