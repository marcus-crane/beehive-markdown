Tourists, adventurers and the residents of South Westland will all benefit from the new $270,000 Franz Josef police station, which was opened by Police Minister Judith Collins today.

The Minister joined police and the community in celebrating the opening of the station, which replaces a small station built into the courthouse at nearby Whataroa.

Ms Collins said the police received substantial co-operation from the Department of Conservation (DoC) in the design and construction of the new building. The station was built on National Park land that was once the site of the Glacier Hotel, which burned down in 1954.

"The result is a much-needed facility that will support the work of both the New Zealand Police and DoC, as well as the Franz Josef community," Ms Collins said.

"I firmly believe the success of any police service relies on two fundamentals: having officers out on the streets, and having the full support and confidence of the community it serves.

"Here in Franz Josef, we now have both those things, with a highly visible police presence here on the main street, and the support of local residents."

In an area where natural attractions draw many visitors each year, the new station was designed for search and rescue operations. The station incorporates extra space for storing search and rescue equipment and a covered car park so police can use vehicles quickly in icy conditions.

It is the fifth police station that Ms Collins has opened since becoming Minister. A further two new police stations are due to be opened throughout New Zealand in the coming year, along with two stations that have undergone extensive refurbishment.

"This new station reinforces the Government's commitment to safer communities and ensuring police are well resourced and supported," Ms Collins said.
