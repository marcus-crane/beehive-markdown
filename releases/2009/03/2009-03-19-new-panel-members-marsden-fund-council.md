Minister for Research, Science and Technology Wayne Mapp has appointed three new members to the Marsden Fund Council.

The new members’ role is to provide guidance on investments made by the fund in leading-edge research projects. The appointees will convene three panels on the Council. They are:

- Juliet Gerrard (Cellular, Molecular and Physiological Biology)
- Grant Scobie (Economics and Human and Behavioural Science)
- Rod Downey (Mathematical and Information Sciences).

“I am pleased to appoint these three leading researchers to the Marsden Fund Council. I have great confidence in their ability to help guide Marsden Fund investments,” Dr Mapp said.

The Marsden Fund Council comprises ten eminent researchers - a Chair and nine convenors. Each heads a panel in their academic field.  Panels work to assess applications for funding of research projects.

Research supported by the fund is investigator-initiated, and awarding of funds is based on the research merit of the proposal, the potential to contribute to the advancement of knowledge and the enhancement of research skills in New Zealand. The fund is administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand and funded through the Government’s Research, Science and Technology portfolio.  In 2008/09, the Council invested $54 million in research projects.
