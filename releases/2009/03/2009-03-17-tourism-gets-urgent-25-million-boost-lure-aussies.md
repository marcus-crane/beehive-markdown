Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism, John Key, is giving Tourism New Zealand an additional $2.5 million immediately to boost tourism promotion in Australia.

“This represents more than a one quarter increase on the current $9 million investment in the Australian market and must be done now in order to plan a campaign to be implemented in our low season.

“Australia generates nearly 40% of New Zealand’s arrivals, and even small gains in demand will make a big difference.

“New Zealand tourism is operating in a very challenging environment because of the global economic crisis; however I expect this investment to contribute an immediate injection of around $64 million to the New Zealand economy.”

The $2.5 million investment will be allocated across three areas:

- Extending the current 100% Pure New Zealand and ‘What’s On’ activity in Australia to increase autumn and winter arrivals
- Increased public relations activity
- Working with industry partners to convert awareness of New Zealand into actual travel

“The impact of the global recession is likely to result in New Zealand becoming a more attractive holiday option as Australian consumers tighten their spending and look at holidaying closer to home.

“This additional funding will be specifically targeted to encourage them to choose New Zealand.”
