Investment writer and commentator Mary Holm has joined the Capital Market Development Taskforce, Commerce Minister Simon Power and taskforce chair Rob Cameron announced today.

Mr Power said he is delighted that Mary Holm has agreed to join the taskforce.

"Mary Holm brings a considerable range of skills, including retail investor expertise, to the taskforce. We have already seen how the taskforce responded to the credit crisis with their interim report and I'm keen to reinforce the retail investor perspective on the group to help build confidence in our financial markets," Mr Power said.

Rob Cameron also said Ms Holm would make a valuable contribution to the taskforce's work.

"She has both a good understanding of the issues we are grappling with and the ability to communicate clearly with the public. As well as helping to shape the taskforce's recommendations, Ms Holm will lend her considerable skills as a writer to our future reports."

The Capital Market Development Taskforce is due to produce an action plan for developing New Zealand's capital markets later this year. It released an interim report last November which focused on ways to make it easier for businesses to obtain funding from capital markets, in light of the financial crisis.

Mary Holm is an award-winning investment columnist, and has authored a number of books, including "The Complete KiwiSaver", which has just been published, and "Get Rich Slow: How to grow your wealth the safe and savvy way". 

She lectures in financial literacy at the University of Auckland, and previously worked on the 1997 Todd report on retirement income. She holds an MBA in finance from the University of Chicago, and an MA in journalism from the University of Michigan.
