The Government has confirmed that it will not be introducing legislation to ban retail tobacco displays, at the moment. 

A report from the Health Select Committee recommended new legislation to force retailers to have tobacco products stored out of sight.

Health Minister Tony Ryall noted the Select Committee reported that evidence could not directly link the banning of displays with decreasing smoking rates.

Responding to the Health Committee's report, the Government also commended the efforts of health and other groups whose efforts have contributed to the recent declines in tobacco use.

Mr Ryall said, "We are committed to continuing efforts to reduce smoking rates and tobacco use, and to exploring new effective initiatives to support this.

"The Government will consider any options, including legislation, if international or domestic research gives us a compelling case that it would lead to a significant decrease in tobacco use. 

"I have asked the Ministry to keep monitoring international moves in this area, and if research suggests that a ban on displays would result in a significant reduction in tobacco use, then the Government would give the issue further consideration," Mr Ryall said.
