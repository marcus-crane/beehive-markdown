Prime Minister John Key tonight condemned the attack by gunmen on the Sri Lankan cricket team in Pakistan.

"I condemn this despicable terrorist act. I am sure all New Zealanders will be outraged, as I am, at hearing this news.

"I am very concerned at this turn of events, where an international sports team has been targeted by terrorists.

"The New Zealand Government is monitoring the situation. At the appropriate time I intend to convey a message of condolence to the Sri Lankan Government and Sri Lankan cricket team."
