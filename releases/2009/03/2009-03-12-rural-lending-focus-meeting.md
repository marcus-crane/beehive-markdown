Agriculture Minister David Carter has reiterated the Government message for banks to work positively with borrowers, during a meeting with leading rural lenders today.

"Recognising the substantial growth in rural debt, I called the meeting of representatives of the major banks to discuss issues facing the primary sector. I made it clear that rural lenders are important players when it comes to fostering confidence and stability in the sector."

Mr Carter said the meeting discussed the unique challenges faced by primary sector businesses in the current economic downturn.

"All business sectors are under pressure, but the rural sector even more so because of the substantial rise in debt over the past five years.  This is making it hard for farmers and small rural communities," says Mr Carter.

"There's no doubt that rural lenders are facing challenging times but I'm confident that they will continue to offer a degree of flexibility with clients facing difficult circumstances. 

"Everyone at the meeting spoke of the resilience of farmers and farming communities in the face of difficult times, and recognised that the global economic crisis poses some extraordinary challenges.

"But all agreed that banks providing early and comprehensive information to their clients, and their clients heeding advice and cutting unnecessary expenditure, are key factors in making timely decisions on cost structures.  

"The majority of farmers are financially sound, and the reality is the primary sector is the path to New Zealand's economic recovery.  Revenue generated from land based sectors accounts for around two-thirds of this country's export earnings and delivers thousands of jobs - not just in rural and provincial areas, but in our cities as well," says Mr Carter.
