A new programme between New Zealand and China will open the door to exchanges for promising researchers.

The New Zealand-China Scientist Exchange Programme will support short-term research visits for up to five researchers a year from New Zealand to institutions in China and vice versa. The exchanges will facilitate greater understanding of research collaboration possibilities and foster the development of research linkages between early- to mid-career researchers from New Zealand and China.

Minister of Research, Science and Technology Wayne Mapp welcomed the launch of the new exchange programme with this important partner. 

"Scientific collaborations between New Zealand and China have grown markedly over recent years, and are expanding into an increasingly diverse range of fields," said Dr Mapp.

"I expect that these connections will continue to flourish through the Scientist Exchange Programme to the mutual benefit of researchers in both countries."

The exchange programme was formally signed by Dr Helen Anderson, Chief Executive of the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology (MoRST) and Vice Minister Dr Cao Jianlin of the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology at the second meeting of the New Zealand-China Joint Commission on Science and Technology.

Vice Minister Cao led a delegation of nine officials from Chinese science and technology agencies to Wellington for the Joint Commission meeting. The Joint Commission is the principal bilateral forum for developing the New Zealand-China science relationship under the updated Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement, signed in 2003.
