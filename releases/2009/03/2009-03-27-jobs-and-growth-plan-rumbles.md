Life saving rumble strips will be installed on 750 kilometres of state highway thanks in part to the government's Jobs and Growth programme.

The NZ Transport Agency has been given an extra $4 million in funding to accelerate the installation of life-saving ‘rumble strip' road markings on the state highway network.

The additional funding is part of the $142.5 million for small and medium sized state highway projects announced as part of the government's Jobs and Growth plan in February.

Transport Minister Steven Joyce said, from the AA's Annual Conference at Waitangi today, that the accelerated installation of rumble strips will help improve road safety and will contribute to regional economies.

"Most of the subcontractors laying these strips will be regionally based, using a regional workforce so local communities will benefit from the increase in work.

"The government is committed to making New Zealand's roads safer and to taking economic measures that will remove the sharpest edges from the current global recession."

With the additional Jobs and Growth funding the NZTA is expanding its national rumble strip installation programme for 2008/09 by around 50 percent, with approximately 750 kilometres of state highways across New Zealand to be fitted with new rumble strips by the end of June 2009 - around 250 kilometres more than originally planned.

This will increase the total length of state highways fitted with rumble strips to approximately 1,350 kilometres, or 12% of the state highway network.
