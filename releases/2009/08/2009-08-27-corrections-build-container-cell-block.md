Corrections Minister Judith Collins today announced that a container cell block capable of housing up to 60 prisoners is to be built at Rimutaka Prison.

The cell block will allow the Department of Corrections to evaluate whether container construction can be used more widely in the New Zealand prison system.

"This project is the first of its kind at a New Zealand prison and we hope it will point the way to how we can build extra prison capacity faster and much cheaper than in the past," Ms Collins said.

"Lack of planning by the previous Labour government has meant that the number of prisoners will soon exceed the number of beds available in our prisons.

"Corrections is forecast to run out of baseline beds early next year. We have to take immediate action to ensure that prisoners are securely locked away and the public is kept safe."

A tender process for the construction of the cells will start immediately. It is expected that the new cells will be operational in March next year.

The cost of the project is expected to be $53,000 - $63,000 for each bed, which is substantially less than the cost of a conventional cell. The final cost will be determined by the tender process.

While some of the components of the initial cells will come from overseas, they will be extensively fitted out in New Zealand.

"It is my hope that in future most of the construction of container cells will be undertaken in New Zealand," Ms Collins said.

"There is an opportunity for prisoners to be involved in the construction of future prison cells. Prisoners will gain skills and help pay their debt to society, our prisons will get more beds and we will be delivering better value for the taxpayers of New Zealand."
