The conviction of Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi is a serious retrograde step that will further alienate the Burmese government from the international community, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.

The Burmese opposition figure, who has been under home detention for many years, has been convicted for alleged breaches of detention conditions, and sentenced to a further 18 months of home detention.

"It is difficult to reach any conclusion other than that the Burmese government orchestrated this verdict to ensure that Aung San Suu Kyi would still be in detention and therefore unable to particpate in planned elections next year," Mr McCully said.

"Today's events will be greeted with dismay by the international community, which condemned Aung San Suu Kyi's arrest in May, and had been pushing hard for her release.

"It will also be seen as a slap in the face for Burma's regional neighbours, who have maintained an open dialogue with the Burmese government in an effort to encourage a more democratic approach.

"It is difficult to see any other outcome to today's verdict than further international isolation for Burma.

"Late last month I met with the Burmese Foreign Minister at the ASEAN Regional Forum in Thailand, and raised New Zealand's concerns with him yet again. The Minister was left in no doubt as to our views, or those of the wider region. 

"Burma's rulers must listen to the international community, release Aung San Suu Kyi immediately, and take steps to restore democracy," Mr McCully said.
