Tariana Turia says the world is a better place for people with disabilities thanks to the work of Eunice Kennedy Shriver who died this week.

"Because of Eunice's love for her sister, who had a disability, she became a passionate and extraordinary human rights activist for a very significant part of our society.

"Through Eunice's work we now have the Special Olympics which our country's top athletes with a disability compete in."

Today Special Olympics New Zealand athletes compete in 16 sports in over 185 events a year.

Eunice, who died at age 88, was a member of one of the most prominent families in American politics and a pioneer in the effort to improve the lives of people with intellectual disabilities. She has been referred to as one of the "world's best humanitarians."

"Her family said she set out to change the world and not only did she do that for the world, but she did that for Aotearoa. And I thank her for that.

"Our condolences also go out to Eunice's family who must be acknowledged and thanks for sharing her with us, with the world."
