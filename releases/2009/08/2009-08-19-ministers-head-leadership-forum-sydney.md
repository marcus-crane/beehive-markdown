Senior Ministers will explain the Government's programme to Australia's political and business leaders at the sixth annual Australia New Zealand Leadership Forum in Sydney this weekend, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.

"Australia is our closest neighbour, our closest ally, our closest economic partner, and our closest market. The importance of the trans-Tasman relationship cannot be overstated," said Mr McCully, who leads the New Zealand delegation.

"The Leadership Forum plays a major role in bringing together key political figures, business heavyweights, and academics from both countries to discuss ways to expand and deepen the relationship.

"It is an important opportunity for us to get to know more about what makes Australia tick, and to outline where the new Government sees New Zealand heading in coming years.

"This year's Forum will focus on the development of an Australia and New Zealand Single Economic Market, streamlining trans-Tasman travel and movement of goods, climate change, and progressive science and technology," Mr McCully said.

Other New Zealand Ministers attending the Forum are Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Bill English; Economic Development Minister Gerry Brownlee; Commerce Minister Simon Power; Trade Minister Tim Groser; Defence Minister Wayne Mapp, and Communications and IT Minister Steven Joyce.

Prime Minister John Key will deliver a speech to the Forum on Friday.

The Forum is co-chaired by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade Secretary John Allen (formerly NZ Post CEO) and Australia's Rod McGeoch (Chairman of Sky City Entertainment group).
