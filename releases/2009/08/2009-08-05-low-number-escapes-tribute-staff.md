The low number of escapes from New Zealand prisons is a tribute to improved security measures and the vigilance of Corrections Officers and staff, Corrections Minister Judith Collins said.

Figures released today by the Department of Corrections show the number of escapes from New Zealand prisons has reached a record low.

There were 12 escapes in the 2008/09 financial year. This compares to 89 escapes when the Department was established in 1996/97 and 23 escapes in the 2007/08 financial year.

"New Zealanders must have confidence that the most difficult and dangerous people in our society are kept securely behind bars," Ms Collins said.

"The low number of escapes in recent months is a tribute to improved security measures and the vigilance of Corrections Officers and staff who work incredibly hard to ensure the safety of the public."

Earlier this year Ms Collins asked for a review of the eligibility of prisoners employed by work parties outside prison perimeters. The result was that a small number of prisoners were brought back inside the wire.

In addition to reviewing the eligibility of prisoners on work parties, a re-evaluation of prisoners' security classifications to ensure their escape risk is properly assessed is being undertaken.

"Public and staff safety should be the overriding consideration when deciding prisoner security classifications," Ms Collins said.

The Department of Corrections will report back to Ms Collins next month.
