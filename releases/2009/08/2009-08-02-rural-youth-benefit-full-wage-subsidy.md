Tariana Turia says unemployed youth living in rural areas will be among those who benefit from an initiative which is part of a $40.3 million Community Max investment by the Government.

Up to 3000 employment opportunities will be created from September onward under the Community Max scheme announced by Prime Minister John Key today as part of the Government's response to tackling the shocking number of young people (aged 16-24) on the Unemployment Benefit or Independent Youth Benefit.

And young people and their communities living in rural areas will not be forgotten, Mrs Turia said.

"We're putting our money where our mouth is as far as addressing the dismal state of unemployment among our country's young is concerned.

"Like young people in the cities, those in rural areas also want more cash in their pockets and made to feel they have self-worth and pride, so I challenge them to really embrace this initiative.

"I've always been a great believer in communities knowing what's best for them and this initiative aims to support them in doing that."

Under Community Max, the Government will subsidise the wage of each youth on the unemployment benefit who works on a local community or environmental project for up to 30 hours a week, for a duration of up to six months. Some young people may take part in consecutive projects. Youth working on Community Max projects will receive at least the minimum wage of $12.50 an hour.

Such projects could be run by iwi, marae, Maori trust boards, Maori land incorporations and local councils.

The scheme will also include funding for a supervisor for every four workers and a training component of up to $1250 per worker per project.

Groups, already running or looking to start up a community or environmental project, which are interested in Community Max should call 0800 778 008 or contact the closest Ministry of Social Development or Te Puni Kokiri office in their area.
