Trade Minister Tim Groser departs today to attend the annual meetings of Economic Ministers from the East Asia Summit (EAS) countries in Bangkok, Thailand.

Mr Groser will attend meetings with counterparts from the 10 countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), as well as a broader meeting with Ministers from China, the Republic of Korea, Japan, India, and Australia.

"The meetings will be an important opportunity to reassert New Zealand's position within East Asia's regional economic integration.

"In particular, New Zealand - working with our EAS partners - will seek to advance the case for launching an inter-governmental study into the benefits of a Comprehensive Economic Partnership in East Asia. 

"This would be a free trade area consisting of all 16 East Asia Summit countries - a region which comprises more than half the world's population.

"In Bangkok, Economic Ministers will also examine progress towards implementation of the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area (AANZFTA) agreement signed in February this year.

"New Zealand will be urging Ministers to ensure their countries complete domestic processes so the AANZFTA agreement can enter into force by the target date of 1 January 2010," Mr Groser said.

The meeting of EAS Economic Ministers precedes the meeting of regional leaders at the fourth East Asia Summit in October in Thailand to be held from 23-25 October.
