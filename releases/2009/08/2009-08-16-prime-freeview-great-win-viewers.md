Today's announcement that Prime will be available from tomorrow on the Freeview satellite and terrestrial platforms is a move welcomed by the Government, says Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman.

"The Government is pleased a positive outcome has been achieved. However, it should be emphasised this was always a commercial decision for the parties involved to reach of their own accord.

"It's no secret that the Government has been keen to see Prime on Freeview. Earlier this year the Government convened a meeting between SKY, Freeview and Kordia to identify the barriers to getting Prime on Freeview.

"Having Prime on Freeview adds considerable value to that platform - viewers will now be able to see Prime in digital quality on Freeview. It also benefits Prime, increasing their potential viewership. It's a win-win for all parties.

"Today's announcement is also significant given that it's likely to increase uptake of Freeview, driving New Zealand's overall transition towards digital switch over," says Dr Coleman.

A final decision on the official switch over date will be made when digital television take-up reaches 75 per cent of households, or in 2012, whichever occurs first.
