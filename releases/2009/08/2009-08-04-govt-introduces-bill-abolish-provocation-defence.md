The Government today introduced a bill to Parliament that will remove the partial defence of provocation from the statute books.

The Crimes (Provocation Repeal) Amendment Bill was introduced by Justice Minister Simon Power after Cabinet approved it yesterday.

It follows two reports by the Law Commission in recent years - in 2001 and 2007 - both of which recommended the defence be abolished.

"This Government has no intention of letting the matter lie," Mr Power said.

"We've been looking at it for some time.

"I don't believe the partial defence of provocation has any place on the statute books.

"It wrongly enables defendants to besmirch the character of victims, and effectively rewards a lack of self-control. 

"I look forward to the support of the House for this bill."

Mr Power said he hoped the bill would be passed by the end of the year.
