Associate Minister of Defence Heather Roy today announced that the Hon Hugh Templeton, Major-General (retd) Louis Gardiner, and Brigadier (retd) Timothy Brewer have been appointed to lead the three Companion Studies that will run in parallel with Defence Review 2009.

"These Studies will assist the NZDF in the increasing role it plays in supporting the Government's objectives of economic growth, whole-of-Government strategies and increased focus on youth development," Mrs Roy said.

"The Studies to be undertaken are:

- **New Zealand Defence Industry:** an examination of the New Zealand Defence Industry sector and options for economic improvement - to be led by Hon Hugh Templeton, former Minister of Customs; Trade and Industry.
- **Youth Programmes:** an examination of the role of NZDF in youth programmes generally, and specifically in regard to the New Zealand Cadet Force - to be led by Major General (retd) Louis Gardiner, former Chief of Army and current CEO of Crimestoppers New Zealand.
- **Voluntary National Service:** an examination of the concept and viability of Voluntary National service as a whole-of-Government strategy - to be led by Brigadier (retd) Timothy Brewer, former Director General of Reserves and Cadets, Law Commissioner and current Crown Solicitor for New Plymouth.

"These Studies will enable a detailed examination of several important aspects of the links between Defence and society.  Hon Hugh Templeton, Maj General (retd) Gardiner and Brigadier (retd) Brewer have been selected for their knowledge and experience in the areas of their respective topics," Mrs Roy said.
