The NZ Transport Agency has today commenced consultation on tolling as a means to bring forward the Tauranga Eastern Link, which has been identified as a Road of National Significance.

Transport Minister Steven Joyce says tolling, coupled with the government's billion dollar boost for state highways, could enable construction to start as early as next year.

"The Tauranga Eastern Link was identified as a Road of National Significance as it will be a key driver of productivity and growth in the Bay of Plenty and Tauranga - one of New Zealand's fastest growing areas.

"The new road will boost productivity, improve access to the Port of Tauranga and greatly enhance safety. This consultation is a step in the process of assessing whether tolling is a way to deliver the benefits sooner."

The $455 million project will see a four-lane motorway from Te Maunga to Paengaroa - by-passing Te Puke. At 23 kilometres it will be New Zealand's longest single four lane state highway project.

The work involves two distinct parts - an upgrade of the existing State Highway 2 between Te Maunga and Domain Road at Papamoa; and a new section of motorway from Domain Road to Paengaroa.

"It's estimated that the new road will shave up to 24 minutes off travel time for a return journey between Paengaroa and Te Maunga," says Mr Joyce.

"As well as shortening the journey for motorists and reducing transport costs for business, greater efficiencies and access to the Port of Tauranga will help increase the volume of exports and in turn the growth of the region.

"The new road will also bring significant safety benefits to what is currently the second most dangerous piece of state highway in the country."

Tolling the route would supplement traditional sources, enabling the early delivery of the road without over-burdening the land transport fund.

Following consultation, any toll proposal would be considered under the criteria set out in the Land Transport Management Act 2003.

When implemented, the toll is proposed to be no higher than $2 for light vehicles or $4 for heavy commercial vehicles. As soon as debt and financing costs are repaid, tolls would be removed. 

NZTA anticipates that this could be within about 35 years.
