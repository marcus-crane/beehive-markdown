A new Inquiry Line giving war veterans better access to services and advice is an outstanding success with almost 2000 calls a week, Veterans' Affairs Minister Judith Collins said today.

"The response to the Inquiry Line has been incredible, with more than 13,000 calls from veterans since it started on June 23," said Ms Collins, who visited the Veterans Affairs New Zealand (VANZ) Inquiry Line call centre this week.

"VANZ has been working hard to meet the needs of veterans and to focus on improving the delivery of services. The Inquiry Line was set up to give veterans a single point of contact for a wide range of services and advice.

"It has been an outstanding success, with 98 percent of calls during its first month responded to and resolved at the first contact with the caller."

The Inquiry Team can help veterans with inquiries about pensions, information on the Veterans SuperGold card, and details about memorials and funding for commemorations.

The Inquiry Line also provides information on how veterans can get a case manager, how the case management system works and what is available through case management for partners and children of veterans.

If the caller is actively case managed, it is necessary for the team to refer the call to the case manager when there is a requirement for services and support.

"It's important that the Government is responsive the changing needs of veterans. The Inquiry Line is a solution that will greatly simplify access to support and services," Ms Collins said.
