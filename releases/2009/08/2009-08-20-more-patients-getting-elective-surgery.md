Health Minister Tony Ryall has announced a record increase in elective surgery for the financial year just ended.

"The National-led government came to power promising more elective surgery for New Zealanders, after years of Labour-led neglect that saw elective surgery volumes fail to keep up with population growth," Mr Ryall said.

"The preliminary results show that the number of people who got elective surgery in 2008/09 was 130,216 - a record increase of 12,265."

"That is the largest increase in our history, and higher in one year than under eight full years of Labour-led neglect."

"Our aim was to increase the number of people getting electives in our first term by an average of 4,000 per year - a total increase of 12,000. We've met this target already. "

"What this shows is that the Government is delivering for patients."

"The preliminary data shows increases in nearly all elective specialties including Orthopaedics, Ophthalmology, Plastics, and Ear, Nose and Throat."

"It will be a challenge to maintain this total number of patients for the 2009/10 year, simply because of the remarkable increase, and also because the swine flu has had an impact on this financial year."
