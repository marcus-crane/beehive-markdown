A joint Government and industry Steering Group to assist with the transition to digital switchover has been established, Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman and Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce announced today.

"The Steering Group is tasked with managing the transition from analogue to digital television transmission and advising the Government on the switchover," says Mr Joyce.

"The group will monitor the take-up of digital television throughout the country, ensure technical coordination, monitor the progress of other countries as they transition to digital television and recommend a date for switchover."

The Digital Switchover Steering Group comprises Kordia, SKY, Television New Zealand, the Ministry for Culture and Heritage, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Development. An Executive Director has been contracted to manage the project.

The group will be responsible for a comprehensive public information programme to ensure the public is fully informed throughout the transition process, and that all New Zealanders know exactly what they need to do to switch to digital.

"Digital television offers better reception including high definition where this is available and greater content choice with more channels. There are also economic benefits associated with early and efficient digital switchover, estimated to be over $300 million if digital switchover happens by 2015," says Dr Coleman.

"Digital television technology makes much more efficient use of radio frequency spectrum than analogue technology, it also reduces transmission costs and energy consumption," says Mr Joyce.

"Moving to digital television will free up analogue spectrum allowing it to be used for other purposes. The options for the use of the freed up spectrum after digital switchover is the subject of the recent discussion paper, Digital Futures.

"This is an exciting prospect for New Zealand. Having a significant amount of spectrum available for new uses will enable New Zealand to keep up with international developments in wireless communications and information technology, to improve productivity and economic performance."

It is estimated that approximately 60 per cent of New Zealand households now have digital television. The Government will set a final date for switchover when digital uptake has reached 75 percent, or in 2012, whichever occurs first.
