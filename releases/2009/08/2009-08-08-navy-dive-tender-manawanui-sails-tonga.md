The Navy dive tender HMNZS Manawanui has sailed for Tonga to support the recovery operation following this week’s ferry disaster, Prime Minister John Key said today.

Mr Key said the Manawanui had sailed from the Devonport naval base about midday as a contingency measure to support rescue and recovery efforts.

“She will support the Royal New Zealand Navy’s operational dive team and the Royal Australian Navy divers to carry out recovery of victims from the submerged ferry, the Princess Ashika.”

New Zealand and Australian dive teams arrived in Tonga overnight and are today conducting a survey of the recovery site using an underwater search vessel. A RNZAF P3 Orion has continued to search for survivors from the sinking on Wednesday night.

Mr Key said he was extremely concerned, and saddened, to hear that up to 85 people might now be unaccounted for after the sinking. Two bodies have been recovered and 54 people rescued.

“This has been an extremely distressing time for the people of Tonga, and New Zealand’s thoughts are with the families and friends of those who have died and who are missing. The New Zealand Government remains in close contact with the Government of Tonga and we are ready to provide whatever assistance we can.”

The diving tender has sailed because a suitable vessel to support the navy dive teams was not immediately available. It is due to arrive in Tonga next Friday, but will return to Devonport if a closer and suitable vessel can be located to support the recovery efforts.

Mr Key said New Zealand had today received an official request from Tonga for a disaster victim identification team and that was being actively considered by New Zealand Police.
