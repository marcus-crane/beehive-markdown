Police Minister Judith Collins tonight paid tribute to 165 New Zealand police officers who served in Timor-Leste, describing them as "exemplary representatives of our police overseas".

At a ceremony at Parliament, Ms Collins presented the Timor-Leste Solidarity Medal to 10 officers who represented seven police contingents to Timor-Leste.

The medal was instigated by Timor-Leste President Jose Ramos-Horta to recognise the work of the New Zealand Police in bringing stability to the emerging democracy.

"It is difficult to think of a task more difficult than building a system of law and order in a country where the people have long been wary of uniforms and authority," Ms Collins said.

"But the New Zealand Police can be counted on to succeed in this role. I believe that the ability to make personal connections across borders and across cultures is one of the greatest skills our police possess.

"By building friendships between people, in the villages, on the farms and in the cities, each of these officers helped strengthen the bonds between our two countries.

"In addition, the importance of the police in upholding the rule of law is crucial to a young democracy such as Timor-Leste."

Among those at the ceremony was Sergeant Ron Scott, who was Officer-in-Charge of the investigation into the attempted assassination of President Ramos-Horta.

Also receiving a medal was Senior Sergeant Peter Payne, who made a huge contribution to the life of a young woman from a Timorese orphanage by making arrangements for urgent dental treatment for her.

"This medal acknowledges the difference each and every one of you has made to Timor-Leste, by being mentors, role models and exemplary representatives of our police overseas," Ms Collins said.
