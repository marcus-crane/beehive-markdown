Immigration Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman announced today that Australian and New Zealand immigration officials will be working together to improve immigration processes for trans-Tasman travel.

Dr Coleman said officials from both Immigration New Zealand and Australia's Department of Immigration and Citizenship had agreed to look at ways to streamline trans-Tasman immigration processes.

His announcement follows a joint statement today by Prime Minister John Key and Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd that both countries have agreed to work together to streamline trans-Tasman air travel.

"I am pleased to announce that immigration officials from both countries agreed at a recent Australia and New Zealand Immigration Forum that they would meet to discuss ways to streamline immigration processes," Dr Coleman said.

This would complement other measures announced today by Mr Key, he said.

Dr Coleman, who is also Associate Minister of Tourism, said improved border processes between Australia and New Zealand would help make travel between the two countries more attractive.

"Australia is a major tourist market for New Zealand. More than one million Australian tourists visited New Zealand in the past year.

"Measures to encourage more tourists visiting here from our nearest neighbour will be a boost for the tourism industry and our economy," Dr Coleman said.
