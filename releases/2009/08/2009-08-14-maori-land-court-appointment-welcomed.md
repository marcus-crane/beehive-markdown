Courts Minister Georgina te Heuheu has welcomed today's appointment of Acting Chief Judge Wilson Whare Isaac as the Chief Judge of the Māori Land Court.

"This is a key role requiring extensive knowledge of the Court, te reo Māori and tikanga Māori, and the ability to engage with Māori communities while promoting and maintaining the confidence of Māori in a judicial institution of significance to their future development.

"I have no doubt that Chief Judge Isaac will perform this multi-faceted role fairly and with distinction, managing the Court as it deals with proposals and disputes involving Māori people, Māori assets and Māori aspirations."

Mrs te Heuheu said the Court had a unique role affirmed in legislation to promote the retention of Māori land in the hands of its owners and to facilitate its occupation, development and utilisation by its owners, their whānau and hapū. The Court also records and preserves historical documents which are essential for tracing whakapapa. 

As the new Chief Judge of the Maori Land Court, Chief Judge Isaac would face many challenges, she said.

"Many Māori live away from traditional lands, making the provision of information vital to assist them link their past with their future.

"Allied to this is the Court's preservation and maintenance of the largest indigenous land titles records system in the world.

"Chief Judge Isaac has already demonstrated leadership and a breadth of knowledge and experience as Acting Chief Judge critical to the role of the Māori Land Court in the 21st century.

"I look forward to him leading the Court with its unique challenges for the benefit of all New Zealanders," Mrs te Heuheu said.
