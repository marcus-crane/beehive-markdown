Transport Minister Steven Joyce has asked the New Zealand Transport Agency to develop a strategic roading plan for the Kapiti Coast, clearly identifying the long-term corridor for State Highway 1 through the district.

He wants a permanent alignment for the State Highway expressway, part of the Levin to Wellington Road of National Significance, to be agreed with the community before construction work proceeds on upcoming roading projects including the Western Link Road.

"State Highway 1 is a hugely important lifeline for the district, for the lower North Island generally, and for our capital city to the south," he says. 

"As part of our commitment to the corridor as a road of National Significance, we are looking to see an accelerated upgrade to that highway to improve safety and reduce journey times.

"It is intended that State Highway 1 be upgraded to expressway standard. That has ramifications for property access, and the community in Waikanae village, for example. 

"Therefore, given the limited options for roading corridors on the coast, we need to be completely clear as to the preferred long-term alignment before proceeding with the big programme of work in front of us."

The NZ Transport Agency will seek residents' views as to where they would prefer the final alignment for the highway to be, before further advancing the Waikanae Transport Interchange and the Western Link Road.

The two options being proposed for discussion are:

1\. An expressway broadly alongside the existing State Highway 1 alignment throughout the district. It means the highway continues to run through Paraparaumu and Waikanae townships.

2. The second option includes part of the alignment of the proposed Western Link Road. This option moves the highway out of Waikanae township onto the proposed Western Link Road alignment between Otaihanga and Waikanae Beach.

Mr Joyce says the big question is how the expressway will travel through Waikanae, but he is relaxed about which option is taken.

"I just want the community to make a conscious decision about what their long-term preference is."

The Minister has today met with the Kapiti District Council, urging them to work with the Transport Agency on a clear and cohesive plan for the development of State Highway 1 within the district

"This is the time to get that resolved, so we can all get on and improve roading on the coast," he says.
