Minister of Research, Science and Technology Wayne Mapp has set out the Government’s priorities for the RST sector.

In [a keynote address](http://beehive.govt.nz/speech/research+science+and+technology+priorities) to sector leaders at Parliament yesterday, Dr Mapp said that public money is invested in science to lift the country’s economic performance, not just for science’s sake.

“We need to ensure we get maximum value from the $745 million we currently spend,” he said.

“Last month the Prime Minister highlighted six policy drivers that are fundamental to the Government’s drive to boost New Zealand’s economic performance and improve our standard of living. One of those is innovation. A significant driver of innovation is the Government’s investment in RST.

“RST will be expected to play a bigger part in improving our economic performance. This is the start of a process that will be completed by the end of the year. It will directly engage the key participants in the sector.

“There are four major themes for RST underpinning the Government’s policy to grow the economy. They are:

- enhancing the migration of science from laboratory to market
- improving the way we strategically invest in the public-good science that underpins our economy
- directly boosting economic growth through more effective market-driven research
- simplifying the entire system.

“Implicit in these themes are the Government’s priorities for Vote RST. They will determine the best way for science to both directly and indirectly build economic growth,” Dr Mapp said.
