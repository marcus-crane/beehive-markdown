Tariana Turia has described the daughter of a long-time smoker as "courageous" for winning a case against a tobacco giant.

This week, a federal jury in the United States decided cigarette maker Philip Morris USA should pay US$13.8 million in punitive damages to Jodie Bullock whose mother Betty Bullock died of lung cancer in 2003.

"My hat goes off to Jodie - she's absolutely courageous and it's about time tobacco companies were forced to acknowledge that their products not only affect those who smoke them, but also their children."

The Los Angeles jury voted 9-3 in favour of Jodie.
