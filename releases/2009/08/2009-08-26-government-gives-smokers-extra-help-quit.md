Nicotine patches, gum and lozenges will be made cheaper for smokers wanting to quit the deadly habit which kills about 5000 New Zealanders every year, Tariana Turia announced today.

Furthermore, as of September 1, the three forms of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) can also be prescribed by general practitioners (GPs).

"Smokers usually use two forms of NRT with a Quit Card which would cost them $20 for an eight week supply.  From 1 September the same amount will cost $6 whether they are using a Quit Card or a prescription," Mrs Turia said.

"It is one of the Government's priorities to help people quit smoking and these two initiatives are aimed at achieving that.

"We know that many people smoke, because they have formed an uncontrollable dependence on cigarettes; and need all the help they can get to make the dramatic change required - the patches, gum and lozenges are a way of making it easier to break the habit."

International evidence showed using NRT doubles the chances of a person successfully quitting smoking.

Quit Cards will continue to be available from registered Quit Card providers including the publicly-funded free Quitline 0800 778 798.

"We know it costs money to go to a GP but people can call Quitline for free."

The Ministry of Health's budget for NRT is currently $4.5 million per annum. A review of smoking cessation services is underway.
