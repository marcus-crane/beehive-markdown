Transport Minister Steven Joyce today announced that after careful consideration, the government has decided the requirements for used diesel vehicles to meet minimum emissions standards set out in the 2007 Vehicle Exhaust Emissions Rule (Emissions Rule) will not be delayed.

From January 2010, used diesel vehicles will need to meet a standard known as Japan 05 for harmful exhaust emissions. Used vehicle importers had called for the implementation of this standard to be delayed to improve flagging sales.

"Emissions standards are important for ensuring we are in step with the rest of the world in reducing harmful exhaust emissions," says Mr Joyce.

"The government has received correspondence both for and against this issue, with new vehicle importers and vehicle user representatives favouring the current timetable," says Mr Joyce.

"On balance, and to provide certainty to the industry as a whole, we have decided not to delay the existing timetable. This will retain the current balance of responsibility for harmful emissions between new and used vehicle importers.

"I have considerable sympathy for the motor vehicle industry as a whole at this time. That is one reason why the government will not be advancing the previously proposed vehicle fuel economy standard."
