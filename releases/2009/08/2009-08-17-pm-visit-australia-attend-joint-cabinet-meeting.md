Prime Minister John Key will visit Australia from August 18 to 23.

The official visit will include talks with Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, a speech to the Australia-New Zealand Leadership Forum and visits to Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney.

Mr Key will also lead New Zealand Cabinet Ministers in the first joint cabinet meeting between New Zealand and Australian ministers while in Sydney.

“The joint cabinet meeting is a great opportunity for a wider exchange of ideas between our Governments.  The fact this meeting is taking place reflects the close partnership we have, and the degree of economic and social integration between us,” Mr Key said.

“I have met with Mr Rudd a number of times, most recently at the Pacific Island Forum in Cairns.  I look forward to building on the commitments we made when we met in March this year to strengthen trans-Tasman relations.

“Mr Rudd and I will discuss regional and international issues, as well as review progress in expanding the bilateral relationship and further increasing economic integration.

“I am pleased that seven of my Cabinet will be with me in Australia during the Australia-New Zealand Leadership Forum in Sydney. The forum is a fantastic opportunity to get together heavy-hitters from across the private and public sectors, to invigorate the trans-Tasman relationship and generate the momentum necessary to expand it even further.

“The Forum can help generate just the kind of ideas we need to get through these tough economic times, and to lift productivity and growth,” Mr Key said.

During the official visit Mr Key will also meet with Australian Governor-General Quentin Bryce, Victorian Premier John Brumby and New South Wales Premier Nathan Rees.

The ministers who will attend the joint cabinet meeting with the Prime Minister are: Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Bill English, Economic Development Minister Gerry Brownlee, Commerce Minister Simon Power, Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully, Trade Minister Tim Groser, Defence Minister Wayne Mapp and Communications and IT Minister Steven Joyce.
