New Zealand will provide up to $100,000 to support relief efforts in Taiwan following Typhoon Morakot, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.

"New Zealand extends its condolences to the people of Taiwan over the destruction caused by Typhoon Morakot," Mr McCully said.

"There are currently 117 confirmed deaths, with a further 380 people missing presumed dead. More than 1.5 million were forced to evacuate their homes, and 14,000 people have been displaced, with 5000 living in temporary camps after their homes were destroyed.

"Large numbers of people are without water or electricity, and there have been significant losses of crops, livestock, fisheries, forestry, and infrastructure.

"Taiwan has requested New Zealand assistance. The funding announced today will support the work of Taiwan Red Cross, which is helping people who have lost their homes as a result of the typhoon," Mr McCully said.

The $100,000 contribution will be provided through New Zealand Red Cross to the International Federation of the Red Cross Disaster Relief Emergency Facility, which supports disaster responses.
