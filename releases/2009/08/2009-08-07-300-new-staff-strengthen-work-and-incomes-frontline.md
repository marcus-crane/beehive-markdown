The Government is to invest $17.2 million to boost the front line of Work and Income, says the Minister for Social Development and Employment Paula Bennett.

“This new money will fund an additional 303 frontline staff to focus on finding jobs and placing people into work.

Work and Income agreed it could manage numbers on the Unemployment Benefit up to 60,000. However, as that figure grows closer, extra staff will be required.

“The number of people on the Unemployment Benefit is over 50,000 for the first time since 2005.

“Today’s announcement means the right resources can be deployed right now to the right areas. It’s important that help is provided upfront, so as many people as possible can get work and avoid having to go on a benefit,” Ms Bennett says.

Of the 303, 104 staff have already been recruited to work in the Auckland region.

“Work and Income has lifted its game when it comes to finding jobs in the labour market. Its vacancy numbers are actually more than 50 percent higher than for this time last year – despite growing unemployment.

“As a Government, we committed to supporting and growing frontline services. This move shows we’re prepared to put the resources in where we know it will make a real difference to the lives of New Zealanders,” Ms Bennett says.

**Fact Sheet Work and Income responding to rising unemployment**

- Work and Income will get an extra 303 frontline staff to help place people into work. Most of these resources will be put into urban areas.

<!--THE END-->

- 206 new frontline case managers and work brokers will focus on finding jobs, processing applications and placing people into work.  126 of these will be based in Auckland. The remainder will be spread across the country with Waikato, Wellington and Canterbury receiving an extra 12, 14 and 16 frontline staff respectively.

<!--THE END-->

- 63 staff will boost numbers in the contact centre to handle the ongoing increase in phone calls to Work and Income.  Calls are forecast to grow to 6.4 million by the end of the year – up 400,000 on the previous year.

<!--THE END-->

- 34 staff will be based in the new dedicated Job Call Centre in our existing Wellington call centre. Expanding the Employer Line, this new service improves access for employers to list vacancies.  Using specialist staff, the centre will hunt out vacancies and job opportunities, provide ongoing post placement support and undertake job matching over the phone.

<!--THE END-->

- Case Managers deal directly with clients helping them identify job and training opportunities and ensure they are receiving their correct entitlements.

<!--THE END-->

- Work Brokers liaise closely with employers in their regions to help meet their employment needs and source job vacancies for listing with Work and Income. They also work with industry to identify and develop training courses.

<!--THE END-->

- Customer Service Representatives are the first port of call for people phoning the contact centre for advice and information on the type of support and assistance available from Work and Income.

<!--THE END-->

- Work and Income is continuing to link people with jobs quickly. Currently around 30% of people who attend a ‘Work for You’ seminar do not go on benefit within 28 days of attending the seminar.

<!--THE END-->

- Despite the tough conditions people are still getting jobs. For the past five weeks, each week on average 790 people are cancelling their unemployment benefit due to finding work.

<!--THE END-->

- Work and Income is still receiving on average around 800 new vacancies each week across the country. This has remained steady for the past three months. A year ago Work and Income was receiving about 600 new vacancies a week.

<!--THE END-->

- Work and Income’s ‘Rapid Response Service’ is actively supporting struggling businesses across all regions.  It helps redundant workers access training services, search for other work opportunities and provides financial support if required.

<!--THE END-->

- Work and Income is also using technology smarter. An agreement with Trade Me has seen its job vacancies split into regions, forwarded to Work and Income who then send the vacancies to its registered job seeking clients.  This offers job seekers another source of vacancies.

<!--THE END-->

- Work and Income is improving its business processes and cutting out unnecessary transactions.  For example, it has stopped sending additional confirmation letters to people who had received an emergency grant – about 500,000 a year.

<!--THE END-->

- Work and Income is moving more transactions online.  Within the next couple of months people will be able to begin the benefit application process online.  Employers will also be able to lodge vacancies online with Work and Income.

<!--THE END-->

- Voice Enabled Technology is providing a faster way for clients to identify themselves when they access services.

<!--THE END-->

- Improvements in the appointments scheduling process has reduced waiting times for clients and allowed more clients to be seen.

Unemployment Numbers

- As at 31 July, there were 55,272, working aged people (18-64) receiving the unemployment benefit. Overall unemployment benefit numbers are up by 34,726 (169%) since July 2008.

<!--THE END-->

- Although unemployment will continue to grow, it’s worth providing some perspective on where the numbers currently sit. In June 1999 over 150,000 people were receiving the unemployment benefit and in March 2003 it was around 100,000 people - almost double what it is today. This time four years ago there were about 51,000 people receiving the unemployment benefit.

<!--THE END-->

- Young people continue to feature prominently in growth in main benefits. 18 – 24 year olds account for 33% of people receiving the unemployment benefit as at July 2009, compared with 23% a year earlier. The numbers for this age group rose from 4,749 to 18,161 over the same period.

Vacancies

- Despite rising unemployment, Work and Income is still receiving on average around 800 new vacancies each week across the country. This has remained steady for the past three months. A year ago Work and Income was receiving about 600 new vacancies a week.

Partnering with Employers

- Industry Partnerships are successfully placing clients into jobs. Work and Income’s Straight to Work Programme tailors training courses to meet industry needs.  There are 80 industry partnerships linking to 48,000 employers.

<!--THE END-->

- For the period July 2008 to June 2009 3,300 job seekers have participated in Industry Partnership programmes. Of these, 48.6 % were young people and 39% were Maori and 12.2% were Pacific People.

<!--THE END-->

- One thousand nine hundred and seventy nine people have completed a programme and 1,321 are currently training or in the process of being matched to employment by providers.

<!--THE END-->

- The ‘Employability Enhancement’ service with the Auckland Chamber of Commerce, targets highly skilled workers who have been laid off.  From July to December 2009 this service will help up to 500 workers affected by the downturn with CVs and interview preparation.

<!--THE END-->

- In May 2009, the Auckland Chamber of Commerce and Work and Income jointly developed a vacancy portal providing a recruitment service to members of the chamber.  It has already listed 76 job opportunities.

<!--THE END-->

- Work and Income is helping Progressive Enterprises Ltd to recruit workers. Progressive is one of New Zealand’s largest employers, with over 18,000 staff.  Progressive plans to open 3-5 new stores each year for the next five years, creating 2,000-3,000 new jobs.

<!--THE END-->

- Work and Income has a partnership with Fonterra and currently Work and Income receive approximately 40 job opportunities a month.  Fonterra have 20,000 full time employees.

<!--THE END-->

- Alliance Group has a seasonal workforce of 4,800 meat industry workers and in any one year look to fill 700 to 800 vacancies across their South Island plants and their recently acquired Levin based plant.

Youth Opportunities Package

- This is a $152 million dollar package announced in early August to create new work, education and training opportunities for unemployment young people.

<!--THE END-->

- The key two components administered by Work and Income are Job Ops and Community Max. We need employers, groups and organisations to step up with opportunities.

Job Ops

4000 6 month job placements for low-skilled young people in businesses (2009-2010). The aim of Job Ops is to help young people develop work skills, foster confidence and discipline and provide reference. $5000 total wage subsidy over 6 months paid to employers

Community Max

3000 jobs up to 6 months in community programmes + 1 supervisor per 4 jobs (2009 – 2010). The aim of Community Max is to connect young people to the positive work going on in our communities. Minimum wage for 30 hours a week and a training payment paid to community groups

International Comparisons

New Zealand’s official unemployment rate (HLFS) is still well below the OECD average of 8.3%. As at June 2009, New Zealand’s unemployment rate was 6\`%, Australia was at 5.8%, Canada 8.6%, United Kingdom 7.2% and 11.7% for Ireland.
