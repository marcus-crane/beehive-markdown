Children currently receiving additional therapy at 23 New Zealand schools will continue to be funded, Education Minister Anne Tolley announced today.

"I have taken this decision following discussions with affected families and schools, and feedback received in regular meetings with sector representatives," said Mrs Tolley.

Children already receiving services through the funding will continue to do so while they remain at their current school, with no new students eligible for additional therapy funding at the schools.

"The additional therapy funding was introduced in 1999, and was only intended to be available until 2001. It has continued to be rolled over every year since then.

"Some parents have enrolled their children at a particular school based on the additional therapy resourcing available there. Today's decision guarantees that while their child is at that school, the funding will remain available."

The funding, which will cost $2.5 million in 2009/2010, will reduce as students leave their school, and will come from the $51 million in increased funding allocated to special education in Budget 2009.

"We consider this a small cost relative to the very high value that is clearly placed on the additional therapy services.

"Ministry of Education staff will now work with the schools to ensure they have everything in place for additional therapy services to continue next year."
