New Zealand is sending a strong signal that it is serious about combating cyber crime, Police Minister Judith Collins said at the 25th anniversary celebration of the Police Electronic Crime Lab (ECL) today.

Launched in 1984, ECL specialises in extracting evidence from electronic devices such as computers and mobile phones. Today it has a staff of 31 who process thousands of exhibits every year.

Ms Collins said the country's future economic prosperity and growth will rely on the secure use of information technology.

"Increasingly, New Zealand's exports to the world will be innovation and ideas. Growing the knowledge economy is a priority, and a safe and secure digital environment is essential to its success," Ms Collins said.

"Entrepreneurs and investors must have confidence that their networks and their intellectual property will be protected while conducting business in New Zealand.

"To achieve this, the police must demonstrate they have the capability and the commitment to detect and fight electronic crime."

Information technology has offered new opportunities for criminals, Ms Collins said.

"Of particular concern is the use of information and communications technology by organised crime to conceal their activities, reach a wide range of victims, and network with other criminal groups."

At today's ceremony, ECL launched Environment for Visualised Evidence (EVE) - a world-first technology developed in-house that enables frontline investigators to view data held within electronic devices, such as seized computers.

"Project EVE is testament to the energy, innovation and can-do attitude that exists within the ECL team," Ms Collins said.
