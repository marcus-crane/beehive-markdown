Agriculture Minister David Carter says the decision by farmers not to support the continuation of a wool levy is disappointing and will create difficulties for the industry.

"I respect the democratic process and the right for farmers to decide, but I am concerned that the ramifications of this decision have not been fully realised.

"The result of the referendum on the Meat & Wool NZ levy gives a clear go-ahead for the meat sector, but effectively leaves the wool industry without a mandated industry-good body at a time when this is desperately needed.

"For example it will now be difficult for the wool industry to access funding from the Government's Primary Growth Partnership initiative," says Mr Carter.

"As Minister of Agriculture, I am concerned that the wool industry now finds itself in such a vulnerable position.

"It is time for the industry as a whole to stop fighting old battles and look to the future."

Mr Carter says that while he is willing to assist, the onus is also on industry leaders to work together to find a solution. 

 

Note: The Commodity Levies (Meat) Order 2004 and the Commodity Levies (Wool) Order 2004 expire on 18 April 2010. Current arrangements will continue until that time.

Meat and Wool NZ will submit its application to the Minister of Agriculture for those commodities (sheepmeat and beef) that got the required potential levy support in the near future. MAF will then assess MWNZ's application against the requirements of the Commodity Levies Act, including the consultation requirements, before advising the Minister whether to agree with the making of the required levy orders. MAF will assess MWNZ's application, present the report to the Minister in November 2009 and have the levy orders made in early 2010.
