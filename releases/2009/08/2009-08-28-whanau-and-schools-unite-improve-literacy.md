A large-scale, grass-roots education campaign to raise literacy and education achievement levels in Manurewa is being launched this morning by Associate Education Minister Dr Pita Sharples.

The Manurewa Literacy Project involves 29 schools and kura in teacher professional development, extended reading recovery and whanau reading projects, in both English- and Maori-medium education.

"Today's launch signals another step towards realising Maori potential through strengthening literacy," said Dr Sharples, "and Manurewa is showing the way."

"Successful learning in the early years is a ‘must' if learners are going to stay engaged and go on to achieve in education. Investing in the development of strong learning foundations like reading and writing is critical to lifting achievement," he said.

"Home has a powerful influence on what a child learns inside and outside of school. A special feature of this programme is the role parents take on with guidance on how to help their children at home.

"When productive partnerships between Maori learners, their whanau and expert educators are made, everyone enjoys better outcomes," he said.

"These programmes have both teachers and whanau in mind. It is important to support teachers to improve their literacy teaching practices, but families, whanau and communities must not be overlooked," said Dr Sharples.

**Background:**

The Manurewa Literacy Project consists of five programmes:

Programme 1 involves the Manurewa Literacy Cluster of 11 primary schools, three intermediate and three secondary schools in professional development based on leader and teacher literacy practices

Programme 2 provides for literacy development officers to offer support for the same type of professional development programmes in another nine primary schools.

Programme 3 strengthens reading recovery programmes in all 20 primary schools on Manurewa.

Programme 4 will see the Reading Together programme rolled out across all 20 primary school communities over two years.

Programme 5 supports Maori immersion and bilingual programmes in two kura kaupapa Maori, five primary school bilingual units and the wharekura.

Tainui kaumatua and the Manurewa marae are strong supporters of the project.

Around 40% of the 16,000 students in Manurewa schools are Maori.

The launch is at Manurewa Marae, Matukurua, Auckland at 10.00am Friday
