Prime Minister John Key has announced the establishment of a pilot programme that will deliver skills training to visiting Pacific workers taking part in the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) Scheme.

“We are committed to the RSE scheme and expanding the benefits for Pacific communities, families and individuals,” Mr Key says.

Today’s announcement will see $500,000 invested by NZAID in skills training for up to 300 RSE workers across the Bay of Plenty, Hawkes Bay and Marlborough over the next two years.

“The training will be conducted outside of work hours and will focus on literacy, numeracy, and financial understanding.

“If successful, we will look at expanding the programme to cover more RSE participants.”

In the last year more than 5,500 workers came from around the Pacific region to work in New Zealand orchards and vineyards. This has contributed significantly to improving returns for New Zealand's horticulture and viticulture industries, as well as contributing cashflow and skills to Pacific nations.

“In the current economic climate the money earned by Pacific people working in New Zealand is an important lifeline for Pacific economies, and the skills that the workers take home will also help economic development in the region.”

In addition to the RSE scheme, NZAID and AusAID have jointly funded the development of the [www.sendmoneypacific.org](http://www.sendmoneypacific.org/)  website aimed at reducing the costs of remitting money from New Zealand and Australia by allowing people to easily compare costs, exchange rates and transaction speed.

The Prime Minister is currently attending the Pacific Islands Forum in Cairns and returns to New Zealand on Friday.
