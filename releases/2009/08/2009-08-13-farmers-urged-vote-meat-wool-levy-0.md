Agriculture Minister David Carter is urging all eligible sheep and beef farmers to vote in the upcoming referendum on the Meat & Wool NZ levy.

"As a sheep farmer myself I know how easy it is to forget to vote on the levy proposal. But this is an important decision for farmers and the future of their industry.

"It is essential that sheep and beef farmers are represented by a strong industry good body, which provides a prominent voice in Wellington and takes an active role in market development, innovation, and other key areas.

"With the primary sector facing an increasing number of challenges, this is a critical vote and one that farmers should not ignore."

Mr Carter noted that Meat & Wool NZ had made considerable efforts to listen to farmers' concerns and adjusted the proposed levy range accordingly.

"It is clear that there has been considerable debate about the relative merits of the proposal and such debate is to be encouraged. The most important thing now, though, is that farmers deliver a clear mandate one way or another.

"I look forward to seeing farmers exercising their right to vote on this important issue and securing the best future for their industry", said Mr Carter.

Voting on the Meat & Wool NZ levy proposal closes at 2pm on 28 August.
