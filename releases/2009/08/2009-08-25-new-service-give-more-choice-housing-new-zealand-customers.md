Housing New Zealand has launched an Options and Advice Service designed to help more low-to-modest income families with housing, Housing Minister Phil Heatley announced today.

Phase One of the Options and Advice Service is being piloted in eight Housing New Zealand Neighbourhood Units, fulfilling an election promise and is part of the Government’s overall housing programme.

“Every day, four times more people ask Housing New Zealand for a home than the Corporation can actually house,” Mr Heatley said.

“The aim of the Options and Advice Service is to use the expertise Housing New Zealand has, and the relationships it holds in the community and in government, to help more people.

“The National Government wants Housing New Zealand to provide customers with information and advice that helps them identify all the housing options available to them. These options may be in state housing, the private rental market, or home ownership,” said Mr Heatley.

“With good information, people can take charge of their own circumstances and make an informed choice about their housing.”

The new service is being piloted in Whangarei, Onehunga, Panmure, Manurewa, Hamilton, Manawatu, Linwood, and Timaru.

The pilot will be evaluated to ensure it is working for customers. If the results are good, Phase Two of the service will consist of a national roll-out.

“Critical to this initiative is the support of the Ministry of Social Development and private rental agents,” Mr Heatley said.

“Many of Housing New Zealand’s customers are not aware of the homes available to them in the private market, or their entitlements to the Accommodation Supplement that assists low-income people to live in the private sector. By working more closely together, Work and Income, Housing New Zealand and private rental agencies can provide these families with sustainable housing options and genuine choices they don’t think they have,” Mr Heatley said.

“Housing New Zealand can’t build a state home for every person who comes through their door, so its time to start thinking innovatively to help a lot more people find a home.”

**Background:**

**How does it work?**

Housing New Zealand takes customers through an information session.  The session explains the various housing options available to customers and links them to all the government services that assist with housing.

After the session, if a customer is interested in applying for a state house they can make an appointment for a housing needs assessment.

Where the customer indicates they are interested in pursuing housing in the private sector, Housing New Zealand will:

- provide information regarding homes that are available
- assist the customer with the rental process
- make an appointment with a Work and Income case manager on the customer’s behalf.  At the appointment the customer can establish what financial assistance they may be entitled to in private sector housing.
