Minister of Education Anne Tolley has announced the timeline for implementing National Standards, which aim to lift the levels of achievement in literacy and numeracy for New Zealand children in primary and intermediate schools.

"I have taken into account the feedback we received following the consultation period, where over 10,000 people attended sector and parent meetings or gave written submissions," said Mrs Tolley.

National Standards are due to be published and distributed to schools in October of this year. They will come into effect in 2010, and schools will be required to assess students against the standards and report in plain language to parents about their child's progress and achievement.

Schools will begin submitting data to the Ministry of Education in 2012, against targets set for National Standards achievement in their 2011 charters.

"This will give schools time to develop their 2011 charters next year, and shows I have fulfilled my promise to listen to their concerns," said Mrs Tolley.

"This timeframe will also allow us to work together on addressing other issues, such as how the data is presented and used.

"But we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that National Standards will help us to get the best possible results for our children, as well as informing parents about their achievement levels."
