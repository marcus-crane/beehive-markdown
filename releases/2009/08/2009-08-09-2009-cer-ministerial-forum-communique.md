New Zealand and Australian Ministers responsible for the trans-Tasman trade and economic relationship met in Wellington on 9 August 2009 for the annual Closer Economic Relations (CER) Ministerial Forum.

Ministers welcomed the very good progress that had been made over the preceding year to strengthen and deepen the relationship, working towards the ultimate goal of an Australia-New Zealand ‘Single Economic Market'.

This progress built on 26 years of CER and the Joint Statement on Strengthened Trans-Tasman Cooperation issued by Prime Ministers Key and Rudd at their meeting in early March.

Ministers expressed their strong commitment to driving forward the trans-Tasman agenda in the face of the global economic crisis. It was more important than ever to foster open markets, keep capital and credit flowing and resist the rise of protectionism around the world.

"The CER economy remains open for business despite the current economic challenges," Ministers said.

CER is a model for the world, going beyond barriers at the border to deeper economic and regulatory integration. Two-way trade is currently worth over NZ$26 billion (A$21 billon). Merchandise trade has grown at an average of 6.2% per annum over the last two decades. Two-way investment between Australia and New Zealand stands at over NZ$122 (A$97 billion).

"This is testament to the success of the CER and SEM agenda for both countries," said Ministers. "We are becoming increasingly integrated - and this has direct benefits for business and the wider economy."

The progress made over the past year has been aimed at reducing barriers at and behind the border. Ministers noted that they would be reporting on progress to Prime Ministers ahead of their meeting in Canberra later in the month.

Areas of focus included industry policy, notably modernising ‘rules of origin', freeing up investment rules, an ambitious new work programme for the Single Economic Market looking particularly at enhancing the regulatory environment for business, seeking to streamline travel across the Tasman, collaboration on improvements in the rules around food trade, and exploring the scope to liberalise services trade even further. Ministers also discussed current biosecurity issues, the review of the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Arrangement, and collaboration on science including climate change and areas of innovation and scientific research.

New Zealand participants were Minister of Trade Tim Groser, Minister of Commerce and Associate Finance Minister Hon Simon Power, and Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Biosecurity Hon David Carter. Australian participants were Minister of Trade Simon Crean, Assistant Treasurer Senator Nick Sherry, and Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Tony Burke.
