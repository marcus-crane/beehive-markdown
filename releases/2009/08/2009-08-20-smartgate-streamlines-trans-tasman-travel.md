Today's announcement by New Zealand Prime Minister John Key and Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on the installation of SmartGate will make it simpler and more efficient to cross the Tasman, says Customs Minister Maurice Williamson.

"SmartGate is an automated passenger clearance system using biometric technology. It is already operating at most international airports in Australia for arriving New Zealand and Australian e-passport holders and will be available to New Zealand and Australian e-passport holders arriving in Auckland from Australia from December. Wellington and Christchurch will follow in 2010.

"Both countries using SmartGate systems will greatly enhance the ease of use for the travelling public, which in turn will reduce processing times," Mr Williamson says.

SmartGate uses face recognition biometric technology and the information stored in the microchip inside e-passports to perform the identity check that is usually conducted by a Customs officer. 

"SmartGate gives New Zealand and Australian e-passport holders travelling trans-Tasman the option to complete the customs and immigration arrival or departure processes using an automated system instead of reporting to a Customs officer," Mr Williamson says.

"Facial biometrics for mass passenger processing is world-leading technology. SmartGate will enable our agencies at the border to work smarter, quicker and faster. We're improving our border processing through the application of this new technology solution.

"The technology will streamline the trans-Tasman passenger clearance processes. It will reduce the amount of queuing throughout the departures and arrivals processes, which will give visitors a more positive first impression of New Zealand as a travel destination. 

"SmartGate will also allow Customs to focus important resources on higher-risk passengers," Mr Williamson says. 

SmartGate is part of wider trans-Tasman travel initiatives which include changes to biosecurity screening and further work to streamline trans-Tasman travel, including a joint feasibility study on the possible integration of both countries' SmartGate systems.

The implementation of SmartGate will be managed by Customs with the involvement of other border agencies.
