An online Muslim Women’s Directory has been launched by the Office of Ethnic Affairs as part of Islam Awareness Week.

The directory is the result of a collaborative effort between the Office of Ethnic Affairs and Islamic Women’s Council of New Zealand and brings together 26 Muslim women’s organisations in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.

Ethnic Affairs Minister Pansy Wong says the Muslim Women’s Directory brings together various Muslim women’s organisations from many different communities and will allow them to adopt a national focus in their contributions to their community.

“There are many wonderful organisations out there offering a range of support to Islamic families and I am delighted that these groups have been brought together to ensure they can further assist Muslim New Zealanders,” Mrs Wong says.

“The Muslim faith spans across more than 40 different ethnic communities in New Zealand and this Directory is a way for these communities to work together to achieve their goals.”

“It is crucial that all New Zealanders feel supported and the Directory has anything that a family might need; whether that is sports clubs, playcentres and family assistance.”

The Muslim Women’s Directory brings together groups that support Muslim women and families and provides information to Muslim women organisations so they can work together more effectively.
