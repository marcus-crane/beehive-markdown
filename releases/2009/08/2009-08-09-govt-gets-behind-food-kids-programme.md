About 7,500 more children will have the opportunity to learn with full stomachs as a result of a Government decision to help expand KidsCan StandTall’s ‘Food For Kids’ programme, Prime Minister John Key announced today.

Mr Key said the Government has agreed, with funding from the Ministry of Social Development and Ministry of Health, to put $320,000 into KidsCan StandTall’s food in schools scheme.

He unveiled the new funding during an appearance on the Big Night In Telethon event.

The money means children who are identified by teachers as needing food will be able to get some basic nourishment to help them learn at school. The 7,500 children are spread across almost 150 schools which have voluntarily put themselves on a waiting list for the programme.

“I am delighted that more children who are in need will be able to get something to eat to put them on the right path to learning,” Mr Key says.

“There is no doubt in my mind that a child who is hungry is a child who will struggle to concentrate and learn.

“I am determined to raise literacy and numeracy levels in this country and I believe that making sure children aren’t hungry at school will help contribute to that,” Mr Key says.

KidsCan StandTall already provides food to around 8,500 children a week but it has thousands more on a waiting list.

Mr Key would also like to see more of the business community come on board and help programmes which offer food in schools.

“There are a lot of good people out there doing great work helping kids in need.

“When it comes to food in schools I believe it is not only a matter for the Government or individuals – businesses too may be able to step up to the plate and help out programmes like this one,” Mr Key says.
