Corrections Inmate Employment instructor Paul Jack was today presented the Minister's Excellence Award by Corrections Minister Judith Collins.

Mr Jack received the award at the Corrections Officer graduation ceremony at Upper Hutt's Rimutaka Prison.

A CIE instructor at Northland Region Corrections Facility (NRCF), Mr Jack is the first non-Corrections Officer to receive the award.

Ms Collins established the award to recognise newly graduated Corrections staff who demonstrated outstanding achievement.

"Paul displayed a high level of professionalism and leadership during his training," Ms Collins said. "He has demonstrated that he is a great team player and has always shown a willingness to offer help and advice to others."

Mr Jack will be based at NRCF as a tutor, helping prisoners earn NZQA unit standards in food hygiene, food preparation and cooking.

"I have no doubt that Paul's outstanding work ethic will also be an inspiration to them," Ms Collins said.

Fourteen Corrections Officers and three CIE Instructors graduated today.

The new graduates will work at Waikeria, Spring Hill, Otago, NRCF, Christchurch and Invercargill Prisons.

"The work of Corrections staff in making our communities safer is often under-recognised. My wish is that this award acknowledges not just the hard work of those receiving it, but the contribution of all Corrections staff," Ms Collins said.
