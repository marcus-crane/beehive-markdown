Tenby Powell, executive director of New Zealand Rental Group, has been appointed to Antarctica New Zealand's management board, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"Mr Powell brings strong business acumen to the board, along with a deep understanding of risk management and environmental issues," Mr McCully said.

Mr Powell is a Lieutenant Colonel in the New Zealand Army reserves, and co-chaired the Auckland Entrepreneurial Summit in May. He replaces former Bank of New Zealand Chairman Kerry McDonald on the board.

Mr McCully said former World Wide Fund chief executive Jo Breese, retired Defence Secretary Graham Fortune, marine conservationist Janice Molloy, and marine scientist John Montgomery had all been reappointed to the board, which is chaired by Living Earth founder Rob Fenwick.

"The members of the Board have the skills and experience to successfully guide New Zealand's activities on the ice, particularly this year as we look forward to the commissioning of the wind turbines on Ross Island," Mr McCully said.

Antarctica New Zealand is a Crown entity and manages New Zealand's national programme in Antarctica, including the running of Scott Base.
