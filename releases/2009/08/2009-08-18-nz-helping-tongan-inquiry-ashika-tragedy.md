New Zealand's Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) is formally supporting the Tongan Royal Commission's inquiry into the sinking of the MV Princess Ashika, says Associate Minister of Transport Nathan Guy.

"The New Zealand Government has been pleased to assist the Tongan Government to date in dealing with this tragedy and we are very happy to provide the support of TAIC for this inquiry.

"TAIC has had a six person team (including two investigators from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau and one from Maritime NZ) in Tonga since Wednesday last week working in the background pending the formal establishment of the Royal Commission." 

Justice Warwick Andrew was sworn in as the Royal Commission's chair on Friday with two other Commissioners yet to be appointed. The TAIC team has been working closely with Justice Andrew since his appointment.

Mr Guy said the team would be conducting a wide-ranging and thorough investigation for the Royal Commission which would go well beyond the fateful voyage itself. 

"The aim is that the Royal Commission's final report will establish the facts of the sinking, all the reasons contributing to it, and make findings and recommendations that will help improve maritime safety in Tonga and elsewhere.

Mr Guy said it was important to note that TAIC's legislative mandate only allowed it to determine the circumstances and causes of transport accidents to avoid reoccurrences and it would not be involved in apportioning blame or liability for the tragedy.

The current team includes two master mariners, an engineer, a regulatory expert, a human factors expert, and a liaison and logistics person.

One of the team is currently aboard HMNZS Manawanui. He witnessed and assisted with the photographic survey of the sunken vessel completed this morning. Others are reviewing information already gathered by the Tonga Police which is running a separate investigation, confirming and interviewing witnesses and gathering additional documents to support the investigation.

Mr Guy said it was envisaged the team would be in Tonga for another 10 days initially, with members returning as required to carry out inquiries and to support the Royal Commission. Other resources would be brought in if needed for specialist expertise depending on the course of the investigation.
