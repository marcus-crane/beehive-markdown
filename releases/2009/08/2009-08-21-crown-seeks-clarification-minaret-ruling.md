The Crown is to seek clarification from the High Court of the Land Valuation Tribunal's decision on the Minaret Station rent case.

"The Government remains supportive of the decision and is committed to implementing pastoral lease rents based on the earnings capacity of a property," say Agriculture Minister David Carter and Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson.

"However, the Solicitor General has advised the judgment leaves an unclear definition of "capital value" which presents some complexities around valuing pastoral leases in the future.

"For this reason, further clarification is needed," say Mr Carter and Mr Williamson.

"This is not about amenity values. This Government has no intention of revisiting Labour's policy of including amenity values in the rent setting process," says Mr Carter.

"It is a case of defining a narrow technical aspect of the ruling."

"We want to bring certainty to the application of our previously stated policy on pastoral lease rents. Clarifying the decision will benefit both the Crown and leaseholders," the Ministers say.
