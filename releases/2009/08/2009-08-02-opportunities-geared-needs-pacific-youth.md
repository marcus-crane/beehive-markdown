Pacific youth will benefit from the Government's Youth Opportunities policy package, says Pacific Island Affairs Minister Georgina te Heuheu.

Sixteen to 24 year olds make up about one-third of all people on an unemployment benefit. Of those 12 per cent are Pacific youth.

Mrs te Heuheu says two of the initiatives announced by the Prime Minister - Job Op and Community Max - will create immediate opportunities of particular value to Pacific people.

Job Op creates funding for up to 4000 entry level roles for 16 to 24 year olds whose chances of getting work are limited.

Community Max helps unskilled 16 to 24 year olds with low or no qualifications and funds up to 3000, six-month places on community projects such as renovating marae or getting rid of graffiti and tagging.

"The Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs will play an important role in working with the Pacific community to identify projects that could be funded as part of Community Max," she says.

The Government is also funding places to help regions develop national cycleway projects, provide summer work for students and provide specific on-the-job training.

Mrs te Heuheu says for some Pacific youngsters this might be the start they need to get that first job in tough times.

"Everyone has a role to play in battling the problem of youth unemployment. It's especially tough during a recession - and it's not just a problem for the young. It is a problem which needs our help and we all have a part to play.

"Together with my Ministry, I will be out and about promoting these new opportunities to Pacific youth over the coming months. I want to see as many young Pacific people benefiting from this package as possible."

The Minister encourages anyone interested to call 0800 778 008 to find out more about these job opportunities.
