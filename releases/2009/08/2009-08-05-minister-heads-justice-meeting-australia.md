Justice Minister Simon Power left today to attend the two-day Standing Committee of Attorneys-General meeting in Alice Springs, Australia.

The meeting comprises the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, its states and territories, and New Zealand's Minister of Justice. Norfolk Island has observer status.

The meeting provides a forum for ministers to discuss and progress matters of mutual interest, and seeks to achieve uniform or harmonised action in the areas of responsibility of its members. 

Mr Power will deliver a presentation on the Drivers of Crime ministerial meeting he co-hosted with Hon Pita Sharples at Parliament in April. 

"This is a valuable opportunity for us to share with our Australian counterparts our experience in conducting the Drivers of Crime meeting and the outcomes we hope to achieve, and to also learn from their experiences." Mr Power said.
