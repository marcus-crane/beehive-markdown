Prime Minister John Key today announced a package of policies aimed at helping young New Zealanders reach their full potential. 

“The policies I am announcing today build on the Youth Opportunities package and Kiwisport initiatives announced earlier this month,” says Mr Key.

The policies being announced today are in two parts:

- A Break-Away Package for School Holidays which includes a large amount of funding for what will build to be 30,000 places a year in holiday programmes for youth aged 11-17 targeted at deprived communities and families under stress.
- A Fresh Start package for Young Offenders which sets aside funding for military-style activity camps, but also expands Fresh Start to include a range of other funded initiatives.

“The cost of the policies will be $84.55 million over four years,” says Mr Key.

“As Prime Minister, I am determined to ensure our young people have the opportunities they need to deliver on their potential and ambition.

“I want them to have the skills and experiences they require to succeed, to gain productive employment, and to achieve good living standards.

“We owe our young people opportunities to deliver the very best of themselves.  They owe us their very best efforts in return.”
