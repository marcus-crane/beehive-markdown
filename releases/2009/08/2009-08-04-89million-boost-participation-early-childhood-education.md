Minister of Education Anne Tolley and Associate Minister of Education Dr Pita Sharples today announced $8.9 million in grants from the Discretionary Grants Scheme, set up to increase the number of places available in early childhood centres. 

More than 400 new places in early childhood education centres will be available thanks to this newly announced Government funding.

“The grants include more than $5 million for new capital works in Counties Manukau, an area where participation rates are generally lower. Other projects will create 70 places in Samoan immersion centres, a new centre in Arrowtown, and services for Māori, Pasifika and refugee communities.

“Te Taura Hiri i Te Ao Te Kōhanga Reo can now be built, to create 30 new places in south Taranaki; and five other kōhanga reo have grants to plan new buildings or refurbishments, for over 120 mokopuna.

“Planning grants have also been given to projects which include supporting the development for Māori immersion centres, and a Tongan immersion centre.

“This funding directly supports this Government’s priority of increasing participation in early childhood education and care. This funding will open up opportunities for education and increased choices for parents, families and whanau,” the Ministers said.
