A new Prime Minister's Youth Programme and 30,000 extra places on school holiday activity programmes for young people have been announced by the Prime Minister.

The Minister for Social Development and Employment Paula Bennett says the ‘Break Away Package for School Holidays' will capture Kiwi kids for whom options during the holidays are limited.

"Sadly, not all children in New Zealand get interesting and meaningful school holiday options. We know research shows taking part in positive activities can help improve engagement at school and give young people an alternative to risky, antisocial behaviour.

Ms Bennett says there are three aspects to the Break Away Package.

"First, from this summer holiday, 15,000 places on one week camps will be rolled out offering a diverse range of activities, from outdoor activity to drama. This will rise to 30,000 places by next Christmas.

"We will also offer 500 places in Respite Camps for kids who are being cared for by foster parents, extended whanau and grandparents. These camps will be run in the first instance by Te Puna Whaiora Children's Health Camps, with a focus on 5 - 7 year olds.

"The Prime Minister's Youth Programme is particularly exciting. High profile and well respected Kiwis from a variety of fields will act as role-models during the week long programmes. Actor Oscar Kightley, ex All Black Norm Hewitt, NZ Rugby, netball guru Raewyn Henry and hip hop artists Prestige, have all offered their time.

"The programme will reward young people who might have been in trouble with police, but have made a real effort to change their behaviour for the better. The aim of the programme is to put these youngsters in touch with inspiring and motivational leaders - and help them get another view on how their life could be.

"The aim of the Break Away package is to provide simply that. It's a break for disadvantaged kids from their home environment, a break for the caregivers or foster parents of children heading to the Respite Camps and a break from former negative behaviour for kids selected for the Prime Minister's Youth Programme.

"The new initiatives complement the Youth Justice reforms announced earlier this year as part of a broad approach to address at-risk youth," Ms Bennett says.
