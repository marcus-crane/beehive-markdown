There can be no fluffing over of the severe unemployment problem Maori and Pasifika peoples are facing and that should give all of us even more reason to take advantage of the new opportunities that have been created by the Government, Tariana Turia says.

"New Zealand is facing its worst unemployment levels since 1999 and the situation is even worse for Maori and Pasifika peoples, particularly our youth," Mrs Turia said.

"Make no bones about it, this is serious stuff and we must all band together in our drive to keep each other afloat.

"The Government will provide financial assistance to people who are out of work but if we are to survive this recession, then the communities our youth live in must also grab the opportunities that can be created under the recent unemployment youth package that has been announced.

"About 16,900 employment and training opportunities could be created under the youth package - all our communities and youth need to do is step up and say they want to be involved.

Since March, the country's unemployment rate has risen one point to 6% (or 138,000). The rate for Pasifika has almost doubled at 12.8% while that for Maori is fractionally less at 12%. Of all unemployed Maori and Pasifika, the majority are youth (aged 15 to 24).

Mrs Turia acknowledged the leadership many employers were demonstrating in trying to keep jobs open and create viable work options.

Youth and communities wanting to take part in the youth unemployment initiatives should call 0800 778 008 or contact the closest Ministry of Social Development or Te Puni Kokiri office in their area.
