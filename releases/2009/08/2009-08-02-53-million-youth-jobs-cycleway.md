More than $5 million is being allocated to subsidise young people into work on regional projects that will form part of the National Cycleway Project.

Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism John Key announced the funding at the National Party annual conference in Christchurch today.

The Cycleway is one of the Government’s priority areas from the Job Summit.

Mr Key says the goal of the New Zealand Cycleway project is to create a network that links a series of ‘Great Rides’ throughout New Zealand.

He says the $5.3 million will be used to encourage those developing Great Rides to take on and train young people to do the work.

Sixteen to 24 year-olds make up about one-third of all people on an unemployment benefit.

Minister of Social Development Paula Bennett says funding the places will go a long way towards helping the regions get their projects started.

“Putting funding into jobs to develop regional cycleway projects is one of a series of targeted time-limited initiatives we are developing to promote job growth in the regions.

“We estimate that this additional funding will allow the creation of up to 500 subsidised youth work opportunities on cycleway projects,” she says.

The number of places will depend on the number of cycleway projects approved for development, and the number of people who will be required to work on them.

The Government has recently announced seven tracks; the Waikato River Trail, Central North Island Rail Trail, Mount Ruapehu to Wanganui, St James Trail, Hokianga to Opua/Russell, Hauraki Plains Trail and Southland Around the Mountain Rail Trail.

**Questions and answers about the Cycleway**

**What if you can’t find workers for some more isolated areas; will young people be expected to move?**

We don’t expect young people will have to move to isolated locations. This is about gearing up to take advantage of opportunities rather than forcing young people to uproot and move, although if they want to go where there are more opportunities that’s ok.

**What kind of organisations can apply?**

Each local authority will decide how it wants to run the cycleway projects. Some might be done in-house and some contracted out to different types of organisations.

**Who will be eligible?**

Any person aged 16 to 24 who is on an Unemployment Benefit or an Independent Youth Benefit. Young people aged 16 or 17 who are not in work, education or training will also be eligible.

**How will the subsidy work?**

This will depend on how the project is run – if a cycleway is being built by a private sector employer then Job Ops is likely to be the right model. Ifa cycleway is being built by a non-profit organization then Community Max is likely to be the right type of model.

**How will groups building cycleways get involved?**

Groups receiving funding for cycleway projects will be made aware of the scheme through the application and approval process for cycleway funding.

**Contractors working on cycleway projects can call 0800 778 008 to determine their eligibility for assistance.**
