Prime Minister John Key has today announced the development of a new Pacific Business Mentoring Programme to provide practical support for Pacific businesses.

“Many of the Pacific business people I have met recently have told me how useful it would be for them to have greater access to business advice and mentoring from New Zealand.

“This is especially important given the challenging economic climate,” Mr Key says.

“I have asked officials to design a Pacific Business Mentoring Programme that will match selected enterprises with experienced New Zealand mentors.

“I also want to see the creation of a network of local business mentors in Pacific Island countries.

“The programme will help small and medium sized businesses in the Pacific grow by identifying business training needs, creating opportunities for partnerships and joint ventures, and increasing Pacific exports to New Zealand.”

The Prime Minister is currently attending the Pacific Islands Forum in Cairns.

He returns to New Zealand on Friday.
