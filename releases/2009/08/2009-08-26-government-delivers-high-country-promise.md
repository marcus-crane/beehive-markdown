The new direction for Crown pastoral land strikes a balance between economic use and environmental and cultural values, say Agriculture Minister David Carter and Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson.

The Government has today announced a three-prong plan for Crown Pastoral land - effective stewardship of the land, better economic use, and improved relationships with lessees and high country communities.

Following the Crown's decision last week to appeal the Minaret Station rent case, the plan released today confirms the Government's commitment to implementing pastoral lease rents based on the earning capacity of a property.

It also rescinds the previous Government's ‘lakesides' policy, which effectively prevented leasehold properties within five kilometres of lakes from entering into tenure review. Lakeside leases will now be considered on a case-by-case basis, with significant inherent values protected as necessary. 

"Labour's policy was driving more and more land into the DOC estate, with the assumption that the Crown could better look after the land than farming families," says Mr Carter. "This Government's direction will maximise the best conservation and economic gains from each tenure review."

Mr Williamson says the plan recognises the value New Zealanders place on lakesides and landscapes, and promotion of public access to the high country remains part of the tenure review programme.

"Safeguards are in place, including oversight of tenure review funding, to ensure these values are protected by tenure review and pastoral lease management," the Ministers say. 

Further work is underway on the lessee's role in stewardship of pastoral land, including the potential for greater use of covenants, an analysis of the recent report into the high country by the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, and implementing the Government's earnings capacity rent policy.
