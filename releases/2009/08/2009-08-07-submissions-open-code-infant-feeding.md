Public submissions on the Draft Code of Employment Practice on Infant Feeding will be welcomed from today, Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson has announced.

“The purpose of the Code is to provide employers with guidance on how to fulfil their obligations concerning the provision of breastfeeding breaks and facilities under the Employment Relations Act 2000,” Ms Wilkinson says.

The Code includes suggestions about the types of issues that should be considered when negotiating an arrangement for infant feeding with an employee, and determining what arrangement would be reasonable and practicable in the circumstances.

More information can be found on the Department of Labour website at [http://dol.govt.nz/consultation/infant-feeding/index.asp](http://dol.govt.nz/consultation/infant-feeding/index.asp).

Submissions close at 5pm on Monday 7 September.

They can be emailed to [infantfeeding@dol.govt.nz](mailto:infantfeeding@dol.govt.nz) or sent by mail to:
