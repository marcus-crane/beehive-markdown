Extra supply of vaccine has been bought by the Ministry of Health as one of the measures to combat the current measles outbreak.

Cases have been reported in Canterbury and Auckland, and there were cases in Otago earlier in the year.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says, "So far this year New Zealand has had 149 cases of measles, which is more than 10 times the number for all of last year. As well as the 30-thousand plus extra doses of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine the Ministry has already secured, they are sourcing more doses."

"Measles is highly contagious. It's estimated that for every case up to 13 contacts could catch the disease, which is spread by coughing and sneezing. And the consequences can be very serious. Measles can lead to pneumonia, ear infections and, in rare cases, encephalitis (brain infection)." 

The Ministry of Health is advising doctors and practice nurses to contact the families of children aged between 12 months and 12 years who have no record of receiving a dose of the MMR vaccine.

Practices are also being encouraged to immunise opportunistically, and immunise all unimmunised contacts of a measles case.

Adults born after 1969 who have not had the vaccine are also being advised to get vaccinated.

In Canterbury, vaccination for children has been brought forward from the scheduled doses at 15 months and 4 years, to be vaccinated at 12 months and 13 months.
