The Natural Hazards Research Platform, launched today by Minister of Research, Science and Technology Wayne Mapp, breaks new ground in how science research is funded.

"This new Platform means that essential scientific research will benefit from secure long-term funding and a cooperative approach," Dr Mapp said.

"It is a significant step in building New Zealand's science capability. The Government will be investing $140 million over the next 10 years. It is a new way of funding science in New Zealand." 

The new platform is hosted by GNS Science and the National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA). It will potentially include expertise from New Zealand's leading environmental research organisations including the University of Auckland, the University of Canterbury, Massey University and Opus.

The Platform will examine how natural hazards occur, their effects, and how we deal with them. It will involve scientists from a range of fields, including hydrology, seismology and climate.

"This initiative will provide further long-term certainty for our scientists. It will reduce the transaction costs involved in applying for research funding every two or three years.

"This approach avoids duplication and unnecessary contestability. Most importantly, it encourages collaboration. Bringing together our best researchers from different agencies will help maximise the impact from the Government's science investment," he said.
