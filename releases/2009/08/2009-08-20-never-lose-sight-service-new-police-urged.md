Police Minister Judith Collins today urged new police graduates to go the extra mile in serving the public, particularly victims of crime.

Speaking to the graduation ceremony for Wing 258 at the Royal New Zealand Police College at Porirua, Ms Collins said service was at the heart of policing.

"During your career, you will be called on to protect the community from crime, to prevent crime from happening and to help build a better and safer New Zealand," Ms Collins told graduates.

"But at the same time you must never lose sight of the fact that your role is to serve the public. This is particularly important when dealing with the victims of crime.

"Often you will come into contact with people during the most stressful and traumatic times of their lives. The public will be looking to you, as police officers, to go the extra mile providing protection, support and care.

"Any crime, no matter how small, can be devastating for a victim. Your response should always be to act with compassion, professionalism and integrity."

Today's ceremony saw 78 officers join the ranks of the New Zealand police. It was the fifth graduating Wing this year.

Trainees undertake an intensive 19-week course at the college. They will

be posted to frontline roles as they begin a two-year probationary period.
