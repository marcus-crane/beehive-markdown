New Zealand is offering its full support to Tonga as search and rescue efforts continue following an overnight ferry sinking, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.

Mr McCully said Prime Minister John Key had today expressed New Zealand's sympathy and concern to Tonga's Prime Minister Dr Fred Sevele, who is also attending the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders meeting in Cairns, Australia.

"We are deeply concerned about those still missing," said Mr McCully, who is also in Cairns.

"Two New Zealand Airforce Orions are assisting with the search for survivors, and our authorities are in close touch with Tongan officials in case further support is required.

"New Zealand officials will also engage in discussions regarding any support required to maintain interim ferry services following the loss of the vessel."

New Zealand's Rescue Coordination Centre in Wellington is coordinating the search, which is centred about 86km north of Tonga's capital Nuku'alofa.

The ferry, the Princess Ashika, was sailing in the Ha'apai group of islands in northern Tonga when it sank earlier today. An estimated 82 passengers and crew were on board. The cause of the sinking is not yet known.

Rescuers have so far found 56 survivors, and the Orion, a Tongan navy vessel, and other ships are searching the area for those missing, although the exact number of people on the ferry has not been confirmed.

Mr McCully said the rescue conditions were good, and hopes remained high that more survivors would be found.

"The fact that this disaster comes so closer behind the recent sinking in Kiribati in which 33 people lost their lives, is doubly tragic for the Pacific region."

There have been no reports of New Zealand citizens being on board the vessel.
