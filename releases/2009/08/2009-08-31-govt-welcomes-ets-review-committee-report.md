Minister for Climate Change Issues Nick Smith today welcomed the report of the Emissions Trading Scheme Review Committee.

"I would like to thank Chairman Peter Dunne and the other members of the select committee for their hard work on what is an important and complex issue.

"The Majority Report by the ETS Review Committee makes 34 recommendations on broad climate change policy that requires close examination. The Government will be taking time to consider the recommendations before making any announcements.

"With four parties also issuing minority reports clearly there were a range of views expressed. The Government will continue its discussions with all parties to find a way forward that balances our environmental responsibilities and our economic opportunities.

"The Government preference remains an amended ETS. No-one should be surprised at the challenge we face. Other countries are facing similar challenges as well on achieving political consensus to implement an emissions trading scheme.

"It is our ambition is to go to Copenhagen in December with the policy and legislation for our emissions trading scheme settled."
