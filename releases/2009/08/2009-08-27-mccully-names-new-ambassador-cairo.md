New Zealand's next Ambassador to Egypt will be career diplomat Graeme Waters, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"New Zealand greatly values the dialogue we have with Egypt on Middle Eastern and global issues. Egypt plays a vital role in addressing the challenges of the region, and in the ongoing search for a durable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict," Mr McCully said.

"Cairo is New Zealand's newest Embassy in the Middle East and Africa, and there is significant potential for expanding bilateral trade with Egypt in many areas, including education and consultancy services. 

"Egypt has become a significant export market for New Zealand over the past 10 years, primarily for dairy and meat, with exports worth $NZ200 million."

Mr Waters will take up his post next February. His responsibilities will also include representation to the Arab League, the African Union, and Libya.

He has previously served as High Commissioner to New Delhi; Ambassador to Manila, and been posted to Seoul, Rarotonga, and Port Moresby.
