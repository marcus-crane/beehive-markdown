The government has confirmed that a new agency will be established to focus on delivering transport projects and services across Auckland.

Transport Minister Steven Joyce says the new Auckland Transport Agency will replace the current nine separate Auckland transport entities and will be responsible for all local authority transport delivery functions in Auckland, including local roads and public transport.

"Having one Auckland Transport Agency will provide the focus and continuity in decision-making needed to deliver a transport network that supports Auckland's growth and economic success," he says.

"It will be well-placed to make the necessary sequencing decisions between different priorities and ensure regional transport projects are delivered efficiently and effectively."

"The Auckland Council will set the strategic direction, appoint the transport directors, including up to two Councillors, provide planning guidance and determine the levels of regionally sourced funding."

 "This will ensure strong alignment between the Council and the Auckland Transport Agency so investment can be made with confidence to deliver the high performing network that all Aucklanders want."

The governance structure of the Auckland Transport Agency will be incorporated in the third Auckland Governance Bill to be introduced later this year.

The new agency will work closely with and be partly modelled on the NZ Transport Agency which operates at a national level.

The government and the current local authorities together provide about $1.5 billion per annum for Auckland transport. 

Mr Joyce says it is important that expenditure is managed effectively and efficiently.

"The appropriate structure is a quality delivery agency, overseen by the Auckland Council."
