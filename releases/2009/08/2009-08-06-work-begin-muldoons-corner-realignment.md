Work towards the realignment of Muldoon's Corner on the Rimutaka Hill Road has commenced thanks to an additional $142.5 million in funding announced in February as part of the government's Jobs and Growth plan.

Preliminary work is now underway with construction due to begin at the end of the month - 30 months earlier than originally planned.

Transport Minister Steven Joyce says the work will come as a relief to those who travel the dangerous Rimutaka Hill Road.

"The upgrade will ease a number of tight curves, including Muldoon's Corner, about 500m south of the Rimutaka Summit.

"The project will improve safety on a very difficult section of road where currently heavy vehicles travelling in opposite directions are unable to pass each other.

"The Rimutaka Hill Road is the only practical road link to the Wairarapa from Wellington and is vital for both tourism and freight.

"This work will result in improved visibility and increased road widths.

"When construction is in full swing, the $16.5 million project will employ up to 80 people, with many more involved in supplying materials and providing supporting services," says Mr Joyce.

"It is our expectation that the majority of suppliers and subcontractors for this will be regionally based, using a regional workforce and material so local contractors and their communities will benefit from the increase in work," says Mr Joyce.
