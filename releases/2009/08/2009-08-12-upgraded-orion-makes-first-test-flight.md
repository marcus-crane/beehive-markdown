The first of the Air Force's newly upgraded P-3K2 Orion aircraft made its initial test flight yesterday at contractor L-3 Integrated Systems' facility in Greenville, Texas, Defence Minister Wayne Mapp announced today.

"This is an important milestone in a complex project," Dr Mapp said.

"New Zealand is the smallest country in the world to operate the Orion, with its sophisticated airborne maritime surveillance capability. It is among our most advanced defence capabilities.

"The upgrade will greatly increase the capability and versatility of these advanced aircraft.

"The Orions will have much greater ability to deal with contemporary maritime operations. They will now also be properly equipped for overland operations and have greater capability for civil tasks," he said.

This is the first of the six Air Force Orions to be upgraded. The surveillance, reconnaissance, navigation and communication systems have been dramatically improved.

"In addition to the upgrade of surveillance equipment, the flight management systems will now have a new-generation glass cockpit, which will enable the aircraft to maintain pace with civilian flight requirements and legislation."

The remainder of the fleet will be upgraded at the Safe Air facility in Blenheim. The first aircraft of the remaining five is scheduled to be handed over to Safe Air on 26 August.
