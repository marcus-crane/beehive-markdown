Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully and Trade Minister Tim Groser today welcomed the recommendation from the Pacific Island Forum Leaders' meeting that talks on the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER Plus) formally commence.

"New Zealand's special relationship and significant people-to-people links with the Pacific means that PACER Plus will not be a traditional free trade negotiation in which commercial interests alone define our negotiating positions.

"Our objective for PACER Plus is to equip the Pacific to raise standards of living, increase employment opportunities and export capacity, and promote sustainable economic growth by assisting Pacific Island countries to capitalise on potential for trade," said Mr McCully.

"The talks are an important step in achieving the Forum's goal of developing increased economic opportunities.

"But trade access on its own is not enough. We must provide support to the public and private sector alike to ensure Pacific countries can take advantage of the opportunities PACER Plus will offer.

"The Pacific forms a significant part of New Zealand's national identity and a prosperous and sustainable Pacific is clearly in New Zealand's interests," said Mr Groser.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade is calling for public submissions to help shape New Zealand's negotiating mandate for the trade talks.

The public consultation process is ongoing and will provide further opportunities for input and comment on the talks. For more information and to find out how to make a submission on PACER Plus negotiations go to www.mfat.govt.nz.
