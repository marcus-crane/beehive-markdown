Prime Minister John Key has announced that New Zealand will provide a targeted package of assistance to Pacific Island countries to support the region’s development and capitalise on trade opportunities.

“We welcome the launch of PACER Plus negotiations. Trade remains a key driver for economic development in the Pacific and we want to see the Pacific producing and trading more successfully with New Zealand, Australia and other trading partners.”

PACER Plus is an agreement that will allow countries to better withstand external shocks, increase jobs and export capacity, and address the trade imbalance that currently exists between the Pacific and New Zealand.

“It’s important that we ensure all Forum island countries can take full advantage of improved trading arrangements.

“With this in mind, our assistance will focus on three key areas - trade policy and negotiating capacity, trade facilitation, and trade promotion.”

New Zealand will support the establishment of the Office of the Chief Trade Advisor to assist Forum countries to prepare for, and engage in, PACER Plus negotiations through a $1.95 million funding package.

“We are also looking at ways to support business groups and non government organisations to become more closely involved in the development of trade policy in the region.”

New Zealand’s support for vital trade-enhancing activities such as regional biosecurity, customs, and standards and conformance work will also be boosted.

“We are also working closely with Australia to look at ways to promote outward trade from the Pacific with the key emphasis on private sector development and improving networks. 

“These initiatives demonstrate New Zealand’s strong commitment to support sustainable economic growth in the Pacific.”

The Prime Minister is currently attending the Pacific Islands Forum in Cairns and returns to New Zealand tomorrow night.
