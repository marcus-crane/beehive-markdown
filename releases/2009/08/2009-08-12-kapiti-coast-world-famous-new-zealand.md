The Kapiti Coast District Council has become the first local government in the world to gain the International Disability Management Standards Council's Certificate.

They are one of just 30 organisations around the world to pass the rigorous audit process and gain the certification.

Associate ACC Minister Pansy Wong applauded the Kapiti Coast District Council for their dedication to work-place safety.

"Already, the Kapiti Coast enjoys a great reputation both in New Zealand and around the world as a popular place for golfing, camping and fishing and now, with this certification, they have made their way into the record books in terms of their commitment to safe work practices," Mrs Wong says.

By gaining the certification, the Kapiti Coast District Council has attained international best practice for workplace injury prevention and rehabilitation with a return to work focus.

"The social cost to the nation of work-related injury and disease is huge - an estimated $13 billion a year, which equates to more than a billion dollars a month," Mrs Wong says.

"By showing their commitment to reducing workplace accidents and reintegrating injured workers back into the workplace, Kapiti Coast District Council is actively helping to reduce the social cost to New Zealand."
