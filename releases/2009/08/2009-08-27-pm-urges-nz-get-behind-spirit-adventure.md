Prime Minister John Key and Minister of Youth Affairs Paula Bennett have today announced funding for the Spirit of Adventure Trust and urged other New Zealanders to get behind the Kiwi icon as well.

The Trust has been guaranteed funding of $250,000 a year for the next three years in order to carry out critical maintenance.

“The Spirit of New Zealand is a familiar sight in New Zealand waters,” says Mr Key. “Every year over 1,000 young Kiwis set sail on a journey that will change their lives forever.”

Paula Bennett says the Government is right behind the programmes like those offered by the Spirit of Adventure Trust, but she acknowledges the Trust will need ongoing support from the wider community to continue its work.

“We know the extra government funding will help young New Zealanders continue to enjoy the challenges offered by the Spirit of Adventure experience and we hope this will encourage others to contribute to this worthy cause.”

The Spirit of New Zealand sails 340 days per year, and organises its sailing schedule two years ahead.

“In a time when too many young people are lacking direction, programmes like those offered by the Spirit of Adventure help keep our kids on track,” says John Key. 

“This funding will help the Trust and its 200 volunteers continue to make a real difference in the lives of young New Zealanders.”
