Mandatory fortification of folic acid in bread will be deferred until May 2012, with the focus now on introducing a targeted voluntary programme, Minister for Food Safety Kate Wilkinson announced today.

"After reading through each of the 124 submissions, I decided the best way forward was to put the mandatory requirement on hold.

"I agree with public health advocates that folic acid is beneficial to the health of women and can prevent neural tube defects, but I also understand consumers overwhelmingly want to be able to choose whether or not the bread they buy is fortified," Ms Wilkinson says.

"I met with representatives of the baking industry yesterday and they are prepared to develop a voluntary code targeted at increasing women's intake of folic acid, particularly at child-bearing age.

"I intend to convene a meeting with the Paediatric Society and the Bakers' Association in the next month to discuss what bread lines need to be fortified to have the greatest impact. Both have indicated they want to work together.

"This approach will provide for consumer choice while also helping to address folate deficiency and increase the protection for babies resulting from unplanned pregnancies."

Submissions were received from both sides of the debate, with public health advocates primarily in favour of keeping the mandatory standard.

Consumers and industry generally opposed it, preferring it be revoked.  

The necessary amendment to give effect to the decision to defer commencement will be gazetted today.

A range of foods are already fortified with folic acid, including cereals and orange juice. Folate occurs naturally in leafy vegetables such as spinach and other foods such as baked beans.
