The Lottery Grants Board's Community Facilities Committee has granted $500,000 to the Methven District Heritage Association Incorporated for the upgrade of the Mount Hutt Memorial Hall.  
   
Internal Affairs Minister and Lottery Grants Board Chair Nathan Guy says the people of the small Canterbury town of Methven will soon have a more pleasant centre where they can meet as a community and generally enjoy themselves.  
   
"The Community Facilities Committee funds building projects to construct and improve facilities that promote the involvement of people in their community.  
   
"This grant will be used to renovate and extend the Mount Hutt Memorial Hall, which last year was used by 49 groups ranging from the Methven Community Board to the Red Cross Blood Bank to Methven Line Dancing. The town's market day is also held there every month.  
   
"The Committee says the hall upgrade is a great fit with its priority to fund facilities that meet a clearly identified need and providing opportunities for widespread and significant community interaction.  
   
"I am delighted, both as Minister of Internal Affairs and Chair of the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board, to support projects which help build strong communities," said Mr Guy.
