Conservation Minister Tim Groser today announced the start of a review of a range of funds which provide public funding for conservation on private land.

"The review, which was signalled in the Budget, will look at whether public funding for conservation on private land is providing the most effective support for New Zealand's broader conservation effort and is delivering value for money," Mr Groser said.

The review will be carried out by two independent reviewers - Lindsay Gow, who retired recently from the position of deputy secretary for the Ministry for the Environment, and Dr William Lee, who is science leader at Landcare Research.

The review includes the Queen Elizabeth the Second National Trust, the Nature Heritage Fund, Nga Whenua Rahui Fund, Matauranga Maori Fund (Matauranga Kura Taiao Fund), the Biodiversity Condition and Advice Funds and Moutoa Gardens/Pakaitore in Wanganui.

"These funds play an important role in advancing conservation and protecting biodiversity on private land.

"The review will not affect any currently funded projects or applications to the funds which are under consideration.

"The reviewers will report their findings to me by 30 November so that any financial recommendations can be included in Budget 2010."

The terms of reference for the review are available at [www.doc.govt.nz](http://www.doc.govt.nz/).
