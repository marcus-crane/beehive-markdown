Associate Minister of Defence Heather Roy will visit New Zealand Defence Force personnel in theatre for the first time next week when she travels to visit Operation Rata II on deployment in the Solomon Islands.

"Many of these personnel have participated before in operational service, while for others this is their first tour of duty.  When I farewelled them as they deployed from Ohakea in July, I told them I would visit them in theatre," Mrs Roy said.

"Operation Rata II is an impressive combination of regulars and reservists that shows the strength of our Defence Force by working as one - undertaking such duties as ROVE Prison external security, participating in the Quick Response Force, patrolling in a number and variety of settings, deploying to outposts, and providing protection and support to the Participating Police Force operations.

"I am looking forward to this opportunity to visit our troops in the field and spend Wednesday and Thursday in the Solomons before returning to New Zealand on Saturday.

"Each of these servicemen and women is a representative of our country and our reputation.  Without their contribution - and that of the families and whanau serving at home with a gap in their lives while their loved ones are on deployment - many in the Solomon Islands would not be able to live in safety," Mrs Roy said.
