Minister for Arts Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson and Minister of Maori Affairs Dr Pita Sharples today honoured the veterans of New Zealand’s 28th Maori Battalion for their service during the Second World War at a function held in Wellington. 

The veterans were invited to the celebration of the 28th Maori Battalion web site, a joint project developed by Te Puni Kokiri and the Ministry of Culture and Heritage that draws on the rich collections of the National Library of New Zealand.

“The 28th Maori Battalion holds a special place in New Zealand’s culture and history,” Mr Finlayson said.

“Today is a special occasion to honour the 28th Maori Battalion,” said Dr Sharples. “There are only 51 remaining veterans from the 3,600 who served overseas during World War II.”

“This is their gift to their children, and all New Zealanders, who can now learn the remarkable stories of the heroism of the 28th Maori Battalion through this outstanding website.”

The web site tells the stories of the 28th Maori Battalion through pictures, video, audio and the written transcripts of the veterans’ memories.

Registered contributors are encouraged add their own memories to the site.
