Prime Minister John Key is delighted that 72 recipients of the Principal and Distinguished Companions of the New Zealand Order of Merit have decided to take the opportunity to be re-designated as Knights and Dames.

There were 85 New Zealanders eligible to accept a title after The Queen approved the reinstatement of titles to the first two levels of the New Zealand Order of Merit in March.

"This is a real celebration of success and I am very pleased that 87% of those eligible for a title thought so as well.

"When I first decided to bring back titular honours I was confident that many people would embrace the opportunity, but even I am overwhelmed at the large numbers who chose to do so.

"I also respect those who chose not to change their status. This is about people exercising their choice".

The titles will be bestowed at one ceremony at Old St Paul's in Mulgrave Street, Wellington at 3pm on August 14.

"I look forward to congratulating all of our new Knights and Dames at that time."
