The Minister of Māori Affairs, Hon Dr Pita R Sharples, today announced the appointment of Acting Chief Judge Wilson Whare Isaac as the Chief Judge of the Māori Land Court.

"Judge Isaac has been the Deputy Chief Judge and Acting Chief Judge of the Māori Land Court. He has proven leadership, and a breadth of knowledge and experience in dealing with Māori land issues. With his extensive background, I am sure Judge Isaac will make a fine Chief Judge and leader of the Māori Land Court, and I congratulate him on his appointment," said Dr Sharples. 

"Whenua is central to tikanga Māori, so the Māori Land Court is an important judicial institution for all Māori. The bond between people and land is recognised and supported by the Māori Land Court," said Dr Sharples. 

"The Chief Judge of the Māori Land Court plays an important role in ensuring all interested parties can navigate successfully through Māori land issues to support Māori in their retention, utilisation and development of Maōri Land.

"The successful utilisation of Māori Land, in Māori hands, not only benefits Māori land owners and local communities, but also contributes to the success of the New Zealand economy," said Dr Sharples.
