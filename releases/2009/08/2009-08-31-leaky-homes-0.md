Today I met again with the Auckland, Wellington, North Shore, Tauranga, Christchurch and Waitakere Mayors to further our discussions on finding a solution to the leaky homes issue. They represent the six most affected Councils.

The Mayors gave me their views on the options discussed at our earlier meeting. I will relay that information to relevant Ministers for analysis, after which the Government will respond to the Mayors. There will be no further comment until then.
