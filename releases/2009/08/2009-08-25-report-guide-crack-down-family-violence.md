Tariana Turia has welcomed the latest report on family violence, saying it will help guide the work of a new high-level ministerial group formed to address and eliminate family violence.

"The report confirms the grim reality of violence in this country and there can be no fluffing over of that.

"It's now time for us in Government to act - to see what works, what doesn't and what will."

The Ministerial Committee on Family Violence will provide leadership across government to make sure the laws, policies and services are working, Mrs Turia said.

"If the laws, policies and services aren't working, then it will be our job to make sure that changes are made so that they do work.

"Our families must step up to the mark as well because the Government on its own can not eliminate family violence - all of us need to pitch in on this.

"We are very committed to addressing this issue and working with families and communities."

The 288-page Family Violence Statistics Report was compiled by the Families Commission using data from 2000-2006 sourced from a number of Government departments and non-Government agencies that deal directly with victims and perpetrators of family violence.

This is the first time that data from government and non-government agencies dealing directly with victims and perpetrators of family and sexual violence have been brought together. The report does not come with an analysis or recommendations.

"We always knew family violence was a huge problem in this country but the content of this report is very helpful because it will help us pin-point specific areas of concern."

The ministerial committee, which Mrs Turia would chair, is expected to meet within the next four weeks. Other members are the ministers for police, justice, social development and employment, education, housing, health, women's, ethnic, Maori and Pacific affairs.
