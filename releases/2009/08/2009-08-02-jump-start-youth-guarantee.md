The Government will jump-start the first stage of the Youth Guarantee in 2010, a year earlier than originally intended, Tertiary Education Minister Anne Tolley announced today.

"Up to 2000 full-time equivalent student places will be created for the Youth Guarantee in each of the 2010 and 2011 calendar years, at a cost of $52.7 million. The students will be selected from areas of highest need, based on youth unemployment rates and access to suitable vocational training programmes," she says.

"The ultimate aim is to make the scheme available to all 16 and 17 year-olds as funding permits. The decision to fast-forward the Youth Guarantee delivers on the Prime Minister's commitment at the February Job Summit."

National's Youth Guarantee policy aims to keep young people in education who might otherwise be left behind, recognising that some students can be more motivated in non-school settings. It provides free study towards school-level qualifications in settings such as polytechnics, wananga and private training establishments.

"Young people cannot hope to succeed in today's employment market without adequate education - therefore, the Youth Guarantee is a top Government priority," says Mrs Tolley.

"Students taking part will not pay course fees, although they will not be eligible for student loans, like other 16 and 17 year-olds, because we don't want to provide undue incentive for students to leave school. Good pastoral care of students will be a core requirement of the programme, including services tailored towards individual student needs."

Tertiary organisations will be asked to submit applications to the Tertiary Education Commission to deliver the Youth Guarantee. The successful organisations will be announced later this year.

"Youth Guarantee is one of several initiatives the Government is pursuing to expand education and training options for school leaving-age youth," says Mrs Tolley. "For example, we are now considering 11 business cases prepared for trades academies, and funding of $2.6 million has been allocated to establish new service academies, which provide military-focused training at high schools."

**Youth Guarantee - Questions and Answers**

**When will the full Youth Guarantee policy be rolled out?**

This is an early implementation of Youth Guarantee for a limited number of students. The timing of full implementation of the policy will be considered by Ministers later this year.

**What is the Youth Guarantee? Why are we offering the Youth Guarantee?**

The Youth Guarantee is a tertiary education initiative. While many 16 and 17 year olds will continue their education at school, Youth Guarantee recognises that others will be more motivated to achieve qualifications in a tertiary education setting.

Its primary objectives are:

- to increase the educational achievement of 16 and 17 year olds not engaged in education, by providing them with improved access to study towards qualifications at levels 1 to 3 on the National Qualifications Framework in tertiary education.
- to improve transitions between school, tertiary education, and work.

 

**How will Phase One work?**

Phase One of Youth Guarantee will:

- Target those 16 and 17 year olds who would have entered the workforce in the past, but are now unable to find a job;
- Be provided nationwide, with funding allocated in 2010 to selected high performing providers, including institutes of technology and polytechnics, wananga, private training establishments and other tertiary education providers.
- Offer Youth Guarantee students a range of vocationally-focused programmes leading to full qualification linked to Levels 1-3 qualifications on the National Qualifications Framework. The programmes must have embedded literacy and numeracy in the course content; provide clear pathways to higher levels of learning with a range of practical, specific and generic skill development; and be delivered face-to-face. Study programmes must be full time for at least one academic year.
- Ensure young people face similar incentives to access education in either tertiary education or secondary school (i.e they will not be eligible for student loans).

**Will the Youth Guarantee mean that youth cannot access the Independent Youth Benefit if they are not in training?**

The object of this policy has always been that young New Zealanders should be in work or training, not on benefits. The Government will make announcements about how this aspect of the policy will work later in the year, but the intent is that the policy will recognise that some young people have special circumstances and may require support - eg those with disabilities.

**What initiatives are happening in the secondary school area to make schools more responsive to student needs?**

The Ministry of Education has received the 11 business cases prepared for Trades Academies. It is now providing advice to the Minister on the merits of each proposal to support the selection of the final academies, along with the legislative changes and funding arrangements required when trades academies become operational.

The Ministry of Education is also leading work on arrangements for Manukau Institute of Technology's Tertiary High School proposal, which is expected to be operating from February 2010. While similar to Trades Academies, this initiative is on a faster track, and will involve shared funding arrangements between tertiary and schooling funding streams. Legislative change is also required to ensure that under 16 year olds can take part in the programme.

The Government has also committed $2.6 million in additional funding to expand the number of Service Academies throughout the country.

Service Academies are military-focused programmes based in schools where students are less likely to leave school with a qualification. They are aimed at Year 12 and 13 students who want to pursue a career with the New Zealand Defence Force. They include a minimum requirement that students sit and attain level one NCEA maths and English.

**What providers will be eligible for the Youth Guarantee?**

Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics, wananga, private training establishments and Other Training and Education Providers (OTEPs) are all eligible. However, specific eligibility criteria have been developed for Phase One, to ensure organisations are best placed to meet student needs.

Providers will need to have a successful track record of delivering programmes at levels 1-3 to young people, or be able to demonstrate capability to deliver to this age group. They will also need have pastoral care and literacy and numeracy capability and demonstrate capability in catering to the needs of Maori and Pacific students.

**Will there be stricter performance criteria on providers that are given Youth Guarantee slots?**

These outputs will be measured to ensure the programme's desired outcomes are met: retention; successful course completions; and progression in literacy language and numeracy skills as measured by the Adult Literacy and Numeracy Learning Progressions.

**How will the places be allocated across providers? How will you decide which areas have the greatest need for the 2000 places?**

The allocation of places and funding will be based on the numbers of youth unemployed 18-19 year olds in each region. Those areas with highest youth unemployment with receive a greater percentage of places than those areas with low youth unemployment.

**What courses will be eligible for the Youth Guarantee? What are examples of courses that will be offered?**

Vocationally-focused courses linked to Levels 1-3 on the National Qualifications Framework with embedded literacy and numeracy in the course content. Examples include Certificates in carpentry, plumbing and gasfitting, mechanical maintenance, electrical and related trades, trades foundation; office administration and computing; automotive and mechanical engineering; catering and hospitality; rural skills; computing; retail; horticulture, agriculture; and forestry skills.

**Can you guarantee that no fees are charged for the Youth Guarantee?**

The Minister has prescribed that Youth Guarantee programmes will have zero fees.

**What is pastoral care? How will institutions provide this?**

Providers will be expected to have well established facilities and student support services. Pastoral care might include career planning and advice, counselling, an orientation programme, student support services, or a form class especially for Youth Guarantee students.

**Will there be attendance requirements for students?**

Students must be enrolled full time doing a full year's worth of study. There is no set pass requirement, although future allocations will be dependent on provider performance.

**When can students sign up for Youth Guarantee courses?**

From the beginning of 2010, when enrolment begins at tertiary education organisations.

**Could they sign up half way through next year?**

Yes.

**Could a student go to school for half of next year, then leave school and sign up to the Youth Guarantee?**

Yes, if they qualify.

**Do students have to study full time?**

Yes.

**What is the minimum length of courses?**

One full year.

**What career guidance will be provided?**

As part of Youth Guarantee, career guidance will be targeted towards 16 and 17 year olds at risk of disengaging from education either while enrolled in school or not enrolled in any form of education or training.
