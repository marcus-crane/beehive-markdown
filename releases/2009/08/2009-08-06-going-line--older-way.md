The Senior Citizens Minister, John Carter, is praising the latest addition to SeniorNet Learning Centres, which help the over-55's become connected to the net. 

Mr Carter will be at Ruakaka in Northland tomorrow to open the SeniorNet Bream Bay Learning Centre.

"What maybe second nature to younger people can at times be a little daunting for others and these SeniorNet centre's teach the over-55's to embrace advances in computer and information technology, and so I will be delighted to open this latest centre," said Mr Carter.

"As Senior Citizens Minister I recognise technology can help enriching the social lives of the elderly and keep their minds active and alert." 

"Many older people are reluctant to use computers. What they may not appreciate is how much technology can make their day-to-day tasks easier and it can be fun", he said.

"Managing your finances, catching up on missed television shows or storing precious family memories - all these are within reach with a few key strokes and so I endorse these centres for helping make it all achievable," said Mr Carter.

"It's also pleasing to see the enthusiasm generated by the tutors at these learning centres who understand the kind of support that older people need to learn."

"It might mean I receive a lot more e-mails from the older members of the community willing to share their views on the errors of my ways, but I guess that's good for democracy as well," said Mr Carter.
