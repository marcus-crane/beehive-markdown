Associate Minister of Defence Heather Roy was today delighted to attend, and address, a special ceremony at which the medals of New Zealand war hero Brigadier Reginald Miles were donated to the National Army Museum at Waiouru.

"An artillery officer, Brig Miles received 15 decorations - including the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and the Military Cross - and a nomination for the Victoria Cross," Mrs Roy said.

"Remembered as a great leader and soldier, Brig Miles served with distinction in both World Wars - he undertook daring missions, was wounded several times in the line of duty, and was appointed as the first Commander Royal Artillery during WWII.

"Brig Miles' second DSO was awarded after he and two accomplices made a daring escape from a high-security POW camp in Italy and he crossed half of Europe to reach Spain.

"Today's ceremony is the culmination of a decades-long quest by Brig Miles' family to locate, replace and preserve his medals.

"The Government and the New Zealand Defence Force are honoured that the Miles family have generously chosen to donate these medals to the National Army Museum so that New Zealanders now and in the future will be able to recognise and celebrate the bravery of one of our most gallant and illustrious soldiers," Mrs Roy said.
