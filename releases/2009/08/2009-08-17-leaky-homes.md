Today I met with the Mayors of Auckland, Wellington, North Shore, Tauranga, Christchurch and Waitakere to discuss the leaky homes issue. These Mayors represent the six most affected Councils.

The Government is working closely with them on finding a solution to the problem. Any solution will be focussed on fixing damaged homes rather than on litigation.

We have canvassed a number of approaches which the Mayors have gone away to consider.

Until I have received their response there will be no further comment.
