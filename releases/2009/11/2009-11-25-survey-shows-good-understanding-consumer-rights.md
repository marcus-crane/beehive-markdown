Minister of Consumer Affairs Heather Roy today released the National Consumer Survey 2009 - a survey of consumer awareness, experience and perceptions, and consumer legislation conducted from June-August and involving 1,000 face-to-face interviews with New Zealanders aged 18 and over.

"Commissioned by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, the survey asked a range of questions on issues including: participants' understanding of their rights; awareness and use of information sources when in a dispute; how to seek redress; taking action to resolve problems and disputes," Mrs Roy said.

"The survey found New Zealanders to have a fairly good understanding of consumer rights - particularly that they're entitled to have faulty goods repaired, replaced or have their money refunded.  It also showed that most people know to contact the seller when they have a problem and that the seller will usually do something to put it right.

"Consumers are confident their problems will be addressed and dealt with fairly, and are generally aware of services and organisations where they can get consumer advice - particularly the Citizens' Advice Bureau (48 percent) and Consumer NZ (24 percent).  TV shows - ie 'Fair Go' and 'Target' - were also noted as a source of advice by 14 percent of respondents, up from six percent in 2005.

"Interestingly, the main source of advice is family and friends - this is likely to be due to their easy accessibility, trustworthiness, and being an inexpensive source of advice and information.

"The survey results do not raise significant new issues, but they highlight areas to focus on.  This includes extended warranties - which don't offer any greater protection than people already have under the law - and some lack of knowledge of rights under the Consumer Guarantees Act.

"Work is currently underway to simplify consumer law through my 'One Law, One Door project - 'One Law' to review, consolidate and simplify existing legislation to achieve principle-based law covering all trading transactions; and 'One Door' for information on complaints and disputes mechanisms," Mrs Roy said.
