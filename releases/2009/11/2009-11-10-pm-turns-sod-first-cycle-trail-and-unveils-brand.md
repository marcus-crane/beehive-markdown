Prime Minister John Key officially launched construction of the first New Zealand Cycle Trail project at Waipa Domain on the banks of the Waikato River today.

The $3 million to complete these two sections of the Waikato River Trail will be funded from the National Cycle Trail Fund.

Mr Key says: "This 41 kilometre section of the Waikato River Trail is the last section of a 100 kilometre cycle track that will follow the Waikato River, and pass five hydro lakes in some of the most scenic countryside in New Zealand.

"That this project is so advanced already is a credit to the tremendous support from the community, Mighty River Power, and other corporate sponsors. This is fundamental to the ongoing success of cycle trail projects."

The two new sections run from Waipapa Dam to Lake Karapiro, and from Whakamaru to Mangakino and will be completed in time for the Rowing World Cup at Lake Karapiro in October 2010.

"It is exciting to see the first of the seven Quick Start trails underway and to also unveil the National Cycle Trail brand. This will become an immediately recognised symbol for the cycleway all over New Zealand," says Mr Key.

The brand, Nga Haerenga, means ‘the journeys' and will be used in offshore marketing in conjunction with 100% Pure New Zealand and also on track signage.

"Today is an important milestone for the New Zealand Cycle Trail Project."
