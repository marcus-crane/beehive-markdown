Education Minister Anne Tolley and China's Ambassador to New Zealand, Mr Zhang Limin, today signed an education agreement at Parliament which focuses on enhancing education research, science and technology links between New Zealand and China.

The ceremony was witnessed by Chinese Vice Premier Li Keqiang.

"The renewal of this agreement, which has been in place since 2002, reflects the maturity of our education relationship with China," said Mrs Tolley.

"China sees New Zealand as a strategic education partner. This has raised New Zealand's education profile in China, and has improved access for our education institutions to operate in this highly competitive market.

"The renewed agreement goes well beyond student recruitment and brings new directions for cooperation and growth in science and research, research commercialisation, vocational training and private education.

"There is a particular focus on training high-level research talent, with academic research and education exchanges between institutions and agencies."

The signing of the agreement comes a day after China's Vice Premier Li Keqiang formally opened the Confucius Institute at the University of Canterbury.

The institute, the second of its kind in New Zealand, is a partnership with Huazhong University and supports Chinese language learning in the South Island.
