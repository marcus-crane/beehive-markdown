New Zealand is to contribute $420,000 to the World Health Organization (WHO) in support of an H1N1 vaccine roll out in the Asia Pacific region, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.

"New Zealand's donation, which will go towards the purchase of syringes and sharps bins, complements Australia's commitment to donate up to 10 per cent of its H1N1 vaccine stocks to the WHO for use in the Pacific island countries," Mr McCully said.

"Yesterday I met with Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith in the margins of the APEC Ministerial Meeting in Singapore, and we again reinforced our special Trans Tasman ties.

"Collaboration on this issue reflects a shared recognition of the challenges faced by developing countries in responding to pandemics.

"Australia and New Zealand will continue to coordinate closely with the WHO to ensure vaccines reach the people who need them the most.

"New Zealand's contribution to the WHO will come out of a $7.1 million fund that has already been set aside for helping Pacific island nations prepare for a possible pandemic," Mr McCully said.
