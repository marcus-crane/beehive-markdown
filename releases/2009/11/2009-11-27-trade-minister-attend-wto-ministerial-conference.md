Trade Minister Tim Groser will travel to Geneva tomorrow to attend the WTO 7th Ministerial Conference from 30 November - 2 December.   

Mr Groser says this Conference will consider the WTO's contribution to growth, recovery and development in the current global economic environment and discuss the Doha Round of trade talks.

"We are all conscious of the need to continue to build positive momentum towards concluding the Round. This Conference presents several good opportunities to focus on the state of the Doha Round, both during the formal sessions and in bilateral meetings," says Mr Groser.

While in Geneva, Mr Groser will also attend a meeting of the Cairns Group of agricultural countries.
