Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism John Key, has delivered on his promise to increase tourism funding - a move he has long said will help drive New Zealand's recovery from the economic recession.

Cabinet today approved an extra $20 million in funding for tourism in 2009/2010, which will bring this year's annual funding up to $89 million. This will allow Tourism New Zealand (TNZ) to increase our visibility in key markets such as Australia, the United States, and China.

"The increase in funding is something the industry has been waiting for, for many years, and it was one of the priority recommendations of the Job Summit."

Of the $20 million, $5 million will be earmarked for TNZ to carry out joint venture work with the private sector and Regional Tourism Organisations (RTOs).

"Through the 100% Pure NZ campaign TNZ has created a strong, internationally-recognised brand. By combining forces with private sector companies such as airlines and hotels we will increase our ability to turn awareness into arrivals.

"The New Zealand visitor experience is not just about skiing or geysers. The joint venture funding with RTOs gives regions the ability to market themselves as unique while still under the 100% Pure banner.

"Tourism is a substantial and dynamic industry sitting at the forefront of our economy. Its performance ultimately affects the wellbeing of all New Zealanders. A strong tourism brand enhances New Zealand's profile and benefits other exporters.

"This funding is, in my view, an investment that all New Zealanders will reap the rewards from."
