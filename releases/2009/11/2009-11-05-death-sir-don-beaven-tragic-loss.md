Associate Minister of Health, Tariana Turia, has expressed her great sadness at the tragic loss of Sir Don Beaven, Emeritus Professor of the Christchurch School of Medicine, University of Canterbury.

"Sir Don has been the paramount authority on diabetes in New Zealand" said Mrs Turia.   "I met with him just two days ago, in his capacity as co-patron of Diabetes New Zealand.  His enormous enthusiasm was evident to us all - he had a fierce passion for making a difference for the lives of people with diabetes".

"Professor Don, over his lifetime, has received many awards and honors, including as Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit; the New Zealand Commemorative Gold Medal; the Hon Condliffe Memorial Medal; the Sands Memorial Medal, and the Christchurch City Council Greenstone Award, Live Tall".

"And indeed this amazing man lived tall in his lifetime dedication to medicine.  "He had a prestigious career, having been a Fulbright Fellow at Harvard; an Eli Lilly International Fellow; Professor of Medicine at the new Medical School in Christchurch; and Professor Invite in Geneva".

"While he has been devoted to advancing diabetes management in New Zealand, he has also been a New Zealand Diabetes representative to the World Health Organization working parties in Africa, India, and the Pacific and the International Diabetes Foundation for over twenty years".

"His legacy is never better represented than in the over 250 articles and eight books he wrote in the area of clinical medicine and diabetes".

"But it will be his relentless energy and his quick mind that will stay in our minds" said Mrs Turia.  "And while New Zealand mourns the loss of such a distinguished statesman, our heartfelt sympathies are extended to those who miss him most as the head of their family".
