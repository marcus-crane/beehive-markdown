Despite record levels of elective surgery earlier this year, there continues to be strong growth in the number of New Zealanders getting the operations they need.

2,000 more patients received elective surgery in the three months to September 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. That is an increase of over 6% - from 32,300 to 34,300 operations for the September quarter. 

"The previous government effectively cut access to elective surgery because their slow average annual increase of just 1,400 operations didn't keep up with population growth" says Health Minister Tony Ryall. 

The new Government said it would treble that to an average increase of 4,000 elective operations per year. 

"We exceeded that in the year ended June 2009, with a record increase of around 12,000 -the highest increase in our country's history."

"Sustaining this level of delivery is challenge enough, but District Health Boards have now surpassed that with even bigger increases this quarter."

"This is a great achievement because it has been done despite the impact of swine flu and the recession, and with no significant change in the complexity of those operations."

"These results are a tribute to the DHB teams around the New Zealand who are helping to move patients off waiting lists in much greater numbers," says Mr Ryall.
