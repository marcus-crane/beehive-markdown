Trade Minister Tim Groser today welcomed news that the European Union (EU) has removed all remaining export subsidies for dairy products.

Mr Groser says this is a very positive development and is in line with recent market trends.

"International dairy prices have shown a marked improvement across the board in the last three months, reflecting a more positive outlook in international dairy markets.

"In response to this market improvement, the European Union has been gradually scaling back its export subsidies since late October. The removal of remaining export subsidies sends an encouraging message to the international dairy market and I welcome that.

"I will continue to make the point in my international contacts that it is important not to revert to subsidies as a response to market conditions.

"All countries with dairy industries have an interest in a healthy international market. This is a positive development toward that end," Mr Groser said.
