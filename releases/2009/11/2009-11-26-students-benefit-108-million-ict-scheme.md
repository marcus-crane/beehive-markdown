Government is investing $10.8 million in a three-year programme to support teachers to use digital technology to boost student achievement, says Education Minister Anne Tolley.

From next year 257 schools will join this major information and communication technologies (ICT) initiative. 

"The ICT Professional Development programme will benefit students by providing teachers with the skills, knowledge and confidence they need to maximise the benefits of ICT," says Mrs Tolley.

"An increased focus on the effective use of ICT in schools will help to raise achievement levels for students.

"This investment supports the Government's $150 million commitment to make schools broadband ready to ensure our young people are at the centre of a digital world."

Schools will work together on 43 local projects that will support government educational priorities in literacy and numeracy and delivering success for Māori and Pasifika students.

"As the pace of change in the digital world accelerates, schools are putting ICT tools into the hands of students. Learning to use these tools responsibly and appropriately will help New Zealand students take full advantage of the opportunities presented in today's rapidly changing digital world."
