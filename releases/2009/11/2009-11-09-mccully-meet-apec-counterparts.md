Foreign Minister Murray McCully leaves for Singapore tomorrow to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Ministers' meeting.

Mr McCully will join Prime Minister John Key, Trade Minister Tim Groser, and Finance Minister Bill English at a range of APEC meetings in Singapore this week.

"APEC promotes closer trade and economic relationships across the Asia-Pacific region, and a key focus this year will be regional economic integration and encouraging greater cooperation between governments and business," Mr McCully said.

"Foreign Ministers will also discuss non-trade issues such as how we can improve responses to natural disasters and pandemics, and the common threats and challenges we face in the region," Mr McCully said.
