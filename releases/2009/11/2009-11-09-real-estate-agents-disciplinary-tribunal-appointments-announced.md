Retired District Court Judge Michael Hobbs has been appointed to chair the new Real Estate Agents Disciplinary Tribunal, Justice Minister Simon Power announced today.

The Disciplinary Tribunal was established under the Real Estate Agents Act 2008, which significantly reforms the regulation of the real estate industry.  The Act outlines the tribunal's functions, and sets down the basis on which charges are laid. The tribunal will become operational from 17 November.

"Mr Hobbs had a distinguished career on the District Court Bench, and his standing and experience will be invaluable in establishing the tribunal," Mr Power said.

Michael Hobbs was admitted to the Bar in 1956 and was a partner in Hobbs and Corbett before serving as a Stipendiary Magistrate in Fiji from 1968 to 1970, and in Wellington from 1970 to 1980.  He was appointed a District Court Judge in 1980 and retired from the Bench in 1989.  He has held several acting warrants since that time.  He is chairperson and mediator for Moss Brothers Limited.

Four members have also been appointed to the Real Estate Agents Disciplinary Tribunal.  They are:

- Mary Peters - an Auckland-based barrister whose areas of expertise include commercial, company and property law, trust disputes and by advising on trade practice issues.
- Garry Denley - a company manager from North Shore who has a long association with the real estate industry and is also an arbitrator and mediator.
- John Gaukrodger - a former partner of KPMG who is now a Hamilton-based company director.
- Jennifer Robson - a current Tenancy Tribunal Adjudicator from Palmerston North who has wide experience in serving on a number of industry-focused disciplinary tribunals.

"I'm confident these people not only bring to the tribunal a high level of expertise in their particular fields, but collectively provide an excellent balance of experience in law, commerce, and consumer rights, as well as the real estate industry," Mr Power said.
