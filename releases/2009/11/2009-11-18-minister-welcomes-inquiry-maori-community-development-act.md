Māori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples welcomes the [Inquiry](http://ourhouse.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/SC/About/Media/4/0/e/00SCMA_MediaRelease20090731_1-Inquiry-into-the-operation-of-the-Maori.htm) into the operation of the Māori Community Development Act 1962, and the [Terms of Reference](http://ourhouse.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/SC/About/Media/2/f/2/00SCMA_MediaRelease20091029_1-Submissions-called-for-on-inquiry-into.htm) recently released by the Māori Affairs Select Committee.

 "I thank the Committee for their commitment to inquiring into this Act. An Act that was put in place in a time when government policy towards Māori was very different from today." said Dr Sharples.

"I am pleased to see that as part of the inquiry the Committee will seek opportunities to improve the ability of the New Zealand Māori Council and its subsidiary bodies, and Māori Wardens, to undertake the important work they do with Māori communities.  To that end I'm happy to advise that the Māori Wardens now number around 700, an increase of 200 in just over two years. This demonstrates a phase of tremendous growth and effort in the last couple of years and I'd like to acknowledge that."

 "I encourage all those who have an interest in Māori community development, particularly those who are working at a community level, to share their views and experiences with the Committee as they undertake their inquiry. "

The closing date for submissions is Friday, 12 February 2010.
