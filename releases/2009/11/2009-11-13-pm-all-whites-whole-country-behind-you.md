Prime Minister John Key is wishing Ryan Nelsen and his All Whites all the best when they play for a place in the football World Cup finals tomorrow.

Mr Key will be at the APEC Leaders meeting in Singapore when the All Whites play but he will be cheering them on in spirit.

"I'll be getting updates about the game as soon as I can and I'm sure there will be a lot of New Zealanders in Singapore watching the game on television," Mr Key says.

"Qualifying for the World Cup would be a huge achievement and something for the team, and all New Zealanders, to be extremely proud of."

"I wish coach Ricki Herbert, captain Ryan Nelsen and the guys good luck - go out there and give it your best, New Zealand will be right behind you."

The last World Cup the All Whites qualified for was in 1982, and their final qualifying match was played in Singapore.

If they qualify, the All Whites will represent New Zealand at the next World Cup finals in South Africa in 2010.
