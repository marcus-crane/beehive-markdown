Pacific Island Affairs Minister Georgina te Heuheu today described the revised Pasifika Education Plan 2009-2012 as a key stepping stone to raise Pacific education results.

"Along with young Maori, Pacific young people are our future workforce," she told those gathered at the Cook Island Community Centre in Flaxmere, Hawke's Bay, for the launch of the plan.

"It is critical that we have a coherent and effective approach for Pacific students from early childhood to tertiary education.

"This plan has a vision that the education system must work for Pacific students so that they gain the knowledge and skills they need to thrive, excel and contribute to the overall economy and social wellbeing of New Zealand."

The plan was revised to include the Government's key education goals of national standards in literacy and numeracy and a need to respect and value Pacific language and culture in schools.

The plan's goals and actions focus on the Government's priorities for Pacific education, Mrs te Heuheu said.

"We want everyone in the education sector to concentrate on what will make the most difference for Pacific students.  That involves building strong learning foundations, lifting Pacific literacy and numeracy and increasing the number of Pacific students achieving school level qualifications.

"I am also pleased to see a strong emphasis on acknowledging culture and identity. It is identity which binds Pacific communities together, strengthening and affirming New Zealand as a Pacific nation.

 "Over the last two decades we have seen enormous progress in the achievements of young Pacific people from early childhood education through to tertiary qualifications, skills, professions and business.

"But now we need to urgently build on that platform to ensure that all Pacific children have the chance for success in their education and their future.

"That's why the launch today of the Pasifika Education Plan is so important."
