Commerce and Justice Minister Simon Power is in Australia this week for talks with his Australian counterparts.

His main focus will be New Zealand's commitment to the ongoing development of the trans-Tasman single economic market agenda.

The visit reflects the new intensity and renewed focus on the trans-Tasman bond that Prime Ministers John Key and Kevin Rudd signalled when they met in August.

"There is a high level of shared political commitment to accelerating the pace of achieving a single economic market," Mr Power said.

"It will provide greater opportunities for our businesses to grow and respond to global opportunities and challenges.

"I will be working very closely with my counterparts in Australia to ensure we make progress on achieving the short and medium-term outcomes that both governments have identified."

Mr Power will also meet Australian ministers on justice issues.

He leaves today and returns on Thursday.
