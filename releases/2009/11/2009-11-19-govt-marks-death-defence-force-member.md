Defence Minister Wayne Mapp and Associate Defence Minister Heather Roy today extended the Government's deepest sympathies to the wife and family of Air Force Flight Sergeant Andrew Forster, killed in a routine explosive ordnance demolition task at Waiouru this morning.

"The accident was a shock for the New Zealand Defence Force and the wider community.  Their thoughts, and ours, are with Flight Sergeant Forster's family," Dr Mapp and Mrs Roy said.

"This is a tragic day.  Flight Sergeant Forster's death will sadden every member of the NZDF.  This accident is a reminder of the dangers that NZDF personnel face regularly.  They are brave people who demonstrate the highest levels of commitment every day," Dr Mapp said.

"Even more tragic than this loss to the NZDF is the loss to Flight Sergeant Forster's family.  Today's tragedy is a salient reminder that NZDF personnel risk their lives for their country every day, both at home and abroad," Mrs Roy said.

"We offer the most sincere sympathies of the Government, and our personal condolences to Flight Sergeant Forster's wife and three children. Our thoughts are very much with you at this time of bereavement," the Ministers said.
