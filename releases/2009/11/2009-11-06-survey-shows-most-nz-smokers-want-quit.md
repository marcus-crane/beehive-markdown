The *2008 New Zealand Tobacco Use Survey: Quitting Results* published today shows overwhelmingly most smokers want to quit, Associate Minister of Health Hon Tariana Turia said.

Minister Turia said that helping smokers to quit was a priority for the Government and was one of the six health targets.

This report presents the quitting results of 15 to 64 year olds from the *2008 New Zealand Tobacco Use Survey*, including where possible, in comparison with the previous survey (2006).

"What is really striking is that 80 percent of smokers said they regretted started to smoke and if they had their time over again they would not smoke," she said.

The results showed Māori who smoked, and smokers living in the most deprived areas, were more likely than others to be receiving help from health care workers.

"This is positive but there is still a great deal more work needed to get Māori smoking rates down," Mrs Turia said.

The results also showed 40 percent of those who had recently tried to quit said they found cigarette and tobacco displays in dairies, petrol stations, supermarkets and convenience stores made it more difficult to quit.

"This confirms what international and domestic research has concluded that retail tobacco displays play a role in normalising tobacco as a product, and in promoting impulse purchases," Mrs Turia said.

"With 5000 New Zealanders dying each year from a smoking-related illness, we need to ensure people get the help they need to quit and stay smokefree," Mrs Turia said.
