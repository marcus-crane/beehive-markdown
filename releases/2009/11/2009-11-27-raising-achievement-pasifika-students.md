Education Minister Anne Tolley says the revised Pasifika Education Plan 2009-2012, which was launched today, will focus on raising achievement among Pasifika students.

 "In virtually all areas, Pasifika participation and achievement in education is growing, and that bodes well for the future of Pasifika communities. But there is a lot more work to be done," says Mrs Tolley.

The Plan was launched in Flaxmere by Pacific Island Affairs Minister Georgina te Heuheu on behalf of the Education Minister.  

"We asked for the Pasifika Education Plan to be revised, to concentrate on those areas which will make the greatest difference for students," says Mrs Tolley.

"The revised Plan incorporates key Government initiatives such as National Standards in literacy and numeracy, which will help to raise achievement in reading, writing and maths. 

"There is also a strong emphasis on the need for schools to promote and respect all Pasifika languages, cultures and identities."

Pasifika people make up 7.2% (or 302,000) of the New Zealand population.  That proportion is expected to increase to nearly 10% in 2026.  Most of the Pasifika population is concentrated in the Auckland region with a significant majority in Counties Manukau. 

"The Pasifika population is young, diverse, and growing quickly. This means that Pasifika success is critical to New Zealand's success."

The revised Plan concentrates on areas with high Pasifika populations and will focus on:

- participation and quality in early childhood education;
- strong literacy and numeracy foundations in schooling, and making sure students are engaged in learning;
- more effective engagement with parents; and
- transitioning students into higher levels of learning and achievement in tertiary education.

"Teachers, school leaders, parents and students themselves all have a part to play. The key to educational success for Pasifika students is everyone working together. "
