Education Minister Anne Tolley has today announced additional funding of $29.8 million for new buildings at 27 schools across New Zealand.

"This funding will give a significant boost to schools, and builds on our Budget commitment to enhance school property," said Mrs Tolley.

"I am delighted these schools will be able to start work on important building projects, giving them the opportunity to meet the needs of their growing rolls and upgrade their facilities."

Seventeen schools will be funded for new buildings under the School Property Guide allocation. This funding, often used for libraries and administration blocks, is in addition to each school's five year agreement budget to modernise and upgrade existing buildings.

Ten schools will receive funding under the Replacement Buildings Programme, which replaces existing buildings that are no longer economical to upgrade.

"Today's announcement follows a $41 million property funding boost to eighty-one schools earlier in the year as part of the government's infrastructure package, and shows we are serious about investing in this country's schools," said Mrs Tolley.

Schools are selected for funding through a ranking system, depending on their need for additional space and on building issues.
