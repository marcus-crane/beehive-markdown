Social Development and Employment Minister Paula Bennett has confirmed Ms Diana Crossan in the role of Retirement Commissioner until January 2013. 

Ms Bennett says Ms Crossan has developed valuable networks across both the state and private sectors and within international financial literacy circles.

"Ms Crossan's reappointment means she'll be able to carry on implementing the national strategy to lift New Zealanders' financial literacy and continue the valuable work she is leading within the OECD to find the best ways of measuring the effectiveness of financial education.

"Ms Crossan is also well-placed to work with the financial services sector and the Government to help Kiwis understand how to get good financial advice and how to better recognise sound financial products."

Ms Bennett says Ms Crossan will deliver her second three-yearly review of New Zealand's retirement income policy at the end of 2010.

The Retirement Commission's goal is for New Zealanders to be financially sorted.  It works to ensure New Zealand has a financially educated population, a trusted financial services sector, and stable and effective government policy so people can plan their retirement income with some certainty.

More than a third of New Zealanders have used the Retirement Commission's Sorted booklets and website which provide free, independent information on money matters for all stages of life.

Ms Crossan was originally appointed in February 2003.
