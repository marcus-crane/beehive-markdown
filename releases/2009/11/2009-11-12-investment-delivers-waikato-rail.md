The Waikato rail network is set to be the first to benefit from new track maintenance equipment coming into service, Transport Minister Steven Joyce has announced.

Mr Joyce was in Hamilton to mark the first use of KiwiRail's new equipment. The specialist equipment is part of a $25 million KiwiRail project to improve the tools available to maintain the country's track network.

"This equipment will be put to work on key freight routes, beginning with the East Coast Main Trunk Line," says Mr Joyce.

"Not only will it maintain the condition of the track to a higher standard at a reduced cost, it will improve performance by enabling more consistent and higher speeds on the network." 

The new equipment will complement other rail improvement work in the region. Environment Waikato recently confirmed the final allocation of $13 million of Joint Officials Group funding for rail will be spent on improving the capacity, reliability and safety of the network.

Work will include level crossing upgrades and initiatives to encourage use of rail including improvements to the Te Rapa container transfer site.

Freight carried across all transport modes is set to increase by 75 percent over the next 25 years, and rail will play an important role.

"More than 900 freight trains cross the country each week, and a huge amount of this is moved within this area between Hamilton, the Bay of Plenty and Auckland," says Mr Joyce.

"A rail network that operates in a robust and commerical manner and is able to respond to the increasing demands to carry the goods and people that drive our economy is an essential part of the mix. This equipment is a positive step towards ensuring this happens."
