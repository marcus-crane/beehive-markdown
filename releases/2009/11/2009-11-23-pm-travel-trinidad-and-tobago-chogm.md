Prime Minister John Key will leave for Trinidad and Tobago on Wednesday for the biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting.

The 2009 CHOGM, to be held in the capital, Port of Spain, from 27 to 29 November, comes as the Commonwealth celebrates its 60th anniversary year. 

"Sixty years after the landmark London Declaration that established its modern foundations, the Commonwealth remains one of the most important multilateral organisations on the world stage," Mr Key says.

"The Commonwealth is a unique organisation encompassing two billion people from a range of nationalities, faiths, and cultures who are united by a commitment to the principles of democracy, human rights, and good governance.

"This meeting is an important opportunity to take stock of the Commonwealth's achievements over the past 60 years and to discuss ways to ensure its continued relevance in the 21st century."

The Prime Minister will also be having bilateral meetings with a number of Commonwealth leaders.

Mr Key returns to New Zealand on 2 December.
