From tomorrow the public will see how their DHBs are performing.

The first quarterly results of the Government's new health targets will be published in table form, in newspapers and on the Ministry of Health website. 

Health Minister Tony Ryall says, "The public want accountability from DHBs, and people are entitled to know how well their health services are delivering."

"Public scrutiny helps improve performance and accountability. That is why, for the first time, we are letting people know how their DHBs are doing in key areas." 

"These tables provide measures to focus boards, managers and health staff on improving performance in these priority areas." 

Three targets focus on hospital performance:

- Shorter stays in Emergency Departments
- Improved access to Elective Surgery, and
- Shorter waits for Cancer Treatment Radiotherapy.

The other three targets focus on preventive measures:

- Increased Immunisation
- Better help for Smokers to Quit, and
- Better Diabetes and Cardiovascular Services.

"We worked closely with health professionals to provide measures  that are useful and appropriate."

Targets information is also being published on the Ministry of Health website, [www.moh.govt.nz](https://webmail.ministers.govt.nz/OWA/redir.aspx?C=3c55fd3aecd340d498ac7d4c4b63322d&URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.moh.govt.nz%2F)
