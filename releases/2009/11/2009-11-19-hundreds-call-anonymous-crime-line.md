Police Minister Judith Collins today hailed the success of the Crimestoppers initiative which has received hundreds of calls from the public since it was launched last month.

Crimestoppers NZ gives New Zealanders an avenue to anonymously pass on information about crime and criminals to law enforcement agencies.

It has received around 630 calls, of which 243 were described as actionable by police. The main crime reported through the Crimestoppers line was supply and distribution of drugs. Other crimes reported were theft (including burglary and fraud), information on wanted persons and sexual offences.

"While Crimestoppers is an independent charity and not part of the Police or government, I am delighted that New Zealanders are taking full advantage of the Crimestoppers crime line," Ms Collins said.

"As it has done so successfully in many countries overseas, Crimestoppers provides a safe, anonymous channel by which people can speak out and speak the truth. The information provided will help Police solve crime faster and more effectively.

"It is already exceeding expectations and I hope that all New Zealanders will recognise the value of this service in making New Zealand a better and safer place."

Of the calls received by Crimestoppers in New Zealand, 79 percent were from the North island and 21 percent from the South Island. Roughly half of all North Island calls came from Auckland while half of the South Island calls came from Christchurch.

With the upcoming White Ribbon Day (25 November) raising awareness of family violence, Crimestoppers provided a safe way for people to report violence in the home, Ms Collins said.

The Crimestoppers line is 0800 555 111. An online encrypted message form is available at [www.crimestoppers-nz.org](http://www.crimestoppers-nz.org/)
