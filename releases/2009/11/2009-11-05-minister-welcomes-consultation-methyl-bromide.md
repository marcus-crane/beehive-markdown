Minister for the Environment Nick Smith today welcomed the decision by Environmental Risk Management Authority New Zealand (ERMA) to seek public submissions on its reassessment of fumigant methyl bromide.

"This is an important opportunity for the public to have their say on the use of methyl bromide," Dr Smith said. "This chemical is ozone depleting, is a greenhouse gas and has been the subject of concerns over public health. However, it is also very important to exports of logs and timber in meeting biosecurity requirements.

"I have a particular interest in this review as the MP for Nelson where its use has been controversial and I was part of the Select Committee that recommended such a reassessment in 2006.

"The strength of this review of methyl bromide's use is that it is thorough, technically focused, and open to public submissions. I encourage all those who have been part of this debate from both an industry and health perspective to have their say."
