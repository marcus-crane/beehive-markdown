Twenty five groups supporting positive parenting are to receive more than $810,000, says Social Development and Employment Minister Paula Bennett.

For the first time the Ministry of Social Development's SKIP (Strategies with Kids, Information for Parents) will fund local projects for three years. 

"The SKIP Local Initiatives Fund (LIF) supports communities to explore new ways to promote positive parenting, including practical tips on how to deal with the special challenges small children can bring," says Paula Bennett.

"The new three year funding was made available to community development projects that have already delivered three or more successful SKIP Local Initiatives. A longer funding period will allow them to show an ongoing commitment to the parents they work with.

"Seven successful initiatives will receive the new three year funding, allowing them to continue to meet local parents' needs through to 2012.

"Another 18 initiatives will also be funded for the next 18 months resulting in over $815,545 being invested in local parenting projects.

"This means parents from Doubtless Bay to Invercargill will be able to access a range of positive parenting events including workshops, shows and courses that will build the skills and confidence of parents of under-5s," says Paula Bennett. 

One initiative to receive three-year funding is Auckland Women's Centre (AWC). The funding will allow AWC to continue working with young parents through mentoring programmes and peer support.  The young mums involved in the parenting initiative say are more confident parents and this has helped improve their relationships with their children.

 "The next SKIP funding round closes in March 2010 and is open to organisations working to support parents to do the best job they can," says Ms Bennett.

$8.25 million has been distributed through the Local Initiatives Fund to community organisations who are making parenting less stressful since SKIP began in 2004.
