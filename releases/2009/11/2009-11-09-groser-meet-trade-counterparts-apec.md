Trade Minister Tim Groser will meet with his trade counterparts in Singapore this week at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting.

Mr Groser leaves tomorrow to join the Prime Minister John Key, along with the Foreign Minister Murray McCully, and Finance Minister Bill English at the annual meeting.

"APEC Trade Ministers will focus on future trade and investment opportunities, improving the business environment and ways to integrate and manage supply chains.

"APEC is also an opportunity for New Zealand to reaffirm the importance of concluding the WTO Doha Round of trade talks and avoiding protectionist measures as the region prepares for economic recovery.

"The Director General of the WTO, Pascal Lamy, is expected to attend to discuss progress in the Doha Round with Ministers.

"New Zealand will also confirm the importance of achieving progress on climate change at Copenhagen and beyond, including profiling New Zealand's Global Alliance research initiative," Mr Groser said.

Following APEC Mr Groser will travel to Copenhagen for a ministerial climate change meeting.
