The Government will consider the 2025 Taskforce's recommendations and make practical decisions about them, Finance Minister Bill English says.

"The Taskforce's report issued today raises some interesting ideas and challenges, which will hopefully generate constructive debate about options for improving New Zealand's economic performance.

"Having steered the economy through the recession in better shape than many had predicted, the Government is now focused on getting a step change in New Zealand's economic performance over the next three to five years.

"We must consider a range of options if we are to get the investment, economic growth and new jobs needed for that to happen.

"Having said that, this Government is pragmatic. And any decisions about key economic policies must meet the tests of fairness and equity.

"Where we specifically campaigned on doing certain things, we're not going to break our word."

Mr English notes that the 2025 Taskforce is one of several review groups that have already reported to the Government or will report back in the next month or so. The others cover regulatory responsibility, taxation, infrastructure and capital markets.

"As with the 2025 Taskforce, they have all gone about their work in a transparent way and encouraged public input," Mr English says. "The Government welcomes their contribution to policy debate.

"We will consider their ideas - and others - over coming months as we work towards making decisions for Budget 2010 and beyond."
