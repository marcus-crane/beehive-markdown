The government has finalised a consultation process it will be following for the review of Schedule 4 of the Crown Minerals Act.

Energy and Resources Minister, Gerry Brownlee, has announced a discussion document on the proposed changes will be released in February next year to be followed by a six week public consultation period.

"Officials from the Ministry of Economic Development and Department of Conservation have been meeting regularly. The government is satisfied cautious progress is being made on the analysis of mineral potential of conservation and Schedule 4 land," said Mr Brownlee.

"The review is generating plenty of debate.  As Minister of Energy and Resources, and in conjunction with the Minister of Conservation, I will be releasing a public discussion paper with proposed options in February and then allow a six week period for public submissions and feedback," he said.

A final paper seeking policy approvals would go to Cabinet by June of next year," said Mr Brownlee.

In August 2009 the Minister of Energy and Resources and the Minister of Conservation started the review.  Conservation areas listed in Schedule 4 of the Crown Minerals Act 1991 are closed to mining access (except underground mining that does not disturb the land surface).

"Work is currently underway on assessing the mineral and conservation value of the various areas.  These will be identified in the discussion document as well as any proposed changes to Schedule 4," said Mr Brownlee.
