The government has moved to correct an anomaly in civil aviation law which has meant that Australian-licensed airlines operating in the New Zealand domestic market have not paid the passenger safety levy.

The passenger safety levy is currently paid by all New Zealand-based airlines to the Civil Aviation Authority, which provides regulatory and safety oversight.

The change means that from 4 December this year, Australian safety-certified airlines operating within New Zealand will pay an additional $1.66 per passenger for each leg flown.

This is 83 percent of that paid by New Zealand operators, recognising the fact that the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority is not solely responsible for direct regulatory oversight of these airlines.

In practice, this change will only affect JetStar.

Transport Minister Steven Joyce says this will create a level playing field by ensuring all airlines contribute to domestic aviation safety.

"There is a possibility of a similar issue arising in relation to international operators of ANZA airlines.  Officials are working through those issues carefully and will advise me if any further regulation is required in relation to those operators."
