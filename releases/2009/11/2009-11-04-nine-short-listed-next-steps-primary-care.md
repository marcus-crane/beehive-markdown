Nine primary health care provider groups have been chosen to move through to the next stage of development in implementing the Government's *better, sooner, more* *convenient* primary health care says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

The Ministry of Health recently called for expressions of interest (EOI) from primary health care providers ready and able to deliver large scale changes to the way they deliver health care.  More than 70 EOIs were received and nine have been selected to develop more detailed plans outlining their proposed changes.

"We need to keep New Zealanders well and out of hospital" says Mr Ryall "and we need to make the system work better so that Kiwis can get faster, more convenient health care that is closer to home."

The Health Minister says the nine proposals moving to the next stage include the development of Integrated Family Health Centres (IFHCs), more nurse-led services including a greater role for nurse practitioners, the development of more multi-disciplinary teams and greater cooperation with hospitals. 

"Integrated Family Health Centres enable people to go to one location and, for example, maybe see a GP or nurse without an appointment, have a blood test or an X-ray, see a physiotherapist, have a first specialist assessment, or visit a pharmacy for their prescription, even have minor surgery - all in the same building." 

The Health Minister says the proposals also include fewer primary health organisations (PHOs), meaning more resources moving to the front-line.

"There were many good EOIs and I encourage all who are not on the short list to discuss their plans with their local DHBs to see whether they can be developed locally."

Mr Ryall says the Government also plans to provide a $500,000 fund as dollar for dollar seeding money for feasibility studies to support small general practices to consolidate into Integrated Family Health Centres (IFHCs) if they want to. More details will be released soon.

The nine successful EOI proposals now going to business case stage:

\- **Canterbury Clinical Network** - a consortium of PHC providers covering half a million people.  The proposal focuses on evolving general practice into IFHCs, developing the wider team of primary health care professionals and improving cooperation between primary and secondary care.

\- **Greater Auckland Integrated Health Network** -  a consortium of 274 general practice teams, 11 PHOs and 3 DHBs delivering primary health care to a million Aucklanders. The consortium is committed to working together to achieve better health outcomes, better patient experience and better use of money, establishing up to 12 IFHCs over the next three years..

\- **Health+ Alliance PHO** - three Pacific PHOs providing primary care services at 17 clinics. The proposal highlights new opportunities for Pacific primary care to better coordinate its services and workforce regionally and to build critical mass for the Pacific sector, including three IFHCs.

\- **Kawerau PHO** - All 3 PHOs in the Eastern Bay of Plenty, merging into one PHO. They propose one Integrated Family Health Centre in Whakatane within the next three years and two smaller Whanau Ora Centres in Opotiki and Kawerau.

\- **MidCentral PHOs** - all four MidCentral PHOs (Otaki, Horowhenua, Manawatu and Tararua). They propose five Integrated Family Health Centres (IFHCs), collaboration across health and social organisations, mainstream and Iwi providers, more clinical leadership, management of long term conditions, focus on care of the elderly, care of the young and care of those with mental health issues.

\- **Midland Network** - 11 providers from Taranaki, Waikato, Tairawhiti and Lakes districts which cover an enrolled regional population of around half a million people. The proposal identifies consolidating $66 million worth of services that are currently purchased and managed by four of the Midland region's DHBs and their provider arms that could be devolved into the community. Also developing 9 IFHCs.

\- **National Maori PHO Coalition** - 11 PHOs from around the North Island. The proposal aims to devolve services and government-held resources to Maori communities.  The Coalition aims to develop a national network of Whānau Ora models of care including IFHCs, new care pathways, health and social service integration.  

\- **Wairarapa Community PHO** - A partnership of Wairarapa organisations, including the seven GP practices, the primary health care nurses group, Wairarapa Hospital clinicians and iwi providers. It is clinically led, and aims to establish the Wairarapa Integrated Family Health Model of care as an integrated health system for Wairarapa people.

\- **West Coast PHO** - The proposal is centred around Integrated Family Health Centres, workforce retention and devolution of suitable hospital based/DHB owned services. The proposal aims to build on existing initiatives including: nurse-led clinics; the PHO Long Term Conditions programme; rural/generalist and rural immersion programmes for Doctors; Clinical and Rural Nurse Specialists.

Successful proposers have until February 2010 to develop Business Cases. Approved business cases will then progress to implementation.
