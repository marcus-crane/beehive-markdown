Defence Minister Wayne Mapp is on his way to Canada for a formal bilateral Defence visit and a Research, Science and Technology visit.

Dr Mapp will also attend the first Halifax International Security Forum in Halifax, Nova Scotia this weekend. The Halifax Forum, a conference seeking new thinking and solutions on regional and global security issues, will also be attended by US Secretary of Defence Robert Gates.

"Canada and New Zealand have a close and friendly bilateral Defence relationship. Our shared Defence traditions and our joint Commonwealth heritage underpin our common values," the Minister said. 

"The two countries also have a very healthy relationship in science and technology collaboration. An important objective for me in this visit will be to build on this relationship in areas of mutual interest." 

Dr Mapp will return to New Zealand on Sunday 29 November.
