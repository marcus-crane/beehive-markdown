People interested in the adventure tourism industry are being asked for their views on its safety and risk management practices as part of a nationwide review, says Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson.

The review was announced in September by Prime Minister John Key and is being led by the Department of Labour.

Ms Wilkinson says the review team has prepared two questionnaires - one for outdoor and commercial sector operators, associations and organisations, and another for individuals.

"Feedback from the questionnaires will complement the review's first interim report - a stocktake on the current situation - which I hope to receive before Christmas.

"These questionnaires provide an opportunity for those interested in the outcome of this review to have their say.

"People from around the world come to experience the adrenalin rush that our outdoor adventure activities provide and we want to ensure our industry is among the best and safest in the world."

The questionnaires can be downloaded from the Department of Labour's website at [http://www.dol.govt.nz/consultation/index.asp](http://www.dol.govt.nz/consultation/index.asp)

Completed questionnnaires need to be received by 5pm on 16 December. They can be e-mailed to [AOCSreview@dol.govt.nz](mailto:AOCSreview@dol.govt.nz) or posted to David Mulholland, Project Manager, Workplace Health and Safety Policy, Department of Labour, PO Box 3705, Wellington.
