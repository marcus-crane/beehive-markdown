After the government's first year in office Energy and Resources Minister, Gerry Brownlee, says he is pleased with the roll-out of energy efficiency initiatives.

"The government is interested in offering practical energy efficiency programmes which not only help New Zealanders save on power and fuel bills but also reduce energy demand.

"The very popular home insulation scheme, *Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart*, is not only providing warmer, drier, healthier homes but is also creating energy savings," said Mr Brownlee.

*Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart* has already given assistance to over 14,000 houses in its first three months of operation.

"The new public information campaign which recently started screening on TV, The Energy Spot, is giving practical advice on how to save power at home and when driving a car.

"I encourage people to watch the latest series, which is offering tips on how to make sure your car and driving habits are fuel efficient," said Mr Brownlee.

"Most households can easily save 10% on their electricity bills by taking a few simple steps highlighted in the episodes. That works out to savings of about $200 per household, or about $320 million in savings each year across the whole country", said Mr Brownlee.

"We've also rolled out a series of other policies which focus on creating the right incentives for New Zealanders to use energy wisely", said Mr Brownlee.

These policies include removing Road User Charges for electric vehicles as well as $1000 grants for people to install solar hot water heaters. Since November 2008, 1863 solar grants have been given out.

"The Energy Efficency and Conservation Authority also has a range of programmes designed to show businesses how to make energy savings, such as the energy audit programme and the successful Tourism Energy Efficiency pilot programme", he said.

"Furthermore, we are rolling out a programme to continue to improve the energy performance of our products and appliances through Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS), energy labels, and independent information.

"We have already tightened the regulations for set top boxes, commercial chillers, external power supplies, refrigerators and freezers, close control air conditioners (for computer rooms)," said Mr Brownlee.

The government is also supporting the "Right Light" campaign, an awareness campaign on savings which can be made if consumers make a choice to switch to energy efficient light bulbs.

"As I identified early in the year, the NZ Energy Strategy document is being updated," said Mr Brownlee.

"Energy efficiency is going to be a part of the new Strategy. The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy document is also being updated and will continue to remain a separate document but very much linked to the government's overall Energy Strategy", he said.

"Overall the government holds a very strong interest in the efficient use of energy and in the 12 months since coming into office it has a long list of achievements.

"We want to make sure the public and business know that energy efficiency can produce material gains for them - and it's easy!" said Mr Brownlee.
