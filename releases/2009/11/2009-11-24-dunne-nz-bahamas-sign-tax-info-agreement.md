New Zealand has signed a Tax Information Exchange Agreement (TIEA) with the Bahamas, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne announced today.

"TIEAs are bilateral treaties that provide for full exchange of information on civil and criminal tax matters between two countries," Mr Dunne said.

"I welcome the signing of the latest TIEA, which brings to nine the number of such agreements that New Zealand has entered into this year.

"A great many TIEAs have been signed all over the world this year, as offshore financial centres seek to achieve a sufficient number of them to meet OECD standards for transparency and information exchange.

"The new TIEA will come into force once New Zealand and the Bahamas have each given legal effect to it," Mr Dunne said.

The text of the agreement, signed last week, is available at www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz.
