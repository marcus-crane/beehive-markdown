Associate Minister of Education Heather Roy today announced the appointment of the Gifted & Talented Advisory Committee which will provide advice on education tailored to gifted and talented students and to strengthen partnerships across the Education sector in New Zealand.

"While the Education Ministry previously had an advisory group, this new committee consists of representatives from across the sector.  It will look at new and innovative thinking, and some members have recent experience of excellent initiatives currently operating overseas," Mrs Roy said.

"This committee provides a forum for sector representatives to engage on the future direction of gifted and talented education - the key outcomes being to improve support for gifted and talented education, and to improve outcomes for all gifted and talented students," she said.

"A 2008 Education Review Office (ERO) report identified that most schools lacked programmes to match students' gifts and talents or, where appropriate, across a variety of curriculum areas.  Most provide only for academically gifted students, while some had no provision at all.  Government is committed to initiatives to enhance provisions for gifted and talented students including:

\* Calling for proposals for the provision of Gifted & Talented professional services in 2010.

\* Providing curriculum-based learning programmes that respond to students' gifts, and which support teachers and schools.

\* Designing services to be culturally responsive and aligned with Ka Hikitia and the Pasifika Education Plan.

\* Exploring ways to utilise information technology to strengthen links between students, parents and private providers.

\* Refreshing the current information website, Te Kete Ipurangi (TKI).

"As a nation, it is vital that we recognise achievement and provide positive encouragement to our gifted and talented students - whether in academic, artistic, or sporting fields," Mrs Roy said.
