A report on the value of increased pasture renewal shows that a further $1.6 billion could be injected into farmer incomes and the New Zealand economy, Agriculture Minister David Carter said today.

Launching the report commissioned by the Pasture Renewal Charitable Trust, Mr Carter said that pasture renewal could unlock significant growth in primary sector productivity.

"Pasture is what all our dairying, beef and sheep farms are based on. It is a multi-billion dollar ‘crop' that has the potential to be even greater.

"I congratulate the Trust on initiating this work which spells out the economic benefits of investing in pasture development and concludes that farm-gate value could jump by 16.4 percent a year.

"New Zealand has its sights set on increasing agricultural productivity to meet global consumer demand and it is gains like these that we need to reach our goal.

"The rates of pasture renewal have traditionally stayed low because farmers have lacked information about the benefits. This report fills the important gaps, and will help the Trust promote the advantages of developing good quality pasture," Mr Carter said.
