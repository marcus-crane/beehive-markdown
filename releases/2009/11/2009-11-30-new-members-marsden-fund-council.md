Two distinguished researchers have been appointed to the Marsden Fund Council.  They are Victoria University Professors James Belich and Timothy Naish.

In addition to the new appointments, Professor Roger Morris of Massey University has been reappointed.  All three appointments are for three years.

"These highly-regarded researchers will make significant contributions to the work of the Marsden Fund Council," said Research, Science and Technology Minister Wayne Mapp. "I have every confidence that they will provide first-class guidance for the Marsden Fund."

The new members replace Professor Lydia Wevers of Victoria University and Dr Rupert Sutherland of GNS Science, who were not available for reappointment. 

The Council comprises 10 eminent researchers - a Chair and nine convenors.  Each convenor heads a panel in their own academic field, assessing research funding applications.

The Marsden Fund was established in 1994 to fund high-quality fundamental research. It is administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand and receives $47 million a year in funding.
