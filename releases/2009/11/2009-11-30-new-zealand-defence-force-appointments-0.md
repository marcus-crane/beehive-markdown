The Chief of Defence Force, Lieutenant General Jerry Mateparae, and the Chief of Air Force, Air Vice Marshal Graham Lintott, have been reappointed for a further year from 1 May 2010. Their current terms of office end on 30 April 2010.

Announcing the appointments, Defence Minister Wayne Mapp said that both officers had shown outstanding leadership and management skills in their roles.

"The Defence White Paper is scheduled for publication on 30 March next year. Its release will herald a landmark period of decision-making. The Government will be setting out the direction and purpose of the Defence Force for the coming decades.  

"This will be a challenging time. The years of experience both officers have in these positions will be invaluable in implementing the decisions which will be made," Dr Mapp said.

"Lieutenant General Mateparae has led the Defence Force since May 2006. During this period there has been a very high operational tempo and several major acquisition programmes in progress.

"His operational leadership is exceptionally well-regarded and he is highly respected throughout the Defence Force. He has contributed fully to Defence Review 09. Within the Defence Force he has done much to retain and improve capability and simplify support for the three Services and operations," he said. 

"Air Vice Marshal Lintott has led the Air Force during the same period. Under his direction the Air Force has met the challenges of our operational commitments at a very high level. He has a strong focus on innovation and is well respected by Air Force personnel at all levels, particularly for his inclusive approach.

"I congratulate them both, and look forward to working with them through to 2011," the Minister said.
