Prime Minister John Key says tonight's historic win by the All Whites has the whole country cheering.

"I wish I was there to celebrate with you, but rest assured I will be raising a toast to you from APEC in Singapore," Mr Key says.

The All Whites beat Bahrain one nil in Wellington tonight, qualifying for the FIFA World Cup finals in South Africa in 2010 - something they have not achieved since 1982.

"This is the chance we have been waiting more than 20 years for. It is a credit to Ryan Nelsen and his team that tonight they have rekindled New Zealand's passion for ‘The beautiful game'.

"Ricki Herbert must be elated that all these years of hard work have delivered such a coveted opportunity.

"Enjoy your well-deserved victory - we are all celebrating with you."
