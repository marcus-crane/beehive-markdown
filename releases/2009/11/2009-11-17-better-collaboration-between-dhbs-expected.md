The Government has today announced new appointments to four District Health Boards as part of its plan to strengthen DHB collaboration and add financial expertise.

The Health Minister, Tony Ryall says, "Having dual appointees on neighbouring boards will help to break down silo thinking and assist DHBs to have a better knowledge of each others' services and issues."

From January, Dr David Warburton, currently Deputy Chair of Whanganui DHB is appointed to Palmerston North's MidCentral DHB, and Mr Phil Sunderland, currently a member of MidCentral, is appointed to the Whanganui District Health Board. Mr Sunderland will also become Chair of Mid-Central at the same time, following the statutory retirement of current chair Mr Ian Wilson.

Mr Keith Hindle, a Hutt Valley DHB member since 2003 has been appointed to Capital and Coast DHB. Ms Debbie Chin, a Wellington resident and former Deputy Director-General of Health, has been appointed to Hutt Valley DHB and as a Crown Monitor to Capital and Coast DHB.

"DHBs across the country have responsibility for overseeing budgets from $100 million to over $1 billion a year. They also have in total around $160 million of unfunded services (DHB deficits) inherited from the last Government."

"The Ministry of Health advises that only around 10% of Board members have specific financial expertise. The Government will not forcibly merge DHBs, however we need them to work a lot more closely together, and cross-board appointments will help achieve that," says Mr Ryall. 

The appointments to Hutt Valley and Capital and Coast will take affect next week.
