Tertiary Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced that 12 polytechnics and institutes of technology are to provide up to 700 new student places following an $8 million funding boost.

"This additional funding for 2010, part of the Government's Youth Opportunities package, will help these institutions cope with forecast enrolment growth," said Mrs Tolley.

"At a time of limited opportunities, this will enable more young people to access meaningful education and training."

The funding was allocated to the polytechnics by the Tertiary Education Commission, based on their performance in delivering education and training to students under 25, and students at higher levels of training.

"This represents an important step in delivering this Government's election commitment to introduce a performance-linked funding system," said Mrs Tolley.
