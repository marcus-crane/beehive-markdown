Associate Health Minister, Jonathan Coleman will lead a small New Zealand delegation to the Commonwealth Fund's 2009 International Health Symposium from 4 - 6 November in Washington DC.

The symposium brings together health ministers, key health reform advisors, senior policy leaders, CEOs of the health systems of all the participating countries and researchers from 11 OECD countries. Key attendees will include Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.K. Secretary of State for Health, Andy Burnham.

In 1997, New Zealand was one of an early group of 7 countries participating in international comparisons of health sector performance. Interest in this useful work has grown and there are now 11 countries involved.

"This is the 12th symposium hosted by the Commonwealth Fund, a U.S. based research organisation which specialises in examining high performing health systems. 

"The focus of the symposium is on strengthening primary health care, an area of priority for this government," says Dr Coleman.

"It is an opportunity to discuss evidence on health system performance, reflect on practical lessons that might be valuable for New Zealand, and talk frankly with Ministers and senior officials about initiatives that improve patients' experience of health care."
