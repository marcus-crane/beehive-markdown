Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson says the introduction of the National Multiple-Use Approval service meets the Government's promise to cut red tape and to reduce compliance costs in the building sector.

From 1 February 2010, volume builders will benefit from the new service that is designed to fast-track the building consent process, and to reduce delays and costs.  Where the same design will be built several times, the National Multiple-Use Approval Service will provide ‘pre-approval' for Building Code compliance.

"Volume builders will no longer need to get each design approved by dozens of councils.  This will save time and will lead to cost savings that can be passed onto consumers.  The establishment of the National Multiple-Use Approval service delivers on the Government's promise to improve the efficiency of the building sector.  It is part of a package of initiatives, which also includes the review of the Building Act 2004, currently underway", Mr Williamson says.

Thousands of buildings every year are built by volume builders, such as suppliers of kitset homes or standardised buildings and garages.  The National Multiple-Use Approval service means they will be able to get their designs ‘pre-approved' for compliance with the Building Code by the Department of Building and Housing.  Then the local council will only have to check site-specific conditions before issuing a building consent.  Where a National Multiple-Use Approval is used, councils will have to decide on building consents within 10 working days, instead of the usual 20 days.

"I encourage all volume builders to consider applying for a National Multiple-Use Approval as soon as the service opens in February 2010.  Having your designs pre-approved for Building Code compliance will provide your customers with a streamlined consenting process and will give you a marketing edge in these challenging economic times", Mr Williamson says.
