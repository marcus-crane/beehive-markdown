A further 2,000 places have been confirmed today on the Job Ops scheme, says the Social Development and Employment Minister Paula Bennett.

Job Ops creates work opportunities for young people with low or no skills who are trying to elbow their way into a tight labour market.

Paula Bennett says the scheme to date has been a runaway success.

"Since the Job Ops and Community Max programmes were launched in August these two programmes alone have created more than 4,000 employment opportunities for young people.

"Job Ops creates a 6 month work opportunity for an unemployed young person. In return, the employer receives a $5000 subsidy from the Government.  This money is being well spent. We're investing in a programme which is delivering concrete, tangible results.

"That's why I'm announcing a further 2,000 Job Ops places, in addition to the 4,000 announced in August.  The Government has set aside $8.9m to fund this increase.

"Youth unemployment numbers have stabilised to just under 19,500. That's down to the success of Job Ops and the real difference it's making.

"I also know however, we're entering what's going to be a tough time of year. It'll also be tough for tertiary students who are looking for summer work. Jobs are sparse and competition is high. There'll be thousands of students who need work to help finance their studies for the coming year.

"There are more than 160,000 students registered with Student Job Search.  That's a 60% increase on the same time last year.

"We want to help them - that's why we're investing nearly $1 million in a campaign with Student Job Search to target businesses and individuals. We believe there are still jobs that need doing, and SJS can help connect people with the right student for them.

"It could be anything from participating in the great Spring Clean campaign, to getting a student to help build your website and attract more customers to your business.

"We believe we can increase those opportunities for students this summer by investing in this campaign," Paula Bennett says.
