Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce today announced Mr Jack Matthews as a further member of the board of Crown Fibre Holdings. Crown Fibre Holdings is the Crown-owned company established to manage the government's $1.5 billion investment in ultra-fast broadband infrastructure over the next ten years.

Mr Matthews is Chief Executive of Sydney-based Fairfax Digital, which manages all online media, including TradeMe, for the group. Prior to this he was involved in a number of online ventures in Japan and the United States.

US born with New Zealand citizenship, Mr Matthews was also the driving force behind the roll out of Saturn's (now TelstraClear's) hybrid fibre-coax cable network in Wellington and Christchurch.

"Mr Matthews brings an end-user focus and a strategic understanding of digital media to the board," said Mr Joyce. "His expertise will be a welcome complement to the commercial and technical skills this board currently provides."

Mr Matthews joins the five existing board members Mr Simon Allen (Chair), Mr Andrew Body, Ms Miriam Dean QC, Dr Murray Milner, and Keith Tempest for a three-year appointment.
