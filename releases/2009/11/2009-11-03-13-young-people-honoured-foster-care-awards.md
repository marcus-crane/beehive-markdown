A group of young people in foster care will today receive awards celebrating their achievements.

Run by Child Youth and Family, the William Wallace Awards are a result of a bequest made by William Wallace and into their fourth year.

The 13 young winners will receive between $1000 - $2000 each to go towards tertiary, vocational or leadership training.

Minister for Social Development and Employment Paula Bennett will present the awards at Parliament today.

"It's always wonderful to celebrate the success of our young people. It's especially wonderful to see young people who have had a tough start in life come through and truly shine.

"These young people have achieved remarkable success in their studies, sports or the arts," Paula Bennett says.

Helping to celebrate that success at Parliament today will be two Kiwi legends - rugby league star Stacey Jones and former Split Enz member Mike Chunn.

The ceremony is being held during Foster Care Awareness week, which runs through to the 7th of November.

"It's important to note the achievements of these young people are also a reflection of the commitment of their caregivers, who make a huge difference in providing foster children with care and nurture, and help turn their lives around. A big thank you has to go to our foster carers," says Paula Bennett.
