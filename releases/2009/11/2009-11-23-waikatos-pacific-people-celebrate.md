Hundreds of Pacific people gathered in Hamilton on Saturday to celebrate the diversity of Waikato's Pacific heritage and hear Pacific Island Affairs Minister Georgina te Heuheu open the inaugural Waikato Nesian Festival.

The Minister said the Waikato Pacific community was borne out of the wishes of Pacific families who came to New Zealand in the 50s and 60s seeking access to a better future for their children and grandchildren.

As part of a community development project funded by the Department of Internal Affairs, the Pacific communities of Waikato identified three key areas relevant to community development and engagement: a Pacific community facility/centre, a pan-Pacific early childhood centre and an annual Pacific cultural festival.

The festival, where local Pacific community groups showcased their talents while visitors enjoyed the Pacific food and handcrafts, was the first of those milestones.

Mrs te Heuheu said the festival with a theme of Celebrating Our Diverse Pacific Heritage, was a fitting celebration of the decision of families to come to New Zealand to make their home and contribute to building the nation. She was privileged to be with them to celebrate.

"In a global environment that is facing many challenges, preserving unique values and culture is critical.  Engendering a sense of belonging and connectedness is an important facet of such gatherings.

"Pacific languages are clearly a key part of our diversity and central to keeping the Pacific heritage alive in Aotearoa. The New Zealand-born Pacific population is growing and brings a unique multi-ethnic influence to our identity. 

"We must support them to thrive and excel - as the future of our communities and of New Zealand. "

Waikato is home to around 11,000 Pacific people from the islands of the South Pacific.  Together with 76,500 Tainui and Maori who are also people of the Pacific, that was a significant population of Polynesian descent living in the Waikato.
