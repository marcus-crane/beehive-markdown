Internal Affairs Minister Nathan Guy delivered a key note address to the New Zealand's Asia-Pacific Lottery Association's conference in Auckland today. 

The Association represents 11 countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including Japan, Thailand and India, and is one of five regional associations of the World Lottery Association.

Mr Guy says the Lottery Grants Board pumps millions of dollars into local communities each year, with the past financial year bringing in bumper profits to distribute among New Zealanders.

Mr Guy says the conference is a great opportunity to showcase New Zealand's community grants scheme to leading international organisations. 

"Our state-owned lotteries are set up to directly benefit communities. The profits from the New Zealand Lotteries Commission are distributed to New Zealanders through the Lottery Grants Boards.

 "It's great to be able to demonstrate to other nations how good our lotteries system is.  Some of our top-notch athletes benefit from lotteries funding and some of our smallest community organisations are able to use the cash to deliver vital services.

"During these tough economic times, lottery grants are a huge reassurance to so many people who might otherwise experience sources of funding drying up."

Mr Guy says he hopes conference delegates will come away with fresh ideas for lotteries.

"New games, changing audiences and different challenges are emerging all the time. New Zealand needs to stay on the ball to ensure our lotteries remain world-class."
