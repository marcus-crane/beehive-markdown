Police Minister Judith Collins is in Australia this week to discuss drugs strategies with her Australian counterparts.

Ms Collins will attend the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy in Canberra on Friday 27 November.

The Council determines policies and programmes intended to reduce harm from illegal drugs in Australia.

Ms Collins' attendance reflects a determination by the New Zealand Government to reduce the use and trafficking of illegal drugs, particularly methamphetamine.

"The Australian and New Zealand governments share a commitment to reducing drug use and the significant downstream impacts on our countries," Ms Collins said.

"This conference will be an opportunity to exchange ideas, learn more about successful strategies and look at ways we can work in partnership to tackle this growing problem."

Ms Collins returns on Saturday.
