Prime Minister John Key has announced that Prince William will visit New Zealand in January.

Prince William will represent the Queen at the opening of the Supreme Court building in Wellington on Monday 18 January.

Prime Minister John Key says this will be Prince William's first official visit overseas.

Prince William will be in New Zealand from 17-19 January and will visit Auckland and Wellington.

The Prince last visited New Zealand in 2005 when he followed the British Lions' rugby tour.

Details of his programme will be available closer to the visit.

Following his visit to New Zealand Prince William will pay an unofficial visit to Australia, his first to the country since he was nine months old when he accompanied the Prince and Princess of Wales on their official tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1983.
