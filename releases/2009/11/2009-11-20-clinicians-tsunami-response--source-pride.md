Clinicians who responded to a call for volunteers to go to Samoa to help the tsunami response were honoured at a dinner attended by Pacific Island Affairs Minister Georgina te Heuheu in Auckland tonight.

Mrs te Heuheu said when Health Minister Tony Ryall called for volunteers, 815 health professionals offered to go. At the peak of the emergency New Zealand had more than 50 health professionals providing wound care, infection control, surgery, trauma and grief counselling.

"The response from you, as dedicated health professionals has been a source of great pride to us all.  You responded without hesitation at a time of great loss and grief," she said.

The dinner was to acknowledge the clinicians efforts, on behalf of the Pacific peoples in New Zealand, the Pasifika Medical Association and the Ministry of Health's Chief Advisor and his Pacific team.

Mrs te Heuheu said a debrief earlier in the day provided an opportunity for reflection, to share experiences and wisdom that will strengthen future emergency support.  She thanked the Pacific Medical Association for facilitating this discussion with over 60 participants. 

"The ties that bind our countries are strong and precious.

"The tragic events which flowed from the earthquake and tsunami are indelibly etched in our minds and hearts - along with the compassionate and dedicated service we witnessed from you and your colleagues in Samoa's moment of need."

Mrs te Heuheu said as Minister of Pacific Island Affairs she was privileged to have the opportunity to say thank you on behalf of the Government.
