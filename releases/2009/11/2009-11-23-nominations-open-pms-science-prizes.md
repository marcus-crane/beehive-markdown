Nominations are now open for three of the inaugural Prime Minister's Science Prizes.

"These prizes will celebrate the cream of this country's scientific talent," Minister of Research, Science and Technology Wayne Mapp said.

 "New Zealand has outstanding scientists and science teachers. They are making a valuable contribution to the nation's economic, environmental and social wellbeing. These prizes will lift the profile of science and illustrate the vital role it plays in all walks of life."

Five prizes worth a total of $1 million will be awarded annually, with the 2009 winners to be presented with their prizes early in 2010.  Dr Mapp said the major prize, the Prime Minister's Prize for Science, will become one of New Zealand's most prestigious awards.

Each award recipient will receive a trophy and prize money. The prizes are:

- Prime Minister's Prize for Science ($100,000 to the winner and $400,000 for their research)
- Prime Minister's MacDiarmid Emerging Scientist ($50,000 and $100,000 for their research)
- Prime Minister's Science Teacher Prize ($50,000 to the winner and $100,000 to their school)
- Prime Minister's Future Scientist Prize ($50,000 to the winner)
- Prime Minister's Science Media Communication Prize ($150,000 to cover the costs of a series of secondments for the winner to media organisations).

Nominations close on 18 December for three of the prizes - the Prize for Science, the Science Teacher Prize and the Science Media Communication Prize.

The 2009 winners of the Prime Minister's Future Scientist Prize and MacDiarmid Emerging Scientist will be based on existing awards, the nominations for which have already closed.
