Corrections Minister Judith Collins today presented the Minister's Excellence Award to Shanis Williams - the first Probation Officer to receive the Award.

The Minister established the award this year to recognise outstanding achievement among graduates of the Department's Initial Training Course. The award has been extended to Probation Officers who had completed their curriculum.

"Probation Officers manage offenders on community-based sentences and have a key role in bringing about, and encouraging positive change in offenders' lives. They ensure the orders of the courts are carried out and help offenders reintegrate into society.

"It is not an easy job, and one that is often under-recognised by the wider community. This award is just one way to acknowledge the important part Probation Officers play in the justice system.'

The award was presented at the first Probation Officer graduation today. Previously, probation officers have not formally marked the end of their training.

The winner of the Minister's Excellence Award, Miss Williams showed a strong understanding of procedures, was skilled at making effective decisions on offender management and developed good rapport with difficult offenders during her training.

She currently serves as a Probation Officer at the Panmure Service Centre in Auckland.

Twenty probation officers from around the North Island and Nelson attended today's graduation ceremony in Auckland.

The graduation comes at the end of the initial six months' training. However, Probation Officers must complete a further two years' training on the job.
