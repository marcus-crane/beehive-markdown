Revenue Minister Peter Dunne is encouraging employers to offer their staff the chance to donate to charities through the new payroll giving scheme.

"I'd really encourage employers to offer this initiative as it provides a simple and easy way for their staff to be able to give to a chosen charity or cause," Mr Dunne said.

The new scheme takes effect from 7 January next year. Employers simply deduct any donations from workers' pay, reduce their PAYE tax by the appropriate tax credit, and send donations to the chosen organisations.

"It would be a great way to start the New Year, and it is a win-win for all involved.'' he said.

"It's really convenient for workers, is low-cost and effective for charities, and helps employers and their staff become more engaged with the community.

"The scheme's also a real bonus for staff as they get the tax credit when they make the donation, so they don't have to keep receipts or wait for the end of the tax year."

This month employers throughout the country have been receiving information from Inland Revenue on the voluntary scheme and how it works.

Mr Dunne said that the scheme will be available to all employers who file their employer monthly schedules electronically.

"For employers who don't already file electronically, this is a great opportunity for them to start thinking about making life easier by using e-filing," he said.
