Trade Minister Tim Groser has welcomed today's announcements by President Obama and US Trade Representative Ron Kirk that the United States intends to proceed with the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).

"President Obama's positive comments on US commitment to the region and the regional trade agenda are welcomed by New Zealand.

"Today's announcements bring New Zealand's long-held goal of a free trade deal with the United States a step closer.

"This is very good news for New Zealand companies looking to expand future business links with the United States.

"But the Trans-Pacific negotiation is even more important as a potential pathfinder for a future regional trade deal such as a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific.

"New Zealand negotiators will shortly meet counterparts from other Trans-Pacific Partnership countries to move ahead with plans for getting the negotiation under way," Mr Groser said.
