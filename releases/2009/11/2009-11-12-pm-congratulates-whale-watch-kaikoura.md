Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism, John Key says Whale Watch Kaikoura's latest tourism achievement will have positive spin offs for all tourism operators in New Zealand.

Whale Watch Kaikoura has been named overall winner of the Virgin Holidays Responsible Tourism Awards.

The winners are chosen after tourists nominate companies in the travel industry that make a significant commitment to the culture and economies of local communities and a positive contribution to biodiversity conservation.

"I would like to congratulate Whale Watch Kaikoura CEO, Kauahi Ngapora, and his team for their outstanding contribution to New Zealand tourism," says Mr Key.

"When I visited their operation last week I was extremely impressed at the truly professional way this venture was run - and I was amazed by the whale watching experience.

"This company has what it takes. Through sheer hard work, the collaboration of the whole community, and the cultural links of Ngati Kuri, Whale Watch Kaikoura has elevated itself to one of the best tourism attractions in the world.

"I am very proud of their achievements."
