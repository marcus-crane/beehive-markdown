Health Minister Tony Ryall has announced the make up of the Shared Services Establishment Board, which will help reduce the cost of DHB back office functions with estimated savings of up to $700 million.

Mr Ryall says, "That money will be crucial to help us maintain and improve frontline services over the next few years. Extra money in health will be limited for several years as we deal with the consequences of the current financial situation."

"The Shared Services Establishment Board will be chaired by Mr Michael Cashin, who is currently chair of Wellington Waterfront Ltd. Previous appointments include chair of Housing New Zealand, and the former State-Owned Enterprise, At Work Insurance Limited."

The other members of the Establishment Board are:

- Ms Paula Rebstock, Deputy Chair of NZ Railways Corporation, former Chair of the Commerce Commission
- Dr Lester Levy, a medical practitioner with extensive experience in management and governance in both the private and public health sectors, chair of Waitemata DHB
- Mr Brent Esler, Chief Executive of Combined Rural Traders Society Christchurch
- Ms Chris Lowry, nurse and hospital General Manager experience, including responsibility for organisational development and patient safety.

"This is a strong board containing real expertise and experience in improving back office efficiency, such as in payroll systems and procurement."

"The members will be focusing on stopping duplication and waste caused by DHBs reinventing the wheel 21 times. All savings will go back into frontline health services."
