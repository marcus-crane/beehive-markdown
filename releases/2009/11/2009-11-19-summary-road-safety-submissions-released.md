Transport Minister Steven Joyce has today released a summary of the more than 1,500 submissions received as part of a wide-ranging review of road safety.

Issues around alcohol and drugs and younger drivers drew the greatest level of comment, with older drivers and heavy vehicles being the least commented on areas.

Mr Joyce says the feedback received from road users will be used to develop the national road safety strategy for the next ten years. 

"It will be important though, that legislative or rule changes resulting from this exercise are backed up by evidence.  My focus is on implementing initiatives that will actually change behaviour and, ultimately, reduce the road toll.

"We need to be sure that the Safer Journeys strategy identifies the right mix of actions for improving our road safety record.

"I am very grateful to the many hundreds of New Zealanders who took the time to share their views.  Their input will play an important role in determining the shape of the strategy," says Mr Joyce.

The new road safety strategy will be released early next year, with legislative and rule changes introduced over the coming years.
