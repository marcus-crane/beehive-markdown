White Ribbon Day is a reminder we all need to take action against violence toward women, says the Minister for Social Development and Employment.

Paula Bennett is urging New Zealanders from all walks of life to show they don't condone or tolerate violence against women or children.

"The abuse of our mothers, aunts, sisters and daughters affects all layers of New Zealand society.

"White Ribbon Day, the 25th of November, is a chance for all of us - most particularly men - to stand up and say "It's Not OK".

"In an ideal world, this would happen every day. The more we can do to draw attention to this noxious, behind-doors problem, the better chance we have of saving women from it. It's simply shameful an average of 14 women are killed by a member of their family in New Zealand each year.

"I will be wearing a white ribbon tomorrow. I hope thousands will join me.

"White Ribbon Day helps pull this issue out into the open. It's time we took a good look at what's happening in our communities and stop the mental, physical and sexual abuse of women.

"Get involved. If you know or suspect something isn't right, you must have the courage to do something about it. Only then will we start tackling this problem," Paula Bennett says.
