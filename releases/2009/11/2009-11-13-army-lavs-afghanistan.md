Three of the Army's Light Armoured Vehicles (NZLAVs) and their crews are to be deployed to Afghanistan, Defence Minister Wayne Mapp announced today.

"The LAVs are being deployed by the Defence Force to support SAS operations and will be there as long as they are needed," Dr Mapp said.

"They will provide increased protected mobility for our personnel, particularly from Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). These are one of the greatest threats to coalition forces in Afghanistan.

"Our people in Afghanistan are doing a difficult job in a dangerous environment. The Government is committed to giving them the tools they need to do that job and do it well," he said.
