Government Departments, State-Owned Enterprises and Crown entities have been advised what values the Government expects to be considered when Crown land is being disposed of.

"The Government has reviewed existing processes for disposing of Crown land and agreed to a streamlined approach which elimiates unnecessary duplication and reduces the time and costs involved," Maurice Williamson, Minister for Land Information said

"The Government has a clear expectation that Chief Executives of all Crown agencies will ensure important cultural, historic heritage and conservation values are identified, managed and protected if necessary before any land is sold.

Mr Williamson said Ministers would be monitoring the situation, and would move if there were concerns that important values were not being adequately protected.

Guidelines were being prepared that agencies could use to assess values, including where to seek further advice before decisions were made.
