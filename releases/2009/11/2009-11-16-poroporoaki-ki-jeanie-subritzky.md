E te whaea o Muriwhenua, e te morehu pouaru o te Hokowhitu a Tu,

Takoto mai ra, takoto mai, takoto mai!

Moe mai ra i te ahurutanga o to whanau, ka hoki atu ai ki to hoa rangatira ki tua o te arai.

E whakahihi ana to whanau, ko koe te mea mutunga o nga hoia, o nga pouaru o Nga Tamatoa, i haere ki te Pakanga Nui Tuatahi o te Ao.

Ko Ropata Subritzky tera, i haere ki tua o te ao, ki te whenua Wiwi, i te tau 1916. I reira ia i whara kinotia, ka whakahokia ai ia ki te wa kainga, tutaki ai ki tona whaiaipo, ki tona tau, ki a Jeanie e takoto mai ra i tenei wa.

No reira e Kui, haere, haere, haere ki Te Reinga, ki te rerenga wairua.

Haere ki te Po! Haere ki te Po!

An important chapter in New Zealand and Maori history closed with finality this week, with the passing of Jeanie Subritzky, of Kareponia in the Far North, said Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples.

"Jeanie Subritzky was a living link to an important part of our nation's history," said Dr Sharples, "and her death a few days ago, as we commemorated Armistice Day, is a reminder of how close we are to our history.

"Waitangi Day and ANZAC Day are our two key days of nationhood, and I understand Jeanie was the last surviving widow of Te Hokowhitu a Tu, the Maori Pioneer Battalion of World War One, who helped create the ANZAC legend," he said.

"Jeanie's late husband Corporal Robert Subritzky enlisted in 1915, and travelled to Egypt, France and Belgium, where he fought at the Somme, and was seriously wounded at Messines. He was awarded the British War Medal 1914-1918, the Victory Medal and one wound stripe. He returned from hospital in England to Kareponia, and in 1949 he married Jeanie Davison from Dargaville.

"My condolences go to Jeanie and Bob's family, and I hope their pride in the family's history will help relieve their grief at their loss," said Dr Sharples.
