A new police station at National Park will be an important link in the protective cordon around the Central Plateau, Police Minister Judith Collins said.

Ms Collins joined Police and members of the community at National Park today at the opening of the $195,000 station.

The new facility will be manned by two officers and will have fingerprinting and excess breath alcohol facilities, a holding cell, a community meeting room and storage for search and rescue equipment.

"In a place as remote and as unforgiving as the Central Plateau the role of Police is often that of saviours rather than enforcers," Ms Collins said.

"Together with Ohakune and Waiouru stations to the south and the Turangi station to the north, this facility will form a network that keeps watch on these mountains and those that venture on to them.

"This station will be a focus point for search and rescue in what is an increasingly popular attraction for New Zealanders and overseas visitors."

National Park is the eighth Police station opened since Ms Collins became Minister.

Over the next 12 months new stations will be opened at Christchurch Airport and Culverden, and a new Central Police Station at Tamatea.

Recently approval was given for new single-officer stations at Russell, Karamea, Granity, Nuhaka, Bennydale and Waikari, each costing around $250,000. These are all likely to be opened in the second half of 2010.
