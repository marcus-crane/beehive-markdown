"New Zealand enjoys a flourishing, energetic literary tradition," Arts Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson said last night, opening the 2009 Auckland Writers' & Readers' Festival.

The festival, in its tenth anniversary year, has attracted a powerful line-up of international and New Zealand writers on its programme, he said.

"The success of the festival reflects the growth of New Zealand's creative sector since the mid 1990s," Mr Finlayson said. "In the area of literature this growth has been helped by the joint efforts of government support through Creative New Zealand, and the backing of industry bodies such as the Book Council, the booksellers' and publishers' organisations; and through established Awards, fellowships and sponsorships that target writers and publishers."

"This year the festival's inaugural schools programme provides a stimulating series of sessions for intermediate and secondary students," said Mr Finlayson. "This adds a new dimension to the festival and will prove an inspiration for teachers and students alike. It's an exceptional opportunity for aspiring young writers."

A recent Creative New Zealand report, New Zealanders and the Arts, showed that 14% of New Zealanders said they had attended a literary event or festival in the previous 12 months, and 12% had taken part in writing or creating literature.

"We are all aware of the benefits and great pleasures of attending a writers', readers' or book festival. Such events provide the chance to be introduced to new ideas, listen to the views of favourite authors and to meet new ones."
