Line-by-line departmental reviews have freed up $2 billion over the next four years that will be put back into Government priorities such as boosting frontline services, Finance Minister Bill English says.

A combined $454 million has been identified in the remainder of this financial year and 2009/10, rising to over $500 million by 2012/13.

"That is a big boost for this year's Budget and will make a real difference at a time when the Government's books are under pressure from the global recession.

"It is an extra $454 million the Government has put into key policies like more police, more probation officers and training more doctors and nurses. It is on top of the $1.45 billion increase in operating spending announced in Budget 2009, meaning New Zealanders are effectively getting $1.9 billion in new initiatives. "

One of the National Government’s key election commitments was to slow the rate of government spending increases and focus on frontline public services.

"We want better, smarter public services with little or no extra funding. This is the first step in an ongoing process to ensure government spending is effective and goes on the right things,” Mr English says. 

As part of the line-by-line reviews, ministers asked departmental chief executives to identify low priority spending. The savings have been put back into new initiatives, including enhanced frontline services.

The biggest areas of reprioritisation are in education, social development, Overseas Development Assistance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Many of the changes have already been announced.

"The savings come from an array of areas, ranging from big, yet to be implemented policy promises of the previous government, to low quality spending.

"As well as the immediate savings which were reprioritised in the Budget, the reviews have started the process of improving the quality of our spending – delivering better, smarter services with little more money,” Mr English says.

"The real gains will come from making sure that there’s a continual focus on innovating and finding better ways of delivering public services right across Government.

"The average annual saving of $500 million a year over the next four years represents less than one per cent of total government spending of $65 billion. This Government will ensure that budgets are about getting the most for taxpayers out of that spending. "
