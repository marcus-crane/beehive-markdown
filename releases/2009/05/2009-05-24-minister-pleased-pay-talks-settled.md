Education Minister Anne Tolley is very pleased with news that kindergarten teacher pay talks have been settled.

"Negotiations between the education sector union, NZEI Te Riu Roa, and the Ministry of Education, over kindergarten teachers' collective employment agreement have come to an end after five days," says Mrs Tolley.

"I am very pleased both parties could come to an agreement in such a short time-frame.

"The National Government recognises the important contribution kindergarten teachers play in delivering a quality early childhood education service for young New Zealanders."
