Budget 2009 gives a $34 million boost for school access to high-speed broadband, Education Minister Anne Tolley and Information and Communications Technology Minister Steven Joyce say.

This confirms funding for the initiative, which was announced earlier this year as part of the Government’s infrastructure stimulus package.

“Access to high-speed broadband is a vital part of students getting a 21st century education in a 21st century economy,” the ministers say.

“Maximising the rollout of high-speed broadband to schools will contribute to the government’s goal of ensuring that New Zealand schools provide the best possible education to their students.”

Around a quarter of New Zealand schools are ready to take advantage of high-speed broadband. Today’s announcement means other schools will have access to an 80 per cent government subsidy to upgrade their networks. The Ministry of Education will also provide schools with the support they need to take advantage of high-speed broadband. Ministry services will include:

- Infrastructure support such as software, hardware and helpdesk support.
- ICT professional development for teachers and school leaders.
- Guidance drawn from school-based research and innovation.
- Access and advice for schools on online services.

“This National-led Government is committed to ensuring ultra-fast broadband is available to 75 per cent of New Zealanders where they live, work and study over the next 10 years,” the ministers say.
