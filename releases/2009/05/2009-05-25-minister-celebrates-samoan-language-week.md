Samoan Language Week gives New Zealand the opportunity to recognise and celebrate the language and culture of its fourth largest ethnic community and the third most spoken language after English and Māori.

Hon Georgina te Heuheu, Minister for Pacific Island Affairs, congratulated the Human Rights Commission and the Association for the Teaching of Samoa in Aotearoa for establishing Samoan Language Week three years ago in recognition of its importance to New Zealand.

The Minister was speaking at the Wellington Secondary Schools' opening of Samoa Language Week at St Patrick's College in Wellington.

"This event reflects New Zealand's place in the Pacific and the fact that we are host to the largest Polynesian city in the world - Auckland. At the same time, it acknowledges the presence of other Pasifika languages in New Zealand."

Mrs te Heuheu said the Government was committed to the retention and preservation of Pasifika languages.

"As New Zealand evolves in diversity I believe speaking in one's own language preserves culture, enhances cultural identity, improves educational outcomes and in turn contributes to the economic development and national character of New Zealand," she said.

"The Government has approved the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs' Pacific Languages Strategy which will, once developed and implemented, show both educational and economic benefits for Pasifika people and New Zealand in general.

Mrs te Heuheu said it was important to maintain respect for the traditions, cultures and languages of our fellow citizens and neighbours and Samoan Language Week was one way to acknowledge and reaffirm our ties.

"I encourage New Zealanders to show support for the importance of promoting language and culture as a way of recognising and embracing our nation's growing diversity."
