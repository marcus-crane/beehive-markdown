David Henry has been appointed Chief Executive of the Electoral Commission for a term of one year, commencing 2 June 2009, Justice Minister Simon Power said today.

"Mr Henry has wide experience of strategic and operational management in the public sector and I am confident he has the skills to contribute significantly to the work of the Commission," Mr Power said.

Mr Henry is a former senior public servant and more recently has worked as a management consultant. He was the Chief Executive of the Inland Revenue Department from 1988-1995, Commissioner of the Y2K Readiness Commission from 1998-2000, and Chief Electoral Officer from 2000-2006.

The Electoral Commission is an independent Crown entity that registers political parties, party logos, and third parties. It also receives donations protected from disclosure, registered parties and third parties' annual returns of donations and returns of election expenses, and allocates election broadcasting time and funds to eligible political parties. 

Mr Power said the appointment is for one year because the Government is considering a report on the structure of the electoral agencies. 

"Mr Henry will replace Dr Helena Catt who is standing down after five years in the position. 

"Dr Catt has made a significant contribution to the commission and I thank her for her work over the past five years," Simon Power said.
