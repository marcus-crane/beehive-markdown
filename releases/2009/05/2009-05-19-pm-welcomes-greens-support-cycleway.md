Prime Minister John Key is welcoming the Green Party's agreement to work with National on the New Zealand Cycleway Project.

The cycleway has been added to the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that outlines the policy initiatives both parties have agreed to collaborate on.

"When we first signed the MOU with the Green Party in April, I said there would be other important policy areas where we had common ground, and the cycleway certainly fits the criteria."

The MOU now covers four common areas; home insulation, energy efficiency, the regulation of natural health products, and the cycleway.

John Key, as Minister of Tourism, will now work together with the Green Party's spokesperson on Tourism, Sport and Recreation, and Cycling and Active Transport, Kevin Hague, on the development of the cycleway project.

"While the Greens and National will always have policy differences, it is increasingly clear that in an MMP environment this should never stand in the way of working together when we share the same policy objectives.

"I look forward to the valuable input the Greens will have into this project."
