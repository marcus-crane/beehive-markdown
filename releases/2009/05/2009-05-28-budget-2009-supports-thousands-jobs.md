Budget 2009 will help New Zealanders through the recession by supporting thousands of jobs, Finance Minister Bill English says.

Initiatives include $7.5 billion of planned infrastructure investment over the next five years, a $323.3 million campaign to insulate and heat up to 180,000 homes and $50 million towards a national cycleway network.

"The Government's Jobs and Growth plan will keep as many people in work as possible during the recession, while creating a springboard for strong future economic growth and the jobs it will bring with it," Mr English says.

"Building better roads, more state houses, modern schools and faster broadband will support thousands of new jobs. Many more will be created by insulating homes up and down the country.

"These initiatives will employ New Zealanders and create work for businesses throughout the regions, whether they are builders, plumbers or electricians. Their benefits will flow through communities by helping keep suppliers and sub-contractors, shopkeepers and sales staff in business.

"Budget 2009 creates new frontline jobs including 600 more police, 246 more probation workers and hundreds of extra training places for doctors and nurses.

"Supporting those who lose their jobs through the ReStart programme and maintaining welfare entitlements will stimulate the economy."

The Government has already put cash back into the economy through April 1 tax cuts and a $480 million small business assistance package.

"Increased unemployment is one of the harshest effects of the global recession. We cannot reverse that, but we are taking steps to cushion New Zealanders from its sharpest edges," Mr English says.
