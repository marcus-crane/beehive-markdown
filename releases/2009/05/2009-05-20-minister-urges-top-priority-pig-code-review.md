Agriculture Minister David Carter has asked the review of the 2005 Code of Welfare for pigs to be a top priority for the National Animal Welfare Advisory Committee.

The committee is currently reviewing the 2005 Code and Mr Carter has asked it to "give this review the highest priority in its work programme."

In a letter sent to committee chair Peter O'Hara, Mr Carter said: "I would like to be able to issue a new code of welfare for pigs by the end of this year."

Mr Carter said Dr O'Hara will be reporting back on the timeframe shortly.

"There is a high level of public concern over the issue of pig welfare, and it is vital that there is an opportunity for the public to make submissions on the Code," Mr Carter said.
