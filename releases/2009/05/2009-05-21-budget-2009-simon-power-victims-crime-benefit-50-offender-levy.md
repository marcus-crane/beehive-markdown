The Budget next week will provide $2.3 million for the first step in the Government's policy to put victims at the centre of the justice system - the establishment of the offender levy.

Some $1 million in operating funding and $1.3 million in capital funding in 2009/10 is allocated to set up the collection process for a $50 levy on all convicted offenders at sentencing.

Of the $2.3 million, $1.5 million is remaining from 2008/09 Budget allocation to the Sentencing Council ($1.479 million) and the Justice Advisory Board ($29,000), both of which the National Government has disbanded, as promised. The remainder is new money.

Justice Minister Simon Power says addressing the negative impact of crime on victims is one of the Government's top priorities in justice.

"We want to put victims of crime at the centre of the justice system.

"That's why we cut the extra bureaucracy that was the Sentencing Council and the Criminal Justice Advisory Board.

"Victims have been neglected for far too long, and this levy will help address the financial costs that fall on them and ensure that offenders contribute to addressing the harm they cause.

"This initial funding is for the Ministry of Justice to establish new processes in its fines collection system to collect the new levy.

"Although there will be a small initial set-up cost, the levy is forecast to collect $13.6 million in the first four years.

"It will be used to fund additional services for victims of serious crime over and above those covered by ACC or by discretionary grants from Victim Support."

The Sentencing (Offender Levy) Bill, which is before the Justice and Electoral Select Committee, imposes the levy on all convicted offenders at the point of sentencing. The levy will be in addition to any sentence or court order and will be collected after reparation but before fines.

The select committee is due to report back to the House on the bill in August.
