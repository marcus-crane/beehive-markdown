Key artistic and cultural organisations get a boost of $10.5 million over the next four years in Budget 2009, Arts Minister Christopher Finlayson says.

This funding for Creative New Zealand and the Royal New Zealand Ballet will protect New Zealand's cultural assets during the economic downturn.

Creative New Zealand will receive an additional $7.1 million over the next four years. The extra money will support key music, dance and theatre companies so they can continue to provide New Zealanders with cultural and performing arts experiences.

"The Government is providing extra funding to protect national organisations - not only for their own benefit, but because they also play an integral part in supporting regional arts organisations."

The Royal New Zealand Ballet will receive an extra $3.4 million over the next four years, Mr Finlayson said.

"This funding for the Royal New Zealand Ballet and Creative New Zealand will have positive flow-on effects for regional arts organisations such as the Auckland Philharmonic Orchestra, the Vector Wellington Orchestra and the Christchurch Symphony Orchestra.

"The current economic situation is putting pressure on sponsorship and donations given to arts organisations. "This additional funding will relieve some of that pressure," Mr Finlayson says.
