Budget 2009 will provide $9 million in operating funding and $800,000 in capital funding to upgrade court security over the next four years.

Courts Minister Georgina Te Heuheu says she has listened to judges' concerns about court security and the new funding will help improve safety for court users and staff while maintaining public confidence in the justice system.

"Courts by their nature are emotionally tense environments where parties in dispute are brought together. While the risk of security incidents can never be completely removed, this initiative will improve safety for members of the public and those who work in our courts on a daily basis.

"Scanning and searching people entering courts is the single most effective way of reducing the risk of security incidents. The physical presence of dedicated security officers will help prevent incidents such as those that have occurred in the past.

"To do this, around 30 more court security officers will be employed over the next four years, bringing the total number of court security officers to around 83 by 2013.

"Additional security equipment will also be purchased, including walk-through metal detectors, baggage scanners, radios, and closed circuit TV systems."

There are currently 53 court security officers covering 70 courthouses with 350 court rooms and hearing rooms. In 2005/06 court security officers searched or scanned 263,000 people, taking 3,900 items into temporary custody; in 2007/08 court security officers searched 517,000 people, taking 4,300 items into custody.
