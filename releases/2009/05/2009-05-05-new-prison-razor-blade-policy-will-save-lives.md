Corrections Minister Judith Collins has welcomed a clampdown on razor blades in high security prison units, a move she says will improve safety and save lives.

"At least two prisoners have died from razor blade injuries and many more prisoners and corrections officers have been hurt by razor blades," Ms Collins says.

"Until now prisoners in high-security and remand units have been able to possess razor blades that some have used to inflict harm. This common sense new policy restricts access to razor blades by prisoners who are most likely to use them to inflict injury on themselves or others."

In 2007, there were 272 razor blade incidents in prisons including 107 involving self-harm and 28 where the blade was fashioned into a weapon. On three occasions razor blades were used against a staff member or other prisoner.

Under the revised policy, prisoners in high security units will be issued with a safety razor on request, which they will be permitted to keep for a maximum of one hour. The razor will then be collected, checked and safely disposed of.

Should a razor not be returned, or returned with missing blades, searches or other action will be taken.

As soon as becoming aware of the high number of razor blade incidents, Ms Collins asked the Department of Corrections to review its policy.

"Allowing prisoners to accumulate razor blades in their cells is risky for both staff and other prisoners and is unacceptable to this government," Ms Collins says.
