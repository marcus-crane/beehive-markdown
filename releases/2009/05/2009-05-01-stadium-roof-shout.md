The government is supporting the AMI stadium development in Christchurch with a 15-million-dollar contribution.

 The funding was officially confirmed by the Prime Minister, John Key, at a "roof shout" ceremony at the stadium.

 Economic Development Minister and Associate Rugby World Cup Minister, Gerry Brownlee, says the government is pleased t make the modest investment in the AMI stadium development. 

"We congratulate the Christchurch City Council and V-Base for their funding and the efforts they have made with this development work, but it was also appropriate the government assists," said Mr Brownlee. 

"Apart from the economic benefit to the region, the stadium will be an enhanced facility for the people of Christchurch and help maintain the heritage and tradition of the Canterbury rugby union, he said. 

"Such investment ensures the city is well placed to host the Rugby World Cup games in 2011, and also provides a long-lasting legacy for the people of Christchurch," said Mr Brownlee. 

The government has already announced it is granting 15 million dollars to the redevelopment of the Carisbrook stadium in Dunedin. 

The AMI stadium project is expected to be completed by late this year. The improved Christchurch stadium will host seven Rugby World Cup games, including two quarter finals. 

It's pleasing to see good progress being made with the Rugby World Cup tournament just 862 days away," said Mr Brownlee. 

"This will be an important event for our economy.  One estimate forecasts the 2011 RWC event will contribute over $500 million in additional gross domestic product," he said.
