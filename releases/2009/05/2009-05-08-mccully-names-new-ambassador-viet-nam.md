Career diplomat Heather Riddell will be New Zealand's next Ambassador to Viet Nam, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

Viet Nam is an important regional partner for New Zealand, and it assumes the role of Chair of ASEAN next year," Mr McCully said.

"Our bilateral relationship is diverse and substantive, and we have much to pursue in our political and economic dealings.

"Viet Nam is one of our fastest-growing trading partners, with two-way trade now worth $NZ500 million per year, and the recent conclusion of the Australia/New Zealand Free Trade Agreement with ASEAN countries has further consolidated our trade relationship with the region," Mr McCully said.

Heather Riddell has previously been posted to Geneva, New York, Noumea, Honiara, Seoul, and most recently as Deputy High Commissioner in Canberra.

She commences her posting in August, replacing James Kember, who is returning to Wellington.
