Infrastructure Minister Bill English has announced appointments to the new National Infrastructure Advisory Board.

The board has been set up to provide independent advice to the Infrastructure Minister and to help formulate the first 20-year National Infrastructure Plan, which will be completed by the end of the year.

Members have been chosen on the basis of their individual skills and their collective knowledge of infrastructure planning, investment and asset management methods.

"Today's appointments are another step towards meeting the National Government's commitment to put together a long-term plan that clearly states New Zealand's infrastructure priorities. The plan will identify emerging bottlenecks and investment gaps and ensure the government and taxpayers get the best bang for their infrastructure buck," Mr English said.

The board will also provide advice to the National Infrastructure Unit, which sits within Treasury. A key role will be to engage with the private sector, local government and other stakeholders, about regulatory barriers that are slowing investment and opportunities for partnership. 

“As well as advising on new investments it is equally important that the public sector focuses on improving its management of the existing asset base. I'm sure this group will be a rich source of insight as the government implements its plan to improve New Zealand's roads, broadband and electricity supply," Mr English said.

Dr Rod Carr will chair the new board. The other members are Sir Ron Carter, Lindsay Crossen, Dr Arthur Grimes, Dr Terence Heiler, Rob McLeod, John Rae and Alex Sundakov.

The appointment terms of the Board members have been staggered to balance the need for continuity with the occasional need for fresh perspectives or new areas of expertise.
