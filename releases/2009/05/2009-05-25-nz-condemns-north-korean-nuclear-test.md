Foreign Minister Murray McCully today condemned reports of a nuclear weapons test by North Korea - the second such test in the past two and a half years.

"Today's test, if confirmed, is another provocative act by North Korea that risks destabilising the Korean peninsula. It is also a significant step backwards for global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation efforts," Mr McCully said.

"New Zealand condemns Pyongyang's actions. They should be under no illusion as to the gravity with which the international community will view today's events."

North Korea threatened nuclear weapon and ballistic missile tests late last month in protest at the United Nations Security Council's criticism of its rocket launch in early April.

"New Zealand will now join the international community in considering what measures should be taken in response to today's nuclear test," Mr McCully said.

"We remain fully supportive of dialogue through the Six-Party Talks process to resolve issues on the Korean Peninsula, and urge North Korea to immediately re-engage in this process."

North Korea's previous nuclear weapons test led to a UN Security Council resolution and sanctions.
