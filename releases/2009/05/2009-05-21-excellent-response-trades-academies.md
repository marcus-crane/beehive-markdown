Education Minister, Anne Tolley, is delighted by the interest that's been shown in the government's aim to establish a minimum of five Trades Academies across the country.

"The Ministry of Education has received 113 expressions of interest from a wide range of applicants.That is an impressive figure. I am delighted so many providers are interested in providing a relevant and positive learning experience for the country's young people," says Mrs Tolley.

"Trades Academies will give our youth wider choices in education and the ability to gain practical, hands-on vocational skills while still at school."

Submissions were received from 58 schools, 17 tertiary institutions and 38 other providers. They came from the following locations:

Auckland, (33), Christchurch (13), Dunedin (4), Eastern Bay of Plenty (1), Gisborne (4), Hamilton (9), Invercargill (3), Lower Hutt (3), Masterton (1), Napier (4), Nelson (5), Rotorua (7), Southland (1), Wanganui (10), Wellington (8) and Whangarei (7).

The Ministry of Education will now review the EOIs against the selection criteria. The most suitable applicants will be asked to develop a fuller business case before a shortlist is established.

"I will then take the preferred options to Cabinet who will decide which proposals will proceed," says Mrs Tolley.

"I am excited and encouraged that so many people share our goal to provide a relevant learning experience for New Zealand's young people."
