Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson today welcomed the appointment of former senior diplomat John Wood as the Crown's lead negotiator in talks with Wanganui iwi around the settlement of historical claims.

Dr Wood has twice served as Ambassador to the United States, New Zealand's High Commissioner to Pakistan, and Ambassador to Iran and Turkey. He is currently Pro Chancellor of the University of Canterbury, where he is an Adjunct Professor of Political Science. "I am very pleased that Dr Wood will bring his considerable experience and skills to this important role," Mr Finlayson said. "The engagement of talented people like Dr Wood demonstrates again the government's commitment to reaching just, durable and timely settlements of historical claims under the Treaty of Waitangi."

Dr Wood was Deputy Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade. He has led many trade delegations, including delegations to the World Trade Organisation and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Responsible for trade and economic policy, he headed New Zealand delegations and negotiations to the WTO Ministerial meetings in Seattle in 1999, and Doha in 2001.
