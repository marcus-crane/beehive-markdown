The Ministers of Health and Finance have approved the investment of $208 million for major upgrades at Middlemore Hospital.

Health Minister Tony Ryall said, "This is about planning for the future, in one of the fastest growing areas in New Zealand. These upgrades will help provide for South Auckland's growing need for hospital services.

"As well as improving facilities, the Counties-Manukau DHB tells me this work will create in excess of 1000 jobs in South Auckland, including clinicians, trades people and suppliers of construction materials.

"The government has committed new funding of $100 million. The balance is from the DHB's own resources.

"The main areas of investment will be fitting out the new Edmund Hillary Block and the construction of a Clinical Services Block.

"All up, the people of Counties-Manukau will see a new theatre complex of 14 theatres including three new theatres; more than 70 new hospital beds which will help management and flow of patients referred from GPs; and a trebling of capacity in the High Dependency Unit to 18 beds.

"This is a big boost for the South Auckland region," Mr Ryall said.
