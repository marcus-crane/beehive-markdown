Education Minister Anne Tolley and Associate Education Minister Heather Roy have announced that the rebuilt Kapi Mana Special School will now cater for an additional 10 students, bringing the roll to 40.

"This government is committed to giving the parents of special needs students greater choice in their education options. We need to provide support for students and families across a range of settings," says Mrs Tolley.

The Kapi Mana base school caters for secondary level special needs students from across Wellington and the Kapiti Coast. Currently, 26 students are enrolled at the school.

"After discussing plans for the school rebuild with the principal, I have agreed to fund the additional 10 places. The need for these places is clear as the region's population continues to increase. It would have been remiss of the government not to have provided for them," says Mrs Tolley.

The new school buildings are expected to open in Term 2 of 2010 on the Mana College grounds.

"Schools, parents and children deserve the best support possible. Our goal is for every child and young person to reach their full potential. Providing this option for Kapi Mana School and its community is one way of achieving this goal," says Mrs Roy.

Ministry of Education staff will continue to work with local schools, including Mana College, to ensure provision for special needs students is maintained and improved throughout the region.
