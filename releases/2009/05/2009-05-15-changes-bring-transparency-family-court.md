New rules affecting the reporting of Family Court proceedings take effect on Monday.

Courts Minister Georgina te Heuheu says the new rules, contained in the Family Courts Matters Act, will increase the openness of the Family Court. 

‘The changes will help the public gain a better understanding of how the Family Court operates and allow people to tell their side of the story, while protecting the privacy of those involved,' she says.

To help improve the openness of the Family Courts, news media reporters will be able to attend hearings. Reports of Family Court proceedings can be published provided there is no information identifying children or vulnerable people without leave of the judge. This is similar to the existing provisions in the Care of Children Act.

If the judge agrees, parties can bring a support person to the hearing. Others will be able to attend with the judge's permission. The judge can ask anyone to leave the courtroom.

Mrs te Heuheu says other minor process and procedural changes are designed to improve the operation of the Family Court.

‘For example, Family Court registrars will be able to do certain things previously only done by judges.

‘Judges will be able to direct registrars to appoint lawyers and specialist report writers and registrars will be able to issue a summons under the Domestic Violence Act and direct that additional people should be served with applications under the Family Protection Act.'

The changes taking effect on Monday are the first stage of the Family Courts Matters legislation. Other parts of the legislation yet to come into force include changes to counselling for couples and parents under the Family Proceedings Act and the Care of Children Act, and the introduction of counselling for children and family mediation. They will take effect when detailed planning for the new services has been completed.
