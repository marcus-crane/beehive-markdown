New Zealand is closely monitoring the spread of the swine flu around the world, including increasing cases in Australia where some schools have been closed.

The Health Minister Tony Ryall says, "The Ministry of Health is expanding the health information campaign for travellers and the public in general.

"The Ministry is increasing its flu prevention information campaign and also plans to give information more widely at international airports about preventing the spread of influenza.

"The public health message is: if you've returned from anywhere overseas within the last seven days and become unwell, you should phone a doctor or Healthline (0800 611 116) for advice.

"Health authorities have been doing a good job containing the spread of the virus in New Zealand.

"However, with over 12,000 cases in 43 countries, and the spread of the virus in Australia, it will be almost impossible to keep it out of New Zealand forever.

"There is no cause for alarm, but for caution. The Government is taking this threat seriously, and will continue to do all it can to delay the virus taking hold in New Zealand."

Checklists and advice are available on the Ministry of Health's website: [http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/indexmh/pandemicinfluenza-resources-factsheets](http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/indexmh/pandemicinfluenza-resources-factsheets)
