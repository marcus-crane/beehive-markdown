Economic Development Minister, Gerry Brownlee, and Trade Minister, Tim Groser, have made five appointments to the New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Board.

Three are new appointees, and two are reappointments of sitting Board members.

"We are pleased to announce the three new Board members are: Peter Townsend, head of the Canterbury Employers' Chamber of Commerce, Charles Finny, head of the Wellington Regional Chamber of Commerce, and Julie Christie, head of television and video production company Eyeworks." 

"We have also received indications that sitting Board members Craig Ellison and Lorraine Witten have agreed to renewed terms.

"We wanted to bring new points of view to the NZTE Board balanced with the continuity of experience from existing members," said Mr Brownlee.

"This is an important time for NZTE and it needs plenty of strategic thinking. It has to pursue its objectives of trade and investment and supporting New Zealand business during the current global economic downturn," said Mr Groser.

The Ministers said Peter Townsend and Charles Finny would bring to the NZTE Board extensive experience, and the value of their close connections with small and large businesses in New Zealand through their senior positions in the Chambers of Commerce. 

Peter Townsend has a sound background in both the private and public sectors with a deep understanding of export markets.

In addition Charles Finny had a valuable background in Foreign Affairs trade policy work, especially relating to China and Asia in general. 

Julie Christie is a successful entrepreneur based in Auckland with international linkages, who will bring valuable expertise in these areas to the NZTE Board table.

The Ministers said it was valuable that Craig Ellison, the longest serving Board member, with extensive business experience as well as connections to Maori owned businesses, had agreed to extend his period on the Board.

Lorraine Witten, experienced as an entrepreneur and consultant to telecommunications and technology businesses, had also agreed to an extended term.

The Ministers extended their thanks, on behalf of the Government, to Alan Isaac, Jane Hunter and Peter Maire, the three Board members who would be stepping down once their terms expired. 

"We acknowledge their service, and thank them very much for the significant contributions that they made to the Board during their tenures," said Mr Groser.
