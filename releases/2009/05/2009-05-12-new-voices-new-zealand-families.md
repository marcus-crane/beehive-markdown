Minister for Social Development and Employment, Paula Bennett, has today welcomed Bruce Pilbrow and Christine Rankin to their new roles as Families’ Commissioners.

“Both Bruce and Christine have been strong and effective advocates for New Zealand children and families throughout their careers”, said Ms Bennett.

“They will replace departing Commissioners Sharron Cole and Lyn Campbell, both whom have served two terms with the Commission.

“Families in all their diverse forms are a basic building block of our society. It is important we have a range of voices to ensure the Commission remains a valuable voice for all families,” the Minister said.

“I believe Bruce and Christine will be an asset to the Commission, bringing fresh ideas about how to strengthen and support Kiwi families. This is particularly important as many families feel the financial squeeze and the resulting strain that often places on relationships.”

The Families Commission, established in 2004, promotes a better understanding of family issues and needs among government agencies and the wider community.  The appointment process takes care to ensure that the Commissioners draw together the range of experience and expertise required.

Ms Bennett thanked the outgoing Commissioners for their commitment to families and to developing the Commission’s programme.

Mr Pilbrow and Ms Rankin join the Families Commission from 1 June 2009.
