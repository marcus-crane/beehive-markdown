Tariana Turia is calling for Maori and Pasifika peoples who are out of work to take advantage of training opportunities in the current economic recession.

"Today I was advised there has been a significant increase in the number of Maori and Pasifika peoples who are unemployed and while the figures are disappointing we must go forth with hope and optimism.

"The international impacts of the economic recession are rapidly being felt in our corner of the world," Mrs Turia said. "The strength and resilience of our communities must encourage us all, to face up to the challenges of this time and invest in our future.

"It's important that Maori and Pasifika in this situation use this time to up skill, to train, to take advantage of the free and low-cost polytechnic programmes on offer.

"When the recession ends, I'm sure those people who took up training will reap the benefits as they will be returning to the labour market armed with more skills, more know-how.

"I'm very aware that most of the unemployed have children and whanau and I am currently working with officials on ways to improve employment outcomes for Maori and Pasifika peoples."

The Household Labour Force survey, released this morning, reports that since March last year, Maori unemployment has increased by 1.7% or from 14,800 to 18,200 people while Pasifika unemployment has increased by 4.4% or from 7,100 to 11,400 people. For people who identified as being Maori/European the increase was even higher at 5.9%.

Overall the survey reports the national unemployment rate has reached a six year high now at 5%.
