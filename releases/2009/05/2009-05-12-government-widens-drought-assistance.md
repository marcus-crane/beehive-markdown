Agriculture Minister David Carter announced today that the Government is extending drought relief to farmers in parts of North Canterbury, Central Plateau, Taihape and Wairarapa.

This follows a recent decision to assist drought-stricken farmers in the Hawke's Bay and Gisborne/Wairoa regions.

"Farmers in all these areas are heading for a tough winter. As soil temperatures plummet, rain has come too late for many. Rain, sunshine and high soil temperatures are needed for grass to grow," says Mr Carter.

"What is making it worse is these farmers have suffered back-to-back drought for three years.

"The situation is forcing some farmers to sell off capital stock, and stock numbers were already down because of previous droughts."

Mr Carter visited Hawke's Bay last week to talk to farmers and to discuss assistance with the local drought committee.

"It was demoralising to see farms suffering the effects of another autumn drought, even though they'd had recent rain. As a farmer, I know the real impact this has on farming families and rural communities."

The areas today declared medium-level drought zones are Wairarapa and parts of Central Plateau, North Canterbury and Rangitikei.

Drought relief measures offered by the Government include tax assistance for farmers under the Income Equalisation Scheme, farm management advice and funding for Rural Support Trusts to provide help.

Note: Rural Support Trusts provide farm management advice and assistance to rural communities.
