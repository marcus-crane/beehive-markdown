Foreign Minister Murray McCully leaves for Brussels on Saturday for New Zealand's regular six-monthly consultations with the European Union, before travelling to Japan.

"The six-monthly foreign policy consultations with the EU are an important part of our relationship," said Mr McCully, who will meet with senior figures, including High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Dr Javier Solana; External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner, and Czech Presidency representatives.

"We will discuss a range of political issues affecting New Zealand's relations with Europe, and exchange views on issues of mutual interest, such as the global economic crisis, international security, and cooperation with the EU in the Pacific."

While in Brussels, the Minister will also meet with NATO secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, with Afghanistan as the main focus of discussions on global security.

Mr McCully will then travel to Japan to attend the fifth Pacific Islands Leaders Meeting (PALM) on 22-23 May, before holding bilateral talks with various Japanese Ministers and political leaders.

The PALM meetings are held every three years to discuss developments in the Pacific, and to explore greater cooperation between Japan and members of the Pacific Islands Forum. This year's meeting is co-chaired by Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso and Forum Chair, Niue Premier Toke Talagi.

"The meetings in Japan present a chance to reinforce the very positive discussions I had during Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone's recent visit to New Zealand," Mr McCully said.

While in Japan, Mr McCully will also deliver a speech to the Friendship Exchange Council, and, as Minister for the 2011 Rugby World Cup, meet with senior figures at the Japan Rugby Union.
