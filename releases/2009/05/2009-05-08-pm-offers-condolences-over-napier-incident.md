Prime Minister John Key today expressed his sincere condolences to the family of Senior Constable Len Snee, who tragically lost his life while on duty in Napier yesterday.

“Senior Constable Snee was a long-serving police officer who gave a lot to his local community – he will be greatly missed,” Mr Key said.

“It is at times like this that our country is reminded of the risks our police officers take every day to protect the public.

“Their job is a dangerous one and the events in Napier yesterday, which continue to unfold today, are a stark reminder of that,” Mr Key said.

Mr Key is receiving updates on the conditions of Constables Bruce Miller and Grant Diver, who remain in hospital after being shot during the armed incident.

“My thoughts are with them and their families at what is clearly a very difficult time,” he said.

An unnamed member of the public is also in hospital in relation to the incident and Mr Key wished this person a speedy recovery.

“This is an extremely serious incident and I offer my full support to the officers who continue to put their lives on the line in an effort to bring it to a close,” Mr Key said.
