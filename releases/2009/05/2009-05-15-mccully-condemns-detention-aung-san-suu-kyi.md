Foreign Minister Murray McCully today condemned the apparent imprisonment of Burmese pro-democracy leader and Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.

"This is totally unacceptable. The only thing Aung San Suu Kyi is guilty of is standing up for the rights of the Burmese people in the face of appalling repression," Mr McCully said.

"Reports from Burma say Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been under home detention for many years, was taken from her house yesterday to a Rangoon prison.

"The reports say the arrest came after unauthorised visits by supporters, and that Aung San Suu Kyi is likely to stand trial for breaches of detention conditions. She could face a substantial prison term if found guilty.

"This action is yet another setback for Burma, and throws more doubt over the credibility of the planned 2010 elections.

"The Burmese government must release Aung San Suu Kyi immediately, and take meaningful steps towards the restoration of democracy," Mr McCully said.
