Kristy McDonald QC has been appointed chairperson of the Real Estate Agents Authority, Justice Minister Simon Power announced today. "I believe Ms McDonald's legal acumen and her governance experience are ideal preparation for the demanding challenge of leading this newly created Crown entity," Mr Power said.

Ms McDonald has extensive experience as a litigation lawyer and has practised as a barrister sole since 1989. She was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1999 and has served as the chairperson of the Mental Health Review Tribunal and as a member of the Removal Review Authority. In 2008 she was appointed chairperson of the Judicial Control Authority for Racing.

The Real Estate Agents Act 2008, which was passed in September last year, significantly reforms the regulation of the real estate industry and provides a strong focus on consumer protection.

The Real Estate Agents Authority will replace the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand as the oversight body for the industry. The authority will consist of up to seven members, at least two of whom are required to be licensees or former licensees.

The Real Estate Agents Act comes fully into effect from 17 November 2009.
