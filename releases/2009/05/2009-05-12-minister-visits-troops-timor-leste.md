Defence Minister Wayne Mapp will see New Zealand Defence Force personnel in the field overseas for the first time this week when he visits Operation Koru in Timor-Leste.

Dr Mapp will spend Wednesday and Thursday in Timor-Leste before returning to New Zealand on Saturday.

Operation Koru is the largest NZDF deployment with nearly 160 personnel in theatre, including a number of Reserve soldiers.

Dr Mapp said he was looking forward to the visit. "Timor-Leste has been a major commitment for the NZDF. Some 6000 NZDF personnel as well as 30 New Zealand Police, Corrections and Customs officers have served in Timor-Leste since 1999.

"I am particularly looking forward to seeing our people in the field and on patrol, to get an understanding of what they are facing and how they dealing with it," Dr Mapp said.

"These are the same people I farewelled at Ohakea in December last year and it will be good to catch up with them and hear how the operation is progressing."

On Thursday Dr Mapp is scheduled to open the new Chancery at the New Zealand embassy in Dili at a ceremony to be attended by Timor-Leste Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao.
