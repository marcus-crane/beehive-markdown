Transport Minister Steven Joyce has asked the NZ Transport Agency and the Department of Labour to work with the taxi industry to enhance the safety of taxi drivers and their passengers, as required by the law.

Following the death of Christchurch taxi driver Abdulrahman Ikhtari on 5 December last year, the Minister asked officials to conduct a stock take on safety measures in taxis to see what could be done to increase safety.

"The government's focus will be on ensuring taxi companies have the necessary safety measures in place that they are required to by law - rather than adding another level of compliance," says Mr Joyce.

"With the support of the Minister of Labour, I have asked that department to work with the taxi industry to ensure all operators understand their responsibilities in regard to driver safety, and to work with the industry to develop a Code of Practice to cover taxi driver safety. 

"Taxi companies are required by law to provide a safe work place for all employees, including contractors, and we need to hold them to that.

"Other than those operating in small centres, they are also required by law to provide a 24-hour communication service with all working drivers but we know that this requirement is often breached.

"I have asked the NZ Transport Agency, which is responsible for policing this, to monitor closely and penalise offending companies."

A focus of the report on additional safety measures that could be taken by taxi companies was whether or not security cameras in cabs should be mandated for.

Mr Joyce says the cost of purchasing and installing security cameras in all cabs would be considerable and prohibitive, particularly in the current economic climate. It is estimated that it would cost around a thousand dollars or more per taxi.

"Outside of the Taxi Federation there is not a lot of support for compulsory cameras in cabs." 

Of 30 non-Federation taxi organisations surveyed by Ministry of Transport and NZ Transport Agency Officials, only five would support such a move.

Notwithstanding that opposition, Mr Joyce says he urges all taxi companies to reassess their safety measures and take all necessary steps to ensure the safety of their drivers, particularly those driving late at night.

"Current legislation allows the installation of safety screens, security cameras and distress buttons in taxis. 

"I'm happy to remain flexible about which safety devices are deployed to support driver safety. The installation of these devices is both the choice and responsibility of taxi drivers and companies," says Mr Joyce.
