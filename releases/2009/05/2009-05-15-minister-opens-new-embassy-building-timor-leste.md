Defence Minister Wayne Mapp and Timor-Leste Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao shared the honours at the formal opening of New Zealand's new Embassy building in Dili yesterday.

Unveiling a plaque to mark the occasion, Dr Mapp said that the new building was a sign of the deep friendship between the two countries. "This new Embassy is a symbol of New Zealand's commitment to Timor-Leste," he said.

"Since 1999 many thousands of New Zealanders have served in Timor-Leste: with Interfet, in successive UN missions, and in the International Stabilisation Force; as police, aid workers, diplomats, public servants passing on specialist skills in fields such as education, Customs and Corrections, and in commercial roles.

"New Zealanders know of the struggles that the Timorese people have gone through, and it is important that we stand by them as they develop their country. The new Embassy is an expression of the confidence we have in the work they are doing to build their country and society," Dr Mapp said.

Mr Gusmao said that it was an important day in the enduring relationship between the two countries.

"It is a relationship that has been growing stronger by the day. My Government warmly welcomes the new Embassy as an expression of New Zealand's long-term commitment to Timor-Leste."
