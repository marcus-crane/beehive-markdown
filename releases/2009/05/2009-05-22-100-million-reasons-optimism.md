The Minister of Fisheries, Phil Heatley, has good news for southern oyster fishermen and the country’s many Bluff oyster fans on the eve of the 18th annual Bluff Oyster Festival: the health of the Foveaux Strait oyster beds is improving.

“Attendees at this weekend’s festival in Bluff should enjoy their oysters in the knowledge that the latest science suggests there are better seasons to come,” Mr Heatley said.

A recent survey of the Foveaux Strait oyster beds shows oyster numbers have increased, but that the fishery will need to be carefully managed due to the oyster-killing disease Bonamia.

The survey, carried out in February by NIWA, shows the numbers of take-able size oysters has increased 16 per cent from about 620 million to 720 million since the last survey in 2007.  This coincides with fishers’ feedback of increased commercial catch rates and observations.

The fishery is predicted to continue to rebuild, but Bonamia is still affecting some areas.  The current allowed catch is only 7.5 million oysters.  But with Bonamia predicted to account for about 50 million oysters this year it remains the major influence on the fishery’s rate of recovery.

“These results show the need to look for ways to carefully manage the fishery to reduce the impacts of Bonamia.  To this end I have recently approved a plan to help rebuild the fishery,” Mr Heatley said. 

The plan was developed jointly by fishery participants and the Ministry of Fisheries, and has already galvanised action on a number of fronts, including:

- Bonamia research;
- Targeted fishing;
- Reseeding and enhancement of beds;
- New dredge designs, and;
- Better information and monitoring.

“I am very pleased to see those involved in the fishery working together in this way. 

“If we can reduce the impact of Bonamia and bring the fishery back to its historic size, then everyone involved benefits, commercial, customary and recreational fishers, not to mention consumers,” Mr Heatley said.
