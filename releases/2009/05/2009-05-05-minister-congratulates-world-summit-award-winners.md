Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce has congratulated three New Zealand organisations which have won World Summit Awards (WSA) for creativity and innovation in ICT. 

"It's great to see these organisations following in the footsteps of other successful digital innovators, like Weta and Right Hemisphere."

One of the winners, the National Broadband Map (NBM), has a direct link to the government's objective for broadband roll out - ultra-fast broadband to businesses, schools, hospitals and 75% of homes over the next 10 years.

NBM is an online map created by the State Services Commission to provide a visual representation of New Zealand's broadband landscape. It is a valuable resource for planning broadband infrastructure and investment in New Zealand.

The other two New Zealand winners are:

- "Casebook" a cutting-edge 3D digital animation by Dunedin-based company Areo.  The animation is created with Aerograph technology, pioneered by CEO Luke Reid, which allows animators to create 3D environments that are both more detailed and far cheaper to produce than traditional digital animation techniques.  The technology is currently on display in the award-winning "Casebook" series of forensic crime games.
- Te Papa's "Our Space", a user-generated public interactive experience which guides visitors through two unique spaces.  The technology allows the viewing of images submitted by the public and manipulation to create new individual representations on national identity.

Mr Joyce says it's great to see New Zealand projects of this calibre being recognised on the world stage

"In these tough economic times it's important that we celebrate and encourage the high level of innovation and creativity that we have in this country to enable us to capture more export revenue.

"High-value, media rich applications will help drive demand for the new ultra-fast broadband network. Innovative products like these will contribute to the economy through smart use of broadband, as well as helping the wider community."

The winners will be presented with their awards at the WSA gala on 12 June in Monterey, Mexico.
