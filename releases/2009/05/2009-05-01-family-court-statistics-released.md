The third annual Family Court Statistics in New Zealand, covering 2006 and 2007, was released today by Courts Minister Georgina te Heuheu.

The report provides an overview of the number and types of cases dealt with by the Family Court, outlines trends in court activity over the last 10 years and gives statistics on a range of topics such as case outcomes and the demographics of court users.

‘This information helps the Ministry analyse the work of the court and factor any developments or trends into future policy work across the justice sector,' Mrs te Heuheu said.

‘It covers the two years since the introduction of the Care of Children Act which changed the way day-to-day care of a child and guardianship issues are addressed by the court,' she said.

The full report and a summary Statistical Bulletin are available on the Ministry of Justice website [www.justice.govt.nz](http://www.justice.govt.nz)
