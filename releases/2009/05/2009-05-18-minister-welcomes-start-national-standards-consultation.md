Parents, families, whānau, teachers, principals, and school trustees are now able to have their say on draft National Standards.

Consultation material was added to the Ministry of Education’s website today and packs will be sent to schools later this week. Consultation will run until 3 July 2009.

“National Standards will play a vital role in the government’s drive to lift the performance of the education system and improve outcomes for young New Zealanders,” said Education Minister Anne Tolley.

The draft standards were developed by literacy and numeracy experts and establish clear expectations of progress and achievement in reading, writing and mathematics. The Ministry has also developed examples of plain language reports for parents so they can better support their child’s education.

“I encourage educators, parents and the broader public to have their say on the draft standards and the plain language reports.” said Mrs Tolley

“Their input will ensure that the standards can lift literacy and numeracy achievement. I also want to make sure that schools are reporting to parents in a way that gives them a clear picture of their child’s performance."

The standards, for primary and intermediate students, will be used from 2010 and establish clear expectations of progress and achievement in reading, writing and mathematics.

 “Setting National Standards will assist teachers to identify and respond quickly when children are falling behind their peers. Intervening early will help ensure that students remain on track to obtain worthwhile qualifications in our education system,” said Mrs Tolley. 

The Ministry of Education will meet with education groups and parents around the country, from Paihia to Invercargill. People can send submissions to the Ministry, or have their say online at [www.minedu.govt.nz](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/).

Information about the National Standards programme, including the draft standards, plain language reports and meeting dates is available at [www.minedu.govt.nz/theMinistry/Consultation/NationalStandards.aspx](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/theMinistry/Consultation/NationalStandards.aspx).

Consultation on National Standards for use in Māori medium schools will take place in August and September 2009.
