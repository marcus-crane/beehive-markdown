Civil Defence Minister John Carter has welcomed the formalisation of a civil defence ‘hotline' that strengthens links between New Zealand and Australian emergency management agencies.

A formal Administrative Arrangement between the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management and the Attorney-General's Department of Australia was signed this week and includes 24/7 points of contact to keep dialogue open and co-ordinate communications.

‘Every country in the world needs help during a national emergency. We have had a series of ad hoc arrangements with our nearest neighbour, Australia, and this formalises those arrangements that have grown ‘organically' between our civil defence sectors over the years,' Mr Carter said.

He said the Arrangement is part of having strong international links for civil defence emergency management in New Zealand. 

‘Strong international links help ensure that New Zealand would receive international support quickly if it is needed. It also ensures we remain ‘a good global citizen' by supporting other countries in a disaster, especially our Asia Pacific neighbours.

‘There is also the advantage that we increase our own ability to respond in New Zealand by learning from international experience and exercises. This has been a key element of the relationships we have built thus far," Mr Carter said.

‘This Arrangement recognises a strong, working relationship and specified processes so that at any time of day or night we can immediately share information about an emergency and start arrangements to provide staff or resources.'

Mr Carter said the Ministry also works closely with other nations through a variety of international forums, including the United Nations, South Pacific Forum, APEC and ASEAN.
