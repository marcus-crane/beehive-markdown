Budget 2009 recognises the critical role science and technology will play in the economic recovery through substantial extra funding, Research, Science and Technology Minister Wayne Mapp says.

“Budget 2009 rewards leading and emerging scientists and supports excellence in research,” he says. “There is a substantial funding increase for areas of the research science and technology budget identified by the Government as priorities. This will build strength in research and support innovation in the New Zealand economy.”

The Budget delivers:

- An extra $40 million over four years to the Crown Research Institute Capability Fund. This reinforces the ability of CRIs to maintain and develop their nationally significant research.
- Funding of $36 million over four years to the Marsden Fund to provide for investigator-initiated excellent research.
- $32 million over four years for health research. The investment covers innovation in health delivery, research into targeted areas of health, and funding to sustain current health research investment.
- New funding of $4 million over four years for the Prime Minister’s Science Prizes. The prizes will provide a funding boost for the winning scientists and put the spotlight on excellence in science.
- A $16 million capital injection in 2010/11 for the Kiwi Advanced Research and Education Network (KAREN), to enhance New Zealand’s high-speed telecommunications research connectivity and capability.

Dr Mapp says that in addition to the increased funding in the Budget, he will work with stakeholders in the coming year to clarify New Zealand’s science priorities and provide greater certainty to the sector.
