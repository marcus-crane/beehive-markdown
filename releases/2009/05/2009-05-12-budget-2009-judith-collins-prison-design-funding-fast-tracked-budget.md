Minister of Corrections Hon Judith Collins announced today that the Government is funding the Department of Corrections to do initial design and planning work for the construction of additional prison beds.

Ms Collins says the prison population has been rising over a number of years and is forecast to continue to increase.

"Current prison population forecasts show a significant number of new beds will be required, particularly in the northern North Island. The Government is taking immediate steps to ensure that there is secure, safe and cost-effective accommodation in place to hold these prisoners," Ms Collins says.

"Today's confirmation of $24 million in funding will allow the Department of Corrections to complete detailed design and planning work for the construction of additional prison beds at different sites in the upper North Island.

"This design and planning work will put the Government in a strong position to decide which of these options should be progressed in Budget 2010."

Ms Collins says funding has also been provided to address the immediate need for beds through double bunking at Northland Region Corrections Facility, Auckland Region Women's Corrections Facility, Spring Hill Corrections Facility, Otago Corrections Facility, and Mt Eden.

"Significant construction is required over coming years to increase the number of prison beds. The programme will focus on cost effectively delivering increased and secure prison capacity in the upper North Island, where the need will be greatest," Ms Collins says.

"At the same time, it is essential that we reduce the number of prisoners who reoffend and find themselves back in the corrections system. This Government will boost rehabilitation, with more industry skills training and double the number of prisoners eligible for drug and alcohol treatment."
