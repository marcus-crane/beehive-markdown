An independent review of the effectiveness of the Māori Television Service (MTS) Act has come up with recommendations relating to the Māori language and culture, broadcasting platforms and  the provision of high-quality, cost effective services.

The Government and Te Pūtahi Paoho (the Māori television electoral college) have until the end of August to respond.

Associate Minister of Māori Affairs Georgina te Heuheu says she will not comment on the recommendations at this stage as she does not want to pre-empt the outcome.

A review of MTS’s effectiveness was required under the Act as soon as practicable, five years from its commencement date.

Tainui Stephens (Chair), Hone Edwards and Jane Huria were appointed to carry out the review. The review considered, among other issues, the following:

- MTS’s broadcasting platform, including UHF
- The convergence of broadcasting technology and other electronic media
- The establishment of MTS as multi-channel broadcaster
- MTS’s focus on and promotion of Māori language and culture
- Legislation that impacts on the ability of MTS to provide  high quality, cost-effective services
- Governance and the role of Te Pūtahi Paoho

The panel’s key recommendations are:

Māori language and culture

- 1.    Include the words preserve and protect before promote. Remove reference to a ‘broad viewing audience’ in the Act
- 2.    Amend the definition of te reo Māori and include a definition for the quality of language
- 3.    Change the quantum levels for Māori language content and remove all references to prime-time

Nature of MTS broadcasting platform

- 1.    Amend the Act to enable MTS to broadcast on all multi-media platforms
- 2.    MTS to retain UHF rights, post digital switch over

Quality

- 1.    MTS accountability for direct funding to be on a three-yearly basis
- 2.    MTS’s Māori language plan to align with an over-arching Māori language broadcasting plan

General recommendations related to the appointment and skill base of Te Pūtahi Paoho.
