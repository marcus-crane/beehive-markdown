The success of research proposals approved under a recent European Commission science programme highlights New Zealand's international research standing, Minister of Research, Science and Technology Wayne Mapp said today.

Six Government-supported proposals involving New Zealand research organisations have been successful in the first round of the European Commission's new International Research Staff Exchange Scheme (IRSES). Two of the proposals involve the University of Canterbury, one involves both the University of Canterbury and the University of Otago, and Crown research institutes Plant and Food Research, Scion and NIWA have one successful proposal each.

New Zealand performed well in comparison with other countries, with Government-supported institutions winning 10 per cent of the proposals approved. Dr Mapp said the Government had committed $802,000 over three years to support New Zealand participation in the first round of the scheme. 

"New Zealand's success in the scheme demonstrates the international quality of our research. The Government has supported the programme because we recognise the importance of international collaboration in science," he said. 

The areas of research covered by the proposals include climate change, collaborative relationships from forestry, development of aquaculture, and the genomics involved in growing red-coloured apples.

IRSES is a new initiative that supports long-term research partnerships between the European Union and countries such as New Zealand that have a science and technology co-operation agreement with the EU. 

The scheme will allow the successful New Zealand researchers to work in European research organisations for extended periods. In return, the New Zealand organisations will host European scientists on reciprocal visits.

The successful New Zealand proposals were made in partnership with researchers from a number of other countries including Australia, the United Kingdom, Greece, Norway, Germany, Sweden, Austria, Finland, Spain, France, Portugal, Japan, Israel, China, and the United States.
