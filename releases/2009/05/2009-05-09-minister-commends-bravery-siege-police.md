Police Minister Hon Judith Collins today commended police for bringing to a close the armed siege on Napier's Hospital Hill.

"I am enormously relieved that this siege has come to an end without further loss of life to police or innocent members of the public. This is a good outcome to what was a very serious situation," Ms Collins says.

"I would like to commend the excellent work of the police who brought this terrible situation to a close with perseverance, courage and professionalism. I would especially like to commend Superintendent Sam Hoyle for his leadership in a time of extreme crisis, and his team.

"Incidents such as this demonstrate the bravery and operational expertise that makes our police among the finest in the world. It reminds us of the dangers police face every day while keeping the public safe."

Ms Collins says she would like to thank the Napier community for the support it showed police during the past two days.

"Faced with an incredibly dangerous situation and loss of life, this community responded by pulling together and supporting those who have been displaced or suffered loss. The community's patience and assistance has been invaluable to the police.

"My thoughts are also with the civilian who was seriously injured in the shooting. I understand this man acted heroically in trying to stop the offender shooting at police officers.

"It is tragic when innocent members of the public are hurt in situations such as this. I would like to wish this brave man a speedy recovery."
