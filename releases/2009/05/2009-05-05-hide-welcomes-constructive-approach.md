The appointment by the Labour Party of Manurewa MP George Hawkins as Spokesman on Local Government represents a constructive move toward getting the best outcome for Auckland from reform process, says the Minister of Local Government, Rodney Hide.

"George has a wealth of experience in local government as a former Mayor of Papakura. I look forward to discussing representation issues with him. He is an enthusiast for the local part of local government and his views will be valuable as the restructuring process moves forward.

"No doubt we will have areas of disagreement on detail but I'm sure we will be able to find common ground on big picture issues. His usual constructive approach will be welcomed. Partisan politics must not get in the way of good decision making for the region."
