New Zealand is contributing $5.6 million to a trans-Tasman project that will improve eye health, and treat blindness in the Pacific, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

“It is estimated that there 80,000 blind people and a further 250,000 with impaired vision in the Pacific,” Mr McCully said.

“Up to 75 percent of blindness is preventable, and the economic and social impact of poor eye health in our region will continue to grow if not addressed.

“The government’s funding will allow the Fred Hollows Foundation New Zealand, over the next three years, to train and equip at least 45 eye nurses and eight eye doctors throughout the Pacific and in Timor-Leste.

“After training, each new eye doctor will be able to perform at least 200 cataract operations and see over 1000 new patients a year in their own country.

“The Foundation – which has an excellent reputation for the quality of its work in treating eyesight problems in developing nations – will also establish a regional surgical and training facility in Suva; initiate a new diabetes eye program, and establish locally-run eye testing and glasses supply services throughout the Pacific,” Mr McCully said.

The Australian government is contributing $11.2 million to this project.

The government’s aid and development agency, NZAID, has supported the Fred Hollows Foundation New Zealand to train eye health professionals, including doctors, ophthalmologists and nurses since 2002.
