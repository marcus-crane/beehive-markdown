Tariana Turia has commended a decision by South Auckland-based company Sanitarium to close its factory for a day and still pay its 240 workers so they can address their wellbeing issues.

"The fact that the company has decided this, in this tough economic time, is remarkable and I commend them for their social leadership in truly believing our people are our greatest resource."

"This event is a great example of what happens when corporates, not-for-profit groups and the government sector work together."

"I encourage other corporations to follow Sanitarium's lead and realise that this is not a loss but a move that is likely to produce long term benefits for their company., their employees and the wider community in which they operate."

The Sanitarium workers will attend a number of presentations today, held away from their workplace, where non-profit and government professions will give them information on health and wellbeing, including, coping with stress and fatigue, drug and alcohol misuse, nutrition, diabetes, budgeting, injury management, disease prevention and exercise for health.

The event is being held as part of the Pautaunofo Manukau Project which aims to raise awareness of health and safety rights and obligations and to improve workplace safety practices for Pacific workers in the Manukau region.

Other groups supporting the event are: Counties Manukau DHB and city council, Diabetes Project Trust, ALAC, Department of Labour, AA, Heart Foundation, CTU Komiti Pasifika, EPMU, Sports Manu Trust, Arthritis NZ and Open Polytech.
