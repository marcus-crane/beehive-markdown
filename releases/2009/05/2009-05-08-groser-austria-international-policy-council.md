Associate Minister for Climate Change Issues, Tim Groser, leaves for Salzburg, Austria, tomorrow where he will deliver a keynote address on climate change, trade and agriculture to the International Food and Agriculture Trade Policy Council (IPC).

"The IPC is the leading international think tank on the agriculture and trade relationship.

"How agriculture and trade contribute to a climate change agreement in Copenhagen at the end of this year matters a lot to the world, and to developing countries in particular. New Zealand has a unique perspective to bring to this discussion," Mr Groser said.

Mr Groser then travels to Washington from May 12-15.
