The Crown signed a Deed of Settlement with iwi of the South Island and the Hauraki for an early cash settlement of obligations under the Maori Aquaculture Settlement in a ceremony at the Te Papa Marae, Fisheries Minister Hon Phil Heatley announced today.

This is the first Deed of Settlement to be signed by the new government.

The agreement delivers a one-off cash payment of $97 million in full and final settlement of all Crown obligations for “pre-commencement space” – aquaculture space that was approved between 21 September 1992 and 31 December 2004 under the previous marine farming regime.

This settlement covers the vast majority of New Zealand’s current aquaculture development areas including the Marlborough Sounds, Tasman Bay and Hauraki Gulf, along with the remainder of the South Island.

“I and other government ministers, including the Prime Minister, were very pleased to take this important step in meeting the Crown’s obligations to Maori for aquaculture space,” Mr Heatley said.

“Settling claims for commercial aquaculture space will give a financial boost to the iwi groups involved as well as helping to give the aquaculture industry certainty for future development.”

“This is an innovative and ground breaking agreement. It has required hard work, co-operation and good faith negotiation along with a shared determination to reach a settlement.”

Mr Heatley congratulated everyone involved in the settlement process and thanked them for their hard work.

“What has been achieved today by iwi and the Crown is testament to what can be achieved by working together with a common aim. I hope it can serve as a blueprint for future settlement negotiations.”

To complete the settlement and make the payment to iwi, it will be necessary to amend the Maori Aquaculture Settlement Act.

“I intend to table an amendment bill in Parliament tomorrow that will receive its first reading next Tuesday and, subject to Parliament’s approval, be effective by the end of the year,” Mr Heatley said.

“The Government wants to complete the settlement as quickly as possible; we want to see the settlement payment flowing through to iwi so they can use it for the benefit of their people.”

The Crown’s focus will now move to identifying opportunities to settle the few remaining regions where aquaculture exists.
