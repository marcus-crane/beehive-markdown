Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee has welcomed the launch of a national programme to improve the energy performance of New Zealand’s tourism businesses.

“The results from the pilot programme, a joint project between the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) and the Tourism Industry Association (TIA), showed this was a worthwhile investment.

If all of the 16,000 tourism businesses in New Zealand made similar savings to businesses in the pilot programme, that’s nearly $500 million dollars a year that could be invested elsewhere,” said Mr Brownlee.

The Tourism Energy Efficiency Programme was launched by the Associate Minister of Tourism, Jonathan Coleman, in Auckland today.

It will improve the competitiveness and environmental credentials of New Zealand tourism businesses through better energy management.

“This programme provides practical assistance for tourism businesses in the accommodation and transport sectors to use energy management to reduce costs, reduce environmental impacts, retain jobs and keep thriving,” said Mr Brownlee.

“Tourism is a $20 billion industry that contributes close to 10% of New Zealand’s GDP and employs one in ten New Zealanders, Mr Brownlee said. “It is an industry that is vital for our economy.”

“It is also an industry that relies on New Zealand’s unique natural environment as the main tourism product,” he said.

Participating businesses receive a detailed energy audit, identifying potential dollar and energy savings, at approximately half the normal price. The businesses also receive free mentoring and assistance in implementing energy saving opportunities.

The programme was first developed as a regional pilot in 2008. Twelve tourism businesses identified potential energy savings worth $375,000 a year, and annual savings of over 700 tonnes of CO2, equivalent to taking 170 cars off the road.

Results from the programme are then shared with other tourism businesses to encourage widespread replication.

The government, through EECA, contributed $160,000 to the pilot project. An additional $287,000 has been allocated to the next phase of the project which will audit a further 14 tourism operations.
