District Health Boards will receive an extra $2.1 billion over four years in Budget 2009.

"Despite the difficult economic and fiscal situation, Vote Health funding will continue to increase," Health Minister Tony Ryall says. "Most of the extra money will go to DHBs and boosting front line services like better maternity services and improved availability of subsidised medicines." 

"The Government is fully committed to providing faster, more convenient front line health services for New Zealanders," Mr Ryall says.

The Government has also set aside $70 million over four years to boost the health workforce by up to 800 new health professionals required to staff new dedicated elective surgery theatres planned.

"This initiative will require us to train additional surgeons, anaesthetists, resident medical officers, nurses and technicians and other health professionals to staff and support the new theatres.

"The Government is also committed to building 20 new elective surgery theatres, with associated beds and facilities as part of its policy to reduce hospital waiting times and increase access to elective surgery."

Funding for these facilities will be progressively allocated from the Government's health capital budget.

Phasing and implementation of the training is expected to start at the beginning of next year.
