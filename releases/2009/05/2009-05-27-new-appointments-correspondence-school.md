Education Minister Anne Tolley has appointed two new parent community representatives to The Correspondence School Board of Trustees.

Don Blakeney and Jacky Stafford have been selected following calls for nominations and expressions of interest, and will sit on the board until 9 September 2012.

"Both appointees have extensive community leadership experience and will bring an extra dimension to the board," says Mrs Tolley.

"This follows the Government's commitment to give parents a voice on the board of the Correspondence School."

Jacky Stafford, from Waipukurau, is the Education Convenor for Rural Women New Zealand and is the chairperson of the Rural Education Reference Group.

Don Blakeney, of Tolaga Bay, is the director of Anaura Associates Trust, a not-for-profit community organisation and is a former Chief Executive of the New Zealand Film Commission.

A staff representative will also join the board after a separate election process.
