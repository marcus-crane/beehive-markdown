New Zealand and the European Union are exploring the benefits of a comprehensive bilateral agreement covering political, security and economic areas, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.

Mr McCully is in Brussels for six-monthly EU foreign policy consultations, where he met with senior figures, including High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Dr Javier Solana; External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner, and Czech Presidency representatives.

"Our discussions show a willingness on both sides to explore the potential for a formal agreement to provide the basis for a deeper and more long-term relationship," Mr McCully said.

"My talks in Brussels were aimed at moving forward the agreement earlier this year between Prime Minister John Key and European Commission President José Manuel Barroso to jointly examine ways to upgrade the New Zealand-EU relationship.

"Officials will now prepare a report ahead of the December foreign policy consultations in Stockholm.

"In addition to bilateral issues, our discussions covered a range of issues, including Fiji, security in Asia, Afghanistan, the Middle East, and the global economic crisis.

"Our dialogue with the EU is a valuable one, and these talks confirmed the close and likeminded approach we take internationally," Mr McCully said.

New Zealand and the EU concluded a Joint Declaration on Relations and Cooperation in 2007, which replaced and strengthened existing cooperation agreements.
