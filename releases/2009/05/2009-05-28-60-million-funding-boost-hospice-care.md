The Government has boosted hospice care funding by $60 million over the next four years, increasing the proportion of average hospice funding provided by taxpayers to 70 per cent.

The new initiative meets the Government's election commitment to meet a funding shortfall for hospices hit by falling levels of fund raising, increasing demand and rising costs.

Government funding currently provides around half of average hospice funding.  
The extra funding includes $1.3 million a year to help address difficulties in accessing palliative care services. That will be more clearly identified through a national stock take of specialist palliative care services due later this year.

Hospices provide terminally ill people and their families with the services and support they need. In many communities, hospices provide palliative care in the home, as well as at in-patient facilities.

Hospice services include community palliative care, inpatient care, a volunteer support network, day care facilities, family support, bereavement counselling and social work and chaplaincy.  
Hospices are partly funded through District Health Boards, with additional funding sourced from community fund raising.
