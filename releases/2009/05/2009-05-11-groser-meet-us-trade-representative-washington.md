Minister of Trade and Associate Minister for Climate Change Issues, Tim Groser, will meet with members of the new US Administration including US Trade Representative, Ron Kirk, and the US Special Envoy for Climate Change, Todd Stern, when he travels to Washington from May 12-15.

"US leadership is critical to moving the WTO Doha trade negotiations forward. I was delighted by USTR Kirk's recent statement of commitment to concluding the round and look forward to discussing specifics when we meet," Mr Groser said. 

"I will also be engaging senior US figures on their approach to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) - an innovative FTA proposal involving eight countries, including the United States and New Zealand. The TPP would be a platform for a wider trade agreement in the Asia-Pacific region. New Zealand is a strong proponent.

"I'm also looking forward to engaging with my counterparts on climate change issues. The US has a fundamentally important role to play as the international community grapples with how best to address climate change.

"New Zealand welcomes the strong leadership the new Administration has shown. We look forward to working with the US in this endeavour, as we do on so many international issues."

Graeme Harrison, Chairman of the International Business Forum is accompanying Mr Groser on his programme in Washington.
