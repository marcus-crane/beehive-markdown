The Government will invest close to $3 billion in the State Highway network over the next three years, delivering significant productivity gains over time, Transport Minister Steven Joyce says.

This will be about $1 billion more than the previous Government allocated.

“Our economy relies on the State Highway network – when traffic isn’t moving, neither is the country.

“That’s why the Government is committing more of the land transport fund to State Highways than every before.  
   
“This increase is not a one-off.  We’ll now spend about a billion dollars each year on State Highway construction.”

This will provide around $10.7 billion over 10 years for investment in the State Highway network.  
Priority projects for that investment include the seven initial Roads of National Significance:

- Puhoi to Wellsford – State Highway 1
- Completion of the Auckland western ring route – State Highways 20, 16, 18
- Auckland Victoria Park bottleneck – State Highway 1
- Waikato Expressway – State Highway 1
- Tauranga Eastern Corridor – State Highway 2
- Wellington Northern Corridor (Levin to Wellington)  – State Highway 1
- Christchurch motorway projects

The Government expects these projects to be substantially progressed over the next 10 years.

“The Government is committed to ensuring New Zealand is as productive as we can be and that Kiwis spend less time stuck in traffic and more time growing the economy,” Mr Joyce says.
