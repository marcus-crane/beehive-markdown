Young parents wanting to stay in education will continue to get help with childcare costs, Minister for Social Development Paula Bennett announced today.

The Young Parent Childcare Payment helps teenage parents stay in secondary school by meeting childcare costs for their children if they don't qualify for other assistance.

The average weekly supplement rate of Young Parent Childcare Payment is $134 per week. Under the previous government, the $300,000 annual funding for the scheme stopped on December 31 2008.

"This Government wants to help ensure that becoming a young parent is not a roadblock to a good education. Helping with childcare costs removes a barrier that might otherwise stop them staying at school.

"Continuing in education ensures these young parents are better prepared for the workforce so they can financially support their family. It also sends a strong, positive message to their own children about the importance of education.

"It is essential that young parents are able to remain engaged with their peers in a positive way. Continuing with education helps young parents stay on a career path and avoid a lifetime of welfare dependency," Ms Bennett said.
