State Services Minister Tony Ryall has announced a redeployment option to help match State servants who are made redundant with other jobs in the State Services.

"Some departments are reducing staff numbers while others are increasing frontline services in response to government priorities.  We've developed a redeployment option in conjunction with the PSA to retain the skills and knowledge of experienced State servants" says Mr Ryall.

State servants who've been made redundant will now have the option of entering a redeployment pool during their notice period. 

"Of course we don't expect this to be a fix-all for everybody. Some public servants will choose not to take part or will not be suited to available positions" says Mr Ryall.

The Government expects all departments to consider offering any vacant or new positions to State servants in the pool where those State servants are well suited to the position.  See *Government Expectations for Redeployment in the State Services* on the State Services Commission website [www.ssc.govt.nz/redeployment](http://www.ssc.govt.nz/redeployment).

"This is about departments working across the State Services with the PSA to minimise the impact of staffing changes on individual State servants. It will also look after the taxpayers' interest by reducing the cost of redundancy payments" says Mr Ryall.

The State Services Commission will provide guidance to departments and convene a network of agency representatives and the PSA to facilitate redeployments.

The State Services redeployment process will be available for all agencies within the State Services, including Public Service departments, non-Public Service departments, and Crown entities.
