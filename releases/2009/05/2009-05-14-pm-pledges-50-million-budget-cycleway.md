The Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism, John Key has today promised $50 million dollars over three years for the New Zealand Cycleway Project.

Speaking at the New Zealand Hotel Industry Conference in Auckland, Mr Key says the project, first raised at the Job Summit, will create a high quality tourism asset that will enhance New Zealand’s competitiveness as a tourism destination, provide employment, and stimulate economic development opportunities in regional economies.

“I propose to create a series of ‘Great Rides’ of New Zealand, with a long term aim of creating a network throughout the country.”

In this month’s Budget, the Ministry of Tourism will receive $50 million in operating funding to progress the Cycleway.

“Some promising routes have already been identified and I expect to have an announcement on them in the next couple of months.

“I am also establishing an Advisory Group that will look at other regional cycleway proposals and work with those regions on feasibility work and technical advice.

“This $50 million investment will create jobs through its design and construction, while also creating a high quality tourism asset that will complement our 100% Pure New Zealand brand.”
