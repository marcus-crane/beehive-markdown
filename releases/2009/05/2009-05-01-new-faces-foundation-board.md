Minister of Research, Science and Technology Wayne Mapp has announced two new appointments to the board of the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology – the main government funding body for science and technology.

They are:

- Dr William Rolleston, Director of South Pacific Sera
- Phil O’Reilly, Chief Executive of Business New Zealand

They replace board members Dr Diana Hill and Dr Bronwen Connor, whose terms expired on 30 April.

“William Rolleston and Phil O’Reilly are leaders with particular strengths in the areas of science entrepreneurship and business,” Dr Mapp said.

“Establishing better links between science and business is a major priority.  The appointment of Dr Rolleston and Mr O’Reilly will bring significant science entrepreneurship to the board.   This, teamed with the skills and knowledge of the other board members, will help the Foundation to make the best decisions on how to invest in New Zealand research, science and technology.”

“I thank Dr Diana Hill and Dr Bronwen Connor for the valuable contributions they have made while on the board.” 

The Foundation for Research, Science and Technology was established by the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology Act 1990 to invest in science and technology research for the benefit of New Zealand.  It invests about $500 million of public money per annum through a number of funds and schemes to help support:

- “public good” related science and technology, undertaken by Crown Research Institutes, universities, private researchers and industry led-consortia
- private sector business research and development, and
- New Zealand's top achieving students and researchers.

Others on the FRST board are Chair Bryan Gould, Deputy Chair Jim McLean, and members Associate Professor Pare Keiha, Warren Larsen, Dr Tom Richardson, Denise Church, and Professor Roberta Farrell.
