Minister of Research, Science and Technology Wayne Mapp has congratulated Landcare Research on achieving a world first in climate change measurement.

"The carboNZero programme it manages is the first greenhouse gas certification scheme in the world to receive accreditation under the rules of the International Accreditation Forum," he said.

"Their success shows that once again New Zealand is leading the way in developing innovative solutions, this time in climate change." 

The programme provides an online calculator for organisations and households to measure their greenhouse gas emissions (or carbon footprint) and to understand their emission sources.

Organisations which have reduced and accounted for unavoidable emissions can be certificated (subject to an audit) and use the information for their carbon labelling requirements.

"This will be a boost for local firms, as it supports their products sold to consumers around the world. It is an excellent example of alignment with broader government objectives," the Minister said.

"This programme gives New Zealand exporters immediate recognition in overseas markets. The accreditation is an important sign of confidence in the carboNZero programme," Dr Mapp said.
