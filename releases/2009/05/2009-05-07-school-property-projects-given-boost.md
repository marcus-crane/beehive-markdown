Education Minister, Anne Tolley, has today announced new initiatives to allow schools to get their property programmes underway more quickly.

“The changes will see a relaxation of some of the Ministry of Education's property project requirements that schools must currently follow when planning and designing classroom upgrades and other similar work,” says Mrs Tolley.

“These more streamlined processes should enable schools to get their building work underway more quickly, giving the economy a boost in the process.

“School property spending is critical to the government’s economic stimulus package announced in February, therefore I asked the Ministry of Education to review its project management requirements to ensure there were no unnecessary roadblocks hindering school building projects.”

The first set of initiatives is now in place, with more planned for July.

“I often receive valuable feedback from schools about how unnecessary bureaucracy can prevent them getting on with the job,” says Mrs Tolley.

"Some checks and balances do need to be in place, but sometimes it can be a case of overkill. The changes announced today are the first step in getting the balance right.”
