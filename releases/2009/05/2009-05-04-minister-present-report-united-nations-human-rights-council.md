The Minister of Justice, Simon Power, leaves for Geneva today to present New Zealand's National Report to the United Nations Human Rights Council under the new Universal Periodic Review mechanism.

The presentation takes place on Thursday, New Zealand time.

"New Zealand takes its human rights commitments seriously, and I look forward to presenting our first National Report," Mr Power said.

"The new Universal Periodic Review process exposes all United Nations members to a review of the on-the-ground human rights situation in their country" Mr Power said.

"New Zealand has challenges it must face, especially in a recession, but we can be proud of our history in human rights and of our efforts to protect the most vulnerable in society.

"This is an important occasion where New Zealand has an opportunity to share our positive experiences and learn from others."

Mr Power said human rights were not just rights that people exercised when they were before a court of law, but were also the right to protection of the family, mothers, and children, and the right to an adequate standard of living. 

New Zealand's National Report is the product of extensive public consultation.
