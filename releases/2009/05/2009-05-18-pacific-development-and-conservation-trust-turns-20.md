The 20th anniversary of the Pacific Development and Conservation Trust will be marked at a reception at Parliament tonight hosted by the Minister for Disarmament and Arms Control Georgina te Heuheu.

The trust was set up in May 1989 in recognition of the events surrounding the destruction of the Rainbow Warrior in 1986. Each year the trust makes grants to charitable projects benefiting New Zealand or South Pacific countries.

"The Pacific Development and Conservation Trust has a vision of a peaceful, sustainable Pacific region where all cultures flourish and the natural environment is respected," Mrs te Heuheu said.

Over the past two decades, the trust has awarded an average of $300,000 each year to groups in New Zealand and the South Pacific who are working towards this vision.

Grants made by the trust have assisted with the conservation of the South Pacific's natural environment; promoted the peaceful development of the South Pacific and its peoples; and encouraged and promoted the cultural heritage of the peoples of the South Pacific.

The trust is committed to supporting sustainable development and projects that will continue to have long-term effects. 

Recent grants have been made to projects which will provide safe drinking water and sanitation to communities in Papua New Guinea. Another will help construct a micro-hydroelectric power plant to provide electricity to the residents of Asanvari Village, Vanuatu.

"The long-term benefits of the trust's funding can be seen here in New Zealand in successful ongoing conservation projects such as the Kaipatiki Stream restoration on the North Shore, the Karori Wildlife Sanctuary in Wellington, and the Otipua Wetland restoration in Timaru," Mrs te Heuheu said.
