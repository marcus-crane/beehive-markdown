The end of Rape Awareness Week does not mean the end being vigilant about the impact rape has on its victims and on our society, Women's Affairs Minister Pansy Wong says today.

She says Rape Awareness Week was a timely reminder to all New Zealanders that we must work together as a nation of men and women to put a stop to this horrendous crime.

Rape is the most costly crime in New Zealand and it is estimated that 19 percent of women, and five percent of men, experience sexual violence at some point in their lives. It is also one of New Zealand's most significantly under-reported crimes with only an estimated nine percent of sexual crimes being reported to police.

"As Rape Awareness Week concludes for 2009, I urge all New Zealanders - men and women - to continue to work together to end sexual violence," Mrs Wong says.

"All women have a right to be safe and free from all forms of sexual violence and this government is committed to a multi-faceted approach to addressing the problem of sexual violence. This includes preventing sexual violence from occurring, improving support for victims, and increasing accountability for offenders.

"Rape and sexual violence are horrendous crimes that impact greatly on our society with the psychological and social impacts of rape often devastating the lives of victims and their families. 

"Victims often experience shock, fear, guilt, shame, depression and have difficulty trusting others. Victims can be left feeling vulnerable and degraded, and this can impact on their ability to participate in society," Mrs Wong says.
