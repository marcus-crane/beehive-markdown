An Issues Paper that aims to generate public discussion and ideas about how to address issues around electoral finance reform has been released, Justice Minister Simon Power said today.

"The Issues Paper allows the public to have a say on what kind of electoral finance system New Zealand should have, and is designed to ask questions rather than provide answers," Mr Power said.

"There are a lot of good ideas out there and the Government wants to hear those ideas before making any decisions."

The review of electoral finance legislation is being carried out in three stages. Each stage provides an opportunity for the public to have a say.

The first stage is the Issues Paper. Views received on the Issues Paper will be incorporated in a Proposal Document that will set out Government proposals for new legislation. This will be released in August this year.

The final stage will be the parliamentary process, and there will be a further opportunity for the public to provide feedback at the Select Committee phase. 

"The Government wants to engage all parliamentary parties and the public in order to achieve the type of broad consensus that has historically been the hallmark of electoral law reform," Mr Power said.

"We acknowledge that there may be differences in opinion, but we will be listening carefully to the views of parliamentary parties and the public."

Consultation on the Issues Paper closes on 26 June 2009.
