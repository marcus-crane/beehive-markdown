Career diplomat Mark Ramsden will be New Zealand's new High Commissioner to the Solomon Islands, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"New Zealand and Solomon Islands enjoy a close relationship across a range of areas, including peace support and development work," Mr McCully said.

"There are strong personal links, with New Zealanders participating in the Regional Assistance Mission (RAMSI) there, and Solomon Islanders coming here under the seasonal working scheme.

"RAMSI has made a major contribution to supporting peace and security in the Solomons since 2003, and New Zealand has played a major role.

"Solomon Islands is a major development partner for New Zealand, and we are committed to continuing and strengthening that long-term partnership," Mr McCully said.

Mr Ramsden has previously been posted to Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, and New York. He currently holds a senior position in the government's aid and development agency, NZAID, working on Pacific regional growth and governance issues. 

He takes up his appointment in September, replacing Deborah Panckhurst, who is returning to Wellington.
