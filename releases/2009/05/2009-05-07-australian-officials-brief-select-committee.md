Australian Government officials will brief the Emissions Trading Scheme Review Committee next Monday on the Australian Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, Minister for Climate Change Issues Nick Smith announced today.

"In discussions this week with the Australian Minister for Climate Change Penny Wong we agreed that it would be useful for the Select Committee reviewing the New Zealand ETS to be well briefed on the Australian scheme, including the latest changes.

"That is why officials from the Australian Government will brief the Select Committee via video-link next Monday afternoon.

"The Select Committee members will have the opportunity to hear first hand details of the design process and economic modelling underpinning the CPRS and the timetable of the Australian scheme.

"This briefing of the Select Committee builds on the initiative taken at the Prime Ministerial Summit in early March between John Key and Kevin Rudd to explore harmonisation of our responses to climate change and the establishment of the Trans-Tasman Officials Group agreed by Senator Wong and myself.

"Discussions are at an early stage but the briefing to the Select Committee shows a genuine willingness on both sides of the Tasman to work more closely together on the global challenge of climate change."
