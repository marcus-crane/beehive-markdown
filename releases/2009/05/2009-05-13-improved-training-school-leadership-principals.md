Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced a new plan designed to increase the number of education leaders and principals in New Zealand schools.

The Professional Leadership Plan sets out the government’s aim to attract, develop and support talented leaders over the next two years. The Plan focuses on hard-to-staff schools and on upskilling existing Maori and Pasifika teachers. 

“It focuses on developing both experienced school leaders and those who aspire to be principals,” says Mrs Tolley.

“The national programme for aspiring principals will build on the successful pilot. The training will give future principals the knowledge, skills and support they need to lead effective teaching and learning for every student, and it will help teachers move more quickly into leadership positions in their schools.

"There will also be support for experienced principals in primary, secondary and area schools. This will be up and running by July this year.”

Programmes under the Professional Leadership Plan focus on managing school operations effectively, working with parents, families and whanau, and leading effective teaching and learning in schools.

“There is a focus on initiatives that will achieve measurable gains for all student groups, but in particular for Maori, Pasifika and special education students,” says Mrs Tolley.

The training will also assist the implementation of National Standards for reading, writing and mathematics in Years One to Eight.
