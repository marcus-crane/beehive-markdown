Agriculture Minister David Carter says the High Court's quashing of legal action by the New Zealand Fish and Game Council to gain public access to high country land, raises questions about the Council's direction and leadership.

"I seriously question the use of hunting and fishing licensing fees in taking this action, and I will be discussing this further with the Minister of Conservation.

"I am concerned this divisive action was taken when there was no foundation for Fish and Game's claim for greater public access to high country stations.

"A pastoral lease gives the runholder the right to say who has access to their leasehold land. This is no different from private property owners," says Mr Carter.

"The fundamental duty of Fish and Game is to advocate for hunters and fishers, and to help enhance their relationship with rural landowners.

"This case has instead undoubtedly been a costly exercise, not only for Fish and Game members, but also for high country farmers. This action has been anything but a relationship-builder."
