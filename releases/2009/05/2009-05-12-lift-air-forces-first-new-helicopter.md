The Air Force's new NH-90 helicopters are on the way, Defence Minister Wayne Mapp said today.

The first of the eight-strong fleet had its initial test flight at manufacturer NH Industries in Marignane, France, last week. The flight test crew reported that the 25-minute flight went very well, Dr Mapp said.

"This is great news. These helicopters will be a cornerstone of the Defence Force's capability in the future. They will perform all the military functions required and like the Navy's new patrol vessels will be used to support the work of many other agencies, such as the Police and Customs," Dr Mapp said.

"This first flight is a welcome milestone in the process." 

The NH-90 medium utility helicopters are the replacements for the Air Force's 40-year-old Iroquois fleet. They are designed for a wide range of roles in both military and civil operations. The delivery schedule calls for the first helicopter to be offered for acceptance in March next year. That aircraft will then become the training vehicle for aircrew and maintainers.
