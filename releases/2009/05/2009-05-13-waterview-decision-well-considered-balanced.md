Transport Minister Steven Joyce has welcomed the announcement of the NZ Transport Agency’s preferred option for the completion of the Western Ring Route.

He says the $1.4 billion option strikes a fair balance between the needs of the local community and those of the country and the economy.

The $1.4 billion proposed route includes building the motorway under Great North Road and in a tunnel under New North Road and under Avondale Heights.  The resulting underground sections represent around 60% of the road’s length.

South of New North Road the motorway runs through the Alan Wood Reserve corridor to the west of Hendon Ave. The road will run alongside the long -designated Avondale to Southdown rail link.

Waterview Primary School will not be impacted any more than the previous tunnel proposal, as the proposed alignment at the north end of the motorway mirrors that previously proposed.

Mr Joyce says a straight, on-the-surface highway would not have been acceptable to the government when there were reasonable alternatives available that would not have such an impact on the community.

He says this proposed route is about half the price of the previous government’s $2.77 billion two-lane twin tunnel option, and will be future-proofed as it can be easily expanded to three lanes in each direction.

“This is a cost-effective option but it’s still important to note that this will be New Zealand’s most expensive roading project ever by a considerable margin.

“While this option has very strong community and environmental mitigation, I do acknowledge that it still significantly affects some members of the community.  I encourage them to take part in the community engagement process that the NZ Transport Agency will soon begin.

“There were no easy options here but I believe this proposal will go a long way towards easing the concerns of many, while being cost-effective for New Zealand.”

Mr Joyce says the completion of the route is essential to the continued growth and economic development in the Auckland region.

“It will also contribute to better links for business and freight between key industrial hubs in the cities of Manukau, Auckland, Waitakere and North Shore.”
