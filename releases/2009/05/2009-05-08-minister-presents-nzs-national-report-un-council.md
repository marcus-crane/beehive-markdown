The Minister of Justice, Simon Power, last night presented New Zealand’s National Report to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. 

He appeared as part of New Zealand’s participation in the Universal Periodic Review.

Mr Power made an opening statement addressing the challenges facing New Zealand and detailing some of the initiatives by the Government to assist vulnerable New Zealanders. He then answered questions from member and observer states of the Human Rights Council.

“I appreciated the open and constructive manner New Zealand’s human rights situation was discussed by the Human Rights Council," Mr Power said.

“It's important to front up with our own situation so that we can credibly discuss the challenges facing other countries.

“New Zealand will seriously consider the recommendations put to it as a result of the review."

A copy of New Zealand’s National Report and an archived webcast of New Zealand’s appearance at the Universal Periodic Review are available on the UPR website:  [http://www.upr-info.org/](http://www.upr-info.org/)
