Agriculture and Biosecurity Minister David Carter has confirmed that animal welfare investigators are carrying out an inspection of the pig farm at the centre of TVNZ's ‘Sunday' programme.

The Minister yesterday urged animal rights group, SAFE, to reveal the location of the property so it could be inspected by Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry animal welfare investigators.

"SAFE has not contacted my office and has instead speculated on the property involved through media channels.  From various sources, MAF has identified the farm and is now carrying out an investigation," said Mr Carter.

"I am very concerned about animal welfare and no one wants to see animals suffer.  This is why I urged SAFE to provide details of the property yesterday so the authorities could take the appropriate action immediately.

"In fact, SAFE could have revealed details of the property when it first received the recorded footage.

"Instead, the organisation seems more intent on playing publicity games than assisting the animals on this farm.  I trust that SAFE will cooperate fully with the MAF investigation and provide them with any further evidence they may need.

"As an investigation is now underway, I will not be commenting further on the details of this case," Mr Carter said.
