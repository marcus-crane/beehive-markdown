Civil Defence Minister John Carter has offered his condolences to the family and colleagues of Senior Constable Len Snee who died of gunshot wounds in the Napier siege.

Mr Carter said his thoughts were also with the three men wounded in the incident, Senior Constables Grant Diver and Bruce Miller and a member of the public, Leonard Holmwood.

Mr Carter also praised the sensitive and organised response of Civil Defence volunteers in the city, led by Napier City Council Civil Defence manager Angela Reade.

‘Civil defence volunteers worked in shifts to man the welfare centre, which registered more than 300 people forced from their homes by the incident. More than 100 were given alternative accommodated each night,' Mr Carter said.

‘This operation could have stretched over several more days,' Mr Carter said. ‘Other civil defence groups in the region were ready to give assistance if they were needed. It was a good response,' he said

Mr Carter also noted the efforts of Police and emergency services in the city that had contained the events and offered prompt assistance to the people affected.

‘Mayor Barbara Arnott is to be complimented for the response in her town to this tragedy and the tensions the siege caused,' Mr Carter said.

‘I understand Ms Arnott's home was in the street affected by the siege, so she experienced the tension firsthand and, like many other people, was forced from her home.'

‘It was good to see hoteliers and moteliers also providing accommodation to displaced families. People pull together at times like this and that is also a key element in civil defence.'
