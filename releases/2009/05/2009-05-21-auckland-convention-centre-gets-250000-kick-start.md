Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism John Key, has announced the Government will contribute a quarter of a million dollars to conduct a feasibility study into the development of an international conference centre in Auckland that will cater for up to 4,000 people.

"New Zealand lacks a large-scale conventions and exhibitions centre that is capable of attracting big international conferences. As a result, we may be missing out on thousands of high-value visitors that could be interested in coming to New Zealand.

"There is no doubt that business visitors tend to be higher spenders than regular tourists and when they are here on business they often tag on a holiday as well.

"I have allocated $250,000 from the New Zealand Tourism Strategy Implementation Fund to allow the Government, in conjunction with Auckland City Council, to carry out this study and a business case.

"If the recommendations from the feasibility study are positive, I expect we will prepare a detailed business case and an establishment plan to develop a large international conference centre in Auckland."

The Auckland City Council will put a further $20,000 towards the feasibility study and contribute $30,000 for the business case.

"The lack of a large convention centre is losing us business visitors. We need to do more to tap into this higher-value market and today's announcement will kick start that objective."
