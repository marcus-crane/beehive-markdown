This year’s Youth Week is all about how young people interact with their parents and caregivers – and vice versa, says Youth Affairs Minister Paula Bennett.

The Minister is supporting national Youth Week, which this year runs from 23 May to 31 May, with a focus on quality relationships with young people.

“This year’s theme is ‘Making Time for Youth’ – it’s about encouraging parents and caregivers to spend more time with our young people, and about young people making time for their elders, “ Ms Bennett says.

Key findings from the Youth 2007 survey of 10, 000 secondary school students found about 45 percent of those interviewed felt they didn’t get enough time with their parents, especially girls with their mothers.

Launching Youth Week 2009 in Wellington this afternoon, Minister Bennett has been part of a discussion panel which focused on how important it is for young people to negotiate time with their parents.

“If young people have those strong relationships with the adults around them, they’re simply better equipped to cope with the challenges and changes in their lives.”

A range of events around the country this Youth Week will reflect the diversity of young Kiwis and include performances by young musicians, dance competitions, exhibitions and more.

“Youth Week is a great chance for New Zealanders of all ages to connect with the young people in their lives. Get out there, spend some time together and listen to each other. I believe there’s a chance for surprise on all sides.”
