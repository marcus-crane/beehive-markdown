Police Minister Judith Collins has offered her deepest sympathies to the family of Senior Constable Len Snee of Taradale Police who died during an armed siege in Napier yesterday.

"I am devastated by news of Senior Constable Snee's death and offer my sincerest condolences to his family. I can only begin to imagine their grief at the tragic loss of a beloved husband and father," Ms Collins says.

"Senior Constable Snee was with the Police for 32 years and was a hugely popular and respected member of the community. All of Napier will mourn his loss."

Ms Collins said her thoughts were also with the other two officers involved, Constables Bruce Miller and Grant Diver, their families and colleagues.

"There is no worse news than that officers have been hurt or killed while on duty. Yesterday's shooting highlights that policing is a dangerous job with officers taking their lives in their hands every day," Ms Collins says.

"I can only hope that Constables Miller and Diver make a speedy recovery from their injuries."

Ms Collins will be in Napier today to offer support for the families of the officers involved, and their police colleagues.
