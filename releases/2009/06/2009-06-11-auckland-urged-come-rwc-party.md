Prime Minister John Key has today urged Auckland leaders to unite in the interests of making the Rugby World Cup an event that will create legacy infrastructure for the region and the country.

Speaking at the TRENZ event in Auckland, Mr Key spoke of his vision for Queens Wharf being the epicentre of Rugby World Cup 2011.

“The reform of Auckland governance presents a real opportunity to put in place a programme to transform the waterfront.

“It is my view that there is an opportunity to turn Queens Wharf into an important public space.

“I can today confirm that as a bare minimum we have secured Queens Wharf for a number of initiatives for the period of the Rugby World Cup.

“At the very least this will see Queens Wharf loaned from the Ports of Auckland for the period of the Cup.

“Urgent negotiations are continuing to purchase the wharf so that it can be a legacy asset with a view to long-term development.

“I have told my ministers to put serious work into making this happen.”

Mr Key described a Rugby World Cup ‘Live Site’ - a large open air space capable of hosting between 10,000 and 15,000 people, which will be the focus for a mass public opening ceremony and act as a magnet for fans during the six-week tournament – the tournament’s ‘party central’.

In the event that Queens Wharf is purchased, plans such as the development of an international cruise ship terminal would occur, Mr Key said.

“The Rugby World Cup will be a party on a scale never seen in this country before – but it will require Auckland to come to the party first,” he said.
