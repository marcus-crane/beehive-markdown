Families with new babies can expect a boost to their parental leave payments next month, Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson announced today.

The maximum parental leave payment will increase from $407.36 per week to $429.74 per from July 1.

The minimum payment for self-employed parents will also increase from $120 to $125 per week.

"Under the current economic conditions any increase in financial support for new parents is helpful," Ms Wilkinson says.

"The number of New Zealand parents receiving parental leave payments continues to steadily increase, with well over 23,000 families getting assistance each year."

The maximum rate of paid parental leave is adjusted every year to account for any increase in average weekly earnings.

Parents eligible for the scheme are entitled to up to 14 weeks paid leave at a rate calculated on the basis of their average weekly earnings.
