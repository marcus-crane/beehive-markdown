Tariana Turia is pleased to hear that Aotearoa has been named this year's most peaceful country in the world.

"Sometimes it's difficult for us to see the good in ourselves and I'm proud that our nation as a collective has been able to take the world stage for its contribution to peace," Mrs Turia said.

In times like this, Mrs Turia was reminded of what Te Whiti o Rongomai said to his people before his final arrest at Parihaka: "Though the lions rage, still I am for peace."

"We all know that in terms of our own standards, there's still a lot of work to do to reduce and prevent the impacts of violence, but for now, as a country we deserve to pat ourselves on the back," Mrs Turia said.

As Associate Minister of Social Development and Employment, Mrs Turia is responsible for the government's response to addressing and reducing the impact of family violence.
