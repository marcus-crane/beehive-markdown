Applications have opened today for the first funding round of the Community Response Fund, says the Minister of Social Development and Employment Paula Bennett.

Up to $104 million dollars has been made available over a two year period for the Fund. It's designed to aid critical social services facing a significant increase in demand for their services or severe financial difficulty as a result of the economic downturn.

"As I said when I announced the Community Response Fund prior to the Budget, this is a short-term response to serious funding issues being faced by organisations which work with vulnerable families, children, young or older people."

Applications for the first round of funding are open from today, and will close on 3 July. Successful applicants will be notified in September.

Regional panels with community representation will consider applications every four months.

The maximum amount of funding available will be $50 000 per application. There is provision for grants above that amount, but only in exceptional circumstances.

"We know there are groups working with the most at-risk individuals and families which are really struggling in the current economic climate. The Community Response Fund recognises and responds to those needs. I'd encourage those groups which meet the criteria to apply to the Community Response Fund," Ms Bennett says.
