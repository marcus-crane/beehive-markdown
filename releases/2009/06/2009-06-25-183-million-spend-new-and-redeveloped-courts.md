The largest programme of capital works in the history of Courts is being managed by the Ministry of Justice.

Courts Minister Georgina te Heuheu told the Justice and Electoral Select Committee today that $183 million of capital projects was under construction.

This includes four additional jury-capable courtrooms; three at the Auckland District Court and one at Hastings District Court. Once commissioned, these will significantly reduce waiting times for jury trials.

Construction of permanent premises for the Supreme Court in Wellington is on time to be officially opened early next year. A new specialist courthouse space to house the Environment and Employment Courts in the Auckland CBD is due for completion in April next year.

As well as the jury capable courtrooms, major refurbishment of the Auckland District Court includes three civil courtrooms, one new criminal and one new multi-accused courtroom to accommodate 12 defendants.

Three additional judges' chambers are being added at the Auckland High Court.

New courthouses being built in Hastings and Levin are due for completion this year.

Existing court buildings are being redeveloped in Nelson, Invercargill, Timaru and Whangarei. Nelson and Invercargill are due for completion late next year; Timaru and Whangarei this year.

‘There is no single answer to improving court capacity, but in practical terms this substantial investment will help,' Mrs te Heuheu said.

‘It will also improve the working conditions of staff, the judiciary, the legal profession and all other users of our court facilities.'
