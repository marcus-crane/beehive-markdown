Prime Minister John Key says Dr Richard Worth's resignation from Caucus and Parliament is a sensible course of action in the circumstances. 

"I was notified this afternoon of Dr Worth's intention to resign from Parliament. I believe this to be a sensible course of action," says Mr Key.

"The decision gives the country an opportunity to move forward and focus on the issues that matter. There are important challenges facing New Zealand, and they will continue to have the Government's full attention.

"Auckland's Cam Calder is next on the party list. We look forward to welcoming him as a new Member of Parliament for National."
