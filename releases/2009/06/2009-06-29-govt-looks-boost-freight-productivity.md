Transport Minister Steven Joyce says a proposal to allow road transport operators to carry heavier loads, by permit, on specified routes would create a "win - win" situation for the economy and the travelling public.

"This would deliver big productivity gains for industry as a result of reduced transportation costs and help New Zealand grow faster out of the current global recession.

"We are a small country a long way from the rest of the world. This is one way to help reduce freight costs for our exporters, boosting their ability to compete.

"Allowing some trucks on some routes to carry heavier loads would also mean fewer trucks on the roads. This would have the flow-on effects of reduced congestion and frustration for other motorists."

Road transport companies took part in trials during 2008 and into early 2009, carrying loads greater than the current statutory 44 tonnes limit.

"Results from the trials and research undertaken show productivity could increase in the range of 10 to 20 percent, trip numbers could reduce by 16 percent, fuel use by 20 percent and we could see an overall increase in GDP in the range of $250 - $500 million per annum," says Mr Joyce.

The Land Transport Rule - Vehicle Dimensions and Mass Amendment proposes allowing operators to apply for permits to carry heavier loads and in some cases operate longer vehicles and has today gone out for public consultation.

Currently heavy vehicles can carry loads of up to 44 tonnes. The Rule amendment proposes increasing this to allow vehicles of up to around 50 tonnes on routes approved by the New Zealand Transport Agency and local councils.

"During the trials emissions, noise, and vibration effects of heavier vehicles were also tested and results showed no measurable increase in any of these impacts. In fact, there will be a decrease in total emissions with a reduction in the number of vehicle movements," says Mr Joyce.

"Vehicles in the trials met all current safety standards and any vehicle operating under a future permit system will have to meet these same safety requirements."

Trucks carrying heavier loads will not be any wider or higher than trucks on the road at present, but will instead make better use of existing capacity.

Subject to the consultation process, the Rule Amendment could be signed off by the end of 2009 with permits available for application by early 2010.
