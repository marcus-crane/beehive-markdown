Agriculture Minister David Carter has told an audience of meat sector representatives that industry players and farmers need to work together to improve the sector.

Speaking today at the launch of Meat: the future, a meat sector study published by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Mr Carter said the study points to a positive future.

"It shows a sector that recognises that change is both necessary and desirable. But this must translate into vision and action.

"With land prices no longer buoyant, the days of low-margin sheep and beef farms getting by on capital gains from land values alone are over for now."

Mr Carter said he is pleased the study reveals a degree of optimism; two-thirds of those surveyed agreed that the meat sector would be a good investment in 15 years' time.

"From my point of view the real bonus is the importance given by those in, and involved with the meat sector, to investment in research and development.

"This is an area of top priority for the Government which is why we have made a substantial and ongoing commitment through the Primary Growth Partnership announced in the Budget.

"On top of this, government funding through the Sustainable Farming Fund has provided about $15 million to the meat sector since 2000."

However, Mr Carter said change in the meat industry would only be lasting if it is driven from within the sector, and he urged industry players and farmers to work together to deliver higher returns to the sector.

"Solutions need to be driven by industry, for industry," he said.
