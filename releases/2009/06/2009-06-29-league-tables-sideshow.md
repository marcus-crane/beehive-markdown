The debate on so-called league tables is a sideshow to the real issue of meeting parents' desire to bring in National Standards that will help lift student achievement," Education Minister Anne Tolley said today.

"Parents demand clear and direct information about their child's progress in fundamental skills. That is their right, and I intend to deliver for them," Mrs Tolley said.

"National Standards aim to set clear expectations about what children should have learned at each stage of schooling. Schools will assess students against the standards and convey that information to parents in plain English. It is not standardised national testing, as the New Zealand Principals' Federation continues to claim.

"We are in the middle of a consultation process with schools and parents on how to collect and report national standards information. I welcome views from parents and educators on how best to do this - including on how we could shape those reports so they don't lead to league tables," she said.

Schools are currently required by law to produce annual reports, which are given to the Secretary for Education and provided to school communities. Schools are legally required to provide information in these reports about their performance against goals in the school charter.

"I have suggested that National Standards information could form part of this reporting. I've also said that I'm open to suggestions from the sector on how this information should be collected and reported," Mrs Tolley said.

"The Government cannot prevent national standards information being released publicly - to do so would contravene the Official Information Act. Trevor Mallard's call today for a ‘minor law change' to exempt the school sector from Official Information Act requirements that apply across government misrepresents the Ombudsman's position on this.

"The Ombudsman recently told a select committee, in response to questions, that a law change would be needed to prevent publication of information that could lead to league tables. But he argued for proactive release of the National Standards information, as district health boards do with health data.

"Consultation with parents and educators has been running since 28 May and ends this Friday. I encourage parents and educators to give their feedback, in writing or online. Parents can also provide feedback at meetings being hosted by selected schools around the country," Mrs Tolley said.

All English and Māori-medium schools will use National Standards from 2010.
