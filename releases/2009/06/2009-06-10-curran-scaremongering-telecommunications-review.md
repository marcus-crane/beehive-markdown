Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce says suggestions from Labour MP Clare Curran about the outcome of the government's review of the Telecommunications Act are nothing but scaremongering.

"Free local calls will not be axed under this government.  The idea is not even on the table.

"Likewise, there are no plans to further loosen the rules around foreign ownership of Telecom."

The review of the Telecommunications Act is part of a wider government programme to improve regulations and deliver significant gains for the economy.

The review will identify how improvements can be made to the current regime to promote greater efficiency and market competition.
