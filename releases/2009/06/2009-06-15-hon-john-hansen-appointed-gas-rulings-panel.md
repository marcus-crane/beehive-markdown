Associate Energy and Resources Minister Pansy Wong today announces the appointment of Hon. Justice John Hansen to the gas Rulings Panel.

Justice Hansen has been appointed for a five year term on the panel, which governs the gas sector - including approving or rejecting settlements, determining unsettled matters and making orders including remedies and penalties within the gas sector. 

"As the final and sole arbiter of disputes arising from gas governance rules and regulations, the Rulings Panel is critical to ensuring the effectiveness of these rules and regulations," says Mrs Wong. 

"Justice Hansen has more than 40 years of legal experience, the last 11 of which were as an Executive Judge in the South Island. He will bring a healthy degree of pragmatism to the role."

The appointment is made in accordance with the Gas Governance (Compliance) Regulations 2008, which require the Rulings Panel be comprised of one member appointed by the Minister after having been nominated by the Gas Industry Co.

Justice Hansen's appointment will expire on 13 June 2014.
