New Zealand is to provide up to $1 million to help disadvantaged families in Samoa meet the cost of school fees, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

“The global economic crisis, inflation, and increasing unemployment have led to real hardship for some families in Samoa,” Mr McCully said.

There is evidence that school attendance is falling, and that many parents are currently unable to afford to pay school fees for their children.

“It is important that current financial climate does not undermine the good progress Samoa has made in enrolling and keeping young people in the education system.

“Therefore New Zealand and Australia (who are contributing $A2 million) have agreed to jointly support a Samoan government initiative that will target families most in need of help, in order to keep as many children as possible attending classes,” Mr McCully said.
