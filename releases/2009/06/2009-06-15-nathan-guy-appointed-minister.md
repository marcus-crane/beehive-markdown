Prime Minister John Key today announced that Nathan Guy is to be appointed a Minister outside Cabinet.

Mr Guy, the current Senior Whip and MP for Otaki, replaces Dr Richard Worth.

“Mr Guy takes over the Internal Affairs portfolio.  He will also have responsibility for Archives New Zealand and the National Library. In addition, he will be Associate Minister of Justice and takes the new position of Associate Minister of Transport,” says Mr Key.

“Mr Guy will be sworn in tomorrow by Her Excellency the Administrator of the Government.

“The only other ministerial change is Maurice Williamson taking up Land Information, a portfolio with strong connections to the Statistics portfolio he already holds.

“Mr Guy has been Senior Whip since February last year.  He was Junior Whip from November 2006, and entered Parliament in 2005.

“I look forward to welcoming Mr Guy to the Executive.  He has proven himself an able Senior Whip and member of the National Party Caucus.

“The Caucus will elect a new Senior Whip tomorrow.”
