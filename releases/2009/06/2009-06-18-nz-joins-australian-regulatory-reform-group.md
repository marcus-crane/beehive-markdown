New Zealand has taken up the invitation of the Australian Government to join the Business Regulation and Competition Working Group (BRCWG), Commerce Minister Simon Power announced today.

The high-powered group was established by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) in December 2007.  The working group's primary task is to oversee and accelerate COAG’s far-reaching regulatory reform agenda which is aimed at creating a seamless Australian national economy and reducing the regulatory burden on business.

The opportunity to participate in the working group arose from meetings between Prime Ministers John Key and Kevin Rudd, and between Simon Power and Lindsay Tanner, the BRCWG Chair.  New Zealand attended its first meeting on 12 June 2009.

"I am delighted that we have been able to take up this invitation," said Mr Power.

"Being part of the Business Regulation and Competition Working Group allows us to spot opportunities for real-time Trans-Tasman harmonisation and alignment.

"I will be looking to use this opportunity to help achieve new levels of trans-Tasman economic integration."

The working group is chaired by Australian Minister of Finance and Deregulation, Hon Lindsay Tanner, and is attended by senior officials from Commonwealth, State and Territory central agencies.

**Background**

At its 20 December 2007 meeting, the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) established seven working groups. Each is overseen by a Commonwealth Minister, with deputies at a senior departmental level, who are nominated by the States and Territories.

These groups also include senior officials from all jurisdictions. The Business Regulation and Competition Working Group (BRCWG) is one of the working groups that were established as a result of this decision.

The objectives of the BRCWG are:

- to accelerate and broaden the regulation reduction agenda to reduce the regulatory burden on business;
- to accelerate and deliver the agreed COAG regulatory hot spots agenda;
- to further improve processes for regulation making and review, including exploring a national approach to processes to ensure no net increase in the regulatory burden, and common start dates for legislation; and
- to deliver significant improvements in Australia’s competition, productivity and international competitiveness.
