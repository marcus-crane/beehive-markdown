A working group has been appointed to begin the review of the Holidays Act 2003, says Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson.

"The Holidays Act has been widely criticised for its complexity and generic approach, resulting in significant compliance costs," Ms Wilkinson says.

"This review is aimed at making the Act easier for businesses and employees to understand and apply, while maintaining fairness in the employment relationship."

The terms of reference for the review include:

- the calculation of relevant daily pay
- trading annual leave for cash at the employee's request, and
- transferring the observance of public holidays

The working group is made up of five members, including two nominations each from the Council of Trade Unions and Business New Zealand.

The members are Helen Kelly, James Ritchie, Paul Mackay, Philip Doak and Peter Kiely (chair).

"The members appointed to the working group have significant experience in employment matters and I'm confident the recommendations they produce will go a long way to clarifying and enhancing the Act."   

The working group is to submit its report by December 2009.
