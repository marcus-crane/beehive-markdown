"Growing numbers of confirmed cases of swine flu in New Zealand were anticipated and are no cause for alarm" says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

As at 2.30pm today there were 27 confirmed cases of swine flu. 

"It is inevitable we will get much wider spread through the community at some stage and New Zealanders should not be worried by this. We have longstanding plans to deal with the situation" says the Health Minister.

"So far we have been successful in delaying the spread of swine flu in New Zealand. Every week we slow the spread is another week our health services aren't overburdened with even more flu sufferers than usual. "

"We are entering the traditional winter flu season when much greater pressure is put on our Emergency Departments and GP clinics," says Tony Ryall "

"Although swine flu has been mild so far for individuals, it is contagious. With community spread there will be many more people arriving at EDs and GP clinics on top of the usual winter flu numbers."

Mr Ryall says health officials are constantly reviewing the situation at home and internationally.

"When the World Health Organisation escalates its response level to global pandemic, there is no need to significantly change what we are doing in New Zealand. Our response is based on what is happening here and we are continuing to focus on containment "says Mr Ryall.

In the meantime the Health Minister says it is important people continue to hide sneezes and coughs in a tissue, then wash and dry their hands thoroughly. If they think they have flu symptoms they should, in the first instance, call their doctor or Healthline (0800 611 116).
