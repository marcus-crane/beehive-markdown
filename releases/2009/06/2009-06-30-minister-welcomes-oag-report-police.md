Police Minister Judith Collins today welcomed the findings of the first report of the Auditor-General into the response of police to the recommendations of the 2007 Commission of Inquiry into Police Conduct.

"The report shows that police have taken positive first steps in addressing the concerns highlighted by the Commission of Inquiry," Ms Collins says.

"It is essential that the public has confidence in the police. I welcome the findings of the Auditor-General and look forward to further progress as police implement new measures that enhance professionalism and accountability throughout the organisation."

The 2007 Commission of Inquiry into Police Conduct criticised the historical conduct of some police officers and their associates. The conduct included inappropriate sexual activity and a culture of scepticism in dealing with complaints about sexual assault.

The Commission's findings included 60 recommendations. Most were for the New Zealand Police, but some were for the Police Complaints Authority and the State Services Commission.

The Government invited the Auditor-General to monitor the police's response to the Commission's recommendations for 10 years. The report released today is the first of what is expected to be at least three reports.

The report focused on how police organise themselves to move forward. It noted that the police had responded in a comprehensive and committed manner to the Commission's recommendations.

The Auditor-General recommended that police continue to increase training in the Code of Conduct, leadership ethical policing and investigating cases of sexual assault, and that police review and amend how they report their progress with implementing the Commission's recommendations.
