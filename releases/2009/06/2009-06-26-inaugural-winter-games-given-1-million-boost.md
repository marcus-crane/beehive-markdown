Prime Minister and Tourism Minister, John Key has today announced that the Government will invest $1 million in this year’s inaugural Winter Games.

The event, which will be the Southern Hemisphere’s largest winter sports event, will be held at several venues around the Otago region in August.

The event will be known as the 100% Pure New Zealand Winter Games, in line with Tourism New Zealand’s successful international brand.

The biennial games will take place at Coronet Peak, The Remarkables, Cardrona, Snow Farm, Naseby and Dunedin from 21-30 August. It will feature alpine skiing, free skiing, cross country skiing, snowboarding, ice skating and demonstration sports.

“We are serious about attracting and developing world class events. This is a great example of an exciting, home-grown event with huge potential.

“The tourism spin-offs in terms of visitor numbers and spending will be significant.

“This event will showcase some of our most spectacular scenery and we believe the benefits will extend well beyond the Otago region”.

The event will put New Zealand’s pristine winter landscape on 350 million television screens around the world and attract 800 of the world’s elite winter sports athletes, many of whom will go on to the Winter Olympics. It is expected to generate $50 million into New Zealand’s economy in the first year.

“New Zealand has a growing reputation as a world class events destination, and this $1 million investment from the Major Events Development Fund demonstrates this Government’s determination to see that reputation enhanced.”
