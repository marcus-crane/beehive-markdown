Forums for the public to hear more about and discuss ideas around electoral finance reform will begin tomorrow, Justice Minister Simon Power said today.

An Issues Paper on electoral finance reform was released on May 22 to generate public discussion on broad issues and gather ideas for ways to address those issues.

The Ministry of Justice is holding the forums in Christchurch, Auckland and Wellington.

They will begin with a brief presentation followed by an opportunity for the public to ask questions and provide comments.

"The forums will provide an opportunity for issues to be discussed and ideas to be canvassed," Mr Power says.

"There are a lot of good ideas out there and we want to hear from as many people as possible."
