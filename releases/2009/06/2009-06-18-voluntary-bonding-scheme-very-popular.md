Announcing the first results of the government's voluntary bonding scheme today, Health Minister Tony Ryall said the scheme had been very popular.

"We expected up to 100 doctors and a combined 250 midwives and nurses to apply for the scheme."

'The government will in fact confirm 115 doctors, 95 midwives and 683 nurses into the scheme" said the Health Minister. 

"The number one problem facing Health is workforce, workforce, workforce and the voluntary bonding scheme will help young doctors, nurses and midwives stay in the country that trained them."

The scheme aims to encourage young health graduates to establish careers in hard to staff specialities and communities in New Zealand by offering student loan debt write offs or cash incentives over three to five years.

The government will fund the extra applicants to the scheme with an extra $7.5 million over five years. When fully up and running, the scheme will now cost $33 million over 5 years.

Each year another group will be added to the scheme.

"It is important to be clear that there are no guarantees all applicants will qualify for a payment or write-off at the end of 3 - 5 years; that depends on how they manage their careers, within the positions available in the country." said Mr Ryall.
