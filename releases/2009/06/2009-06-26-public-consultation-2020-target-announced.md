The Government today announced it would be holding public meetings, meetings with business groups, and hui on New Zealand's 2020 greenhouse gas emissions target next month.

"The issue of New Zealand's 2020 target is a single decision with major implications for the environment and economy." Minister for Climate Change Issues Nick Smith said. "It is the Government's intention to table at the Bonn climate change negotiations in August our country's policy on a 2020 target to help achieve global agreement at the Copenhagen Conference in December.

"New Zealand has committed to a global goal of stabilising emissions at not more than 450 parts per million of carbon dioxide equivalent. A long-term goal has been set of 50 by 50 - reducing New Zealand's net emissions to 50% of 1990 levels by 2050.

"Setting an interim target for 2020 requires careful consideration, especially in the face of global recession. It needs to be realistic so we don't inadvertently put our economy at risk. It needs to be achievable or we risk our good international reputation by failing to deliver. It must also be sufficient to protect the environment for future generations.

Associate Minister for Climate Change Issues (International Negotiations) Tim Groser says New Zealand's goal is to help reach a pragmatic international agreement that is both environmentally effective and economically efficient.

"We need to consider scientific, economic, environmental and foreign affairs advice in setting our 2020 target. The views of the public and business are also important to the Government. We also need to consider other countries' commitments."

"The Government has been working hard in international negotiations to achieve a post-2012 pact where New Zealand does its fair share in addressing this global problem."

The public meetings, which will feature presentations by the Government, will be held in nine centres between 6 July and 17 July: Wellington, Auckland, Christchurch, Dunedin, Queenstown, Hamilton, New Plymouth, Napier and Nelson. Dr Smith will also hold meetings with business groups in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. Hui are being organised in association with the Climate Change Iwi Leadership Group.
