Foreign Minister Murray McCully leaves tomorrow for a two-day visit to Indonesia where he will meet with his counterpart, Dr Hassan Wirajuda.

"As the world's largest Muslim country with a population of 242 million people, Indonesia is a major political force, and it plays a central part in the leadership of the south-east Asian region," Mr McCully said.

"Indonesia is also a vital economic partner for New Zealand. It is our seventh largest export destination and bilateral trade is valued at over $2 billion annually."

Mr McCully will discuss a range of regional and international issues with Dr Wirajuda, including the Bali Democracy Forum, and the ASEAN Australia New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA).

The Minister will also meet with Indonesian Trade Minister Dr Mari Pangestu to discuss bilateral trade issues, and visit the ASEAN Secretariat, and the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA), to emphasise the importance New Zealand places in its engagement with the region.
