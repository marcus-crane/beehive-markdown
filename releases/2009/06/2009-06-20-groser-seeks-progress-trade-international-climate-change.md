Trade Minister and Associate Minister for Climate Change (International Negotiations) Tim Groser will join Ministers from over 40 countries at an annual OECD meeting as part of his travel to Paris, Copenhagen and Greenland from 21 June to 6 July.

"The OECD Ministerial Council Meeting is a vital opportunity to discuss trade and economic issues with Ministers from around the world," Mr Groser said.

The meeting will include Ministers from the OECD's 30 member countries, and other countries including China, Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa and Russia. Representatives from the IMF, World Bank and WTO will also attend.

"I will be talking to key Ministers about how we can build on the positive signals that emerged from the recent Cairns Group meeting in Indonesia to restart the WTO Doha negotiations and to get these concluded as soon as possible.

"A Doha deal is the very best way to stimulate international trade flows, and our best insurance policy against protectionist measures which can impact on New Zealand's exporters.

"I will also be reminding Ministers that political commitments must translate into practical restraint to resist protectionism. In particular, I will be urging the US and the EU to show leadership by removing export subsidies on dairy products as soon as possible," Mr Groser said.

Mr Groser will then travel to Copenhagen for a series of meetings with senior trade, agriculture and environment officials before attending a high level informal meeting on international climate change negotiations in Ilulissat, Greenland.

"New Zealand has been invited to attend these important talks because of our reputation as a respected and pragmatic voice in negotiations.

"The world needs an international agreement that is both environmentally effective and economically efficient. The Greenland Dialogue is an important and early opportunity to test the waters ahead of the UN Conference in Copenhagen in December," Mr Groser said.
