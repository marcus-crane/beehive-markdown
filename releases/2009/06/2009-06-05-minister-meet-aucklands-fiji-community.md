Hon Georgina te Heuheu, Minister for Pacific Island Affairs, is in Auckland tomorrow to meet members of the Fiji community.

The meeting has been organised by the Fiji Community Association and more than 200 people are expected to attend.

Mrs te Heuheu says she was very pleased to be invited to meet the Fiji community.  Fijians account for four percent of New Zealand's Pacific population, making them the 5th largest Pacific ethnic group in the country. More than half the 9,861 Fijians in New Zealand live in the Auckland region.

‘In keeping with the relatively youthful Pacific age demographic, the median age of the Fijian population is 24 years, compared to 36 years for the general population.

‘This figure is important to the Government as it manages our way through the current economic difficulties.  These young people are the workforce of tomorrow and are critical to the country as we strive to lift productivity while introducing educational initiatives and creating jobs.'

Mrs te Heuheu said she would be speaking about the importance of nurturing young people so they know the mana and contribution they will bring to their community, and to each other.

Early childhood education is vital to the development and learning capabilities of a young person, and their success in life, and Mrs te Heuheu noted that the community is strongly focused on developing its first early childhood centre.

Language and culture contribute to the Fiji identity in New Zealand as does community participation. Mrs te Heuheu said she was interested in hearing about the community's youth development programme which they hope will address the generational loss of language.

Other topics likely to be raised include housing and home ownership, the impact of the recession and the government's support measures.
