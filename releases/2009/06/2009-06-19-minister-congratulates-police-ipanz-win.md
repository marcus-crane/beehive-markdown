Police Minister Judith Collins today congratulated the New Zealand Police for winning the top prize at the Institute of Public Administration New Zealand (IPANZ) Gen-i Public Sector Excellence Awards.

A joint project between police and Porirua City Council won the Prime Minister's IPANZ Supreme Award at the awards ceremony in Wellington last night.

The Safer Porirua project was a partnership of seven agencies resulting in World Health Organisation accreditation for Porirua as an International Safe Community.

The project also won the Russell McVeagh Award for Excellence in Working Together for Better Services.

The IPANZ Gen-i Public Sector Excellence Awards recognise achievements of organisations and project teams in the New Zealand public sector.

"I would like to congratulate the winning team for their commitment to professionalism, excellence and innovation that was recognised at the IPANZ Awards," Ms Collins says.

"I am immensely proud that their work has been acknowledged as being among the finest in the public sector.

"Community initiatives such as Safer Porirua are vital to the success of the police in creating a better and safer New Zealand."

Police were also finalists for the Leadership Development Award for Excellence in Managerial Leadership.
