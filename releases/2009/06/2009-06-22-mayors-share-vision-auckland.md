Associate Local Government Minister John Carter says he is pleased four of Auckland’s mayors have worked together on a detailed submission to the select committee on Auckland governance.

North Shore mayor Andrew Williams told Mr Carter at a public meeting at Takapuna last week that he and three other mayors had prepared a plan for how they think the city should be shaped under the unitary merger now in train.

“This is great. Four mayors from across the spectrum have worked together to produce their concerted submission on Auckland governance,” Mr Carter said.

“They are all encouraging submissions from their communities as well. This is exactly the type of input we hoped for within the democratic process for uniting Auckland. I’m happy with that,” Mr Carter said.

He said first stage submissions close on June 26 and the select committee would be sitting from July 6 to consider the submissions.

“Get them in. They can be as simple as a single point about what you consider important for your own area, or as complex and detailed as the approach taken by the four mayors,” he said.
