The National Party Caucus today elected new Whips following the appointment of Nathan Guy as a Minister.

Prime Minister John Key announced that Junior Whip Chris Tremain would replace Mr Guy as Senior Whip, and Rangitata MP Jo Goodhew will become Junior Whip.

Mr Tremain is the MP for Napier and has been Junior Whip since his election by the Caucus in February 2008.

"I congratulate both Chris and Jo on their election to these important positions.  It is well deserved and I believe they will be highly effective in their new roles," says Mr Key.
