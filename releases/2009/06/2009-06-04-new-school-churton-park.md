The suburb of Churton Park in Wellington is to get a new primary school by 2012, Education Minister Anne Tolley announced today.

"Population growth in Churton Park has seen existing school rolls in the area swell. Projections show that 600 additional primary-aged student places will be needed by 2021," says Mrs Tolley.

"The Ministry of Education has undertaken the necessary consultation with the boards of schools in the area whose rolls may be affected by the opening of the new school.

"Having considered the information presented to me, I have decided that the new school will provide for Year 1-6 students. Arrangements will now be made for an Establishment Board of Trustees to be appointed.

"Once the Establishment Board of Trustees is appointed, the design and construction of the facilities will be sought via an open tender process. The tender is likely to be issued by the end of 2009, with construction to start in May 2010."

Mrs Tolley says this is an exciting time for the Churton Park community.

"It is an opportunity to ensure that the new school is equipped for a 21st century learning environment, capable of providing the very best educational outcomes for its students."
