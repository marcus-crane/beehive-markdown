The Minister of Maori Affairs, Dr Pita Sharples, is warning the public to beware of fraudsters offering cheap passports in the name of the Maori Party.

"I have just been advised that meetings have been called, targeting Pacifc Island communities, by crooks claiming to represent the Maori Party," said Dr Sharples, who is also a Maori Party Co-leader.

"The group calls itself Hapu Tino Rangatiratanga Atawhai Whangai," he said.

"We know of meetings at Manurewa marae and in Hamilton, where over a thousand people turned up, and there may be others.

"My electorate representatives have succeeded in closing down one meeting, but we have been told that some people have already paid $500 each for a fake passport or a visa for overstayers," said Dr Sharples.

"This is a scam. I have alerted the police, and if anyone else hears of any such meetings, they should call the police straight away.

"And whatever you do, don't pay money to anyone for a passport or visa, except the Internal Affairs Department's passports division. If you have immigration queries, go to the Department of Labour Immigration Service," said Dr Sharples
