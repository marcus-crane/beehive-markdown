Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy has announced the appointment of a new member of the Lotteries Commission and the reappointment of two members to the Gambling Commission.

Dr Richard Janes, a Wellington-based company director, will take up a three year appointment to the Lotteries Commission on 1 July 2009.

Mr Guy said the Board would benefit from Dr Janes' extensive commercial governance experience, his experience in marketing and retail, and his knowledge of the regulatory environment.

The Lotteries Commission's function is to provide governance of the Lotteries business in order to raise money for the community through lottery games.

Mr Guy also announced the reappointment of Paul Stanley and Graeme Reeves to the Gambling Commission for three-year terms commencing on 18 June 2009.

The Commission hears casino licensing applications and acts as an appeal authority for licensing and enforcement decisions made by the Department of Internal Affairs in relation to gaming machine operations and other non-casino gambling activities. It also acts as an investigative and advisory body to the Minister.

Mr Stanley, of Tauranga, would continue to bring his experience in public health, Māori issues and health research to the Commission while Mr Reeves, of Wellington, provided legal expertise, strategic analysis and experience in governance roles, said Mr Guy.
