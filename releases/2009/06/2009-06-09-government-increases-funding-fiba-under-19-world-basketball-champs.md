Economic Development Minister Gerry Brownlee has today announced a government grant of $200,000 for the FIBA Under 19 world basketball championship for men being held in Auckland from July 2-12.

The tournament was previously given a grant of $150,000 from the government's Major Events Development Fund. Organisers recently applied for a second grant to cover a funding gap caused by a shortfall in corporate sponsorship.

 "We entered into a partnership with this event because we believe it's an important one. Basketball is the world's second most popular sport, and this tournament is the third largest basketball event in the world," Mr Brownlee said.

"By increasing our investment we've ensured the tournament not only stays here, but that it's organised to the standard required by FIBA. That will stand us in good stead when it comes to securing future international basketball events."

Mr Brownlee says when the government forms a partnership with an event through the Major Events Development Fund, the support goes well beyond funding. 

"We're interested in the wider opportunities that come with events like this. Major events can have economic, social and cultural benefits well beyond the tournament itself," he said.

"We're working with the tournament organisers on a couple of projects that will ensure this event leaves a lasting legacy for Auckland and New Zealand."

Mr Brownlee says major events also provide an opportunity to showcase a country to the rest of the world. One hundred and forty countries will take the broadcast rights to July's tournament and it's estimated there'll be around 100 million viewers.

"The government is serious about events. New Zealand has a growing reputation as a world class destination for major events, and that's something we want to build. Tournaments like this one help build our knowledge and expertise so we can attract and host more major events in the future."

Sixteen of the world's best teams will take part in the tournament with 62 games to be played at two venues - the North Shore Events Centre in Takapuna and the ASB Stadium in Kohimarama.

Chairman of the Local Organising Committee Patrick Dougherty says they are grateful for the increased support from the government.

"The organising committee are very impressed with their support and additional further financial assistance. The FIBA U19 World Championship for Men is going to be a magnificent sporting spectacle showcasing New Zealand and the sport of Basketball in the best possible manner. There will be some amazing talent on display from the 16 nations taking part. The support from FIBA President Bob Elphinston who put his name personally behind the event has been outstanding and has given the tournament additional kudos."

FIBA President Bob Elphinston says he was given a good hearing by the Minister and officials when they met in Wellington last month, and he's pleased to see their assurances come to fruition.

"There is now further government support for what will be an event of great standing around the world. With just over three weeks to go until the opening games the preparation for the event itself is coming together well. There's now no doubt the tournament will be a highlight in the New Zealand sporting calendar," said Mr Elphinston.
