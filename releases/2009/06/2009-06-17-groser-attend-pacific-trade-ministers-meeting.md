Trade Minister Tim Groser will attend the annual Pacific Islands Forum's Trade Ministers meeting in Apia, Samoa from 17-18 June.

"This meeting is an excellent opportunity to build on the momentum for pursuing the regional trade agreement known as PACER Plus," Mr Groser said.

Provided for under the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER), PACER Plus is important for the Pacific region. New Zealand sees the agreement as a means to promote sustainable economic growth in the region by improving Pacific Island countries' export capacity, increasing jobs and providing the tools to raise standards of living.

"At a recent informal meeting of Pacific Trade Ministers in Auckland a number of Pacific Island countries expressed a determination to move forward on Pacer Plus.

"Pacific leaders at last year's Pacific Islands Forum leaders' meeting also requested negotiations on PACER Plus begin at this year's leaders meeting in Cairns in August.

"It is important Trade Ministers come to Apia with sufficient political will to meet that request. Discussions and recommendations from this Forum Trade Ministers Meeting will feed directly into the meeting Forum leaders' meeting in Cairns," Mr Groser said.
