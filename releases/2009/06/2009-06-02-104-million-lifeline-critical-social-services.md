The Minister of Social Development and Employment Paula Bennett has announced a $104 million lifeline for vital social services.

Prior to the Budget, Ms Bennett had announced up to $40 million would be available to the Community Response Fund in the first year.

The two-year Fund will support critical community and voluntary sector organisations during the recession.

Today in Parliament, Ms Bennett confirmed up to $64 million will be left in contingency for year two, bringing the total amount available to the Community Response Fund to $104 million.

"However we know in this rapidly changing economic environment we will need to be flexible with how we distribute the funding if we are to meet the needs of the social sector."

"This Government understands just how important it is to support those groups working with the most vulnerable New Zealanders in these difficult times. As I said prior to the Budget, this is targeted funding which will help organisations in dire financial straits or facing increased demand in this recession," Ms Bennett says.

Applicants to the fund will have to provide critical services to families, children, young and older people and meet a range of criteria. Regional panels with community representation will approve applications.

Further details on the Community Response Fund will be available next week.
