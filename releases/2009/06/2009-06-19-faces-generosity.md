Tariana Turia says most New Zealanders continue to be great givers of their time, energy or money to community organisations and that latest research shows a person's cultural background shapes the nature of their contribution.

The latest research into *‘How do New Zealanders give?' found that a*bout 75 percent of New Zealanders volunteer, make donations or purchase products to support community organisations.

And while the overall support does not vary greatly by ethnicity, personal or family income, what does vary is the type of organisations different groups of people support and whether they give to, or volunteer for them.

Mäori have high rates of volunteering for marae and are more likely than average to volunteer and make donations to pre-school education. Pacific peoples have higher than average rates of both volunteering and giving to churches. Asian people are more likely to volunteer in arts and culture, and for religious or health related organisations. Pākeha are more likely than average to make ongoing donations.

"Giving and volunteering are a crucial feature of strong communities and in these uncertain times, it is even more important that we continue to share our skills, value our connections and to build strong communities," Mrs Turia said.

New Zealanders are generous people and about half donate to appeals, no matter what their families' incomes. Volunteers come from the full range of personal incomes, but the majority (52%) of volunteers earn $30,000 a year or less.

The government encourages a culture of generosity in New Zealand. A person can give up to their total income to registered community organisations and claim a tax credit of 33.3% for the total amount given.

The Government is also looking at legislation to introduce pre-tax payroll giving and simplify the reimbursement of volunteers' expenses, Mrs Turia said.
