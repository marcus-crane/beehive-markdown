Supporting disabled people and their families live an ordinary life will be a key focus for the new Minister for Disability Issues. 

Tariana Turia welcomed the announcement by Prime Minister John Key today for the Government's disability issues portfolio to be transferred to her from Paula Bennett.

"I appreciate the confidence the Prime Minister has in me and my main focus will be to make sure disabled people and their families can fully participate in society," Mrs Turia said.

Having been the associate minister for this portfolio and holding a number of ministerial delegations under other portfolios that relate to people with disabilities, Mrs Turia said she was more than aware of the challenges ahead.

"A key focus for me will be addressing the challenge of what we might call a disabling society.

"The opportunity to participate in society can be limited by many barriers, including, the attitudes of others so I intend to make rapid progress by promoting a shift in thinking."

Mrs Turia said she was looking forward to working with Pansy Wong who has become the Associate Minister for Disability Issues.
