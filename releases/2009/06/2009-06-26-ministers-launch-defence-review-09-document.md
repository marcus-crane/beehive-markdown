Minister of Defence Hon Dr Wayne Mapp and Associate Minister of Defence Hon Heather Roy today officially launched the public consultation document of the National-led Government's Defence review 2009.

"This Government must make important decisions on Defence - decisions which will form our path for decades," Dr Mapp said.

"The role that the Defence Force plays in securing our environment and our people must be understood and properly defined, and the Defence Force given the right tools to do that job.

"Such decisions cannot be made without proper consultation and planning. The consultation document which we are launching today is intended to stimulate debate and consideration of New Zealand's defence and security issues.

"All New Zealanders have a stake in these issues. We need the views of every sector of society to produce an enduring plan for Defence," Dr Mapp said. 

"ACT and National campaigned in 2008 on the promise of a Defence Review within a year of taking office.  Today's launch is a further affirmation of the Government's intent to honour its commitments," Mrs Roy said.

"Defence Review 2009 will look out as far as 2035.  The New Zealand Defence Force belongs to all New Zealanders, all New Zealanders should have a say on the direction of the NZDF into the future.

"This public consultation document will assist in gaining the public's views.  It will be available at libraries and schools, and from the Ministry of Defence website (www.defence.govt.nz).  I encourage all New Zealanders to read the document and provide their feedback through the included submission form so that their views can be recorded and taken into account," Mrs Roy said.
