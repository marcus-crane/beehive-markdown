Public defender services and duty solicitor reforms will be expanded to all Auckland courts under funding provided for in the 2009 Budget, Justice Minister Simon Power said today.

The Budget provides $5.3 million in 2009/10 to expand the Public Defence Service (PDS) from courts in Auckland and Manukau to include courts in Waitakere, North Shore, Pukekohe and Papakura.  Duty solicitor reforms will also be extended across all six courts. This consists of a $4.4 million transfer of legal aid funding and $990,000 new money in 2009/10.

The PDS, which is administered by the Legal Services Agency (LSA), is an in-house service providing criminal legal aid and duty solicitor services.  It is expected to pay for itself within five years.

Currently it operates at the Auckland and Manukau courts only and provides representation for up to one third of all legally aided defendants.  Private sector lawyers look after the remaining cases. The PDS employs 28 staff and handles some 2,400 criminal cases a year.

Justice Minister Simon Power saw the PDS in operation during a visit to the Auckland and Manukau courts today. He says the expansion of the PDS is further evidence of the Government's commitment to ensuring high quality, value-for-money access to justice for all.

"We want to make sure people who are unable to afford their own legal representation still get quality representation if they access it through legal aid."

Duty solicitor reforms include appointing supervisors to manage the service at the court and to assess the competence of trainee duty solicitors.

"The expansion of the PDS and duty solicitor reforms will streamline and enhance efficiencies across all Auckland courts, provide the opportunity to take a whole-of-Auckland approach to managing services, and improve the quality of service and advice provided to legal aid recipients," Mr Power says.

The PDS will be established in Waitakere later this year, while expansion to North Shore, Pukekohe, and Papakura is planned for the first half of next year.   

**Background on Public Defence Service**

The PDS was established at Auckland and Manukau courts in 2004 as a five-year pilot, and in August last year the LSA made it permanent.

There have been two independent evaluations of the service.  Both found it offers savings in lawyer costs when compared to the estimated cost of equivalent private providers (a saving of $985,000 savings over the period of the pilot). These savings were achieved with no difference in outcome for the client, as measured by overall conviction rates.
