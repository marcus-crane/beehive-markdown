Neil Plimmer and John Gilbert have been reappointed as Temporary Safeguard Authorities for three-year terms, Commerce Minister Simon Power said today.

Temporary Safeguard Authorities are independent bodies with certain powers of a Commission of Inquiry.  Authorities are established and appointed by the Commerce Minister under the Temporary Safeguard Authorities Act 1987. 

This Act allows inquiries to establish whether urgent temporary safeguard action is required to help New Zealand industries faced with increased imports which are causing, or threatening to cause, serious injury.  

The Ministry of Economic Development assesses applications for an inquiry, and if the Minister considers an inquiry is necessary, they are referred to an appointed Temporary Safeguard Authority to conduct an inquiry.

"Both Neil Plimmer and John Gilbert have the knowledge and expertise required to capably carry out temporary safeguard inquiries, and I am pleased to reappoint them for a further term," Mr Power said.
