Minister of Consumer Affairs Heather Roy today reminded consumers that they shouldn't have to switch heaters off and shiver in blankets in order to cuts costs and save money on their power bills this winter.

"By visiting www.powerswitch.org.nz, consumers are able to explore their options and ensure that they aren't paying more than they actually have to," Mrs Roy said.

"Since 2001, Powerswitch - run by Consumer NZ and the Ministry of Consumer Affairs - has provided a free, independent, internet-based electricity cost comparison service.  This service allows consumers to determine whether they are on the pricing plan that best suits their needs - or even whether they are signed up to the most appropriate electricity provider.

"All it takes is a few clicks and some information from the consumer's latest power bill to see if money could be saved by switching to a new plan or power company.  Alternatively, consumers may find that they are already on the best plan for their needs.

"Electricity is a core household cost, and families' power bills inevitably increase during the winter months.  As the economic downturn bites, however, families are also mindful of the need to cuts costs and save money.

"Transferring to an alternate plan, or switching power companies, is an easy way to ensure that money isn't spent unnecessarily.  I'm encouraging all consumers to visit the Powerswitch website this winter - and avoid shivering through winter wrapped in blankets in an attempt to save on power," Mrs Roy said.
