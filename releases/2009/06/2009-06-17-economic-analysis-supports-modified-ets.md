A joint report by economic consultants NZIER and Infometrics concludes that a modified emissions trading scheme is the best way forward for New Zealand on climate change policy.

"This report is a useful contribution to the important debate on how New Zealand meets its environmental goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least cost to the economy," Dr Smith said today in releasing the report.

The report was commissioned by the Ministry for the Environment and provided to the Emissions Trading Scheme Review Committee as part of its terms of reference.

"This report concludes that a modified emissions trading scheme is the best way forward. I am releasing this report to assist with informed public debate on climate change.

"The report highlights that the costs to New Zealand's climate change policy are significantly greater if other countries do not put a price on carbon. This reinforces the Government's policy of aligning our response more closely with other countries.

"The Government will await the report back from the Review Committee before committing to any decisions on the future of New Zealand's ETS. The environmental and economic consequences of climate change policy are critical to New Zealand and a careful and considered approach is required."
