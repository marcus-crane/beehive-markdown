Tariana Turia is pleased to announce the members of the group charged with finding a better way for the government to deal with Maori whanau.

"Whanau ora is the way forward to achieving a future where whanau determine what is in their best interests.

"How whanau ora will be applied to government policy will be the job of the taskforce and I'm extremely excited by the possibilities," Mrs Turia said.

Each of the six members on the Whanau Ora Taskforce bring special skills, knowledge and experience with them, she said.

The new taskforce will consist of:

- Professor Mason Durie (chair)
- Rob Cooper

The specific job of the taskforce will be to develop a policy framework for a new method of government interaction with Maori service providers to meet the social service needs of whanau.

**WHANAU ORA TASKFORCE: Terms of Reference**

**Purpose**

The Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector (the Minister) has established a Taskforce on Whänau-centred Initiatives (the Taskforce). The main objective of the Taskforce will be to construct an evidence-based framework that will lead to:

- strengthened whänau capabilities
- an integrated approach to whänau wellbeing
- collaborative relationships between state agencies in relation to whänau services
- relationships between government and community agencies that are broader than contractual
- improved cost-effectiveness and value for money.

**Role**

The Taskforce will need to cover a number of areas of work in order to meets its objectives within tight timeframes. Its tasks are expected to include the following:

- compiling a stocktake of and analysing relevant current departmental policies and programmes, including tertiary education programmes relevant to whänau wellbeing (building on work underway in the Ministry of Social Development and Te Puni Kökiri in the areas of whänau ora indicators, whänau resilience and whänau development planning)
- reviewing existing literature relating to whänau interventions and services, and assessing relevant models of integrated care and training programmes that effectively prepare practitioners for building whänau capability
- determining which social services would be covered by the whänau-centred interventions framework and therefore which Votes and government agencies would be involved
- considering fiscal issues and constraints, both within and across Votes
- considering legislative and regulatory issues and constraints
- ascertaining the views of Mäori and other key stakeholders
- identifying appropriate governance structures and other criteria for selecting providers that would provide assurance of their capacity and capability to deliver comprehensive and integrated services to whänau
- determining how government agencies could best work together to deliver whänau-centred interventions; as well as good practice for relations between the public sector, private sector, not-for-profit sector and Mäori
- developing a robust methodology for measuring the difference made by whänau-centred interventions (potentially with a set of indicators) that includes some measures based on whänau strengths (e.g. capacity to transfer values, culture, lifestyles and to act as trustees for their members)
- developing a framework for monitoring and audit procedures, including procedures that will allow government to measure the difference being made by providers in relation to the funding level.

**Membership and Chair**

The Taskforce will comprise five to eight people who have expertise in whänau health, education, cultural transmission, social innovation, economics, justice, housing and service delivery.

**Reporting Timeline**

The Taskforce will report to the Minister on progress at two-monthly intervals, starting in July 2009 and ending in January 2010.

The Taskforce will provide the Minister with the draft consultation document in September 2009. It will release its consultation document publicly in October 2009. It will report back formally to the Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector by the end of January 2010.

**Supporting structures**

The Taskforce will be supported by a dedicated secretariat, to be based in the Ministry of Social Development.
