More than $700,000 will be provided to eleven councils to help boost youth projects around the country, says Youth Affairs Minister Paula Bennett.

The total funding of $713,000 comes from the Ministry of Youth Development's Youth Development Partnership Fund. It will support a variety of projects benefiting young people and their communities.

"The great thing about these projects is that they get young people actively engaged and helping their peers. Having young people involved in the development and implementation of these projects is vital, "Ms Bennett says.

The Youth Development Partnership Fund supports local authorities and young people to work together on projects which respond to youth needs.

"Projects designed by adults for young people risk not hitting the mark. Why not go straight to the source? I believe it'll help strengthen young people's participation and engagement with their community," says Ms Bennett.

Today's announcement will see the Rotorua District Council deliver mentoring and training workshops for young people to help them back into education, training programmes or the workforce. In Selwyn, young people will design and develop activities for youth in their communities.

"These are just a couple of examples where the Youth Development Partnership Fund will help communities think differently about meeting the needs of their young people," Ms Bennett says.

Since its inception in 2005, the Youth Development Partnership Fund has funded 40 local councils to deliver 55 projects. Over 8,000 young people have benefited from these projects in terms of enhanced education, training and employment outcomes.
