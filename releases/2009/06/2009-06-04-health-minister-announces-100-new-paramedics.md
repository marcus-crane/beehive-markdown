100 new paramedics will be added to frontline emergency services, with the government confirming a $28 million investment over four years for the initiative.

The new paramedics are part of a package of initiatives for the ambulance sector, following intensive consultation, and announced by the Health Minister Tony Ryall today.

"Ambulance officers successfully carry out advanced emergency procedures in the field where patient safety is paramount," said Mr Ryall.

"The 100 extra paramedics will also boost patient safety by increasing the number of double crewed ambulances."

"We are also funding $500,000 annually for more training for rural volunteers, recognising their considerable contribution."

"We're providing an additional $1 million per year to help the air ambulance sector through these difficult financial times," said Mr Ryall.

The total funding allocated to the new initiatives is $48 million over the next 4 years, and was budgeted for under the previous government.

Mr Ryall said, "Even in these difficult times the National led Government is putting resources into a critical front-line service that is important to all Kiwis."

The initiatives announced today were developed with ACC Associate Minister Pansy Wong. ACC and the Ministry of Health have created a joint operating team to work with the sector to action these initiatives.
