Minister of Consumer Affairs Heather Roy has spoken to the First Reading of a Bill designed to improve the Motor Vehicle Sales Act 2003 and make changes to the registration of motor vehicle traders, information disclosure and the Motor Vehicle Disputes Tribunal.

"Following a review of the Motor Vehicle Sales Act 2003, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs recommended amendments to improve the legislation's workability and transparency," Mrs Roy said.

"Changes under the Motor Vehicle Sales Amendment Bill include:

\* Amending the process for traders renewing their annual registration, reducing compliance costs associated with making annual statutory declarations as part of registration renewal.

\* Closing a loophole preventing the automatic banning of traders whose registration has lapsed, but who are subsequently convicted under the Act for conduct while registered.

\* Removing requirements for private sellers at car markets to display a Consumer Information Notice (CIN).

\* Eliminating unnecessary compliance costs by removing the requirement for transactions between traders, or between traders and wreckers, to display a CIN.

\* Increasing the financial limit at which cases may be heard by the Motor Vehicle Disputes Tribunal from $50,000-$100,000.

\* Allowing the Tribunal to award costs for non-attendance of either party to the dispute and allowing it to publish its decisions.

"The Motor Vehicle Sales Act promotes and protects consumers' interests, creating an environment in which to make informed choices with confidence.  It makes vehicle traders accountable and provides consumers with redress through the Motor Vehicle Disputes Tribunal.  The Motor Vehicle Sales Amendment Bill enhances those functions.

"This Bill is a step toward removing unnecessary red tape and compliance costs from the sale of motor vehicles.  This is in line with the Government's tackling of regulatory impediments, as promised by both the ACT and National Parties' prior to the 2008 election," Mrs Roy said.
