Segmenting the collection of fines and reparations will make it easier for those who want to pay to do so, leaving the Courts to apply enforcement actions to those who do not want to pay.

Courts Minister Georgina te Heuheu said today Budget 2009 included $2.5 million for 2009/10 to implement the initiative with up to a total of $16.2 million to be sought over the coming four years.

Segmenting fines on the basis of an individual's willingness and ability to pay and their attitude to compliance will avoid expensive enforcement which drives up the overall cost of collection without necessarily resolving the debt.

‘This government is serious about making sure monetary penalties are a credible sanction, she said.

‘The court collected $233 million in fines and reparation last financial year. Implementing a segmentation approach is intended to enhance the results even further.

‘Taking into account a slowing in the rate at which fines are being imposed - from 7.4% in 2006/07 to 2.5% this financial year - that figure is forecast to increase to $241 million this financial year.'

Mrs te Heuheu said the Courts' ability to take enforcement action earlier and to apply those actions where they are needed the most means reparation will be collected and paid to victims sooner.
