Holding public meetings across Auckland, listening to concerns and aspirations for the new united council and answering questions has been, for the most part, very enjoyable.

It is widely accepted that the best way to tackle the problems and lay a foundation for the future for the greater Auckland region is to put a united council in place.

At a meeting at Takapuna the North Shore Mayor Andrew Williams told me he and three other mayors had combined to make a detailed submission on how they felt the city should be structured. They had also encouraged other groups and individuals to make submissions.

That was exactly the response we hoped for. It reflects the growing consensus that I have seen emerging at each meeting as people consider how they want to participate in shaping this new united council.

That unitary authority will deal with regional issues – make sure water comes out the pipes where it should, sewerage works properly, transport flows better than it is at present – the main aspects of service delivery people expect of their local authority.

To empower the diverse communities of this great city further there will be a number of local boards. The process is moving along. The first Bill created the platform for the reorganisation and was enacted on May 14. The second Bill, with your submissions helping to shape it, will give the democratic structure to the new council and the boards. It will also give a stronger outline to the responsibilities you want your boards to have in your community. Submissions to that have now closed and I will be taking the select committee to various locations around Auckland to hear those submissions.

The select committee will report to Parliament on September 4. The Local Government Commission, with your submissions also helping them, will determine the boundaries for the new united council and the boards. There will be targeted consultation in this process and it will be in place, with your help, by April 2010.

The third Bill will also attract your submissions through the end of this year and into 2010. The select committee will again consider your submissions – this time on exactly what you want the council and the boards to do, and report to Government by no later than April 2010.

The new structure will be in place for local government elections in October 2010. Achieving a unified structure to govern Auckland has been talked about for almost 100 years. Let’s get on with it.
