Prime Minister John Key says he has accepted the resignation of Dr Richard Worth as a Minister in the National-led Government.

"Dr Worth tendered his resignation to me last night, and I have accepted it.

"He advised me of some private matters in respect of which he felt it appropriate that he should resign as a Minister. I accepted his resignation and have advised the Governor-General accordingly.

"I will not be making further comment on the matters he has advised me about.

"Dr Worth's ministerial responsibilities will be temporarily transferred to Maurice Williamson. I will be making an announcement about permanent appointments to the portfolios in the near future."
