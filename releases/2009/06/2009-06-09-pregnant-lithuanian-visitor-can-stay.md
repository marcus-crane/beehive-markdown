Immigration New Zealand's decision to decline a visitor's permit to a Lithuanian woman suffering pregnancy complications was a poor one, says Immigration Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman.

"Immigration New Zealand has reviewed the decision and offered the woman a visitor's permit allowing her to remain in New Zealand beyond the birth of her child. While her visitor's permit remains valid she is able to apply for further permits," Dr Coleman says.

"The woman had been advised by her doctor that travelling would place herself and her unborn baby at risk.

"I believe that declining the permit was a poor decision by the department. I am pleased that common sense has prevailed and that the woman has now been issued a permit allowing her to stay in New Zealand."

A recent Auditor-General's report into Immigration New Zealand raised serious concerns about the quality of decision making processes within the organisation, and found an unacceptable variation in quality of decision making between branches.

"The Auditor-General's report highlighted the need for improvement at all levels of the organisation. Substantial improvements to decision making and service as outlined in that report must be made," Dr Coleman says.

"The department must deliver a consistently high standard of service to its customers."
