Prime Minister John Key has announced that Auckland’s Queens Wharf has been secured as a public site permanently.

“Last week I announced that the Government had secured Queens Wharf as ‘party central’ for the duration of the Rugby World Cup – a ‘fan site’ for people to gravitate to during the tournament.

“Today I can tell you a deal has been struck between the Auckland Regional Council (ARC) and the Government to purchase this significant asset outright from Ports of Auckland.

“Both the ARC and the Government have each paid $20 million in order to ensure this asset is available to be developed for the benefit of Aucklanders and all New Zealanders.

“We consider this joint purchase excellent value for money.

“I want to thank Mike Lee and his team for helping facilitate this purchase.

“Queens Wharf will be the cornerstone asset in a wider waterfront development programme.

“By purchasing this site we have secured an asset that will live long after the Rugby World Cup has finished and give pleasure to visitors and locals alike for generations to come.

“The challenge now, is to Auckland city leaders who must move swiftly to begin the infrastructure programme that will transform this now publicly-owned space into a world-class waterfront attraction.

“We have bought an asset that, if developed properly, will have a major impact on Auckland and New Zealand’s economic performance.

“I urge Auckland local and regional bodies to rise to the challenge this opportunity presents.”
