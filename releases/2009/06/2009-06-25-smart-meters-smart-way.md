Energy and Resources Minister, Gerry Brownlee, says a smart meter is the smart way to go.

The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment has today released its report "Smart electricity meters: How households and the environment can benefit."

The report makes a series of recommendations to ensure electricity retailers make the benefits of smart meter technology fully available to consumers.

"This is a timely and welcome report. Fully enabled smart meter technology is an important step for the future. Consumers need to be able to make choices about their power usage in their homes," said Energy and Resources Minister, Gerry Brownlee.

"I think the report makes some valid points and it raises a number matters for the government to consider more fully," he said.

"Can I say I personally believe the next generation in electricity innovation will revolve around smart meters, smart grids, and a new generation of smart appliances."

"The government supports the roll-out of smart meters but they have to be genuinely smart and not just revenue tools for the retailers," said Mr Brownlee.

"I see merit in smart meters being fully enabled with chips and that they operate to a universal or open access protocol. The meters need to be compatible with retail switching choices made by consumers," said Mr Brownlee.

"I want to be convinced there are no immediate negative pricing implications for the consumer. Also the meters smart meters replace are 70-year-old technology. It is very important to also ensure the smart meter technology is future-proofed."

"The Electricity Commission has to report to me by December 2009 on smart meters. I look forward with interest to see if the report calls for a more regulated approach to smart meters or reliance on industry guidelines," said Mr Brownlee.
