Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson will take part in discussions on the proposed Global Jobs Pact at the 98th International Labour Conference in Geneva starting Sunday.

The Director-General's 2009 report aims to discuss the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) response to the employment and social policy consequences of the global financial crisis.

"The major theme of the conference is about formulating an employment and jobs-centred response to the economic conditions the world is struggling with," Ms Wilkinson says.

"It's an opportunity for New Zealand to be part of the conversation - to get a grasp of the measures being introduced in other nations and the impact the recession is having on employment and policy world-wide."

The Minister leaves on Thursday and will also engage in bi-lateral meetings with officials in London before returning on June 19.
