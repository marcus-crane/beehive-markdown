Defence Minister Wayne Mapp is on his way to Brussels to discuss progress in Afghanistan with NATO and International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) partners on Friday.  
   
"The meeting will provide an opportunity to review progress in key areas in recent months, and to discuss concrete measures to further advance ISAF's agenda," Dr Mapp said.  
   
"New Zealand has a direct stake in a successful outcome in Afghanistan. International terrorism has reached out and directly affected us. New Zealanders were killed on September 11 2001 and in the subsequent terrorist attacks in London and Bali, all of which were directly connected to Al-Qaeda," he said.  
   
"We are involved there to help ensure that Afghanistan achieves sufficient stability to no longer be a safe haven for terrorists.  
   
"The members of NATO and ISAF intend that current operations, including New Zealand's contribution through the PRT, will produce security and stability in Afghanistan. This will enable Afghanistan to stand on its own and resist international terrorism, particularly from Al-Qaeda," Dr Mapp said.
