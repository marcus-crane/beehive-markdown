Veterans' Affairs Minister Judith Collins has asked the new Expert Panel on Veterans' Health to look at research into the health effects of New Zealand veterans who were present at nuclear tests in the Pacific.

"Ensuring the health and wellbeing of our veterans is a priority. I have asked the Expert Panel to look at the research and to recommend how it can be used in New Zealand war pension decisions," Ms Collins says.

The 2005 research by Massey University looked at the health effects of nuclear testing on New Zealand veterans. The results showed a small but significant level of genetic damage to the chromosomes of veterans who were exposed to nuclear explosions during Operation Grapple in 1957 and 1958.

"While the research by Massey University does not indicate the development of any specific service related disabilities, it is important that the Expert Panel has as much relevant information as possible when deciding on the future needs of these veterans," Ms Collins says.

The Expert Panel on Veterans' Health was set up in April as an important step in better understanding issues relating to veterans' service-related health, and how they can be addressed in the war pensions and veterans' support systems.

Nuclear test veterans last week won the right to proceed with their case against the British Government.

The New Zealand Government has provided the veterans of Operation Grapple with a compensatory War Disablement Pension since 1998.

Currently there are 132 Operation Grapple veterans receiving a War Disablement Pension. These pensions are a life time, tax free entitlement. 

Once a War Disablement Pension is granted all the medical care associated with a range of accepted disabilities is fully funded by the New Zealand Government.
