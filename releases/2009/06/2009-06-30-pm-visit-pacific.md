Prime Minister John Key will lead an official delegation to four Pacific Islands next week.

The visit, over four days, will take in Tonga, Samoa, Niue, and the Cook Islands.

Mr Key says the purpose of the visit is to reinforce the already close links New Zealand has with its Pacific neighbours.

“The impact of the global economic crisis on the Pacific and priorities for the Pacific Island Forum in Cairns in August will also be under discussion.”

Mr Key will meet with the King of Tonga, His Majesty George Tupou V, Tongan Prime Minister Sevele, Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa, Niue’s Premier Talagi, and Cook Islands Prime Minister Marurai.

Joining the Prime Minister on the RNZAF flight will be Maori Party Co-Leader Dr Pita Sharples, Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Georgina te Heuheu, and members of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Select Committee.

Also in the delegation will be Manukau Mayor Len Brown, Porirua Mayor Jenny Brash, Waitakere Mayor Bob Harvey, and Pacific Island youth and sport representatives including Michael Jones and Va’aiga Tuigamala.

The delegation leaves Tuesday 7 July and returns Friday 10 July.
