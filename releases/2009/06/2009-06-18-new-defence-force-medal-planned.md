The Government is to introduce a new Defence Force medal for non-operational military service, meeting a campaign commitment to recognise service in the Defence Force by New Zealanders.

"The RSA had proposed such a medal for a number of years. Fulfilling this commitment will enable New Zealanders who have served to receive recognition similar to that of Australia," Defence Minister Wayne Mapp said.

"The new medal will acknowledge the unique requirements of military service. These include commitment to the service of the Crown, represented by taking an oath or affirmation of allegiance, being liable for operational service and being subject to military discipline and lifestyle," he said.

"This medal will also honour the commitment of Reserve personnel, whose service to their country comes over and above their jobs and other activities."

A Joint Working Group on the medal has been set up, chaired by former Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade Neil Walter. It includes representatives from the Defence Force, the RSA, Veterans' Affairs and observers from the Honours Secretariat and the Police. 

"The working group will consult the public and current and ex-military service personnel, including those who undertook Compulsory Military Training and balloted National Service, about the proposed medal. This is to ensure that fair eligibility criteria for the new medal are determined," Dr Mapp said.

A survey to gauge public opinion on the medal was launched today. The survey closes on 23 July and the working group will report back to the Government by 30 September 2009.
