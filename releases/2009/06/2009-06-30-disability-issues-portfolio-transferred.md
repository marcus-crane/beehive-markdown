The Disability Issues portfolio has been transferred from Paula Bennett to Tariana Turia, Prime Minister John Key has announced.

In addition, Pansy Wong will be appointed Associate Minister for Disability Issues. The changes take effect immediately.

"The change has come after a request from Paula Bennett for the transfer of the portfolio to another Minister so she can better concentrate on the Social Development and Employment portfolio," says Mr Key.

"There are big challenges in this portfolio, especially given the increasing workload on the Ministry of Social Development from unemployment.

"The National-led Government is determined to do all it can to help people who have lost their jobs and assist them to find new employment.

"Tariana Turia immediately accepted the important Disability Issues portfolio when I approached her to see if she was interested.

"There are many synergies between this portfolio and her other portfolios, and I believe she will do an excellent job."

Paula Bennett says this is not a decision she has made lightly.

"The impact of this recession on the lives of New Zealanders is becoming clearer, and I am determined to do all I can to help those who have lost their jobs find new employment."
