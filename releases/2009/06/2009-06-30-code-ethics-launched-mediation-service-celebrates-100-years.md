Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson will launch a new code of ethics for the country’s mediators as they celebrate 100 years of employment mediation in New Zealand tonight.

Ms Wilkinson says the new *Code of Ethics for Mediators* *employed by the Department of Labour* is part of the Government’s commitment to ensure the integrity of the service.

“We spoke before the election about the need to properly resource the mediation service and ensure mediators have all the tools necessary to be successful.

“This code will provide our mediators with valuable guidance on complex ethical issues,” Ms Wilkinson says.

“Mediation is an evolving discipline and our systems and approaches will continue to develop.

“Mediators do not carry big sticks. They are not authority figures. They are successful because they have integrity and an ability to listen.”

Mediation remains one of the most favoured forms of dispute resolution. In 2008 the Department of Labour received almost 6000 requests for mediation, 80% of which were settled.

The 100th birthday is being marked with an event at the Beehive, where the Minister will also launch the *Contemporary Mediation Practice: Celebrating 100 years of Employment Mediation,* a book of essays on mediation best practice*.*

Employment mediation in New Zealand began in 1909 when then Minister of Labour John Millar appointed New Zealand’s first three conciliation commissioners, with the aim of taking pressure off the Arbitration Court.

“Although the entities and job titles have changed over the years, the fundamentals of mediation have remained the same.  Those fundamentals – and the attributes of our mediators – have meant it is a service that has remained in continual demand.”
