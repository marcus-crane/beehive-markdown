New Zealand and Spanish science researchers will benefit from a new travel grant programme between the two countries, Research, Science and Technology Minister Wayne Mapp has announced.

The new initiative was formalised in a joint declaration signed yesterday by Immigration Minister Jonathan Coleman (on behalf of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Murray McCully), and Spanish Deputy Foreign Minister Angel Lossada.

Mr Lossada and the Spanish Minister for Science and Innovation, Dr Cristina Garmendia, were part of a delegation accompanying King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia on their official visit to New Zealand this week. 

Dr Mapp said that annual funding of $50,000 from the New Zealand Government will enable New Zealand researchers to travel to Spain, and Spanish researchers to travel to New Zealand to work on joint research projects. 

Paid for through New Zealand's International Science and Technology (ISAT) Linkages fund, the programme will be administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand. 

"Spain's research strengths are very relevant to our own priorities, particularly in biology, genetics and biochemistry, plant and animal science, geophysics and astronomy," Dr Mapp said.

"Spain is also achieving its strong renewable energy goals. It will be of great benefit to New Zealand to have our researchers working with Spanish researchers in this field."

Dr Mapp accompanied the Spanish royal party on Monday morning on a visit to the University of Auckland, and met Dr Garmendia at Parliament yesterday.

"Dr Garmendia and I look forward to seeing the improved links between New Zealand and Spanish research that are sure to result from the new programme," Dr Mapp said.

Dr Garmendia said that for the Spanish Government the programme reflected the goals pursued by the Ministry of Science and Innovation: internationalisation, mobility and excellence in research careers. 

"This is a first step to broaden our bilateral collaboration in scientific and technological research for mutual benefit on new priority areas. I expect Spanish and New Zealand scientists will also work together toward joint proposals through the European Commission's research Framework Programme (FP7)," she said.
