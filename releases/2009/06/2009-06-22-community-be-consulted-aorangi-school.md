Community views on the best interests of local children will be taken into account during a consultation process about the possible closure of Aorangi School in Christchurch, Education Minister Anne Tolley said today.

"I want to ensure that the learning needs of children in this diverse community are properly looked after," Mrs Tolley said. "But I also have to ensure the school's planned $2.625 million replacement building programme is an effective use of taxpayer money."

Closure of Aorangi School is being considered because the school has a falling roll, major investment is needed in buildings, and the community is served by other nearby schools.

"No decision on the future of the school has been made. This process will allow me to hear what the School Board and the local community have to say.

"The delays and issues that have arisen during the rebuilding process are not the reason for considering closure," she said.

Feedback about the best educational options for children and young people in the area should be made to the Board of Aorangi School or the independent facilitator, funded by the Ministry of Education. The facilitator will consult with the Aorangi School Board, the wider community and the other school boards whose rolls may be affected.

"All of this information will then be presented to me, so I can consider all feedback before making a decision," said Mrs Tolley.

"The Ministry will continue to provide additional capital funding for any urgent health and safety issues identified by the Board."
