Labour Minister Kate Wilkinson today announced the terms of reference for a nation-wide review of the adventure tourism sector.

The review of one of the cornerstones of New Zealand's tourism industry will be led by the Department of Labour, and comes after the river-boarding death of British tourist, Emily Jordan.

Ms Wilkinson says she wants to ensure New Zealand's adventure tourism sector retains the dynamism which sets it apart from the rest of the world, while also ensuring the best possible safety measures are in place.

"People come from all over the world to experience the adrenalin rush our adventure tourism operators provide.

"At the same time, thrill-seekers should be able to expect every possible effort is made to ensure their safety. The sector already has a number of measures in place; this comprehensive review is about protecting our international reputation by ensuring all operators are meeting high safety standards."

The review will be conducted in two phases and will cover all commercial adventure tourism.

Ms Wilkinson says the review will be reported back by the end of March, with interim reports in December and January.

"Adventure tourism is important to our economy and to our international reputation. This will be a considered and measured review, and one in which all stakeholders can make useful contributions."
