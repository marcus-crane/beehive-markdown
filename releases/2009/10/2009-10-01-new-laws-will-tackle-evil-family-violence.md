New legislation will help protect victims of family violence and see more offenders held to account for their actions, Police Minister Judith Collins says.

Crime statistics released by police today reveal family violence continues to be a major problem in New Zealand.

Recorded violence rose 7 percent during the year to 30 June 2009, driven almost entirely by recorded family violence which increased 13.5 percent.

"Too many families continue to live in terror of the threat of violence within their homes," Ms Collins said.

"In the 2008 calendar year, police responded to 82,692 incidents and offences relating to family violence. In the year to 30 June, 23 murders were classified as family violence murders.

"Domestic violence is an evil that casts a shadow over the lives of too many New Zealanders - particularly children, the most vulnerable in our society.

"It is time we got serious about stamping out this problem by offering more protection to victims and ensuring offenders were punished for their actions."

The Government has introduced new legislation aimed at significantly reducing family violence.

The Child and Family Protection Bill will focus on keeping children safe where there have been instances of family violence in the home.

The Domestic Violence (Enhancing Safety) Bill will allow police to issue on-the-spot protection orders to help protect victims of domestic violence. It will also allow sentencing judges in the criminal courts to issue protection orders on behalf of victims.

The crime statistics showed a 3.7 percent increase in total recorded crime for the year. New Zealand's population increased just under 1 percent during that period meaning recorded offences per 10,000 population increased by 2.8 percent.

Overall, police recorded 442,540 offences compared with 426,690 last year.

Ms Collins said the latest statistics were a reflection of good work by police. Police resolved 212,038 offences to increase the resolution rate from 47 to 47.9 percent.

The statistics showed increases in drugs offences, sexual offences and dishonesty offences, and a decrease in homicides and robberies.
