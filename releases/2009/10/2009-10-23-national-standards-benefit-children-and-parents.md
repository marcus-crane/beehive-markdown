Prime Minister John Key and Education Minister Anne Tolley today launched the National Standards in reading, writing and maths, which will help ensure students leave school with the skills they need to succeed.

"Parents told us they want the plain language reporting that National Standards will deliver twice a year from 2010," said Mrs Tolley.

"The standards will help teachers and parents assess the progress of students, and identify those children who need extra help. Government is providing $36 million over four years to support schools in lifting the achievement levels of all students."

The National Standards, to be introduced in English-medium primary and intermediate schools from next year, support the New Zealand Curriculum by setting clear, consistent expectations of student achievement from Years 1 to 8 in reading, writing and mathematics.

"If students have these foundation skills in literacy and numeracy they will be able to learn across all areas of the school curriculum, and will be on track to get at least NCEA Level 2," said Mrs Tolley.

Consultation feedback was used to develop the final standards, after more than 11,000 people attended sector and parent meetings or gave written submissions.

"This government made a commitment to parents, and I'm delighted that for the first time they will now have information on what their children should be able to achieve and by when."

The Ministry of Education will support schools to implement the standards by providing resources, workshops and guides on assessment and reporting.
