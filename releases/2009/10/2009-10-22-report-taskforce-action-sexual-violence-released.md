The report of the Taskforce for Action on Sexual Violence, which primarily reflects the views of those delivering front-line services for sexual violence victims and treatment for offenders, was released today by Justice Minister Simon Power.

"The next step is for the Government to consider the recommendations in the report about how we can better prevent and respond to sexual violence," Mr Power said.

"The taskforce is an excellent example of community and government working collaboratively on a complex social problem.  Community sector representatives were at the table with 10 government chief executives to consider how sexual violence could be addressed more effectively.

"I'd also like to acknowledge the role of Te Ohaakii a Hine - National Network Ending Sexual Violence Together (TOAH-NNEST) in the work of the taskforce and the development of the report. 

"TOAH-NNEST represents the majority of organisations and individuals delivering front-line sexual violence services in our communities.  I would like to thank TOAH-NNEST for the commitment and significant effort that they have brought to this work."

The report confirms that sexual violence is one of the most costly crimes for the health, social, and justice sectors.

TOAH-NNEST recommends that the Government prioritise efforts to improve sexual violence services for victims, promote responsiveness in the criminal justice system, and consider long-term investment in prevention of sexual violence.

"The recommendations in the report require detailed analysis.  They cover a range of work areas and bridge a number of portfolios, and there is a lot of related work already under way across government to be considered," Mr Power said.

"Analysis of the recommendations is being undertaken now and the Government is hoping to respond to the report in the coming months."

The report completes the work of the taskforce. However, Mr Power and Maori Affairs Minister Hon Pita Sharples will continue to meet quarterly with representatives from TOAH-NNEST to discuss progress.
