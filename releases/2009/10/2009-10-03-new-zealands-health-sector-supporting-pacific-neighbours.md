Tsunami victims are being treated in NZ, a medical team is helping in Samoa, and more help is on the way, says Tony Ryall Minister of Health.

New Zealand's response to the disaster in the Pacific is being coordinated nationally by NZAID.

An RNZAF plane carrying 14 patients who were injured during the tsunami arrived at Whenuapai overnight, and the patients are being treated in Auckland hospitals.

Health professionals from throughout New Zealand have responded magnificently in offering to work in Samoa with the relief effort.  Over 250 people have already volunteered to help, Mr Ryall said

"We are keeping a register of skilled health professionals and coordinating our resources with Australia to ensure that we provide the most effective help possible in conjunction with the Samoan health service.

Since the tsunami hit, New Zealand has had a strong contingent of Defence Force medical staff on the ground in Samoa.  A Ministry of Health liaison officer  is assisting with needs assessment and three public health and environmental health staff arrived in Samoa overnight.

A surgical team will be travelling up to Samoa in the early hours of Sunday morning.    The surgical team will be joined by two Zealand based Samoan-speaking doctors and two Samoan-speaking nurses.

The timing is at the request of the Samoan authorities so that the team will relieve some of the Australian team, and also allow local staff to take a break to be with their own families.

We are working closely with Australian and Samoan health authorities as well as the New Zealand Defence Force to put people with the right mix of skills in place in a planned and managed fashion.

A total of 14 New Zealand health professionals will be travelling up to Samoa on a RNZAF flight in the early hours of tomorrow morning to be ready to start work on Sunday.

Additional medical equipment and supplies requested by Samoa are also being shipped up on the same flight.  This includes antibiotics, vaccines, IV fluids, tubing, vital surgical equipment and supplies for wound management.

"The stress and trauma suffered by people is Samoa is immense, and New Zealand is including a first psychosocial worker to support those in need," Mr Ryall said.

"Medical help will be needed for some weeks - particularly public health expertise.  New Zealand will be maintaining a regular flow of personnel to Samoa for some time.  New Zealand will do everything we can to help with the immediate and ongoing health needs of the Samoan people," Mr Ryall said.

Any health professional, including those working in primary care, who wants to offer support should contact the emergency controller at their local DHB or phone 09 263 1381 or fax 09 261 3396 or email
