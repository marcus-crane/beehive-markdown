The deemed rate of return for taxing foreign investment fund interests has been set at 9.18% for the 2008-09 income year, down from 10.87% for the previous year, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne announced today.

"The deemed rate of return, which is set annually, is one of the methods that can be used to calculate income from foreign investment fund interests, though it is used less frequently than other methods " Mr Dunne said.

"The rate is based on an average of five-year government stock to which a four percent margin is added, he said.

The new rate was set by Order in Council.
