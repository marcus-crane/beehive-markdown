It's not too late for members of the public to have their say on the future of the New Zealand Defence Force.  The second-to-last Defence Review 09 public will take place in Masterton this coming Monday, Associate Minister of Defence Heather Roy said today.

"The Masterton meeting, to be chaired by Wairarapa MP John Hayes, will be held in the Frank Cody Lounge of the Masterton District Council Building from 5pm-7pm," Mrs Roy said.

"The last meeting will be held in Hamilton on October 19 and chaired by Hamilton East MP David Bennett.

"Defence Review 2009 has attracted a pleasing response from the public, with more than 600 written and oral submissions received - either to the Ministry of Defence or at one of a number of public meetings around the country.  Public opinion from all sides of the Defence debate has been received and heard.

"Due to public demand the submissions period was prolonged beyond its scheduled closing date of August 24 2009 to ensure New Zealanders had adequate time to prepare and present submissions.  Submissions will close at the end of this month following the final public meeting in Hamilton on October 19.

"Defence Review 09, conducted by the Ministry of Defence, is focussed on capability requirements for the Defence force looking out to 2035.  I encourage anyone with a view on Defence to attend the upcoming Masterton and Hamilton meetings, or make their submissions by the end of the month to make sure they have their say," Mrs Roy said.
