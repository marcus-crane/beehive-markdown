New Zealand's contribution to the Pacific disaster relief operation moves into a new phase tomorrow.

The Navy's multi-purpose vessel HMNZS Canterbury, with a Seasprite helicopter embarked, will sail from the Devonport Naval Base in Auckland at 10am tomorrow \[Saturday 10 October], loaded with supplies and equipment for Samoa and Tonga, Defence Minister Wayne Mapp announced today.

"Immediate emergency response needs in the Pacific have largely been met. Canterbury's departure means we are moving into the vital rebuilding phase.

"Canterbury will be carrying specialist supplies to support the ongoing Defence Force relief operation in Samoa and Tonga. There are also a number of items requested by the Samoan and Tongan Governments for recovery efforts in the affected areas," he said.

"The shipment includes 10 containers of donated goods from the Samoan and Tongan communities in Auckland, some of which will go to specific villages affected by the tsunami. There also 15 pallets of supplies for Tonga," the Minister said.

"The Samoan Consul-General in Auckland, Faolotoi Reupena Pogi, has chaired a group of community leaders co-ordinating the donations for Samoa. They included Maungakiekie MP Peseta Sam Lotu-iiga and former All Black Laauli Michael Jones. The Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs has provided administrative support and liaison with NZAID.

"From the beginning the Government has stressed that New Zealand support would not stop after the immediate relief operation. We are in this for the long haul."

Dr Mapp said Canterbury will help the Tongan Government transport supplies for recovery and reconstruction from Nukualofa to Niuatoputapu.

Some NZDF personnel and equipment, such as the Iroquois helicopters deployed immediately after the tsunami, will be brought back to New Zealand on the return voyage if they are no longer needed, the Minister said.
