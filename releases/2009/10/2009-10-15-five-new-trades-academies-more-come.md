Education Minister, Anne Tolley, has announced the five successful applicants selected to open trades academies in 2011.

"Every student should have an education system which works for them and which meets their needs, and trades academies will help deliver this," said Mrs Tolley.

"Trades academies are part of the Government's Youth Guarantee programme. They'll provide more career choices for 16 and 17 year olds, and give them greater opportunities to develop their knowledge, skills and talents through trades and technology programmes."

Following 113 expressions of interest from providers across New Zealand, the five trades academies set to open their doors in 2011 will be based at:

- Northland College
- Waikato Institute of Technology and Cambridge High School
- Wellington Institute of Technology
- Taratahi Agricultural Centre
- Catlins Area School

 "Trades academies, based on partnerships between schools, tertiary institutions, industry training organisations and employers, will give students a head-start in an industry-related career, earning both NCEA credits and a tertiary qualification," said Mrs Tolley.

"And I'm pleased to say that six additional proposals put to the Ministry by education providers will also be developed with a view to establishing trades academies."

They are:

- Christchurch Polytechnic and Linwood College
- Trident High School
- Education Taranaki Incorporated
- Greymouth High School
- Eastern Institute of Technology
- Forest Industries Training and Education Council and Agricultural Industry Training Organisation

The Ministry of Education will now work with all eleven applicants on their business plans.

"This government is committed to bringing out the best in our young people. Trades academies will enable more students to gain qualifications which will set them on a strong career path and help them achieve in their chosen field."
