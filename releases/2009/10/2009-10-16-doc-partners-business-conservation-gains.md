Conservation Minister Tim Groser today announced the Department of Conservation (DOC) is launching a series of pilot projects designed to help improve the way it works with business to deliver conservation gains.

The pilot projects include working with local businesses in the building and operation of a new visitor centre on the West Coast; the development of new recreation opportunities on conservation land in the Kaimai Range; and working with local iwi to develop opportunities associated with the new Central North Island Rail Trail cycleway.

Tim Groser says the department is committed to its core conservation work and building partnerships with local business will help develop DOC's capability in developing conservation opportunities.

"Investing in our forests, soils, water and wildlife is at the heart of New Zealand's conservation economy. The taxpayer invests over $400 million in conservation work and we want to encourage the private sector to join in this conservation investment.

"To get private business working for conservation, DOC needs to tap into the existing business opportunities and needs to be more business-like in the way it deals with the private sector."

Mr Groser says the projects have grown out of meetings between DOC business, tourism, Maori and conservation organisations and they will provide an ideal opportunity for monitoring how effectively the Department engages with business.

"DOC needs to engage with the local communities it works in - these projects are about creating successful partnerships for the best conservation outcomes."
