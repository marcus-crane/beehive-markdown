Foreign Minister Murray McCully has welcomed the significant French contribution to the response to the Tongan tsunami tragedy.

"The tsunami that caused such devastation in Samoa also caused significant damage and loss of life on Tonga's northern island of Niuatoputapu, leaving the island's population in need of substantial support," Mr McCully said.

"Under the France, Australia, New Zealand (FRANZ) agreement to cooperate in responding to natural disasters in the Pacific, France is deploying military aircraft and a French navy vessel to take personnel, medical supplies, and other emergency response equipment to the island.

"As part of its response, France is transporting New Zealand and Australian emergency response personnel and supplies that have already been sent to Nuku'alofa, to Niuatoputapu. 

"The three countries will also ensure that the reconstruction effort, now that the initial emergency response is over, will be coordinated over the coming months.

"The combined FRANZ response in Tonga shows the value of cooperation between our countries in the Pacific," Mr McCully said.

French Ambassador to New Zealand, Michel Legras, said France was very pleased about the success and the quality of coordination of the emergency aid operations undertaken by the three FRANZ partners.

"This assistance will help the people affected by this tragedy to rebuild their communities.

"As the current holder of the revolving FRANZ presidency, France organised last week the annual FRANZ partner meeting in Noumea where FRANZ partners managed to meet "in real time" to organise their cooperation," Mr Legras said.
