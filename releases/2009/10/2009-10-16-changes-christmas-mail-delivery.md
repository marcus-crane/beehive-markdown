Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce today announced that he has agreed to New Zealand Post's proposal to change mail delivery over the 2009/10 Christmas period.

"I have agreed to New Zealand Post's proposal for non-delivery of mail on Saturday 26 December 2009 and Saturday 2 January 2010," Mr Joyce said.

 "The government has consulted with the New Zealand public on the issue and very little negative feedback has been received.

"The change will give New Zealand Post's posties a welcome long weekend break at Christmas and New Year".
