New Zealand is contributing an initial $1 million to support emergency relief work following an earthquake in Indonesia, and a typhoon that has struck a number of Southeast Asian countries, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"New Zealand will provide $600,000 to assist with rescue efforts and provide emergency provisions following the earthquake that struck western Sumatra in Indonesia on September 30," Mr McCully said.

"We are also contributing $400,000 to relief efforts in the Philippines, Viet Nam and Cambodia, which have suffered major flooding as a result of Typhoon Ketsana.

"The death toll from the Indonesian earthquakes is estimated to be approaching 3000, and with thousands more injured or homeless.

"Padang city and surrounding towns have been heavily hit, with schools, hospitals, hotels and markets destroyed. Fires have caused further damage, and heavy rain is making access difficult, and hampering search and rescue efforts.

"New Zealand's contribution will be channelled through the Red Cross and other aid agencies already on the ground to provide medical supplies, petrol, generators, sanitation equipment, food and shelter.

"The Philippines has been most severely hit by Typhoon Ketsana, with Manila suffering its worst floods in 40 years. Throughout the country three million homes have been damaged, with over 300,000 people displaced and nearly 300 deaths reported.

"Viet Nam and Cambodia have also been hit, with deaths, significant damage, and displacement of people.

"Another major typhoon in the region is building strength and is compounding the situation in all three countries.

"New Zealand's assistance will go to the Red Cross and other agencies working in affected communities. The funds will help provide emergency shelter, food, water and health supplies," Mr McCully said.
