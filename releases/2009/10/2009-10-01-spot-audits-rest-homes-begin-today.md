A government pilot project of "spot audits" of aged residential care facilities starts today, Health Minister Tony Ryall has announced.

Mr Ryall says, "The two-month pilot project will fine tune the spot audit regime, which will then be rolled out nationally from January. We want to make sure the new audit checklist and process is workable, and fits without adding bureaucracy."

In another recent change to provide more information to older people and their families, summaries of rest home audits are now being made public on the Ministry of Health website.

For the first time ever, family members can now see and compare audit summaries of rest homes. This will help older people and their families know more about their options. The overall objective is better care for all residents, wherever they are.

Mr Ryall confirmed the changes during a visit to a residential care facility in Tauranga this morning.

This pilot project is being led by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with District Health Boards, providers and aged care organisations.

"There has been mounting public concern around issues of poor care in rest homes and residential facilities."

"It is vitally important to maintain public confidence in the standard of care being provided in the country's rest homes. Certification and auditing, and publishing results should provide residents and their families with an assurance of quality care," Mr Ryall said.
