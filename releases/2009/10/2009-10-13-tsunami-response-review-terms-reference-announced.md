Civil Defence Minister John Carter has today released the Terms of Reference for the independent review into the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management's response to the recent Samoan tsunami threat.

The review will look at Civil Defence's response to the 30 September tsunami, with a focus on how public information was managed. 

"While the response to the alert was generally good overall, particularly on a regional level, there were clearly some issues with the way information was communicated to the public," said Mr Carter.

"It is critically important that New Zealanders have confidence in our civil defence arrangements. They need to know that they can rely on those arrangements for support in the event of a disaster or serious emergency.

The review will be conducted by Dr Simon Murdoch, former Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

"This review will also run alongside the Ministry's own comprehensive review of its operational response. 

"The improved response by Civil Defence to the 8 October tsunami alert shows that lessons were learnt. However, it is necessary to ensure that the proper processes and procedures are in place to respond effectively and appropriately to future events.

"This review will help ensure New Zealand has the best possible civil defence and emergency management systems and support in place," said Mr Carter.

The review is expected to be reported back by the end of October.
