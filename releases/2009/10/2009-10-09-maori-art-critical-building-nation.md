Creative energy pushed boundaries at last night's gala opening of Māori MARKet 2009 at Porirua's Te Rauparaha Stadium.

Georgina te Heuheu, Associate Minister of Māori Affairs and guest speaker, told the hundreds of people who gathered for the opening that Māori art and culture are unique to this country and critical to building a nation. They help define New Zealand as a country with a unique Māori identity.

"Māori people are innovative and adaptable and currently in the process of unleashing their creative energy on to the global stage.

"They are doing this with honour and dignity, while securing their niche," Mrs te Heuheu said.

"Māori MARKet 2009 is likened to the third phase of a journey which began in 1984 with Te Māori, gained momentum with Māori Art Meets America (2005) and is now providing a platform for Māori to take their culture, their creativity and entrepreneurship to the world, and in turn to bring the world here to Aotearoa."

About 160 established and emerging Māori artists, including those with international reputations, feature in the exhibition at Te Rauparaha Stadium and at Pātaka Art Museum.

This is the second Māori MARKet which, for the first time, includes works by Pacific Island New Zealanders. The Minister paid tribute to the sponsorship of the Porirua City Council, Toi Māori, Te Puni Kōkiri and the Council's partnership with Pātaka Art Museum.

Māori MARKet is now established as a biennial function with an expanded event planned for 2011 to capitalise on the Rugby World Cup.  It closes on Sunday.
