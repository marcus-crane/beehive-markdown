The Minister for Social Development and Employment has welcomed a new partnership between Work and Income and the Recruitment and Consulting Services Association.

"It's a great agreement, because it's simple and aimed at getting the right people into the right jobs, right away", says Paula Bennett.

"The RCSA leads the way in recruitment.  With over 700 recruitment agencies throughout New Zealand, this partnership allows people to tap into vacancies that traditionally haven't been available to them through Work and Income.

"It benefits the RCSA by providing their employers with access to a more diverse talent pool. 

"Additionally, it allows their job-seeking clients to tie in with Work and Income to check they're getting all the financial support they're entitled to while they're between jobs.

"By partnering up, we are expanding opportunities for job seekers and employers alike.

"This is a great example of how we can all work together to manage our way through the current economic environment.  It is this sort of Kiwi ingenuity and innovation that continues to see us through the tough times," Paula Bennett says.
