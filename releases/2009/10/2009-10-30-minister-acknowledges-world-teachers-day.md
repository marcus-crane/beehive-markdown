Education Minister Anne Tolley has acknowledged the valuable work being done by New Zealand's teachers as they celebrate World Teachers Day.

"Teaching is a vitally important job, second only to parenting," said Mrs Tolley.

"Our children and young people rely on their teachers to guide them through their school days and into tertiary education and employment.

"I visit as many schools and early childhood centres as I can around the country and I'm always impressed with the dedication shown by our teachers.

"I know that we all share the same goals. Together we can help lift student achievement and support every child in New Zealand to realise their full potential."
