Ethnic Affairs Minister Pansy Wong expresses her deepest sympathies and condolences to the many Filipino and Indonesian New Zealanders, who are waiting to hear from loved ones affected by Typhoon Ketsana and the earthquakes in Padang.

The devastation of the earthquakes and tsunami in the Asia-Pacific region has had a huge impact on many New Zealanders as they await news about family and friends in Samoa, Tonga the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia.

"This is an anxious time for many New Zealanders who are waiting by the phone as rescuers work through the rubble and damage to find survivors of the wide-spread devastation caused by these tragic disasters," she says.

"Our thoughts are with the thousands of people who have been killed, wounded or who lost their homes as a result of these horrific natural disasters and also those here in New Zealand who are waiting to hear whether their family and friends are safe."

Mrs Wong has expressed her condolences to Filipino and Indonesian communities and has reiterated the support of the New Zealand government.

The Government has committed $1 million in aid to assist the Philippines and Indonesia - with $600,000 being sent to help during the aftermath of the earthquakes in Indonesia, and $400,000 going to assist the Philippines, Vietnam and Cambodia to recover from Typhoon Ketsana.

Anyone wanting information about friends and family in Indonesia or the Philippines should call the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade on (04) 439 8000.
