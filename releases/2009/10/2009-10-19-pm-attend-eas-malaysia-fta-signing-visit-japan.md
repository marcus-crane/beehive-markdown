Prime Minister John Key will travel to Thailand on Friday to attend the 4th East Asia Summit, before visiting Malaysia and Japan.

Mr Key will join leaders from the 10 ASEAN countries, China, the Republic of Korea, Japan, India, and Australia at the EAS in Hua Hin on 25 October.

"Amongst discussions will be consideration of a study group report on a proposed Comprehensive Economic Partnership in East Asia (CEPEA), which has the potential in the long term to create the largest free trade area in the world," says Mr Key.

"East Asia is an important region for New Zealand.  In 2008 New Zealand's exports to the EAS countries totalled $20.96 billion.  This represents more than half of New Zealand's total exports."

Following the EAS, Mr Key will travel to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, for an official visit and to attend events for the signing of the New Zealand-Malaysia Free Trade Agreement.  He will be joined by Trade Minister Tim Groser and a delegation of more than 60 business leaders.

"The FTA will deepen New Zealand's ties and strengthen our relationship with Malaysia.  It will also further underline New Zealand's commitment to this rapidly integrating region," says Mr Key.

"Malaysia is New Zealand's eighth most important global export destination.  In the last four years New Zealand's goods exports to Malaysia have grown by more than 80 per cent - more than double the rate of our export growth to the world over the same period." 

On 27 October Mr Key will fly from Malaysia to Japan for an official visit.  He will have an audience with the Emperor and hold talks with his Japanese counterpart, Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama.

"Our countries are long-standing friends with shared values and interests.   We will discuss ways of bringing our two countries even closer together, including through increased trade and economic ties," says Mr Key.

"Japan remains the world's second largest economy and is our third largest export market and fourth largest trading partner overall."

Coinciding with the Prime Minister's visit are a series of New Zealand-related activities planned for Tokyo that will promote links between the two countries, raise New Zealand's tourism profile and publicise New Zealand's hosting of the 2011 Rugby World Cup.

Mr Key arrives back in New Zealand on 2 November.
