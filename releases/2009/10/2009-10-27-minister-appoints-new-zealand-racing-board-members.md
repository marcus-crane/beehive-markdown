Racing Minister, Hon John Carter, today announced the reappointment of Michael Stiassny and Ray O'Connor, and the appointment of Simon Moutter, to the New Zealand Racing Board's governing body.

"All three members bring considerable business and industry experience to the boardroom," said Mr Carter.  "They will make valuable contributions to the Board."

"The members of the Board are expected to play a leading role in developing policies that capitalise on the potential of the industry and drive the industry's economic performance," said Mr Carter.

Michael Stiassny was reappointed as the independent chairperson following consultation with the racing industry.  Ray O'Connor was reappointed as a board member following his nomination by the harness racing code.  Simon Moutter was recommended for appointment as an independent board member by the statutory panel following consultation with the industry, and was subsequently appointed.

The three members have been reappointed or appointed until 31 July 2012.
