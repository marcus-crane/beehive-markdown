Prime Minister John Key has announced that there will be a National Memorial Service to commemorate those who lost their lives in the recent tsunami tragedy in Samoa.

The service will be attended by Prime Minister John Key and Governor-General, the Hon Sir Anand Satyanand.

"I would like to invite the families of the New Zealand victims and the wider New Zealand Pacific community to join me at this service," says Mr Key.

"It is fitting that we remember the New Zealanders, Samoans, and Tongans who lost their lives by way of a National Memorial Service."

The service will be held at the Auckland Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Parnell on Sunday 8 November at 4.00pm
