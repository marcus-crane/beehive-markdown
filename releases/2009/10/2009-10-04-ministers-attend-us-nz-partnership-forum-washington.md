Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully and Trade Minister Tim Groser will join high profile business and government representatives at the third US-NZ Partnership Forum, in Washington DC.

"The United States is an important friend, ally and trading partner to New Zealand.  It's important New Zealand Ministers attend the Partnership Forum along with senior business leaders," Mr McCully said. 

"The Partnership Forum is organised jointly by the NZ/US Council and its US counterpart and will be held in Washington on 6-8 October. 

"Discussions at the Forum will include the trade and business relationship, political and trade developments in the Asia-Pacific region, and US/NZ cooperation on security issues - including border control and trade security."

While in Washington, Mr McCully will meet with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to advance cooperation in the Asia Pacific region.

Trade Minister Tim Groser will meet his counterpart, US Trade Representative Ron Kirk, and will also discuss climate change issues in his capacity as Associate Minister for Climate Change Issues (International Negotiations).

"We have been heartened by the recent US leadership on climate change. They will have a crucial role in helping deliver a successful outcome at Copenhagen," Mr Groser said.

During the visit, Mr Groser will also continue discussions on New Zealand's proposal for a global research alliance on agriculture greenhouse gas mitigation.
