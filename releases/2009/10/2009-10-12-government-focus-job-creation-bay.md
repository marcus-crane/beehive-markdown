Tariana Turia says creating jobs will be a key aim for the Bay of Plenty region over the next year.

"Our families have had it tough this year bearing the brunt of the recession," said Mrs Turia who will be launching the Ministry of Social Development's 2009/10 Regional Plan in Rotorua this afternoon.

"The recession is officially over but now we are faced with the most important task of getting those people made redundant back into the work force, and helping first-time jobseekers onto the employment ladder."

As at September end, the number of unemployment benefit recipients in the Bay went up from 1,791 to 4,383 from the same time last year. Nationally the figure has risen to 60,660 - an increase of 37,387 on 12 months ago.

Just some of the employment programmes that Work and Income will focus on include Kai Mahi, which so far this year has seen 87 beneficiaries placed into kiwifruit job positions, and the Community Max and Job Ops schemes which began in August.

"Bay of Plenty employers and communities have embraced these schemes and by doing so 92 young people are now on the employment ladder," Mrs Turia said.

The other major areas being highlighted in the ministry's regional plan include helping young people thrive, keeping children safe and value for money.
