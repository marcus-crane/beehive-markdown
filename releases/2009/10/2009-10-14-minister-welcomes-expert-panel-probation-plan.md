Corrections Minister Judith Collins today welcomed the release of a plan recommending a fundamental rethink of probation services.

The Probation Expert Panel today released a plan in which it would oversee improvements to the Department of Corrections' Community Probation Service (CPS).

"The Expert Panel has found that significant improvements can be made from a fundamental rethink and redesign of the way probation works," Ms Collins said.

"The Panel has already helped CPS undertake changes which have improved outcomes, but we need to ensure this improvement continues."

One of the main recommendations of the Panel is that CPS move away from a highly prescriptive and procedure-based framework to one where it manages offenders based on their risk to the community rather than the type of sentence.

"This will encourage a greater degree of responsibility among staff and provide greater accountability for their decisions," Ms Collins said.

The Panel was recommended by the State Services Commissioner after shortcomings were identified in the Auditor General's February report into the department's management of parole. The Panel was chaired by Paula Rebstock, formerly Chairperson of the Commerce Commission.

Ms Collins said the establishment of a chief probation officer role was another important development.

"This role will provide an additional level of professional leadership for staff and be responsible for recommending improvements."

The Chief Probation Officer would report directly to the Chief Executive on the findings and recommendations of any investigation that followed a major incident in the community.

"While there are never any guarantees there will not be another tragedy, the recommendations of the Panel give the public greater confidence that there has been an increased focus on safety," Ms Collins said.

"The Panel will continue to operate until improvements are made that are sustainable and enduring."
