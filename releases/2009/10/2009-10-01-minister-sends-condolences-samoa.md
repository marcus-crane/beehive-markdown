Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples expressed his shock and sadness at the deaths of so many people, and young children in particular, caused by the tsunami in the Pacific yesterday morning.

"Reports are still coming in, and we don't yet know the extent of this tragedy," said Dr Sharples.

"But we have heard confirmed reports of at least 112 people having been killed by the tsunami, following a massive earthquake off the coast of Samoa.

"I understand whole villages have been destroyed and swept away, and people on boats at the time have been drowned," he said. "There are confirmed reports of at least 83 deaths in Western Samoa, many more in American Samoa, and obviously many people still missing and areas cut off."

"Any death is a tragedy, especially in a tight-knit community. We grieve with our Pacific cousins in Samoa, Tonga, and elsewhere in the Pacific who may have been affected. Any disaster generates terrible stories of loss, and we feel the impact through the bonds of love we share," he said.

"I know our Government has already launched emergency support and aid, which carries the aroha of our people to those affected. As more information comes through, we will see more clearly how we can help with fundraising campaigns and donations of supplies.

"We stand in solidarity with Samoan and Pacific people in New Zealand, who will be distraught with worry for their relations back home.

"And we have also just heard of another devastating earthquake in Indonesia, and disastrous storms in the Philippines and Vietnam, and the people there, too, are in our thoughts and prayers," said Dr Sharples.
