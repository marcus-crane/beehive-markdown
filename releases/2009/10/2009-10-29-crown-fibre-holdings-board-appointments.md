Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce today confirmed the formation of *Crown Fibre Holdings Limited,* and appointed its inaugural Board.

Crown Fibre Holdings has been established to manage the Crown's investment in ultra-fast broadband infrastructure over the next ten years.

Simon Allen, former Chair of NZX, and founder and former Managing Director of ABN AMRO New Zealand, has been appointed as Chair of Crown Fibre Holdings. 

Andrew Body, Miriam Dean QC, Dr Murray Milner and Keith Tempest have been appointed board members.

Mr Joyce says he's very pleased with the high calibre of the inaugural board.

"Crown Fibre Holdings is being created as an expert and independent decision-making body, and this board represents the range of skills and experience necessary to deliver the government's ultra-fast broadband initiative."

"Delivering ultra-fast broadband to 75 percent of New Zealanders where they live, work and study within the next ten years is a key priority for the Government. 

"We've committed up to $1.5 billion to this and we expect that to be at least matched by private sector investment. An investment of this size requires the commercial, technical and legal expertise and nous that this board brings."

Appointments are for a three-year term, commencing immediately. Further Board members may be announced at a later time.

Further information on the board and the government's ultra-fast broadband initiative is available at [www.med.govt.nz/ultra-fast-broadband](http://www.med.govt.nz/ultra-fast-broadband).
