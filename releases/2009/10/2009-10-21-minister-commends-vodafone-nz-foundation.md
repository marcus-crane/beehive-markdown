The Youth Affairs Minister is commending the work the Vodafone New Zealand Foundation is doing to make a difference in the lives of young Kiwis.

Each year the Foundation's World of Difference programme supports six people to spend a year working with the youth-related cause of their choice.

"This is a fantastic scheme. Not only does it provide a unique opportunity for industrious individuals to work with young people, fosters relationships between community organisations and a major corporation," Paula Bennett says.

"It's a great example of how corporate philanthropy is moving beyond simply writing cheques. The Vodafone Foundation is taking a fresh approach to volunteering and taking a new generation along with it.

"The Vodafone Foundation has also led the way in ensuring its Grants Making Programme supports innovative and much needed youth services and facilities. 

"Its funding has made possible Youthline's state of art community centre, a consortium with UniServices to support the workforce development of youth health workers, SAFE's young adult sexual abuse prevention programme and the Digivoice project that gives young people a voice using innovative technology.

"As a nation we need to celebrate our young people and back them to succeed.  I'm heartened that by working with organisations like the Vodafone Foundation we can do exactly that," says Paula Bennett.
