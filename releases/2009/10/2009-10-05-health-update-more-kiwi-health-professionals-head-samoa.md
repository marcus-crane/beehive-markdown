Health Minister Tony Ryall says as the demand for emergency surgery in Samoa lessens and the focus shifts to recovery, public health staff are now being flown in to work on minimising the impact of infectious and communicable diseases. 

"We are advised there is a strong demand for on-going wound care and a growing need for mental health staff to support grieving communities.

"Field health clinics are being set up in some of the more isolated areas on the south coast and hills to provide treatment to those in remote villages who haven't already sought medical care" says Mr Ryall.

The Health Minister says there will be a further twelve staff in Samoa by tomorrow night in addition to the 14-strong health team who arrived on Sunday (4 October).

Five left early this morning, and seven more are due to depart on a New Zealand Defence Force flight leaving at midday tomorrow, Tues 6 Oct.  They include a plastic surgeon, a psychiatrist, Samoan-speaking grief counsellors, an infectious diseases specialist, doctors, wound care nurses and support staff..  

"We have been able to provide a number of Samoan-speaking health personnel who have worked in Samoa before and they're proving invaluable I'm told," the Minister says.

A large contingent of Australian medics who have been in Samoa since the tsunami hit are being gradually replaced by New Zealand staff over the coming week.  

Additional equipment, medication and wound care supplies are being sourced and flown in to meet local needs.

New Zealand's response to the disaster in the Pacific is being coordinated nationally by NZAID.

Coordinator of the New Zealand health volunteers, Ron Dunham, says "People are   very keen to do all they can to help."

"Our people on the ground in Samoa are identifying where the areas of need are, and we are coordinating resources with Australia to ensure that we provide the most effective help possible.

"We have a very impressive pool of people who are keen to help with the disaster relief effort.   Samoa will need our help for weeks and months to come and we anticipate a constant flow of staff heading up to meet the ongoing health needs of the people in Samoa.

Any health professional, including those working in primary care, who wants to offer support should contact the emergency controller at their local DHB or phone **09 263 1381** or fax **09 261 3396** or email [**Incident.Controller@middlemore.co.nz**](mailto:Incident.Controller@middlemore.co.nz) outlining relevant qualifications, experience, availability and contact details.
