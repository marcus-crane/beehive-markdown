Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples says he's happy that Maori Television's bid to broadcast the Rugby World Cup will be considered on its merits, alongside all other contenders.

"There's been a lot of misinformation, especially from Labour MPs, about Te Puni Kokiri giving grants or subsidies to Maori Television to up the ante," said Dr Sharples. "That's nonsense, of course."

"I think it's quite clear that Te Puni Kokiri is in fact buying a package deal of programming that will wrap around the rugby broadcasts, during the two years of build-up as well as the live games.

"That programming will help and encourage all viewers to use Maori words and phrases in everyday conversation, for example, and celebrate the contribution that Maori make to New Zealand's economy, society, culture and arts," he said.

"This promotion of Maori development is part of Te Puni Kokiri's role, and the programming will celebrate New Zealand identity in a much more interesting way than advertisements for fast food, cars or home appliances.

"As for coverage, I am confident that will not be an issue. The Prime Minister has set out his expectation that all New Zealanders should be able to watch the games, and I fully endorse that.

"At this stage, the bids are in, and I think we should leave the bidders and the IRB to negotiate a deal that's good for all New Zealanders," said Dr Sharples.
