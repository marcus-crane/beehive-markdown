The Cabinet has approved setting up a taskforce to determine how New Zealand can get the greatest benefit from its Crown Research Institutes (CRIs), Minister of Research, Science and Technology Wayne Mapp announced today.

The taskforce will examine the purpose, governance and funding of CRIs. Its members are Neville Jordan, Dr Ron Sandland, John McKenzie and Dr Rod Carr.  The chief executives of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Treasury, the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology and the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology will also be part of the taskforce.

Dr Mapp said the Government is firmly committed to science and technology. "CRIs must play a central role in lifting New Zealand's economic performance," he said.

"The CRIs were established in 1992. It is now time to revisit their purpose and operation. They are a crucial part of New Zealand's research sector. They must be delivering on national priorities and responding to the needs of research users, particularly industry and businesses," the Minister said.

The taskforce's work will complement two other Government Research, Science and Technology initiatives: a review of investment priorities, and assessing options for improving business research and development performance.

The taskforce will report to the two CRI shareholding Ministers, Finance Minister Bill English and Dr Mapp, by the end of December.
