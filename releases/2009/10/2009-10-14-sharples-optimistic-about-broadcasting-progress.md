Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples says the arrangements outlined by the Prime Minister and himself should ensure great TV coverage of the Rugby World Cup, and he hopes broadcasters and the IRB can reach agreement on the practical details of implementing the deal.

"I am pleased MTS is expected to lead the bid. I supported their original proposal, because I could see it would excite Maori people and mobilise their energy and passion to strut their stuff on a national and international stage," said Dr Sharples.

"But the MTS bid was never just about Maori - it was a way to show New Zealand at our best. It is unfortunate how the whole thing became such a political football, but I am pleased we may have found a way forward. 

"I acknowledge MTS's hard work and sacrifices, to address concerns over coverage and access. I am sure the board and management of MTS will show outstanding leadership of a truly inclusive national bid, and I look forward to new arrangements taking co-operation and unity to a new level," he said. 

Dr Sharples said he looks forward to hearing how the broadcasters get on, and he does not intend to make any further comments for the moment.
