"The Vice Premier's visit is further evidence of the strength of the economic and political connections between China and New Zealand. 

"We have just celebrated the first anniversary of the China-New Zealand FTA, and trade between us is growing very well. The visit offers an excellent opportunity for us to discuss a range of issues of importance to the relationship," Mr English said.

The Vice Premier will have meetings with Prime Minister John Key and Mr English and attend an official Ministerial dinner hosted by the Prime Minister.  

In Christchurch, his delegation will visit Canterbury University where the Vice Premier will open New Zealand's second Confucius Institute.  He will also visit a farm at Lincoln University and attend a dinner hosted by Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker.
