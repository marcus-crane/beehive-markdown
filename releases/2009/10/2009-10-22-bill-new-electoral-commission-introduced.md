A bill that establishes a new Electoral Commission with over-arching responsibility for electoral administration was introduced to Parliament today by Justice Minister Simon Power.

The Electoral (Administration) Amendment Bill will establish the commission, which will be an independent Crown entity separate from executive government.

Responsibility for electoral administration is currently split between the Chief Electoral Officer, the Electoral Commission, and the Chief Registrar of Electors through the Electoral Enrolment Centre.

Mr Power said having one agency would remove duplication and confusion over responsibilities, as well as saving costs and reducing complexity for political parties, constituency candidates, and the public.

"Ongoing reviews have found the existing arrangements to be flawed.

"The proposal for a single entity will address those flaws and alleviate the pressure on the current agencies, political parties and candidates, and the public."

The bill will transfer the functions of the Electoral Commission and the Chief Electoral Officer to the new commission on 1 October next year, so it can administer the 2011 general election. 

"I'm confident the new agency will provide better access to electoral services and encourage a more integrated, efficient, and strategic approach to electoral administration." Mr Power said. 

"The adoption of an independent Crown entity for electoral administration will provide the best balance of a high level of independence with good accountability and the ability to administer the electoral functions to a high standard."

A further bill will transfer the functions of the Chief Registrar of Electors to the new commission on 1 October 2012.

The reform is in two stages to ensure transition to the new commission does not create risk for the administration of the 2011 election.
