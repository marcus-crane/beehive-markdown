Tariana Turia is praising Ngati Manawa for leading a hikoi in Murupara today against the violence that has seen two children killed in their town over the past nine months.

"Every child is precious - they are the legacy of our learning, the face of our future and this is a message Ngati Manawa and the Murupara community will be reiterating when they march today," Mrs Turia said.

"I support Ngati Manawa's call for help to address the cultural dislocation and disconnection that leads people to commit acts of violence, and as a minister I will do my very best to help them.

"The march is not about blaming anyone or any group but heeding the cries of a people, of a community who rightfully so want their children kept out of the firing line," Mrs Turia said.

"Ngati Manawa is leading the way in their fight against violence and I encourage other communities to look to them in times like this."

Mrs Turia realised there were "deep societal issues" that led to violence and that any solution would not be a quick fix.

The Ministerial Committee on Family Violence has requested that a stock-take be done on all Government spending on family violence programmes.
