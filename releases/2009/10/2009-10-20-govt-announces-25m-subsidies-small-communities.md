The government has approved nearly $19 million of subsidies for small communities to help them improve drinking water supplies and another $5.8 million for new sewerage systems, Health Minister Tony Ryall has announced.

"The 66 successful water supply applications are the last to be assessed under the scheme's old criteria. The drinking water subsidy scheme is currently being reviewed, because we want to be sure that it is benefiting the small communities which have the greatest need."

"In this latest round of applications, the Sanitary Works Technical Advisory Committee (SaWTAC) recommended 66 of the 72 drinking water applications be funded, and three of the nine sewerage applications. And we have accepted SaWTAC's recommendations."

"The drinking water assistance applications came from a variety of territorial authorities, marae and community organisations - all with communities of under 5000 people."

The amount of subsidy made available to specific communities is commercially sensitive at this stage, as communities will be seeking tenders for the various projects.

Successful applicants will be notified this week.
