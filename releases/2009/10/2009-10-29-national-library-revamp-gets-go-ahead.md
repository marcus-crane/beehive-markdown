The Government has approved plans to solve critical storage and infrastructure issues in the National Library's Wellington building, the Minister Responsible for the National Library, Nathan Guy announced today.

"This $52 million revamp, starting in mid-2010, will ensure the ongoing safety and preservation of the nation's taonga and documentary heritage.

"The National Library urgently needs a significant structural overhaul if we want to protect those treasures".

Mr Guy says the National Library has put significant effort into planning the redevelopment and the relocation of the collections.

 "The National Library's staff will be advising customers of relocation details, and how to access collections, while the building work is underway."

It is expected the renovations will be completed by early 2012.
