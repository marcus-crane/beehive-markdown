Foreign Minister Murray McCully heads for Asia tomorrow to attend the East Asia Summit in Thailand and then travel on to South Korea and Japan.

Mr McCully will join the Prime Minister John Key in Hua Hin for the EAS on 25 October before heading to Seoul, where he will meet Prime Minister Chung Un-chan, Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan, and Reunification Minister Hyun In-taek. 

"South Korea is New Zealand's ninth largest trading partner and is an important potential partner for us in fields such as science and technology, investment, and film," Mr McCully said.

"New Zealand is also actively engaged in supporting peace and stability efforts on the Korean Peninsula. We have Defence Force personnel deployed as part of the United Nations force stationed at the De-Militarised Zone between South and North Korea, and we are firm supporter of the Six Party Talks and other efforts aimed at pressing North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions."

Mr McCully will then travel to Tokyo, where he will meet counterpart Katsuya Okada, and attend the Japan New Zealand Business Council and the Japan New Zealand Partnership Forum.

"As the Minister for the Rugby World Cup, the visit to Tokyo also presents an opportunity to promote New Zealand's hosting of the 2011 Cup.

"With Rugby Sevens now confirmed as an Olympic sport, and Japan set to host the Rugby World Cup in 2019, for the next decade at least rugby will be a great way to build friendships, and business and trade relationships in the Asia-Pacific region," Mr McCully said.
