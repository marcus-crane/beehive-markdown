The Government has announced today that it will continue the Fruit in Schools programme, but is cutting the administration component.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says "When introduced, the previous government said Fruit in Schools funding would be for three years, and after that schools would be expected to pay for the fruit themselves."

"Schools were aware of this when they entered the scheme. For some schools that three years was up in June this year, but the Government agreed to roll the funding over for an extra six months pending a review."

"We've now decided to extend the Fruit in Schools programme for all qualifying low-decile schools. But we will no longer pay for DHB provider staff to oversee the programme nor will the programme fund teacher release time."

"Fruit in Schools will now become part of the Health Promoting Schools programme run by DHBs, and this will save more than $4 million a year, which will be spent on other health services."

"Last year, Fruit in Schools cost $12 million, with just over half spent on fruit."
