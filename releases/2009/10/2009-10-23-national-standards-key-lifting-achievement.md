Prime Minister John Key will today fulfil a major election promise with the launch of National Standards in reading, writing, and maths for primary and intermediate schools.

"We have a strong mandate from parents and we are delivering for them," says Mr Key, who will launch the standards with Education Minister Anne Tolley at Glen Taylor School in Auckland today.

"National Standards will lift achievement levels for New Zealand children, and will give parents plain English reporting on their child's progress."

The standards provide clear signposts for teachers and parents on how students are achieving in literacy and numeracy. 

"As many as one-in-five students are being left behind. We need to identify those students early so they get the help they need to make progress.

"The Government is providing $36 million over four years to support schools in doing this.

"Parents want, and deserve, clear information on how their children are doing at school. Parents can't help if they don't know there is a problem in the first place.

"Under National Standards, schools will report to parents twice a year from 2010.

"In order to succeed, our children must have the very best educational opportunities.

"National Standards will help realise those opportunities."
