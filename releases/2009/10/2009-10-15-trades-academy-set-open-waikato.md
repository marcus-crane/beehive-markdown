Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced that the Waikato will be the base for one of five new trades academies set to open in 2011.

"Every student should have an education system which works for them and which meets their needs and the Waikato Trades Academy, a joint venture between Waikato Institute of Technology and Cambridge High School, will help deliver this," said Mrs Tolley.

"Trades academies are part of the Government's Youth Guarantee programme. They'll provide more career choices for 16 and 17 year olds, and give them greater opportunities to develop their knowledge, skills and talents through trades and technology programmes."

The Waikato Trades Academy will initially focus on automotive engineering, carpentry, engineering, hospitality and beauty industry courses. Cambridge High School is also looking to expand to focus on the equine industry.

Waikato Institute of Technology and Cambridge High School propose to partner with 11 schools and a number of industry partners, with a planned mobile workshop to benefit remote schools. The academy will give students a head-start in an industry-related career, earning both NCEA credits and a tertiary qualification.

There were 113 expressions of interest from providers across New Zealand. Four other trades academies will open in 2011 based at:

- Northland College
- Wellington Institute of Technology
- Taratahi Agricultural Centre
- Catlins Area School

Six additional proposals put to the Ministry by education providers will also be developed with a view to establishing trades academies.

"This government is committed to bringing out the best in our young people. We want to see more students gain qualifications which will set them on a strong career path and help them achieve in their chosen field."
