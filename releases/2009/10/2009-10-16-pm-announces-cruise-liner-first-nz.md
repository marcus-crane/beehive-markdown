Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism John Key announced today that P&O Cruises will launch its next cruise liner in Auckland and said the ship will use Auckland as its base for the 2010-2011 summer cruising season.

Mr Key made the announcement as he opened the start of the 2009/2010 cruise season at a celebration in Auckland.

This is the first time the company has launched one of it ships in New Zealand.

The Pacific Pearl is a 63,500 tonne, 1800-passenger superliner and will be launched in Auckland on 19 December next year.

"This is a big vote of confidence in the growth of the New Zealand cruise ship market. It also shows that the Government's commitment to build a cruise ship terminal at Queens Wharf is a worthy investment in the tourism industry," says Mr Key.

"The cruise industry is of huge value to both national and regional tourism markets, with each visit contributing around $500,000 through port fees, stores and passenger spending.

"Having the Pacific Pearl based out of Auckland can only enhance an industry that is already worth $174 million annually."
