Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce today released a discussion document on complementary measures the government is considering to facilitate the deployment of broadband infrastructure by local fibre companies and other telecommunications companies. 

"Access to ultra-fast and high-speed broadband is part of the essential infrastructure of a productive and growing economy, and will be crucial to New Zealand's improving its competitive advantage in the global market. 

"The government is considering a range of regulatory and non-regulatory measures that the government, local councils and industry groups could adopt to support the roll-out of both the government's recently announced initiative on ultra-fast broadband and the government's rural broadband strategy," says Mr Joyce.

Submissions on measures relating to access to support structures and services, access to land and Resource Management Act controls should be made to the Ministry of Economic Development by **5.00pm, Friday 6 November 2009**.

The Ministry of Economic Development is also hosting workshops in Wellington, Christchurch and Auckland on the 12th, 14th and 16th of October respectively, to enable interested parties to better understand the issues addressed in the discussion document.

**Questions and Answers**

## What are complementary measures?

Complementary measures are regulatory and non-regulatory measures that the government and others, such as Local Councils and industry groups, could adopt to facilitate the roll-out of broadband infrastructure by reducing deployment costs, speeding up consenting processes, and encouraging the use of existing support structures.  These measures fall into three clear categories:

- \- access to support structures and services;
- \- access to land; and
- \- Resource Management Act controls.

**What are support structures?**

Support structures are structures that support the physical deployment of ultra-fast broadband infrastructure such as fibre cables. This is likely to be primarily in the access network. Examples of such support structures are ducts and poles.  Organisations with potential support structures include telecommunications companies, electricity companies, local authorities, and Crown Entities.

**What are support services?**

Support services are infrastructure and services that support ultra-fast infrastructure once it has been deployed. This is likely to be primarily beyond the access network. Examples include fibre backhaul and in-house ducting and wiring.

**Are the complementary measures just for the ultra-fast broadband initiative?**

While supporting the government's ultra-fast broadband initiative is a key aim of these complementary measures, they will also be important for facilitating the roll-out of broadband infrastructure in rural areas.

**Will the complementary measures require legislation?**

A few of the proposed measures would require legislation, but most of the measures can be implemented without the need for legislation.

**Do the complementary initiatives have implications for property owners?**

At the moment, the government is not proposing legislation to require owners of support structures or services to make them available to local fibre companies and other telecommunications companies.  The government's initial view is that the owners of this infrastructure will wish to make it available on reasonable commercial terms.  The government will be monitoring to determine whether this is the case.

The government is seeking feedback on the costs and benefits of a small number of regulatory measures that do have implications for property owners, such as requiring developers to lay fibre infrastructure to homes and premises in greenfield developments. 

**Will non-regulatory measures be effective?**

The government is proposing a series of non-regulatory measures such as ‘best practice' guides and educational workshops, and self-regulatory measures such as national codes of practice.  The government has set an ambitious goal for the roll-out of broadband infrastructure through-out New Zealand and anticipates a lot of support from local communities and regions for the deployment of this infrastructure in their areas.  The Councils and regions that are most responsive to non-regulatory measures will be strengthening the case for early deployment of ultra-fast broadband infrastructure in their areas.

**What is shallow and micro-trenching?**

Fibre optic cables are often located in ducts that are placed in trenches dug in the road or in other environments.  Currently, Councils in New Zealand do not allow these trenches to be dug using modern trenching equipment that digs a very narrow and shallow trench, because of concerns about the effect of this type of trenching on road maintenance.  As using shallow and micro-trenching significantly reduces the cost of deploying fibre optic cables, the government is suggesting codes of practice to encourage Councils to implement standards permitting this type of deployment. 

**What amendments is the government considering to Resource Management Act controls?**

The government's preliminary view is that Resource Management Act controls are not in themselves a barrier to the roll-out of broadband infrastructure, but inconsistency and uncertainty in the application process across and between Councils may potentially create time delays and additional costs and impact the planning of fibre deployers.  The discussion document proposes measures that might assist in reducing this inconsistency and uncertainty.
