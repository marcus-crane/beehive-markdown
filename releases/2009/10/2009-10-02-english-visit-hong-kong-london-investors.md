Finance Minister Bill English leaves for Hong Kong and London this Sunday to raise New Zealand's profile with investors and business groups, and to share ideas about the next steps in economic recovery.

The six-day trip follows a similar visit to Tokyo and New York last month.

"It's important that we are talking directly to these groups in the world's financial capitals, with the Government needing to borrow about $40 billion over the next four years," Mr English says.

"I also want to get a better feel for the growth prospects in these economies - particularly how they are moving out of the recession stimulus phase and into economic recovery mode."

During his two days in Hong Kong, Mr English will call on Hong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Executive Norman Chan and Hong Kong SAR Chief Secretary for Administration Henry Tang.

He will also speak to the New Zealand Chambers of Commerce in Hong Kong and meet investors.

In London, Mr English will meet British Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling, and speak to businesses and investor groups.

"As I did during my visit to Japan and the United States last month, I'll be reminding investors that New Zealand's economic fundamentals are sound and that we are well positioned to come out of the recession ahead of many other countries," Mr English says.
