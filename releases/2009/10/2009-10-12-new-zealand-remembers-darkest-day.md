The loss of almost 850 young New Zealanders in the fields near the Belgian village of Passchendaele continues to be felt 92 years later, Veterans Affairs Minister Judith Collins said today.

"Along with Gallipoli, Passchendaele remains a byword for the terrible sacrifice made by a young New Zealand during the Great War," Ms Collins said.

"In 1917 New Zealand's population was only around 1 million. The loss of 840 young men cut down by German machine guns in a single day touched every family in the country.

"The New Zealanders were motivated by a powerful sense of duty to their country, and marched to their deaths without question. Their loss in an ill-conceived campaign continues to be felt as we remember one of our country's darkest days."

Under the command of the British Commander in Chief, Sir Douglas Haig, the allies were ordered to take Passchendaele on 12 October 1917. 

The Germans repelled the attack with machine gun fire from their bunkers.  On 13 October 1917 the order was given to stop the attack. 

In terms of lives lost on a single day it was the greatest disaster in NZ history, with 2700 casualties, including 845 New Zealanders killed.
