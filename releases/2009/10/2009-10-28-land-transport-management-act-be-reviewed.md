Transport Minister Steven Joyce has asked for a review of the Land Transport Management Act (LTMA) to ensure compliance costs are minimised and planning processes simplified.

"The LTMA is the framework for the distribution of around $3 billion a year into a range of land transport projects and services," he says.

"Given the size of this spend, and the scope of the act, it is important to ensure the processes in place offer the greatest value for money possible.

"At present planning and decision making processes are overly complex, resulting in unnecessary compliance costs.

"This review will focus on improving those processes and achieving a durable piece of legislation for administering the land transport system."

Mr Joyce says the review will focus on simplifying and increasing the effectiveness of planning, funding and accountability under the LTMA rather than a major rewrite of the legislation.

The review will also look at measures for reducing the barriers to using tolling, borrowing and public private partnerships to fund transport projects and will also repeal the regional fuel tax provisions in the LTMA.

It is expected amending legislation could be in place by the end of 2010.
