Next week will be the last opportunity that New Zealanders have to express their views on the capability requirements of the New Zealand Defence Force as the public consultation phase of Defence Review 2009 draws to a close, Associate Minister of Defence Heather Roy said today.

"Defence Review 09 has drawn a pleasing response from the public and attracted over 600 oral and written submissions that have been received either by the Ministry of Defence or at one of a number of public meetings held around the country," Mrs Roy said.

"Due to public demand, the submission period was extended beyond its scheduled closing date of August 24 2009 to ensure New Zealanders had time to prepare and present submissions.  With public opinion from all sides of the Defence debate having now been heard and recorded, submissions will close at the end of the month.

"The closing of submissions will follow the final Defence Review 2009 public meeting - to be chaired by Hamilton East MP David Bennett - which will be held in Hamilton on Monday October 19 2009.

"Conducted by the Ministry of Defence, Defence Review 09 is focussed on capability requirements for the NZDF looking out to 2035.  I encourage anyone with a view on Defence to attend the upcoming and final meeting in Hamilton, or make their submissions by the end of the month to make sure they have their say," Mrs Roy said.
