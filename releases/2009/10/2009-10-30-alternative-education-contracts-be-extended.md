Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced that Alternative Education contracts with schools will be extended for 2010.

"I want to give certainty to the sector, following a review of Alternative Education," said Mrs Tolley.

"There will be some changes from next year as a result of the review, but further work is needed to get better outcomes for Alternative Education students.

"After the initial results of the review were reported to me, I asked the Ministry to carry out further consultation, as it is important we get things right for these young people. I have also met with the Alternative Education National Body and will include them in further discussions next year."

The review confirms that students in alternative education have complex and diverse needs, and that mainstream education does not always meet these needs adequately.

"The results of this review will assist us to better understand student needs, better address these needs and support students and schools," said Mrs Tolley.

"The Ministry of Education has begun a fundamental re-think of its approach to student attendance, engagement and behaviour as a foundation for better educational achievement. Findings from the Alternative Education Review, the District Truancy Service evaluation, and the Positive Behaviour for Learning Action Plan will contribute to this work."
