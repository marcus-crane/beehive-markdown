Police Minister Judith Collins today urged police graduates to build strong relationships with the communities they serve, and create a society where crime is not accepted.

Speaking at the graduation of Wing 259 at the Royal New Zealand Police College at Porirua, Ms Collins said each graduate would play an important role in building happy, safe and prosperous communities.

"I think the mark of a great police officer is one who has strong ties with the people he or she serves," Ms Collins said.

"An officer who knows their community well, who understands the needs of that community, is an officer that has the respect and trust of that community.

"In the years ahead, such relationships will be increasingly important to the maintenance of law and order in this country.

"While finding and apprehending criminals will always be the first priority of police, creating communities where crime is not tolerated is our best hope for tackling the causes of crime.

"It's a fact that less crime leads to stronger communities. It's also true that stronger communities can help stop crime taking root. That is our goal."

Today's graduation saw an additional 40 officers join the ranks of the New Zealand police and is the sixth graduating Wing this year.

Trainees undertake an intensive 19-week course at the college.

All of today's graduates will be posted to frontline roles as they begin a two-year probationary period.
