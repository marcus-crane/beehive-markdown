Conservation Minister Tim Groser has today announced the allocation of funding grants totalling over $3 million dollars for more than 70 conservation projects across 23 thousand hectares of private land.

Successful applicants for the Department of Conservation's Biodiversity Advice and Condition Funds 2009, granted to enhance management of biodiversity on private land, have been funded to the value of $3,261,641.

"Encouraging private landowners to get involved in conservation work is one of the Government's priorities - conservation is a partnership and this funding will provide strong support for my department's conservation goals," Mr Groser said.

The largest of the grants went to the Maungatautari Ecological Island Project, in Waikato which received $300,000 for the next three years. The Maungatautari Project is a fully enclosed 3400 hectare sanctuary in the Waikato involving private and publically managed land. 

"Maungatautari is a prime example of what private landowners can achieve and this funding will help ensure that the momentum in building this safe haven for species like takahe and kiwi continues," Mr Groser said.

Over 70 other projects are also being funded featuring protection projects for a wide range of forest types, as well as a number species protection projects including takahe, kiwi, blue duck, and kauri snails.
