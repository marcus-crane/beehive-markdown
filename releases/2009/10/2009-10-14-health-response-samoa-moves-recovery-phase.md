The New Zealand Government's health response to the tsunami in Samoa is now moving to the recovery phase.  Plans are in place to determine the on-going help that will be required to support the health system in Samoa as they gradually return to "business as usual".  

"We are continuing to rotate staff up to Samoa, and this will carry on for some weeks yet.  A relief liaison manager and logistics person left for Samoa yesterday, and today two GPs and a general surgeon will join the roster in Samoa," said Minister of Health, Tony Ryall.

"While the demand for acute and emergency surgery has decreased, our staff report that around 100-130 people are still being seen each day by health teams working in field clinics.  On-going wound care and plastic surgery continue to keep hospital staff busy."

"Our psychologists and psychiatrists are involved in coordinating psycho-social support.  Our role is to help increase the local capacity and capability as the demand for psychosocial services will be ongoing."

New Zealand mental health staff have played a role in establishing ‘train the trainer' courses for school teachers in Samoa to ensure they are equipped to support young people through their grief.  

Since September 29 a total of 43 NZ medical personnel have been deployed through DHBs and the Ministry of Health. At present 28 New Zealand health personnel are currently deployed to Samoa.  This number will reduce to 20 as demand for services reduces and Samoan health providers are able to cope.

"In addition to personnel, New Zealand has dispatched well over three tonnes of medical equipment, supplies and medications." 

New Zealand has an existing arrangement with Samoa to support their health system by providing access to specialist care.  "This has been managed through Counties Manukau DHB for many years.  We are currently reassessing this arrangement to see how best to provide visiting specialist support to Samoa over the next 12 months," Tony Ryall said.
