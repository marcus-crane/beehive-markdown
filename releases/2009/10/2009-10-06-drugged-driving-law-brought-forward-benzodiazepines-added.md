The government has brought forward the start date of legislation aimed at tackling drugged driving to 1 November, a month earlier than previously planned.

Transport Minister Steven Joyce says drugged driving is a significant road safety issue and with the Police indicating that they will be operationally ready to go at the end of this month there is no reason to delay.

The 1 November start date coincides with the new road user rule banning the use of hand held mobile phones. 

Mr Joyce says the common commencement date will help raise awareness about both changes.

The scope of the legislation will also be widened to include benzodiazepines.  These are sedatives and anti-anxiety medications and research shows their use can lead to severe impairment in driving ability.

"When the legislation was passed in June drugged driving campaigners raised concerns around the exclusion of benzodiazepines," says Mr Joyce.

"I asked officials to look into it and they reported that this class of drugs should not be excluded from the legislation. 

"With the support of most parties in Parliament the change to include benzodiazepines will be made this month as an addition to the Illegal Street Racing legislation.

"The drugged driving legislation is only aimed at drivers who pose a road safety risk.  A driver who is not impaired will not be affected by this law." 

The Land Transport Amendment Act 2009 creates a new offence for drivers impaired by drugs, introduces compulsory testing when the driver is suspected of driving while under the influence of drugs and allows for blood testing to determine whether there are drugs in the bloodstream.
