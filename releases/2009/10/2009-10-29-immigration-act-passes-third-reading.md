The new Immigration Act, which passed into law today will enhance border security and improve the efficiency of our immigration services, says Immigration Minister, Jonathan Coleman.

"The previous legislation is now completely out of date. The new Immigration Act will modernise and future-proof New Zealand's immigration legislation.

"Key aspects of the new Act include the ability to use biometrics, a new refugee and protection system, a single independent appeals tribunal and a universal visa system.

"The Government's aim is to create a world class immigration system. It is vital we have immigration legislation which allows us to protect the security of New Zealand's border and the integrity of our immigration system. At the same time, we must manage immigration in a fair and balanced way. This Act allows us to do all of those things.

"The review of the current Immigration Act began in late 2004. Since then, there has been extensive public consultation, both by the Department of Labour and the Transport and Industrial Relations Committee. This shows the importance that has been placed on getting this legislation right.

"It is expected that much of the legislation will come into effect in the next 12 to 18 months. This will give us time to talk to those who might be affected, and work out how the new law can work better for everyone," says Dr Coleman.
