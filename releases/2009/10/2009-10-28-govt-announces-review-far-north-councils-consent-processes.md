Environment Minister Nick Smith today announced a review of the Far North District Council's functions under the Resource Management Act.

"I am authorising a formal investigation into the Council's performance under Section 24A of the Resource Management Act," Dr Smith said.

"The Far North District Council processed just 37% of resource consents within the statutory timeframes in the 2007/08 Ministry for the Environment Resource Management Survey - a decline from 51% in the previous survey in 2005/06.

"I acknowledge the Far North District Council has taken some steps in the last year to improve its performance in this area. I want to work constructively with the Council through this process to ensure the RMA is well administered in the Far North.

"The review is constrained to resource management functions unlike the wider investigation into Environment Canterbury. The review will occur in November with a report concluded by the end of the year.

"The Far North is very dependent on the efficient management of its natural resources for its wealth and unique lifestyle. This review is about ensuring these functions are done as well as possible for the people of the Far North."
