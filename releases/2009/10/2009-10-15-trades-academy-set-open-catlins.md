Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced that Catlins Area School will be the base for one of five new trades academies set to open in 2011.

"Every student should have an education system which works for them and which meets their needs, and the New Zealand Virtual School in the Catlins will help deliver this," said Mrs Tolley.

"Trades academies are part of the Government's Youth Guarantee programme. They'll provide more career choices for 16 and 17 year olds, and give them greater opportunities to develop their knowledge, skills and talents through trades and technology programmes."

The New Zealand Virtual School will be a pilot for an ICT-focused way of delivering industry-related education. It will provide distance learning to students throughout the country, and will broker work placements for students and hold trade camps once a year for students to receive face to face teaching and learning along with detailed career guidance.

The New Zealand Virtual School proposes to partner with three other southern schools, a tertiary institution and several industry training organisations and industry partners. It will give students a head-start in an industry-related career, earning both NCEA credits and a tertiary qualification.

There were 113 expressions of interest from providers across New Zealand.

Four other trades academies will open in 2011 based at:

- Northland College
- Waikato Institute of Technology and Cambridge High School
- Taratahi Agricultural Centre
- Wellington Institute of Technology

Six additional proposals put to the Ministry by education providers will also be developed with a view to establishing trades academies.

"This government is committed to bringing out the best in our young people. We want to see more students gain qualifications which will set them on a strong career path and help them achieve in their chosen field."
