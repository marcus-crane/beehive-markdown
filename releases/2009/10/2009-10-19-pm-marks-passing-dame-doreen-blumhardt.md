Prime Minister John Key has expressed sorrow at the news that Dame Doreen Blumhardt passed away at the weekend.

Dame Blumhardt was a pioneer of art education and the founder of the Blumhardt Foundation, which was set up to foster art in New Zealand.

She was made a member of New Zealand's highest honour, the Order of New Zealand, in the New Year's Honours in 2007.

"Doreen received her well-deserved title of Dame at Old St Paul's in August and that capped off a lifelong passion for the arts that saw her internationally recognised," Mr Key says.

"My thoughts are with her family who will farewell her at Old St Paul's on Thursday.

"New Zealand art is richer for her commitment and achievements."
