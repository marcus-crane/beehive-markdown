Special ties that bind Niue and New Zealand together were reaffirmed and celebrated today, as Niue marked the 35th anniversary of its Constitution Day.

In a speech at the Nga Tapuwae Community Centre in Mangere, Pacific Island Affairs Minister Georgina te Heuheu commented that the day was an important milestone in the relationship between New Zealand, Niue and its people.

At the last census over 22,000 people self-identified as Niuean New Zealanders.

"The Niuean people are now part and parcel of the fabric of life in New Zealand," she said.

"While that is appreciated, the Government also understands the importance of language and culture in providing a strong base for the development and achievements of Niuean people in New Zealand.

"The ‘Mind your Language' programme developed within my Ministry with input from the Niuean community is part of the Government's support for Niuean language and culture in New Zealand.

"The New Zealand Government is also committed to the education and training of young Niueans and adults and ensuring they become a skilled part of our workforce and contribute to our economy.

"Since becoming Minister of Pacific Island Affairs I*'*ve come into contact with outstanding young Niuean leaders and look forward to meeting more."

Mrs te Heuheu visited Niue in July with the Prime Minister's delegation where they met with Niue's Government, members of the Assembly and the wider community.

The visit was short, but the Minister said it allowed them to understand better the challenges Niue was facing.

In the presence of the Niuean community, Mrs te Heuheu acknowledged the Niuean High Commissioner's commitment to the special relationship New Zealand and Niue shared.
