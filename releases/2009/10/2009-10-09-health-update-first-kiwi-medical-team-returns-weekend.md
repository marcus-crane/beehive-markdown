The first group of kiwi medical and support staff in Samoa are expected to return home this weekend.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says the group are expected to fly home on Saturday to Ohakea while eight more kiwi medical staff fly out to Samoa the same day.

"We owe our thanks to these health professionals who've dropped everything to get to Samoa quickly and who've been working long hours in difficult conditions" says Mr Ryall.  

"Some of the stories from our kiwi doctors and nurses have been uplifting, particularly where they have been able to provide care and treatment that is making a huge difference."

"Some of the stories are heart rending.  Particularly some of the staff who've had to treat a number of sick and dying children."

"Our staff report that there has been a smooth transition of care with the departure this week of the Australian health teams."

Most of New Zealand's health response to Samoa has been provided in Samoa but in a few Samoan tsunami survivors have been flown to New Zealand for specialist care.

Three arrived in Auckland on Wednesday.  The two adults and one child are all in a stable condition.

A kiwi baby born prematurely two days after the tsunami in Samoa and needing medical and surgical care not available there arrived back safely in New Zealand this morning.

The baby arrived in a specially equipped plane which left Sydney on Thursday and flew through the night from Samoa. The baby is in a stable condition in Auckland's Starship hospital.

More equipment, medication and wound care supplies will be sent from New Zealand this weekend - adding to the more than 16 pallets of health supplies and equipment already airlifted in to Samoa.

Mr Ryall said he was heartened by the many messages of support from people who wished to help.  

"The Government would like to acknowledge the commitment and dedication of the New Zealand health professionals who are working or planning to work in Samoa.  We have a pool of more than 600 health professionals who have volunteered to help."

We recognise the generosity of many people who have contributed in one way or another to New Zealand's response.  That includes companies like Fisher and Paykel who've donated specialist assisted breathing machines - at very short notice, and Glaxo SmithKline NZ who have donated 20,000 courses of antibiotics.
