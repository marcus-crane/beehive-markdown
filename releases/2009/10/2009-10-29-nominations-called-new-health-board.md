Health Minister, Tony Ryall is calling for nominations for the new National Health Board, announced as part of an administrative shake up in Health.

Nominations for the board can be made directly to the Minister's office by Monday the 9th of November.

Mr Ryall says, "It is my intention that the Board should reflect the public health service and should include senior doctors and nurses."

The NHB board reports to the Minister of Health. The NHB will provide more focused supervision of the $9.7 billion of public health funding the 21 DHBs spend on hospitals and primary health care.

"The Government is keen to keep up the momentum set by the Ministerial Review Group (MRG), so the benefits for patients are delivered as soon as possible."

As a package, the MRG recommendations accepted by the Government, including the establishment of the National Health Board, are expected to deliver savings of up to $700 million over the next five years, all of which will be spent within health.
