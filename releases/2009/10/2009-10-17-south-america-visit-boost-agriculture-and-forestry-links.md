Agriculture and Forestry Minister David Carter leaves for South America today to address the World Forestry Congress and to meet with Ministers, senior officials and business leaders in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay.

Mr Carter says the 10-day visit is an opportunity to promote New Zealand's primary sector expertise in the important South American market.

"The fast growing markets of Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay are opening new doors for our agribusinesses and offer major economic opportunities for New Zealand."

Mr Carter will give a keynote address to the World Forestry Congress in Buenos Aires, Argentina where he will focus on the advantages and sustainability of New Zealand's unique forestry model.

The Minister will also hold bilateral talks with Ministers and agribusiness representatives in Brazil and Uruguay, and host a number of agriculture and forestry trade promotion events.

"Discussions on the recently announced Global Alliance will be on the table as all three South American countries have significant interests in the area of agricultural greenhouse gas mitigation," says Mr Carter.

"Their support for the Global Alliance would be a major step forward for this initiative and my visit will be a valuable opportunity to test their interest."

Mr Carter is also scheduled to visit a major New Zealand dairy farm investment, ‘Leite Verde' in Brazil to open a new milk processing factory.
