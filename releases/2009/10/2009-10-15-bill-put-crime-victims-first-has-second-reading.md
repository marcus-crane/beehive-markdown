A Bill to help address the financial and emotional costs that fall on victims of crime passed its second reading in Parliament last night.

The Sentencing (Offender Levy) Bill was introduced in February as part of the National-led Government's Action Plan on Violent Crime.

"Addressing the negative impact of crime on victims is a priority of this Government," Justice Minister Simon Power said.

"Victims of crime have been neglected for too long, and we want to move to put them at the centre of the justice system.  This Bill will ensure that offenders contribute to addressing the harm they cause.

"The Bill imposes a $50 levy on all convicted offenders at the point of sentencing in court, which will be collected after reparation and before fines.  This is in addition to any sentence or court order.  

"The levy will be put into a special account administered by the Secretary for Justice, who will designate organisations as an 'approved agency' to be paid for services for victims.

"Currently, victims can receive compensation by way of court-ordered reparation, or may be covered for some costs under ACC or by discretionary grants from Victim Support.

"Victims will have services provided promptly, and more victims can be supported through the justice system."

There are also plans to redirect unclaimed money in the Victims Claims Trust Account into the levy account.

"We can never legislate away the pain and suffering faced by victims of serious crime, but we can respond to the practical needs and emotional costs that fall on victims of serious crimes in particular," Mr Power said.
