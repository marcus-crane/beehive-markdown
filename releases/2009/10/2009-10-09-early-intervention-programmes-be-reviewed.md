The Minister for Social Development and Employment Paula Bennett has announced the Family Start and Early Start intervention programmes are to be independently reviewed.

The programmes, which were both set up in the 1990s, deliver intensive home-based services to families with high needs to help parents support their children.

Family Start and Early Start are provided in 31 sites around New Zealand at a cost of $29.4 million.

The Minister has asked Jo Cribb to lead the review. Dr Cribb will be taking leave from her position with the Families Commission while she undertakes the review.

"I believe the review is timely - we need to ensure programmes set up in the 1990s are adequately serving parents in 2009 and into the decade ahead.

"We want to look at how the programmes were set up, how they're delivered and who they're delivered to. We also need to be sure that the money spent on these programmes is delivering value to the taxpayer.

"I'm committed to making sure all Kiwi kids get the best possible start in life, but sadly we know this isn't what happens in a number of families. To break cycles of disadvantage we need to be sure these families are getting the very best support available to help them help their children develop and learn," Paula Bennett says.

The final review will contain an analysis and recommendations of the effectiveness of both programmes, both nationally and regionally.

It's expected a final report will be with the Minister before the end of the year.
