Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce says the government is considering a proposal to change mail delivery over the 2009/10 Christmas period, subject to feedback from the public.

New Zealand Post is proposing to halt delivery of mail on Saturday 26 December 2009 and Saturday 2 January 2010, because of processing challenges given these days follow Christmas Day and New Year's Day.

The change would also mean posties could enjoy a long weekend holiday.

Mr Joyce says the government is supportive of this proposal, but wants to hear from anyone with concerns before agreeing to the changes

"Past experience suggests that the impact on customers is likely to be minimal."

New Zealand Post expects mail volumes to be light on these days.

Similar non-delivery has occurred over the 1998, 1999, 2004 and 2006 Christmas and new year holiday period.

If any person objects to New Zealand Post's proposal they should email [postalpolicy@med.govt.nz](mailto:postalpolicy@med.govt.nz) or mail Postal Policy Section, Ministry of Economic Development, PO Box 1473, Wellington 6140 by **Monday, 12 October 2009**.
