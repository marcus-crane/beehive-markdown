Education Minister Anne Tolley has asked the Commissioner of Auckland's Felix Donnelly College to begin consultation on the school's possible closure.

The consultation comes after recent reports by the Education Review Office and consultancy firm Cognition Education raised concerns about the management, teaching and student achievement at the school.

"The needs of the school's students are the key issue here and I am concerned that those complex needs are not being met at the moment," said Mrs Tolley.

"Students come to this school with a variety of social, learning and behavioural problems. These children attend Felix Donnelly College because they require the specialised care and attention they wouldn't get in a mainstream school.

"The Ministry of Education will work closely with the College during and after consultation to ensure higher educational standards. If the College closes, any new specialist model will have a much stronger focus on students' educational achievement."

Felix Donnelly College has a current roll of 69 students, most of them in the care of Child, Youth and Family. The school operates from six sites across Auckland and has had a Commissioner for the past two years.

Consultation is expected to take about a month, and will involve relevant agencies.
