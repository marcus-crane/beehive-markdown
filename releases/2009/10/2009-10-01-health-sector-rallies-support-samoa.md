The Health Minister Tony Ryall says New Zealand's health sector is mobilising to support recovery efforts in Samoa.

Mr Ryall expressed his sympathy to all those affected - both in Samoa, and here in New Zealand.

He says requests have been received from the Samoan government for orthopaedic surgeons, general surgeons, theatre nurses, anaesthetists and post-operative staff.  

The Ministry of Health's National Health Coordination Centre is currently working with District Health Boards to compile a register of New Zealand health professionals who are coming forward to volunteer.  

Any health professional, including those working in primary care, who wants to offer support should contact the emergency controller at their local DHB or phone 09 263 1381 or fax 09 261 3396 or email  
[Incident.Controller@middlemore.co.nz](mailto:Incident.Controller@middlemore.co.nz) outlining relevant qualifications, experience, availability and contact details.  

New Zealand's response is coordinated nationally by NZAID, and yesterday the Ministry of Health contacted them to offer personnel, medical supplies and equipment which are available immediately for disaster relief.

The Ministry has offered staff who are qualified to provide on-site medical needs assessments in Samoa to support the wider New Zealand response.

One staff member is in Samoa working with the disaster recovery team, already.

Ron Dunham, chief operating officer at Counties Manukau DHB will be working with Samoan health officials to identify the specific resources they will be needing and discussing other practical assistance New Zealand can provide.

Counties-Manukau DHB has longstanding relationships with hospitals in Samoa and Tonga.
