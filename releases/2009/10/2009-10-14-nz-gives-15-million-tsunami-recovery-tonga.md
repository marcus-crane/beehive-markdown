New Zealand will commit $1.5 million towards tsunami recovery and reconstruction efforts in Tonga, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"Nine lives were lost and significant damage was suffered by houses, other buildings, and infrastructure when the tsunami struck the isolated northern island of Niuatoputapu," Mr McCully said.

"The Tongan government has led a well-coordinated emergency relief operation, and with support from New Zealand, France, and Australia, immediate needs on Niuatoputapu have been met.

"A portion of the $2 million New Zealand allocated for immediate tsunami relief has been spent on emergency supplies and support in Niuatoputapu.

"The focus is now shifting to longer-term recovery and reconstruction, with the Tongan government currently producing detailed damage assessments. Early priorities emerging from that work include housing and infrastructure.

"Reconstruction work on Niuatoputapu will be difficult due to its isolation. Most supplies will have to go there by boat, which adds cost and complexity to the task of rebuilding.

"New Zealand's contribution of $1.5 million to these efforts underlines our commitment to help Tonga recover from this disaster as quickly as possible.

"Further discussions will be held with the Tongan government over the coming week on the finer details of our assistance, and where it can be most usefully focussed.

"The HMNZS Canterbury has recently arrived in Tonga. It is carrying goods donated by the Tongan community in New Zealand and will be able to help the Tongan government transport reconstruction equipment and supplies to Niuatoputapu," Mr McCully said.
