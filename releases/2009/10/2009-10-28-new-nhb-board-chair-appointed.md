Health Minister, Tony Ryall says the Government has appointed Dr Murray Horn as the establishment chair of the new NHB Advisory Board (NHB).

Dr Horn led the Ministerial Review Group (MRG) on Health which reported mid-year on improving public health services.

Mr Ryall says, "The make-up of the Board will be decided over the next few weeks. It is my intention that the Board should reflect the public health service and should include senior doctors and nurses." 

"This will ensure strong clinical input into the Board's advice and oversight."

"There is strong support for the Government's announcements made last week, and the health sector has signalled the need for a real sense of urgency in addressing the challenges facing us."

The Government last week announced an administrative shake up aimed at improving patient services and driving better value for money in health.

The National Health Board is a unit within the Ministry of Health, and will provide a more focused national supervision of the $9.7 billion DHBs spend on hospital and primary health care. The NHB Advisory Board will advise the Minister and Director General on the NHB's performance and activities.

"Dr Horn will bring a depth of experience to the role. As chair of the MRG he has built up strong links across the health sector, and a firm appreciation of the challenges and potential of the public health service."
