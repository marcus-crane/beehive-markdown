Civil Defence Minister John Carter will present the inaugural Ministerial Awards for Civil Defence Emergency Management in Manukau City tonight.

"I am delighted to be making the presentations to 38 Manukau volunteers who are all receiving long service awards," Mr Carter said.

"All these people have made significant contributions and deserve recognition at a national level."

The civil defence awards are designed to complement existing awards, including New Zealand royal honours and mayoral awards.  The award categories are:

- Long service, for at least 10 years civil defence emergency management (CDEM) service at the local or national level;
- Silver award, for important contributions to CDEM; and
- Gold award, for outstanding contributions to CDEM.

"I introduced these awards this year to recognise the work done by volunteers and career personnel in civil defence. 

"It is most appropriate to be making the first awards during Disaster Awareness Week.  Recognition of the great work done by these volunteers will also help to raise awareness of the need for all of us to be prepared for emergencies," said Mr Carter.
