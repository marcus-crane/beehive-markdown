A Labour Party attempt to stop the vehicles of repeat illegal street racers being crushed would result in dangerous cars being put back on the streets, Police Minister Judith Collins says.

Labour's law and order spokesman Clayton Cosgrove has proposed amendments to the Vehicle Confiscation and Seizure Bill which would remove provision for the destruction of vehicles.

Instead, it proposes confiscating cars of the worst recidivist offenders and allowing them to be sold to their friends. Ms Collins said this would simply recycle the cars back on to the streets.

"Without the added threat of vehicle destruction, this Amendment would see dangerous and noisy cars confiscated and resold to other illegal street racers because no-one else would want to buy them.

"With no real penalty, these vehicles would be back on the streets within days, terrorising residents and endangering other road users.

"The nightly misery that people in Christchurch and other New Zealand cities have endured for so long, would continue unabated."

Ms Collins said Mr Cosgrove, who is MP for the Christchurch electorate of Waimakariri, had not taken the concerns of residents worst affected by illegal street racing seriously.

"Confiscation and increased fines alone have failed to stop large, unruly gatherings of illegal street racers and sleepless nights for residents," Ms Collins said.

"The car is the most prized possession of the illegal street racer. Confiscating and destroying the vehicles of the worst, repeat offenders is the ultimate deterrent and will send a very strong message - illegal street racing will not be tolerated."
