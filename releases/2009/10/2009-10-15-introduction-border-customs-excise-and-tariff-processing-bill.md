An omnibus Bill that amends the Customs and Excise Act 1996, the Tariff Act 1988 and makes consequential amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, the Finance Act 1993 (No 2), and the Finance Act 1995 (No 2) had its first reading in Parliament today.

Customs Minister, Maurice Williamson, said "This Government recently announced that low-risk Australian and New Zealand passport-holders will enjoy a faster, more stream-lined exit through border processes at Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch Airports.

As part of this, automated processing through the ‘SmartGate' system will become an option for travellers holding either an Australian or New Zealand ePassport. The amendments relate to passenger interaction with the clearance process and are relatively minor.

"The Government's objectives are to improve the border crossing experience for trans-Tasman travellers and the effect of these amendments will be of benefit to the travelling public."

Maurice Williamson said that the the Border (Customs, Excise, and Tariff) Processing Bill amended interrelated Acts  to improve the processing and administration of goods and people. The majority of amendments relate to border processing and administration by facilitating New Zealand's international commitments or the use of new technology, while other amendments improve border processing or administration generally.
