A new record number of prisoners highlights the need to effectively rehabilitate prisoners and bring the prison population down, Corrections Minister Judith Collins said.

At the weekly headcount today there were 8520 prisoners behind bars in New Zealand prisons and police cells. The number has been climbing steadily, previously reaching 8509 on 21 September.

"This is a trend that cannot continue as the social and economic costs to the country are immense," Ms Collins says.

"A large number of these prisoners have been in jail before. While some are plain bad, for others reoffending is the result of them being poorly equipped to lead a law-abiding and productive life."

Approximately 43 percent of prisoners reoffend within a year of their release. Over half of prisoners reoffend and are reimprisoned within five years.

Last month, the Government launched a Prisoner Skills and Employment Strategy which will see an extra 1000 prisoners gaining skills and work experience.

The strategy will give prisoners on-the-job work experience and training through polytechnics and technical institutes, and increase the number of places available to prisoners wishing to gain NZQA recognised qualifications.

In July the Government announced that three additional Drug Treatment Units will be operating in New Zealand prisons by 2011, doubling to 1000 the number of prisoners able to undertake rehabilitation.

"If we are to bring prisoner numbers down we must look very seriously at addressing drug and alcohol addictions that lead to crime, and ensure prisoners have good work skills and can find a job," Ms Collins said.

"When we release people from prison, we don't want to see them back."
