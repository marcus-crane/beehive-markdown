Food Safety Minister Kate Wilkinson leaves New Zealand today for a week of meetings with Australian and Chinese counterparts.

In Brisbane tomorrow she will represent the government at the biannual Australia New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council meeting.

On Saturday she will arrive in Beijing to engage with Chinese officials on food safety cooperation issues.

"New Zealand's free trade agreement with China opens up the potential for vast commercial gains for New Zealand's food industry. Confidence in food safety systems is critical in realising these opportunities," says Ms Wilkinson.

"The Chinese Commerce Minister, Chen Deming, sees New Zealand as an innovator in food safety systems and both countries are keen to cooperate in this area."

Ms Wilkinson will meet the Chinese Minister of Health, Chen Zhu; and officials from the Ministry of Health and the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine during the China leg of her visit.

In Hong Kong, Ms Wilkinson will meet her ministerial counterpart, Dr York Chow, in addition to attending meetings in her capacity as Associate Immigration Minister and Associate Conservation Minister.

Ms Wilkinson will return to New Zealand on 28 October.
