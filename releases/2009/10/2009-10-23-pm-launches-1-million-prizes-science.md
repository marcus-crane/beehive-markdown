Prime Minister John Key has delivered on another promise to the science community by launching the inaugural Prime Minister's Prizes for Science.

Speaking at an event at Plant and Food Research in Auckland, Mr Key announced five categories of prizes worth a total of one million dollars.

"Our scientists are doing high-quality research in many areas but too often their achievements receive little public acclaim. We are committed to raising the profile and prestige of science in New Zealand," says Mr Key.

There will be five categories of prizes:

- The Prime Minister's Science Prize - $500,000
- The Prime Minister's MacDiarmid Young Scientist of the Year Prize - $150,000
- The Prime Minister's Future Scientist Prize - $50,000
- The Prime Minister's Science Teacher Prize - $50,000 to the teacher and $100,000 to their school
- The Prime Minister's Science Media Communications Prize - $150,000

Mr Key says, "New Zealand's prosperity rests on our ability to make full use of our scientific expertise. These prizes, by combining recognition and financial reward, will be important in attracting young people into science careers.

"Combined with my appointment of Professor Sir Peter Gluckman as Chief Science Advisor these prizes demonstrate I am serious about the role science plays in our economic performance."

The inaugural winners will be announced in February 2010 and subsequent winners will be announced in November each year.
