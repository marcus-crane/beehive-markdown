Associate Minister of Defence Heather Roy today announced that approval has been given for New Zealand veterans to receive and wear 15 gallantry medals awarded by the US and the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam War.

"The first of these medals - a Bronze Star with V device - will be presented to New Zealand veteran Brian Chippindale by US Consul General Randy Berry Jr in Auckland tomorrow," Mrs Roy said.

"The Governor-General's approval for the receipt and wearing of these medals completes the medals actions agreed upon in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in 2006 between the Government and representatives of Vietnam veterans, the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association (RNZRSA) and the Ex-Vietnam Services Association.

"Although the MOU focused on New Zealand and South Vietnamese medallic recognition, the opportunity was also taken to gain approval for three New Zealanders to accept and wear US medals awarded for acts of gallantry while serving with US units.

"This recognition will resolve a long-standing grievance of Vietnam veterans that those who delivered service beyond the normal will at last be allowed to wear these gallantry awards with pride.  These are all very brave men, and approval to wear these medals is fitting recognition of their efforts," Mrs Roy said.
