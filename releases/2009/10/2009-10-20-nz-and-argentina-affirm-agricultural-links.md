Agriculture and Forestry Minister David Carter says talks with his Argentine counterpart have been positive and he is confident the two countries can further develop agriculture and forestry partnerships.

Mr Carter is in Buenos Aires to give a keynote address at the World Forestry Congress and to hold bilateral talks with Ministers and agribusiness representatives.

He will also visit Brazil and Uruguay for bilateral meetings.

A joint statement released today by Mr Carter and Julian Dominguez, the Argentine Minister of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries, affirms the close cooperation between Argentina and New Zealand in the agriculture and forestry sectors.

The Ministers discussed a range of issues including climate change and the recently announced Global Alliance, agricultural trade liberalisation and agricultural and forestry research opportunities.
