September was a record month for homes being retrofitted with insulation and clean heating under the *Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart* programme.

Figures for September show that almost 6000 homes were retrofitted with insulation and clean heating, giving a total figure of over 14,000 homes retrofitted during the first three months of the programme.

Energy and Resources Minister, Gerry Brownlee, says he's delighted with the latest data which shows the success of the government scheme being delivered by Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA).

"The *Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart* programme is proving to be very popular with New Zealand homeowners," said Mr Brownlee.

"14,000 homes will now be warmer, drier and healthier", said Mr Brownlee.

The figures show that during September, 5868 homes had insulation and/or clean heaters installed. Of this figure, 3210 were low income homeowners and 576 were rental properties occupied by low income tenants.

"It is particularly pleasing to see that 65 per cent of those taking up the scheme in September were lower income owners or occupiers of homes", said Mr Brownlee.

"This shows that families most in need are benefiting from the programme."

The *Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart* programme began on 1 July this year. $323.3 million over four years was appropriated in Budget 2009 for the scheme, which is open to all New Zealanders with houses built before 2000.
