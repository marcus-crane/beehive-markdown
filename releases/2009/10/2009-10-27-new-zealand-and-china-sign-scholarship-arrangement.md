Chinese officials will learn from New Zealand's world-class food safety regime through a new scholarship arrangement, Food Safety Minister Kate Wilkinson announced today.

Ms Wilkinson and the Chinese General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine's Vice Minister, Zhi Shuping, witnessed the signing of the food safety scholarships arrangement in Beijing yesterday. 

Five Chinese officials will receive New Zealand China Food Safety Scholarships for post-graduate studies, giving them the opportunity to start specialised study next year.

Ms Wilkinson says the scholarships reflect the National-led government's commitment to cementing a strong food safety partnership with China.

"New Zealand has a wealth of expertise in food safety, and the Chinese government wants to tap into that knowledge so it can be used in their own regulatory regime."

In his April visit to China the Prime Minister highlighted food safety as an area for cooperation between the two governments.

Ms Wilkinson says the scholarship recipients will be able to use the knowledge they build up in New Zealand to make a positive impact on China's food safety systems.

"This programme is a great example of government working with universities and industry to maximise the benefits of our free trade agreement with China," says Ms Wilkinson.
