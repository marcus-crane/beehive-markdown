A new survey shows New Zealanders have more confidence in the Police than they did last year, Police Minister Judith Collins says.

Ms Collins welcomed the findings of the New Zealand Police Citizens' Satisfaction Survey 2009 which was released today. The survey was carried out by a research company for the Police.

The survey was conducted between 1 July 2008 and 30 June 2009 and canvassed the views of 8471 people, over a third of whom had experienced recent contact with Police. It was the second year the survey has run.

"It is vital to the smooth functioning of the justice system that people have trust and confidence in our Police. This survey reveals that people now have more confidence in our Police and that they are regarded as a positive influence in communities," Ms Collins said.

"At its heart policing is about service. I am delighted that Police continue to improve their service to the public and be responsive to the needs of the community.

"This Government is getting right behind them by funding for 600 extra officers on the beat, and practical new legislation that enables them to better tackle serious crime like gangs and methamphetamine."

The survey found that 72 percent of respondents had "full" confidence, or "quite a lot" of confidence in Police during the period of the survey compared to 69 percent the year before.

Respondents' perceptions of safety were similar to (within the margin of error) or better than in 2008. Forty five percent of people felt "safe" or "very safe" in their local town centre after dark, compared to 42 percent in 2008.

The percentage of those who agreed that Police are involved in their community's activities showed a significant increase, from 58 percent to 67 percent.
