New Zealand's commitment to the Samoan recovery continues with more medical staff heading to Samoa this evening.   

Health Minister Tony Ryall says the arrival of the Auckland based Emergency Physician and Emergency Department nurse coincides with the withdrawal of the Australian medical team.  Half of the Australian health contingent leaves today and the rest go tomorrow.  

Another six New Zealand health professionals are on standby expected to travel within the next couple of days.  The two nurses, one lab technician and three health protection officers are ready to go and are just awaiting confirmation of when they are needed in Samoa.  

Additional equipment, medication and wound care supplies continue to be supplied to Samoa. As a result a fourth operating theatre is now in use in Apia hospital.  

Mr Ryall says the New Zealanders are adapting well to the Samoan conditions.  "I understand that staff have been using powerful hand held torches to provide enough light to operate by."  

"From the limited reports we've received - which is  understandable given that they are concentrating on providing health services  rather than reports back home - we know that they have hit the ground running  and are trying to manage and treat as many people as possible."  

"I am advised the New Zealand teams have provided 27 operations on Monday, 15 yesterday and are continuing the work today. I understand most of the operations involve surgical cleaning of wounds and setting broken limbs."  

Mr Ryall says by this weekend the first of the kiwi health team will begin to be spelled out. They'll return home and be replaced with some of the more than 500 health professionals who've volunteered to help. This will continue as long as the situation requires it.  

New Zealand's response to the disaster in the Pacific continues to be coordinated nationally by NZAID.

Any health professional, including those working in  primary care, who wants to offer support should contact the emergency controller at their local DHB or phone **09 263 1381** or fax **09 261 3396** or  email  [**mailto:Incident.Controller@middlemore.co.nz outlining**](mailto:Incident.Controller@middlemore.co.nz%20outlining) outlining relevant qualifications, experience, availability  and contact details.
