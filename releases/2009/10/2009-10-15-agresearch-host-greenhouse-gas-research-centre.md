Agriculture Minister David Carter today announced the appointment of AgResearch, in collaboration with eight other New Zealand research organisations, as host provider for the new Centre for Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Research.

The partners are the Pastoral Greenhouse Gas Research Consortium (PGgRc), DairyNZ, Lincoln and Massey Universities, and Crown Research Institutes Landcare Research, NIWA, Plant and Food Research and Scion.

"AgResearch was selected to host the new Centre because of its track record and scientific capability in the areas of agricultural greenhouse gas research. This will be enhanced by the contributions of its partnering organisations," says Mr Carter.

"Collectively the group represents almost 95 percent of the research conducted into agricultural mitigation in New Zealand and it has strong international links, reflecting New Zealand's leading reputation in this area."

The Centre, established as part of the Government's Primary Growth Partnership initiative, will receive funding of $5 million per year for 10 years. It will be physically located on the AgResearch campus in Palmerston North and across the country at the various partners' facilities.

"The Centre for Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Research will promote win-win technologies that reduce emissions, and improve on-farm efficiency and productivity," says Mr Carter.

"It is clear that agriculture will be part of New Zealand's emissions reduction efforts, but the sector must have access to effective and affordable technologies that do not compromise productivity.

"The Government is also currently working on a Global Alliance of climate change research into agriculture and food production. The domestic centre will be a key contributor to New Zealand's participation in the Alliance and its commitment to mitigating the effects of agricultural greenhouse gases."

About half of New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, with methane from ruminant animals the biggest contributor.
