Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced that Wellington Institute of Technology will be the base for one of five new trades academies set to open in 2011.

"Every student should have an education system which works for them and which meets their needs, and the polytechnic's Wellington Regional Trades Academy will help deliver this," said Mrs Tolley.

"Trades academies are part of the Government's Youth Guarantee programme. They'll provide more career choices for 16 and 17 year olds, and give them greater opportunities to develop their knowledge, skills and talents through trades and technology programmes."

The Wellington Regional Trades Academy plans to offer a wide range of courses in the automotive and construction industries, as well as in technology, engineering, hospitality, business and the beauty industry.

Wellington Institute of Technology proposes to partner with 40 schools, government departments and industry organisations. The trades academy will cater for students across the wider Wellington region, giving them a head-start in an industry-related career, earning both NCEA credits and a tertiary qualification.

There were 113 expressions of interest from providers across New Zealand.

Four other trades academies will open in 2011 based at:

- Northland College
- Waikato Institute of Technology and Cambridge High School
- Taratahi Agricultural Centre
- Catlins Area School

Six additional proposals put to the Ministry by education providers will also be developed with a view to establishing trades academies.

"This government is committed to bringing out the best in our young people. We want to see more students gain qualifications which will set them on a strong career path and help them achieve in their chosen field."
