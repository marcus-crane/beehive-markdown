Associate Minister of Health Hon Peter Dunne says the Ministry of Health's Alcohol Use in New Zealand: Key results of the 2007/08 New Zealand Drug and Alcohol Survey report released today is a "valuable and timely contribution to the national conversation" on alcohol law reform.

"The survey confirms that most New Zealanders enjoy alcohol in moderation and clearly identifies areas where we need to focus most attention," said Mr Dunne.

"The prevalence of binge drinking among young people and the apparent accessibility of alcohol for underage drinkers is an obvious concern.

"While teenage drinking is well publicised, this report also highlights other population groups that experience high levels of harm caused by alcohol; particularly Maori men and women, Pacific men and high socially deprived communities."

 "The clear message this survey sends is that the review of liquor legislation currently underway needs to focus on measures that specifically target these most at-risk groups without interfering with or limiting the rights of the majority who consume alcohol responsibility," said Mr Dunne.

The report is available on the MOH website at: [http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/indexmh/alcohol-use-in-nz-oct09](http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/indexmh/alcohol-use-in-nz-oct09)
