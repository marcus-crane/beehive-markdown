The Government this week released two officials' reports relating to the plan announced last week by Prime Minister John Key to tackle New Zealand's serious ‘P' drug problem.

The reports are from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet's Policy Advisory Group.

They are entitled ‘*Tackling Methamphetamine: an Action Plan*', and ‘*Tackling Methamphetamine: Baseline Indicators Report'*.

The reports are now available on the Beehive website.
