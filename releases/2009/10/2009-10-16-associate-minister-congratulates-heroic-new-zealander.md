Associate Minister of Defence Heather Roy today on behalf of the Government congratulated New Zealand Army Colonel (retired) Brian Chippindale, who will tonight be presented with a US Bronze Star with Valour Device for gallantry during the Vietnam War.

"Col Chippindale will receive the award from US Consul-General Randy Berry Jr at a special ceremony in Auckland tonight - 41 years after he earned it in Central Vietnam," Mrs Roy said.

"In 1968, Col Chippindale was attached to a US unit as an observer.  When the unit commander was killed in an attack, Col Chippindale led a counter-attack that forced the enemy to retreat.  For this, he was awarded the medal - but never received it and was not given approval to wear it.

"Col Chippindale is one of 15 New Zealanders who are now permitted to wear gallantry medals awarded by the Republic of Vietnam and the US during the Vietnam War, following the Governor-General's approval to accept and wear these awards.

"This approval is part of a Memorandum of Understanding between the Government - with much work having been done by former Defence Minister Phil Goff - and representatives of Vietnam veterans, the RNZRSA and the Ex-Vietnam Services Association.  It resolves the difficult issue of the acceptance of foreign awards in an appropriate manner.

"While many medals for meritorious service and public service were awarded to New Zealanders by the Vietnam Government at the time, these were for completing good service - rather than gallantry.  Approval to wear gallantry medals is specifically for those awards included in the MOU.  Vietnam medals for meritorious and public service have not been approved for acceptance and wear.

"The decision around these gallantry awards reflects the attitude of the New Zealand public and has been fully supported by the RNZRSA.  This will allow those men who demonstrated gallantry and heroism in their own right to be recognised by their peers and the public of New Zealand," Mrs Roy said.
