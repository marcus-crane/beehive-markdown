Health Minister Tony Ryall says most people suffering winter colds and flu either use no medication to manage the symptoms or already use medication that contains no pseudoephedrine. 

"Up to 80% of over the counter cold and flu tablets already contain no pseudoephedrine."

**"**Most people find these pseudoephedrine - free products safe and effective during the few days they feel they need to take something.  This means that pseudoephedrine - based medication for colds and flu are not sought after as much as other cold and flu remedies" says the Health Minister.

"I am advised sales of pseudoephedrine - based medicines have been in decline for some time due to the availability of alternate effective products and the negative association between pseudoephedrine and P."

Pseudoephedrine is the substance used to illegally manufacture 'P' and yesterday the Prime Minister John Key announced a package to tackle P that includes restricting access to the chemicals P is produced from by making pseudoephedrine a Class B2 controlled drug, which makes it prescription-only. 

The Prime Minister's action plan also includes new Customs taskforces and $22 million on treatment services for P users.

The Health Minister says he is advised that alternative medications to pseudoephedrine like phenylephrine , which already have the largest share of the market, in addition to being safe and effective, cannot be used to manufacture P."

"While these changes will generally restrict access to pseudoephedrine, I understand that there are provisions within the existing legislation that can be used to allow patients with specific medical needs to still have access to pseudoephedrine in tightly controlled circumstances."
