Associate Finance Minister Steven Joyce will attend the Pacific Forum Economic Ministers' Meeting from 26-28 October in Rarotonga.

The Pacific Forum Economic Ministers' Meeting is one of the major annual set pieces for the Pacific Forum Secretariat.  The meeting brings together Economic and Finance Ministers from across the Pacific Islands, as well as Australia and New Zealand.

The major focus of this year's meeting will be discussion of the effects of, and responses to, the global economic crisis, as well as the recent tsunami disasters in Samoa and Tonga.

Mr Joyce says the meeting presents a valuable opportunity to underline New Zealand's commitment to the Pacific and to strengthen relationships with Economic Ministers from across the region.

"It will also be a good chance to share our experiences of responding to the global economic crisis and discuss development within the region."

Mr Joyce will return to Wellington on Thursday 29 October.
