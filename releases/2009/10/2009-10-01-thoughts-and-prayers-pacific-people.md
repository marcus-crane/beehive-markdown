Georgina te Heuheu, Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, today again expressed her deepest respects to all Pacific people, particularly Samoan and Tongan people, for the continuing unfolding tragedy in the Pacific.

"Since yesterday, so much more of this tragedy has been revealed - further loss of life including in Tonga, many loved ones still unaccounted for, and many more people injured and fragile.  In addition, families are now facing complete devastation in homes and villages."

The Minister said she was saddened at the loss of life from the earthquake and tsunami in the Pacific, particularly at the extent of this.

"I wish to extend my condolences and my sympathies once again to the people of Samoa and also to the people of the Kingdom of Tonga over the loss of so many lives.

"In this time of profound grief I seek to stand with Pacific people to share the sorrow and pain of this unthinkable tragedy.

"New Zealand and the Pacific share a strong and special relationship. Our shared Polynesian history and culture binds us together as Tagata Pasifika.

"May I on behalf of all Pacific peoples and communities throughout Aotearoa, extend our collective thoughts, prayers and arohanui to Pacific communities and people wherever they may be.

"As Associate Minister of Maori Affairs, I also know that Maori and iwi across the motu will also mourn this sad loss of so many lives.

 "I trust that Pacific people's strong sense of community and faith in God will stand them in good stead in the days ahead as they mourn those who have been lost, and prepare to rebuild their lives and communities."
