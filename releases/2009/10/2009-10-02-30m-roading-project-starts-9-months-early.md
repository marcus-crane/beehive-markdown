Work towards the realignment of the Matahorua Gorge between Napier and Gisborne has commenced today - nine months earlier than originally scheduled - thanks to an additional $142.5 million in funding announced in February as part of the government's Jobs and Growth plan.

Transport Minister Steven Joyce says the work will come as a relief to those who travel the section of State Highway 2.

"The project will improve safety by realigning a very narrow and winding 4.5 kilometre section of road which is heavily trafficked by freight, particularly logging trucks.

"This work will result in improved visibility and increased road widths, which will bring real benefits in terms of safety, efficiency and reliability.

"When construction is in full swing, the $30 million project will employ up to 100 people, including around 60 on-site and 40 more involved in supplying materials and providing supporting services.

"It is our expectation that the majority of suppliers and subcontractors for this will be regionally based, using a regional workforce and material so local contractors and their communities will benefit from the increase in work," says Mr Joyce.

The project involves:

- The realignment and widening of a narrow and difficult 4.5km section of SH2 crossing the Matahorua Gorge, between Napier and Gisborne.

<!--THE END-->

- Replacing the existing state highway through the gorge with a new 3.1km section of road that will instead pass over the top of the gorge with the installation of a new viaduct and "road over rail" bridge
