Recent rainfall has eased drought conditions in many parts of the country but farmers should continue to keep a close eye on the weather, says Agriculture Minister David Carter.

The return to more normal spring conditions means the Government can lift special recovery measures provided earlier this year to drought-stricken regions, mainly on the eastern coasts of both islands. 

Funding to Rural Support Trusts and industry bodies and rural assistance payments will finish on 31 December this year.  Currently 65 families are receiving rural assistance payments.

"While the effects of the drought will be felt for some time, the onset of spring has meant that pasture covers and cash flows will improve," says Mr Carter.

"A recent meeting of the National Adverse Events Committee advised that conditions have shown sufficient recovery to cease the special measures.  Other standard support measures, such as Working for Families Tax Credits, will continue.

"However, many farmers are not out of the woods yet when it comes to drought and the local Rural Support Trust should still be the first point of contact if farmers feel they need farm management advice and support," says Mr Carter.
