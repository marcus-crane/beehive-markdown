Transport Minister Steven Joyce is urging motorists to take care on the roads this Labour Day weekend.

"This is the first long weekend in a few months and, with more Kiwis choosing to holiday in New Zealand this year, it's likely that the roads will be unusually busy.

"Driving is a serious task that requires the full attention of those behind the wheel.  Please act responsibly to ensure your own safety, as well as that of your passengers and other road users.

"With just over a week to go until the new cell phone rule comes into force, this is the time to develop good habits by switching your phone off unless you're using a hands-free kit."

Last year, 4 people died over Labour Day weekend on New Zealand roads and 33 people were seriously injured.

"The government is working to develop a road safety strategy for improving road safety over the next decade. But we all have a responsibility for road safety," says Mr Joyce.

"Enjoy the weekend break but please use commonsense and patience on the roads."

The holiday period runs from 4.00pm today to 6.00am on Tuesday October 27.
