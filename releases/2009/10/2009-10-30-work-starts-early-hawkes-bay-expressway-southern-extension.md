The second major Hawke's Bay roading project to start this month got underway today as construction began earlier than anticipated on the Hawke's Bay Expressway's southern extension. 

Transport Minister Steven Joyce, who today turned the first sod to officially mark the start of construction, says the southern extension will bring significant safety and time savings to travellers.

"Work towards the Hawke's Bay Expressway southern extension was not scheduled to start until next year, but the government recognised its importance and was able to bring the project forward as part of the government's $500 million Jobs and Growth plan.

"This is the second major Hawke's Bay roading project to benefit from the plan, with the Matahora Gorge realignment project between Gisborne and Hawke's Bay starting earlier in the month.

"When construction is in full swing, the $12 million expressway project will employ about 30 people, with more involved in supplying materials and providing supporting services."

The Matahora Gorge realignment is expected to employ a further 100 people.

"It is our expectation that the majority of suppliers and subcontractors for these projects will be regionally based, using regional workforces and material so local contractors and the community will benefit from the increase in work," says Mr Joyce.

The Hawke's Bay Expressway southern extension will run between Hastings City and Flaxmere, providing a direct link between the roundabouts at Longlands Road and York Road.

It will remove a bottleneck and crash blackspot, providing a safer, more direct route for highway traffic, freeing up local roads and providing a long-term, sustainable solution which will support future growth in the region.
