The Government sympathises with the New Zealand Association of Bakers' frustration over Labour's legacy of mandatory fortification of bread with folic acid, says Minister for Food Safety Kate Wilkinson.

"Annette King led the charge to have mandatory fortification throughout New Zealand and Australia and ignored widespread public opposition, as well as advice from industry.

"New Zealand is part of a joint standard system with Australia, which is enshrined in both treaty and legislation and we take these responsibilities seriously.

"Once a standard is in place, there is a long process to amend or withdraw it.

"We are currently assessing our options to address this legacy issue and are more than happy to work with the bakers as implementation of the standard nears."
