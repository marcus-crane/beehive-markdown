Housing Minister Phil Heatley is pleased that there is now certainty for all involved after the Tenancy Tribunal ruled today that the 90-day notices issued to tenants from Farmer Crescent in Pomare were lawful.

Three out of the five tenants took their case to the Tenancy Tribunal to have the orders over-turned. The three tenants are still in Housing New Zealand properties and possession orders have been granted in respect of these.

"Now that certainty has been achieved through this ruling, it will allow both parties to move forward. I understand that all three households will be given time to leave the properties, and that Housing New Zealand continues to offer them assistance to find alternative accommodation."

"I support Housing New Zealand's Good Neighbour Policy and the standards of behaviour it sets down for state house tenants. It is important that everyone has the opportunity to live in a safe and peaceful neighbourhood," Mr Heatley said.

"This ruling also upholds the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act, which will give confidence to other landlords that this tool is available to them in appropriate circumstances."
