Māori innovation and creativity will be to the fore this weekend in Auckland as leading Māori business people, scientists, entrepreneurs, researchers and others gather to celebrate Atamira: Māori in the City 2009.

Associate Minister for Māori Affairs Georgina te Heuheu says she is thrilled to be involved and looks forward to backing the efforts of Māori entrepreneurs, exporters and manufacturers.

Atamira is hosted by Ngāti Whātua o Ōrākei and supported by the Government through Te Puni Kōkiri. There is a range of other leading sponsors and contributors.

Around 120,000 people are expected at the ASB Showgrounds in Auckland over three days to experience and celebrate Māori entrepreneurial, economic and cultural success.

Mrs te Heuheu says Atamira: Māori in the City sits perfectly with the National-led Government's commitment to ensuring Māori take their place in an innovation economy.

She will join the Minister for Maori Affairs Dr Pita Sharples to speak at the Icons Evening on Saturday where Māori leaders in innovation, science and technology will be affirmed with distinction.

Technological advances will have major implications for Māori because of their increasing ownership of agricultural, fisheries and tourism assets.

New technologies will allow Māori to differentiate products in the global market place while the development of high-value, Māori-branded products will open up new export markets.

‘The timing is perfect with the Rugby World Cup in 2011 providing a significant catalyst for promoting Māori language, Māori culture, Māori commerce, tourism, leadership and national pride,' she says.

‘Māori are resilient and flexible; they are traders and entrepreneurs possessing dual-world skills.

‘These contribute to the Māori "edge" and the National-led Government is very aware of the competitive advantages the Māori "edge" brings with it.

‘The business friendly initiatives introduced by the National Government are supportive of Māori commerce, tourism, entrepreneurship, innovation and energy.

‘Māori success in these areas means success for Aotearoa New Zealand

‘Events such as Atamira: Maori in the City give us the opportunity to showcase and celebrate these successes,' Mrs te Heuheu says.
