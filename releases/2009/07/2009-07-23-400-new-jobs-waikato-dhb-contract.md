Health Minister Tony Ryall has announced that Waikato DHB has signed a $118 million construction contract with Hawkins Construction Ltd to build the new Waikato Clinical Centre.

"The 32,000 square-metre, five level building, will create work for between 350 and 400 construction workers," Mr Ryall said.

"This will be a real boost to Hamilton during the recession, providing jobs for many tradesmen and apprentices."

The building will include:

- eight new operating theatres, with space for four more
- a 40-place day surgery suite
- a 34-bed intensive care/high dependency unit
- the radiology department, including space for future needs
- outpatient rooms for most acute medical and surgical specialties
- intervention suites, such as catheter labs, angiography and endoscopy

Mr Ryall says, "The building design ensures patients have all amenities close to their treatment area, including access to car parking."

Pre-construction work will begin immediately, with demolition and construction underway early next year.

This project was approved in 2004 and is being funded by the DHB. It is in addition to the $60 million emergency department and acute medical precinct with 100 beds currently under construction.
