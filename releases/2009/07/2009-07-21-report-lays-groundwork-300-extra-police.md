Police Minister Judith Collins today welcomed the release of a report which lays the groundwork for how 300 extra police will be best deployed in Counties-Manukau.

The Government has committed to increase the number of police in Counties-Manukau by 300 frontline officers by the end of 2010, and a further 300 for the rest of the country by the end of 2011.

Already, 64 of the 300 extra Counties-Manukau officers have been recruited and deployed. 

The report, "Planning for More Police in Counties-Manukau", evaluates police preparedness for the additional 300 officers. The report was compiled by Neville Stokes, a former police Detective Superintendent.

"I welcome the release of this report which looks at how extra resources can be best used to reduce crime and make Counties-Manukau a better and safer place to live," Ms Collins says.

"This report takes a hard look at policing in the district, and points the way to how police can be structured to best take advantage of the extra staff and resources.

"It's important that we ensure there are enough police in frontline roles in Counties-Manukau. It's just as important that the right people are in the right roles at the right time.

"This report provides a strong foundation on which the best policing model for the district can be built."

The second phase of the project, in which key recommendations of the report will be implemented, is now under way.

Counties-Manukau is the fastest-growing police district in the country. Between 2007 and 2008 it had a recorded increase in crime of 16.7% compared to a national increase of 0.7%.
