Tariana Turia says tobacco companies appear to be treading a fine line over their recent decision to drop the price of cigarettes so to make smoking more affordable in the current economic recession.

Last month, Mrs Turia advised the Ministry of Health to investigate whether the decision, by British American Tobacco and Imperial, to drop the prices of several of their brands is legal under the Smokefree Environments Act.

"I have huge concerns about what they are doing.

"It is outrageous that on one hand the government is spending millions of taxpayer money to stop smoking addiction and on the other hand, these companies are enticing smokers to consume more."

Mrs Turia is expecting feedback from the ministry on its inquiry by the end of this month.

"If that report says the tobacco companies are in breach of the act, then I'll have no hesitation in recommending they be taken to court."
