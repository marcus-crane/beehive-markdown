The long-awaited, much-anticipated work towards the replacement of the one-lane Kopu Bridge on State Highway 25 between Auckland and the Coromandel has started today - more than one year earlier than previously planned.

Transport Minister Steven Joyce, who today joined Prime Minister John Key for the turning of the first sod, says the new bridge will come as a huge relief to those reliant on it -particularly during the peak holiday period when queues of up to 10 kilometres long are not unheard of.

"The Coromandel is one of the country's fastest growing visitor destinations, with 2.5 million visitors expected in 2011, and traffic volumes expected to continue to rise year-on-year. 

"As well as creating a better link for holiday makers during the peak summer period, the new bridge will create a viable transport link for the community will support growing a strong local economy.

"Work towards the replacement of the Kopu Bridge was not scheduled to start until early 2011, but we were able to bring that forward as part of the government's $500 million Jobs and Growth plan.

"When construction is in full swing, the $47 million project will employ up to 50 people, with many more involved in supplying materials and providing supporting services.

"It is our expectation that the majority of suppliers and subcontractors for this will be regionally based, using a regional workforce and material so local contractors and their communities will benefit from the increase in work," says Mr Joyce. The project comprises the construction of a new 580m long two-lane bridge over the Waihou River at Kopu along with a new four-leg roundabout at the junction of SH25 and SH26 and about 2.5km of associated approach roads, including a new link road to SH26 east of the bridge.
