Defence Minister Wayne Mapp will represent New Zealand at the third triennial France-Oceania Summit in Noumea on Friday 31 July.

"France is an important player in the Pacific region," said Dr Mapp. "The Oceania Summit is an excellent way for Pacific countries to engage across a range of issues."'

The agenda includes discussion of regional politics and security, economic growth, sustainable development and climate change. The Summit will be chaired by French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner.

‘Whilst in Noumea, I will also visit Les Forces Armees de Nouvelle Caledonie (FANC) and particularly thank them for their role on the rescue of New Zealanders from the yacht Carenza in distress last month. This co-operation between the RNZAF and the French patrol ship La Glorieuse illustrates how we work practically together for the safety of people throughout our region," said Dr Mapp.

Dr Mapp will also lay a wreath at the Bourail New Zealand War Cemetery.

"The graves of 239 New Zealanders are a reminder of the magnificent contribution our country made in some of the toughest campaigns of the Pacific war. A memorial at the cemetery commemorates another 280 New Zealanders who died in the Pacific campaign but have no known grave. It is an ongoing reminder of the price paid for our region's security."

Dr Mapp returns to New Zealand on Saturday.
