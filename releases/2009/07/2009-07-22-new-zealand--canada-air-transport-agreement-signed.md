A new Air Transport Agreement has been signed between New Zealand and Canada, Transport Minister Steven Joyce and Trade Minister Tim Groser announced today. 

"New Zealand and Canada have a long-standing partnership. The Agreement, signed overnight in Singapore, creates new opportunities for the further development of business, tourism and people-to-people links between New Zealand and Canada," Mr Groser said.

"The Agreement removes previous limitations on the frequency of flights that can be provided. Additionally, New Zealand and Canadian carriers can now operate to and beyond each others' country over any routing." 

"Air New Zealand commenced non-stop services from Auckland to Vancouver in November 2007 and currently operates three flights per week on the route, as a well as having in place an extensive code-share arrangement with its Star Alliance partner Air Canada," Mr Joyce said.

Almost 49,000 Canadians visited New Zealand in the year ending April 2009, a 20 percent increase in the last five years.

Just over 20,000 New Zealanders travelled to Canada as their primary destination last year, which is a 63 percent increase when compared to five years ago.

The Air Transport Agreement was signed in Singapore by Tim Groser and his Canadian counterpart Stockwell Day. Mr Groser is in Singapore attending the APEC Trade Ministers Meeting.
