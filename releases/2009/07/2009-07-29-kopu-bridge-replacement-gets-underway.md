The start of work on the replacement of Kopu Bridge is another example of the National-led Government moving fast on developing all-important infrastructure, says Prime Minister John Key.

“The Government recognises the importance of developing our infrastructure to help boost the economy and create jobs,” says Mr Key.

Mr Key today attended a sod-turning ceremony at the bridge near Thames to mark the start of work to replace the ageing structure which dates from 1928.

The project will cost $47 million and take three years to complete.  When construction is in full swing, up to 50 people will be working full-time on the site, with another 100 people involved in supplying materials and providing supporting services.

“The start of work on the new Kopu Bridge will come as a huge relief to those who rely on it, particularly during peak holiday times when queues up to 10kms long have frustrated motorists.

“The start of construction was brought forward from early 2011 as a result of the Government’s $500 million Jobs and Growth Plan announced earlier this year.

“National was elected on a platform of unclogging the country’s economic arteries.  The Government believes that more investment in infrastructure will boost productivity, unlock economic potential, lift non-inflationary growth, and generate employment.”
