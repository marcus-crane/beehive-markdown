Forest and Bird's claim that the Government plans "wide-scale privatisation" of the South Island high country is complete rubbish, says Associate Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson.

"The tenure review process is about providing certainty so we can get better economic and conservation outcomes.

"This Government is taking a collaborative rather than antagonistic approach to negotiations with leaseholders and we make no apology for that.

"The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment recommended we look at using a number of different tools, including covenants, to find a better way forward for tenure review.

"The Government has a South Island High Country strategy and we are proud that a more constructive relationship is developing between farmers and DoC."
