‘What New Zealand citizenship means to me' is the topic of a national student essay competition launched today by Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy to help celebrate the 60th anniversary of New Zealand citizenship.

Mr Guy said the 60th anniversary provided an ideal opportunity to encourage young people to learn more about their New Zealand citizenship.  The best essay writer will win $1000 plus another $1000 for their college.

"New Zealand citizenship is keenly sought after, and migrants who decide to become New Zealand citizens value it highly. Although these people know about the importance of New Zealand citizenship, many people born in New Zealand do not," said Mr Guy.

"New Zealand citizenship didn't exist until 1949, but since then, most children born here are automatically New Zealand citizens. However, today's young New Zealanders have grown up knowing very little about what it means to be a New Zealand citizen.

"Earlier this year a new fun and interactive citizenship education website for primary school students and teachers was launched.  Last week the website was extended so it can be used in secondary schools also. 

"This essay competition gives senior students, and their teachers, another opportunity to focus on this important topic.  I urge all pupils to get involved and have a go at writing about what citizenship means to them," Mr Guy said.

The essay competition is open to Years 11, 12 and 13 students and entries close on 25 September this year.

The citizenship education website is at [http://education.citizenship.govt.nz](http://education.citizenship.govt.nz)

Entry forms for the essay competition are on the Department of Internal Affairs website www.dia.govt.nz (follow the links to ‘Citizenship applications' and ‘Celebrating 60 Years'.)
