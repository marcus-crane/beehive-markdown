Trade Minister and Associate Minister for Climate Change Issues, Tim Groser, departs today to attend the annual APEC Trade Ministers' Meeting in Singapore.

"This is one of the biggest Asia Pacific trade meetings this year. I want to take the opportunity to remind ministers that we need a deal in the WTO Doha Round to help lift the region out of the economic crisis," Mr Groser said.

"APEC's 21 member economies can do a lot to galvanise global action that will set us on the road to recovery.

"The meeting will also examine what trade and investment measures member economies have implemented since the onset of the crisis and the impact these have had on trade flows and business across the region.

"I will be urging Ministers to refrain from raising any new barriers to cross-border investment and trade," Mr Groser said.

While in Singapore, Mr Groser will also attend the OECD Roundtable on Sustainable Development, chaired by former New Zealand Environment Minister Simon Upton. 

The meeting will bring together a range of trade ministers, international experts and private sector representatives to discuss climate change policies and their impacts on trade and business competitiveness.
