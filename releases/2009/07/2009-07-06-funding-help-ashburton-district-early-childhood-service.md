Education Minister Anne Tolley today announced that Dorie Community Preschool has been awarded $30,000 to recruit and employ qualified staff and buy equipment for its new service in Chertsey in the Ashburton District.

The grants, from the Ministry of Education’s Establishment Funding initiative, help community based centres purchase equipment and resources, and assist them in becoming licensed.

“This funding directly assists centres to open or increase the number of places they offer their communities,” said Mrs Tolley.

“The government is committed to ensuring all children get the best start in education. By providing these grants we are directly increasing the number of places available for families to access early childhood education.”

Establishment Funding of $1.2 million is available every year to new services or those that are increasing the number of places they offer by five or more. Funds are allocated four times during the year and services can receive up to $30,000 each.

Applications for the next available round of Establishment Funding close on 31 July 2009.  Further information and application forms are available at [http://www.lead.ece.govt.nz/EstablishingAnECE/EstablishmentFunding/default.htm](http://www.lead.ece.govt.nz/EstablishingAnECE/EstablishmentFunding/default.htm)
