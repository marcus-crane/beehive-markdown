Nelson botanist Dr. Philip Simpson has been awarded one of New Zealand's highest conservation honours for his ongoing work with native plants, Conservation Minister Tim Groser announced today.

Dr. Simpson has been honoured with the Loder Cup for 2009 for his outstanding contribution to plant conservation. 

A founding member of the Project Crimson Trust, established to protect pohutukawa, Dr. Simpson is also an award-winning author and is acknowledged for his work in setting up community based planting schemes. 

"Dr. Simpson has supported work with schools, landowners and community groups around New Zealand to protect and restore native plant life.

"This award acknowledges both his professional and personal dedication to conservation and is thoroughly deserved," Mr Groser said.

Dr Simpson is a recent recipient of Creative New Zealand's Michael King Writers' Fellowship, and was granted $100,000 towards his up coming book about New Zealand's native totara tree.

The Loder Cup will be presented to Dr. Simpson at a special ceremony later this year. 

The cup was donated by English botanist, Gerald Loder in 1926 and is awarded by the Minister of Conservation each year for outstanding achievements in flora conservation.
