A new initiative that will see more Māori gain skills and qualifications across a wide range of industries cannot come soon enough, according to the Minister of Māori Affairs Hon Dr. Pita Sharples.

Speaking at the launch of ‘Māori in Industry and Trades Training’ in Mt Wellington this morning, Dr Sharples said the signing of an agreement with InfraTrain (the Industry Training Organisation for the civil infrastructure industry) was a step towards an additional 1,820 Māori receiving training – most at level 4 and above on the National Qualifications Framework – in industries with strong employment prospects.

“It will also increase the number of Māori moving to higher level qualifications and into more senior roles within their organisations,” said Dr Sharples.  “Most importantly the Māori workforce will become more resilient and better prepared for opportunities that lie ahead.”

“This initiative will provide 250 training places at entry level through to diplomas in the civil infrastructure industry – 50 in Waikato; 100 in the Northland/Auckland area; and 100 in the East Coast/Hawkes Bay area, and will support these employees into higher level training, including five at diploma level,” he said.

“InfraTrain guarantees that at least 20 percent of these will be new employees, with the remainder moving into higher level qualifications within the industry.

“Maori make up more than one third of the current civil infrastructure workforce in the North Island, where the government has signalled significant investment creating a demand for skilled workers and InfraTrain is committed to strengthening its Māori workforce,” said Dr Sharples.

“Māori have long struggled to be better educated, to climb the qualifications ladder and to see Māori business and the Māori asset base flourish, and the Māori Economic Summit and the Prime Minister’s Employment Summit reflected this.

“The summit outcomes had a clear focus on industry and trades training as a driver of job protection, job creation and higher level skills and qualifications, and this has become a priority workstream for Te Puni Kōkiri.”

“Te Puni Kokiri has identified the characteristics of training programmes that Maori succeed in, and has paid to have those elements included in this training package. They include mentoring for success, extra pastoral care, a Maori focus in the programme, and career planning with an emphasis on higher level qualifications that lead to real jobs.

“Industry providers have endorsed Te Puni Kokiri’s approach, and have contractually bound themselves to deliver agreed outcomes for Maori. The result is that Maori get much more benefit from training which is largely funded by the Tertiary Education Commission.

Dr Sharples said today’s initiative was one key step in a broader project, with policy and implementation plans being developed for cadetships and professional opportunities for Māori, and Te Wananga o Aotearoa and other providers working on training packages with the Maori Economic Task Force.

The Minister of Māori Affairs was joined by the Prime Minister, Rt. Hon John Key who formally officiated at the launch.
