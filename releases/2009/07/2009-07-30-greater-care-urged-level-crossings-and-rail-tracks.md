New Zealanders need to take much greater care at level crossings and on rail tracks, says the Associate Minister of Transport Nathan Guy.

This morning, Mr Guy teamed up with rail safety campaigner Chris Cairns at the Silverstream level crossing in Upper Hutt to take this message out to commuters during Rail Safety Awareness Week.

"There have already been 16 crashes at level crossings this year. This is 16 too many. Motorists must use caution and common sense when approaching a level crossing," said Mr Guy.

Over the past 10 years there have been 56 deaths at level crossings. There have also been 121 pedestrians, cyclists and trespassers killed on train tracks over this period.

"Pedestrians also need to take on the rail safety message. Tracks are for trains and there is no reason for people to put their lives at risk by walking along the tracks," said Mr Guy.

"Ontrack is working to improve rail safety particularly upgrading level crossings. It has a priority list based on data it has collected in conjunction with roading authorities."

Rail Safety Awareness Week runs until Friday 31 July. It aims to improve safety at rail crossings and reduce trespassing on rail tracks. It is organised and funded by the NZ Transport Agency, KiwiRail, Ontrack, Veolia, ARTA, Tranz Metro and the Chris Cairns Foundation.

A series of advertisements about the need for caution at level crossings will run throughout the week.  "I hope New Zealanders take on the message from these advertisements. A little patience and commonsense can be the difference between life and death," said Mr Guy.

Various activities are being held throughout New Zealand to mark Rail Safety Awareness Week including a function in Wellington this evening which will be addressed by Mr Guy and Chris Cairns.
