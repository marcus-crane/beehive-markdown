This report was commissioned to advise ministers on how effectively co-management arrangements negotiated in 2008 meet the objectives of the Waikato-Tainui Waikato River Deed of Settlement and intended agreements with other Waikato River iwi and, if changes are required, what they might be. This report provides a starting point for ministers to engage with iwi and stakeholders.

The independent panel was appointed to review co-management arrangements for the Waikato River contained in a Deed of Settlement with Waikato-Tainui, signed on 22 August 2008, and in proposed agreements with the Raukawa Trust Board, Te Pūmautanga o Te Arawa, the Tūwharetoa Māori Trust Board and the Maniapoto Māori Trust Board.

The co-management arrangements are focused on restoring and protecting the health and wellbeing of the Waikato River (including its principal tributary the Waipā River) and, through co-management, securing effective Treaty-based relationships with the 'iwi of the Waikato River' now and in the future that also atone for past Treaty breaches.
