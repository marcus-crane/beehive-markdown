Energy and Resources Minister, Gerry Brownlee has released the latest edition of The New Zealand Energy Data File. The publication is an annual record of energy use in New Zealand.

"This document is what you might describe as the energy bible of the country. It has been revamped to offer a comprehensive record and database of all our energy trends for each calendar year", said Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee.

"It is a very useful resource for anyone interested in the facts and figures of our energy resources ranging from electricity price trends through to the state of play in our oil and gas resources," he said.

"The report for the 2008 calendar years shows some pleasing trends. In that year around 65% of electricity generation came from renewable sources," said Mr Brownlee"

"And as reported recently in the New Zealand Energy Quarterly for the first quarter of this year, that trend improved with electricity supplied from renewable sources rising to 74%," he said.

Another positive change can be seen via the increase in geothermal electricity generation capacity by 30% to nearly 580MW in 2008.

In addition, total electricity generation dropped slightly from 2007 to 2008, mainly as a result of decreased demand from consumers and the Tiwai Point aluminium smelter.

Other key findings of the report include:

- Total oil production in New Zealand increased by 45% to a record 21 million barrels in 2008, as a result of the Tui oil field coming online and continued strong production from the Pohokura field.
- Oil and gas exploration activity in 2008 remained high by New Zealand standards.
- Oil continued to dominate energy supply and demand, although the growth in the consumption of oil products continued to slow in 2008, a trend that has been apparent since 2005.
- In 2008, New Zealand's first underground gas storage facility was developed at the depleted Ahuroa gas field in the Taranaki region.
- The total annual amount of energy used by final consumers was slightly below that in 2007.
- Coal consumption rose 25% to 3.9 million tonnes in 2008, as a result of increased electricity generation from coal due to low hydro inflow.

Two main features of the new and improved edition of the report include enhanced usability of the publication, and better explanation of energy flows, qualities which differ from previous editions.

The New Zealand Energy Data File is a primary source of detailed information for government, industry, research institutions, media, and interested members of the public. It also lays the foundation for much of the work on energy policy and projections by the Ministry of Economic Development.
