Public submissions on the Holidays Act 2003 will be welcomed from tomorrow, 21 July, Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson has announced.

“The Holidays Act affects all business owners and employees. It is a significant piece of legislation but it has been criticised for its complexity, especially in the calculation of relevant daily pay.”

An advisory group, chaired by specialist employment lawyer Peter Kiely, was appointed last month to conduct the review.

“The group is keen to hear what Kiwis think about the Holidays Act and what their suggestions are for improving it.”

The advisory group has prepared a number of questions it would like people to address in their submissions.

These questions can be found on the Department of Labour website at [http://dol.govt.nz/consultation/holidays-act-review/](http://dol.govt.nz/consultation/holidays-act-review/).

Submissions close at 5pm on Friday 21 August. They should be e-mailed to

[ERconsultation@dol.govt.nz](mailto:ERconsultation@dol.govt.nz) or mailed to:
