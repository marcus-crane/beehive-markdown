Minister for Arts Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson announced today the reappointment of the chair and the appointment of four new members to the board of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.

Chair John Judge has been reappointed for a further one year period. Mr Judge is the former managing partner of Ernst & Young, and was appointed chair of the Accident Compensation Corporation earlier this year. He has been a member of the Te Papa board since 2000, and chair since 2006.

The new appointments are businessman Wira Gardiner, manager Miria Pomare, former Minister of the Crown and historian Michael Bassett, and businessman Christopher Parkin.

"I am very pleased to announce the new appointments to the board of Te Papa," Mr Finlayson said. "The new members bring with them a wide variety of experience and skills that will be invaluable for our heritage sector." 

Businessman Wira Gardiner was the founding director of the Waitangi Tribunal, and has held many public and private sector directorships and trust roles. He has been strategic director for Te Matatini, and worked as Crown facilitator on a number of Treaty of Waitangi settlement negotiations.

Miria Pomare holds a number of iwi governance posts and is a guest lecturer at Whitireia Community Polytechnic on Treaty of Waitangi issues. She works as a manager for Te Runanga o Toa Rangatira.

Michael Bassett was Arts Minister in the fourth Labour government. He is a noted historian, columnist, and a former member of the Waitangi Tribunal. He has written a number of books on various subjects, including political biographies.

Christopher Parkin has held a range of roles in the business, property, and investment sectors. He is a longstanding supporter of the arts in Wellington, and is the owner of the Museum Hotel.

The new board members have been appointed for three year terms, beginning 1 July, except Mr Parkin who will begin his term on 1 September.
