The Government is to invest an extra $1.5 million into Children's Health Camps each year.

Social Development and Employment Minister Paula Bennett has announced the funding boost after considering the findings of an independent financial review into the Children's Health Camps.

"I'm very pleased we've been able to reach agreement, which will see all seven health camps continue to operate," Ms Bennett says.

"The previous Government had washed their hands of this issue and refused to look at ways to move forward. That simply wasn't acceptable to us.

"By focussing on what really matters - the wellbeing of Kiwi kids - we've been able to forge a strong working relationship," Ms Bennett says.

The extra funding, which is consistent with the review's recommendations, will roll out over the 2009/10 financial year.

The Government has agreed to increase the contract it has with the Children's Health Camps by $1.5 million per year.

The Ministry of Social Development has been working with the Te Puna Whaiora board since last year to better understand the financial situation and identify solutions to the Trust's funding crisis.

\`\`This result is a win-win for all involved. I understand how important the health camps service is to so many families around the country.

"We see a lot of potential for Children's Health Camps to develop their relationship with the Government further, in line with our priorities. We look forward to working with Te Puna Whaiora in future," Ms Bennett says.
