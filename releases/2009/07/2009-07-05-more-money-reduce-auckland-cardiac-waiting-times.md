The Government has provided up to five million dollars extra to enable Auckland District Health Board to speed up dealing with an unacceptable number of people on its cardiac surgery waiting list.

"Auckland has had problems for some time with patients waiting longer than is clinically appropriate, and rather than sit back and let a situation develop similar to the one at Wellington Hospital last year, the Government has taken action" says Mr Ryall.

"The Ministry of Health and Auckland DHB carried out an audit of Auckland DHB's cardiac waiting list in May. As a result 141 patients were identified as waiting longer than was clinically appropriate" says the Health Minister.

"Auckland DHB undertook to sort out the problem. Through a sustained focus using its own theatres and staff, and use of the private sector, the total number of patients waiting longer than they should has reduced to 99.

"The Government has allocated the extra funding to provide operations for these patients as quickly as possible."

"I am advised that the 99 patients awaiting heart operations have been notified that their surgery will be carried out by the end of October" the Health Minister says..

"The Ministry of Health is working with the DHB to improve management of its cardiac patients" says Mr Ryall.
