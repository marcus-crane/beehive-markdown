The Minister for Building and Construction, Maurice Williamson, has welcomed the release of the Building and Construction Sector Taskforce reports at the Building and Construction Sector Forum in Auckland today.

The  Productivity and the Urban Taskforces were established at the first Building and Construction Sector Forum held in Auckland 2008.  More than 80 industry and government leaders joined Mr Williamson and Associate Minister for Infrastructure, Stephen Joyce, at the Forum to discuss the reports, and the sector's future direction.

The Productivity Taskforce, chaired by the Director of Property Services at the University of Auckland, Peter Fehl, highlighted the need to improve building and construction sector productivity by developing a sector-wide skills strategy and improving the procurement of construction projects.

The recommendations include:

- Greater disclosure of the Government’s forward capital investment programme through the National Infrastructure Plan to help the sector plan better.
- Actions to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Government’s own building and construction procurement practice, by using approaches already used by the NZ Transport Authority more widely across the Government.
- Developing a sector skills strategy to ensure the sector has the skills required in the future.  As part of the strategy, improving entry level training and continuous professional development in the industry, and the sector offering stronger career opportunities.

The Urban Taskforce, chaired by the President of the NZ Institute of Architects and the Chair of Jasmax, Richard Harris, identified ways to improve urban development by removing barriers, and reducing the cost, of quality urban development projects.

Its recommendations include:

- Getting higher quality complex urban developments developed more quickly and efficiently through the use of new forms of partnership models across central and local Government, working with the private sector.
- Trialling these new partnership arrangements in 2-3 “ready-to-go” locations to establish their application in NZ.
- Reducing the up-front costs of development, for example by looking at alternative to development levies on new developments.
- Developing faster regulatory and consenting processes to reduce the barriers and roadblocks that urban developments face.
- Clearer leadership of urban development issues across central and local Government, and the private sector to move the Taskforce’s recommendations along.

Mr Williamson says he believes in the value of working with the private sector to find solutions that will drive New Zealand forward. 

“Improving skills and productivity is crucial for improving the performance of the sector and the New Zealand economy.  It’s also important to ensure that urban developers can efficiently deliver the high quality homes and communities that New Zealanders want.  The government is open to fresh ideas that improve the efficiency of the economy and help businesses to do business better.”

“These Taskforces are an important part of that process and I congratulate the sector for its initiative.”

“In these challenging times it is important that we work together with some urgency to find solutions that position us to take advantage of the upturn when it arrives, and help us manage this and future downturns with greater ease.  That means stimulating investment, retaining skills and raising productivity.”

"Reform is underway to improve the performance of the sector, and to reduce compliance costs for business.  The first steps are in the shape of the Building Amendment Bill (2) and the Resource Management Amendment Bill both of which are currently before Parliament.  Announcements on a review of the Building Act and on licensing will be made shortly. "

The Minister says the recommendations from both Taskforces will be considered by Cabinet, and the Government's response will then be announced.
