Minister for Arts Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson announced today the appointment of a new member, and the re-appointment and elevation to chair of a sitting member, of the National War Memorial Advisory Council.

The Council advises the Minister on all matters relevant to the control and maintenance of the National War Memorial.

Rear Admiral (Rtd) David Ledson will chair the board from 1 August 2009. He has also been re-appointed to the Council for a further three years. Rear Admiral Ledson was the Chief of Navy, its highest ranking officer, until retiring on 1 May 2009. He joined the Navy as a cadet in 1967. He has held various public positions ex-officio in the past.

Fiona Cassidy is director of a communications and marketing consultancy. She was an Army officer for 14 years, holding a number of appointments overseas including the Pacific, the Middle East and the United States, and the president of the Public Relations Institute of New Zealand.

Her three-year term runs from 1 July.

"I am very pleased to announce the appointment of Fiona Cassidy and the appointment of Rear Admiral (Rtd) David Ledson as chair," Mr Finlayson said. "They bring a range of experiences from both within and without the armed forces."
