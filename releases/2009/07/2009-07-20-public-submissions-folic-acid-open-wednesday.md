A discussion document proposing that the mandatory fortification of folic acid in bread be deferred until May 2012 will be released on Wednesday, says Minister for Food Safety Kate Wilkinson.

“I am confident that this option addresses the concerns the public have, while also ensuring our relationship with Australia under the joint food regulatory system remains intact.

“There is a consultation process we will go through and a final decision will be made once all submissions have been considered.

“The proposal aims to give us more time to evaluate the risks and benefits of the standard and to take into account the wishes of New Zealanders.”

The Ministerial Council will meet in May 2012 and discuss the review of the mandatory folic acid standard in Australia.

New Zealand could then re-assess whether or not to go ahead with the standard at that point.

A copy of the discussion document will be available from Wednesday at [www.nzfsa.govt.nz](http://www.nzfsa.govt.nz/).

Submissions close on August 12.
