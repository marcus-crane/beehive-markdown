Scientists have rated New Zealand one of the two healthiest fisheries on the planet, Fisheries Minister Phil Heatley announced today.

Mr Heatley applauded the top “Green” rating received by New Zealand in the comprehensive international scientific research paper *Rebuilding Global Fisheries*, which evaluated 31 marine areas, mainly in the US, Canada, Australia, Europe and New Zealand.  The paper has just been published in the respected journal *Science*.

“We can justifiably be proud that along with Alaska we are regarded internationally as leading the world in terms of management success by our efforts to put management interventions in place before drastic measures are needed to conserve, restore and rebuild our marine resources,” Mr Heatley said.

“All stakeholders in fisheries management – the Ministry of Fisheries, commercial and recreational fishers, and iwi – can take the credit for this prestigious outcome.”

While the results of the research are encouraging, there is much work to be done to ensure that the value New Zealanders receive through sustainable use of fisheries is maximised, while also protecting the aquatic environment, Mr Heatley said.

“We cannot afford to be rest on our laurels.  We must move forward with our world-class fisheries management practices.  Initiatives like the long-term Fisheries 2030 programme will ensure this happens as all fisheries stakeholders work towards the same goals for this precious resource.”

The hoki fishery is a good example of rigorous management delivering sustainable stocks for the future, Mr Heatley said. 

Hoki delivered $151 million in export earnings in 2008 and is New Zealand’s third most valuable seafood export after mussels and crayfish.

The Minister paid special tribute to the role of Ministry of Fisheries’ chief scientist Pamela Mace as one of the authors of the research paper. 

“It is acknowledgement of Dr Mace’s international standing that she was invited to participate in this important two-year project,” he said.

**Q&A**

**What is the status of this research?**

This is the most comprehensive international research of its type ever undertaken. It was a two-year project contributed to by 21 reputable scientists world wide, including Dr Pamela Mace, Chief Scientist of the Ministry of Fisheries.

**What does a “Green” rating mean?**

A traffic light rating system was used by the researchers, based on “biomass” (the amount of living matter in a given habitat) and “exploitation rate” (the proportion of fish taken out of the sea) of selected fish stocks.  Alaska and New Zealand were the only countries rated “Green,” the highest rating awarded.

**What is Fisheries 2030?**

Fisheries 2030 is the strategic direction and goal for the New Zealand fisheries sector. It is currently being developed by the Ministry of Fisheries with input from all fisheries stakeholders.
