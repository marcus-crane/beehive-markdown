Nominations are now open for the 2009 William Wallace Awards, which honour outstanding young people in foster care.

Run by Child Youth and Family, the Awards are a result of a bequest made by William Wallace and into their fourth year.

"I'm always thrilled to see young people succeed. However, many of these children and young adults living in foster care have had to overcome a few more obstacles than their peers to get there. I'm sure all Kiwis will join me in celebrating their success," the Minister for Social Development and Employment Paula Bennett says.

Anyone who knows a great young person who is, or has been, in foster care can make a nomination. Forms can be downloaded at www.cyf.govt.nz or Child Youth and Family can be contacted on 0508 FAMILY.

A total of $20,000 is divided into the follow scholarships: $3000 awards for tertiary study, $3000 awards for vocational study and $2000 awards for leadership programmes.

"The Awards helped last year's winners go on to study at university, pursue trades and attend Outward Bound. These scholarships celebrate their success, as well as help them advance further toward their next achievements," Ms Bennett says.

An additional scholarship is also available this year to a young woman living in the lower North Island. The GFS Scholarship, sponsored by the Girls' Friendly Society, will provide up to $4000 to cover course costs for every year of study that is successfully completed.

Nominations close on Friday 14 August 2009, and an award ceremony will be held in November during Foster Care Awareness Week.
