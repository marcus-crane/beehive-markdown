The Government today began a process of public consultation on New Zealand’s 2020 emissions target with a public meeting in Wellington tonight.

“Climate change is a very difficult issue in that the science is complex, it involves every country, the effects are multi-generational and reducing emissions has major economic implications.

“We need to be honest and upfront with New Zealanders about the scale of the change required and the impacts on jobs, industries and the cost of living if we are to commit to an ambitious target. We need to carefully balance this with the importance of New Zealand doing its fair share on global climate change and protecting New Zealand’s brand as a clean, green nation,” said Dr Nick Smith.

“This public consultation is an opportunity for people to connect with the process of international negotiations culminating in the December Conference in Copenhagen. It is our intention to table at the precursor meeting in Bonn our policy target for 2020 following these consultations,” said Tim Groser.

Over the next two weeks the Government will be consulting the people on New Zealand’s proposed greenhouse gas emissions target for 2020 through nine public meetings, three business meetings, a national hui and an engagement with academics.

A discussion document has been produced which outlines the challenge of climate change and New Zealand’s contribution, along with the international situation and the consultation schedule.
