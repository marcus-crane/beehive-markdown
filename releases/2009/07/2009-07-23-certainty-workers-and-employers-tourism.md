A new industry agreement will give certainty to migrant workers and their employers in the tourism industry concerning their ability to obtain temporary work permits, says Immigration Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman.

Immigration New Zealand aims to advise the applicant whether their temporary work permit application will be approved or declined at least 30 days before their current permit expires. This gives them and their employer as much certainty as possible in advance of the permit expiring.

Employers are encouraged to talk to Work and Income about their staffing needs 90 days before their employee's temporary work permit expires.

"Currently, workers and employers are faced with uncertainty about when to begin talking to Immigration New Zealand about further permits. This makes it difficult for workers to manage their affairs and for employers to manage their staffing needs," says Dr Coleman.

The scheme is being trialled in the tourism and hospitality sector.

In some parts of the country New Zealand's multi-billion dollar tourism industry relies heavily on overseas workers - particularly during peak season.

Many of the available jobs are in areas with low unemployment or where there are no New Zealanders with suitable skills, even as unemployment is increasing.

"It's not a change in policy, and it's important to realise that with rising unemployment when suitable New Zealanders are available new work permits won't be issued.

"However, in situations where New Zealanders aren't available, employers will be able to access the staff they need. It's about employers communicating their needs and government departments responding in a timely manner," says Dr Coleman.
