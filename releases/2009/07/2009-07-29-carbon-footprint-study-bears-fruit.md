Agriculture Minister David Carter is welcoming work done by the pipfruit industry into measuring its carbon footprint.

The pipfruit industry today released its findings into the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions involved in the growing, packing, transporting, selling, consuming and disposal of exported apples.

Speaking at the Pipfruit New Zealand conference in Napier, the Minister encouraged the industry to use its research on carbon footprinting to "make that all-important difference in the marketplace."

"This work makes great business sense. It is a significant contribution to New Zealand's leading reputation in GHG research," says Mr Carter.

"It enables the industry to identify both a point against which to measure future reductions, and key targets to reduce GHG emissions and costs along the apple supply chain.

"The way New Zealand product is positioned in the world market is changing as overseas consumers become more discerning. It makes research like this all the more important in understanding carbon footprinting.

"By identifying where efficiencies can be achieved, the pipfruit industry can continue to enhance the premium product that is the New Zealand apple."

Mr Carter says the Government is also fully supportive of the industry's plan to share its research findings internationally.

"The approach developed through this study can help demonstrate how New Zealand producers are world leaders in this field."
