The Crown and the NgāiTakoto-a-iwi Research Unit Trust have signed a Terms of Negotiation document signalling the agreement of both parties to enter good faith negotiations to settle historical Treaty claims, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson announced today.

NgāiTakoto is a Far North/Te Hiku iwi whose rohe is based around Kaitaia and the Aupouri Peninsula. It is one of five iwi participating in Te Hiku Forum - a body established to enable Te Hiku iwi to work through their shared interests.

"The existence of Te Hiku Forum, with representatives from NgāiTakoto, Ngāti Kuri, Te Aupouri, Ngāti Kahu and Te Rarawa, presents an opportunity to substantially accelerate Treaty settlements in Te Hiku," Mr Finlayson said. "I am determined that NgāiTakoto will not have to go through the years of negotiations that some Te Hiku iwi have faced."

The Terms of Negotiation document sets out the guidelines for negotiations between the Crown and NgāiTakoto. The parties will now work together with other Te Hiku iwi to reach agreement on a redress package.

""Today's signing shows the government's continued commitment to reaching just and durable settlements of historical claims by 2014, for the good of iwi and all New Zealanders," Mr Finlayson said.
