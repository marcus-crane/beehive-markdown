The Crown and Ngā Punawai o te Tokotoru collective have signed amended Joint Terms of Negotiation with the Crown to include Ngāti Rangiteaorere, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson announced today.

The signing ceremony took place at Mataikotare Marae in Te Ngae, Rotorua.

The amended Joint Terms of Negotiation set out the scope and nature of Te Tokotoru's upcoming negotiations for the comprehensive and final settlement of its historical Treaty of Waitangi claims.

The member iwi of Te Tokotoru are the remaining groups within the Te Arawa Confederation to enter into settlement negotiations with the Crown. Ngati Rangiteaorere joined Tapuika and Ngati Rangiwewehi to form Te Tokotoru in early 2009.

The Tapuika Iwi Authority and Te Maru o Ngati Rangiwewehi Iwi Authority signed joint Terms of Negotiation with the Crown on 14 August 2008 and their Deeds of Mandate were recognised by the Crown on 30 October 2008. The Ngāti Rangiteaorere Claims Committee obtained Crown recognition for its Deed of Mandate last week.

Tapuika's area of interest includes the coastal Bay of Plenty north of Rotorua. Ngāti Rangiwewehi's area of interest lies mainly to the west of Lake Rotorua. Ngāti Rangiteaorere's area of interest lies mainly to the east of Lake Rotorua, with additional areas to the west of Lake Rotorua and a coastal section between Maketu and Papamoa Beach.

"These Terms of Negotiation are a strong signal of the Government's commitment to maintaining momentum in the settlement process," Mr Finlayson said. "With negotiations throughout the central North Island either completed or well underway, this agreement takes us one step closer to the government's goal of settling all claims by 2014." 

The Crown and Te Tokotoru will now work towards Agreements in Principle setting out broad outlines of agreed settlement packages for each.
