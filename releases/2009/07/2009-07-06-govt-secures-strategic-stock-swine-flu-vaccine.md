The Government has agreed in principle to offer frontline health staff and emergency personnel vaccination against Swine Flu, the new pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus.

The Ministry of Health has ordered an initial supply of 300,000 doses of a vaccine from Baxter Healthcare, under one of its two existing agreements for pandemic influenza vaccine. This is sufficient for 150,000 workers.

Health Minister Tony Ryall said having the vaccine is primarily an insurance policy. "We want to be in the position of having the vaccine and not needing it, rather than the other way around."

"Global demand for vaccines is high, so we have secured sufficient vaccine for this priority group of New Zealanders. In addition to this purchase we have a long-standing option to access more vaccine if required under existing supply agreements with Australian vaccine maker CSL."

The vaccine is due for delivery within the month but it will not be used for an immunisation programme unless it is licensed by Medsafe.

"Before it can be used, the vaccine has to be assessed by Medsafe in New Zealand. Medsafe will review data from clinical trials to determine the vaccine's quality, safety and effectiveness. A licensing decision is expected by the end of this year. The pandemic could last up to 18 months to two years so this purchase is strategic."

Mr Ryall said that currently the new pandemic influenza virus was resulting in a mild illness for most people.  

"Vaccination is an important tool, but not the only tool in the country's armoury against this new virus."

"To re-emphasise, tried and proven hygiene measures are our first line of defence: frequent and thorough hand washing and drying; covering coughs and sneezes and staying away from other people if you're sick are simple steps everyone can take to protect themselves and the wider community."
