Prime Minister John Key said today he was pleased to announce a resolution of the dispute between members of the family of the late Sir Ed Hillary and the Auckland War Memorial Museum.

"I asked the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet in mid-May to assist in mediation over the issue that had arisen between the museum and the Hillary family.

"The dispute arose over interpretation of a clause in Sir Ed's will, in which he gifted his papers and other material to the museum subject to certain rights for his children, Peter and Sarah, to have access and publishing rights.

"All outstanding matters have now been resolved and an agreement was signed in Auckland yesterday afternoon. The parties have decided that as well as making a joint statement, they will make public the full text of the agreement (attached).

"I am advised that yesterday's meeting between the parties was constructive and positive, which I welcome. I anticipate that there will be a good relationship between the parties in future.

"It was important that a solution was able to be arrived at based on trust and goodwill. It respects the wishes of Sir Ed, and his enormous reputation.

"I thank all parties involved for arriving at a successful conclusion."
