Prime Minister John Key today expressed his sorrow at the death of former National Party MP and Cabinet Minister Bill Young.

Mr Young died yesterday, aged 95.

He was Member of Parliament for Miramar from 1966 to 1981, and served in the National Government Cabinet as Minister of Works and Development.

He held the post of High Commissioner in the United Kingdom from 1982 to 1985.

Mr Young was born in Kawakawa, Northland, in November 1913, and served with the 2nd (New Zealand) Division during World War 2.

He married wife Joan in 1946 and they had five children.

“Although I did not know Mr Young very well, he was a stalwart of the National Party and was a prominent parliamentarian in his time,” says Mr Key.  “I want to convey my sympathies to the family and friends of Mr Young.”
