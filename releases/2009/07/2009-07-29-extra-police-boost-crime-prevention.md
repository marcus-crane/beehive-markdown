The 600 extra officers pledged by the Government will enable police to work on new crime prevention strategies without compromising frontline services, Police Minister Judith Collins says.

Speaking to the Metro Sector - Local Government New Zealand AGM today, Ms Collins said it was vital that police worked more closely with local authorities and community organisations to tackle crime at a grassroots level.

"We must create an environment within our communities where crime is starved of oxygen - where it is not accepted as a fact of life," Ms Collins said.

"It's vital that police work more closely with local government and community organisations to set priorities on crime prevention and build a platform for combined action.

"However, this is not always easy as the first priority of police will always be to respond to crime and solve crime.

"With a renewed commitment in staff and resources from the Government, an opportunity exists for police to tackle crime at its roots, and develop new models of community policing without compromising frontline services."

The Government has provided funding of almost $200 million for an extra 600 officers by the end of 2011, 300 of which will be deployed in Counties-Manukau.

Ms Collins told mayors, council officers and councillors there were many examples of police working with local authorities on initiatives to roll back crime and make communities better, safer places to live.

"Your ideas, energy and participation have already made an enormous difference in many neighbourhoods throughout New Zealand," Ms Collins said.
