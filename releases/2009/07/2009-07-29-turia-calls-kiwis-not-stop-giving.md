Tariana Turia is encouraging New Zealanders to keep being generous despite the shadow cast over a recent donation clash involving the Epilepsy Foundation.

"It is important that charities maintain the trust of their donors by using public donations as effectively and efficiently as possible, especially during these tough economic times," Mrs Turia said.

"The inefficient fundraising practices of one organisation should not discourage New Zealanders from giving to community organisations - we must continue to invest in our communities through gifts of money, time and in-kind donations."

Mrs Turia encouraged donors to give directly to a charity, rather than through a third party, and to learn more about the organisations they intend to invest in through utilising the Philanthropy New Zealand's giving guide at [http://giving.org.nz/options](http://giving.org.nz/options) and the Charities Commission's register at [www.charities.govt.nz](http://www.charities.govt.nz/)  

"Now that Annual Returns are starting to be filed with the commission, its register is a great tool available for the public to learn more about how a charity is using its funds."

The commission is currently looking into issues raised by the Epilepsy Foundation situation.

There is currently a bill before Parliament which will enable people to automatically give pre-tax donations directly to a charity of their choice from their pay, reducing administration costs.
