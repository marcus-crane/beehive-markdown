Prime Minister John Key has underlined New Zealand’s commitment to Tonga’s political reform process and economic progress in talks with Tonga’s Prime Minister Dr Feleti Sevele in Nuku’alofa today.

Mr Key is in Tonga on the first leg of a four-country Pacific visit.

”2010 is an important year in Tongan politics. New Zealand, together with Australia, strongly supports the process of political and constitutional reform to which the Government of Tonga has committed.

“King George Tupou V and Prime Minister Sevele have been vital supporters of the reform process, and I commend the leadership they have shown in this area.”

New Zealand’s support for the reform process, including through funding a civic education programme, is reflected in an increase in New Zealand’s official development assistance to Tonga from $12 million to $16 million this year.

“As agreed with the Government of Tonga, tourism and police are key areas of focus for New Zealand’s assistance.

“Through the assistance delivered by NZAID and New Zealand Police, we will continue to strengthen the Tonga Police Force.

“We have already committed $5 million to this programme and I am pleased to announce that New Zealand will contribute a further $2.5 million to this work.

“We are also in the process of delivering a long term programme of assistance to the tourism sector in Tonga through encouraging private sector development.”

New Zealand’s bilateral aid programme with Tonga will increase to $16 million in 2009/10 and 2010/11 and increase to $18 million in 2011/12.
