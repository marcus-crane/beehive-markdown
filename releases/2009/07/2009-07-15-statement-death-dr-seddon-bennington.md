Arts Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson expressed his sorrow at the death of Te Papa chief executive Seddon Bennington.

"Seddon Bennington served Te Papa and the people of New Zealand well over his seven years as chief executive," said Mr Finlayson. "He brought wide international experience and leadership to the role. He was well respected and will be sorely missed."

"My deepest sympathies go to his family and the staff and board of Te Papa, and to the family of Marcella Jackson."

Dr Bennington was appointed chief executive at Te Papa in January 2003. Before that he was Director of the Carnegie Science Centre in Pittsburgh, United States, and a former chief executive of the Scitech Discovery Centre in Perth
