Justice Minister Simon Power welcomes the release today of the Law Commission's issues paper on the reform of New Zealand's liquor laws.

"This is a comprehensive report that looks closely at a wide range of problems caused by alcohol use, and raises many issues for discussion and debate.

"As the Minister of Justice, I'm interested that it addresses the effects of alcohol use on the level of criminal offending.

"I have asked the Law Commission to deliver its final report by March next year, to enable a package of legislation to address alcohol use to be passed by the end of next year.

"That will be a year earlier than originally planned.

"I urge the public to take time to read the proposals over the next three months, and I look forward to the responses to them."
