Tariana Turia today congratulated Tainui woman and pharmacy assistant Te Ana Simmonds for the work she has been doing to help free people from the smoking addiction.

"Te Ana is truly amazing. Here we have a person who has taken her own initiative to help the community she loves for no other reason but that she cares for them.

"Te Ana's ideas and actions are innovative in that she has been able, without any government or public money, to use her job and her energetic spirit to reach an at risk population and come out with real results.

"Te Ana's employer, her Tainui people, the Manurewa community and all of us should be very proud of her."

The 45-year-old single mother, who was recently named [Pharmacy Assistant of the Year](http://www.pharmacyawards.co.nz/), has been smoke free for seven months.

In an effort to help others she has been using her work as the pharmacy assistant at Leabank Pharmacy in Manurewa, where she has erected auahi kore signs, to recruit smokers to join a quit smoking programme she has put together.

The programme has included acting as an in-store quit smoking advisor at the pharmacy, facilitating presentations at marae and in the Manurewa community and mentoring smokers and their whanau on an up close and personal level.

About 44% of the smokers who Te Ana has mentored have been smoke free for three months.
