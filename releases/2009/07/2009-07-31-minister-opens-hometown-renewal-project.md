Housing Minister and Whangarei MP Phil Heatley was on hand in his home town today to open Housing New Zealand’s newest neighbourhood improvement project office in Otangarei, Whangarei.

Housing New Zealand, which owns just under half the properties in the Whangarei suburb, converted a state rental property as a base to better serve the neighbourhood’s tenants.

In the past year $2.75 million has been spent upgrading state houses in Northland, of which $118,828 was spent upgrading 29 state houses in Otangarei.

“The area has had its share of issues in the past, but since Housing New Zealand embarked on its community renewal programme some great things have been happening here,” Mr Heatley said.

“The suburb is really beginning to flourish, with a long list of projects already underway and many more to come.”

Housing New Zealand has partnered with a number of other government agencies such as Police, Whangarei District Council, the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Social Development and the Northland District Health Board, as well as Otangarei residents, iwi and local community groups.

The improvement project, which aims to address social issues and build strong healthy communities, as well as improve housing and the appearance of the area, is one of six community renewal projects around the country, with others in Rotorua, Wellington and Auckland.

“It’s a great pleasure to support agencies which are working on the frontline, all of them focussed on providing services where they are most needed,” Minister Heatley added.
