Just over a week after its launch, the public consultation phase of Defence Review 2009 has been received well and has already drawn a positive response, Associate Minister of Defence Heather Roy said today.

"The Defence Review 2009 public consultation document - released at Te Papa on June 26 - has proved to be an effective tool in gathering the views of the public on the direction of the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) into the future," Mrs Roy said.

"Copies of the document and the Review 09 brochure, both containing a submission form, have been distributed at 491 schools throughout the country - as well as to all public libraries in New Zealand.

"Copies can also be obtained from local RSAs, Waiouru's National Army Museum Te Mata Toa, and the Air Force Museum of New Zealand in Christchurch.  Submissions can also be made at the Ministry of Defence website www.defence.govt.nz.

"The NZDF is an integral part of New Zealand society and belongs to all New Zealanders.  Defence Review 2009 is an opportunity for all Kiwis to play a part in determining the path that the NZDF will take out to 2035.

"I encourage all New Zealanders young and old to take up this opportunity and make a submission to ensure that their views and input are recorded for consideration," Mrs Roy said.
