Foreign Minister Murray McCully leaves for the Pacific tonight for a week-long trip that will see him meet Ministers, political leaders and senior officials in Tonga, Kiribati, Tuvalu, and Samoa.

The trip continues Mr McCully's close engagement with governments throughout the Pacific, and follows earlier visits to Fiji, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, the Cook Islands, and Samoa.

"Strengthening New Zealand's relationship with our Pacific neighbours is a key priority for the government, and this trip will help further reinforce that commitment," Mr McCully said.

"Discussions over the coming week will cover a number of regional matters, including the key issues for next month's Pacific Islands Leaders Forum, in Cairns, Australia, and the impact of the global economic crisis on the Pacific.

"I will also be reaffirming New Zealand's commitment to development assistance in the Pacific, and outlining the government's recent decisions to place greater emphasis on the region and to focus more on supporting sustainable economic development.

"Environmental issues will also be on the agenda, especially in Kiribati and Tuvalu, where the respective governments face considerable social and economic challenges as a result of climate change."

Mr McCully's visit to Kiribati coincides with celebrations marking the 30th anniversary of independence. New Zealand was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with the newly independent nation in 1979.
