The New Zealand Lottery Grants Board has announced that over $163 million will this year be pumped back into the community from lottery profits.

Internal Affairs Minister and Board chairman Nathan Guy said the Board had been able to increase its funding allocations to Lottery community committees and statutory bodies.

Funding allocations to national and regional community committees have been boosted by $2.4m to $40.9m from the total fund allocation of $163.9m for the 2009/10 financial year.

The statutory bodies - Creative New Zealand, New Zealand Film Commission, New Zealand Film Archive, and Sport and Recreation New Zealand will receive $64.7m - up $1.4m on last year while a further $58.3m will go to national, specialist and facilities committees.

"The Board is pleased that it has been able to increase funding to community committees and statutory bodies in this time of economic recession and ensure that lottery profits benefit all Kiwis - not only prize winners," said Mr Guy.

"Because of strong support from the New Zealand public, the Board can provide funding for a wide range of organisations that in turn help make our communities strong and sustainable.

"It has been a difficult year for most philanthropic organisations, and the Board is looking to sustain its funding support to the community.

"Together with other members of the Board, I look forward to seeing the often extraordinary results of what the ‘other lottery winners' do for other New Zealanders with their lottery grants," Mr Guy said.
