Arts Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson expressed his sorrow at the death of renowned weaver Diggeress Rangitutahi Te Kanawa, who passed away last night.

"Diggeress Rangitutahi Te Kanawa dedicated her life to promote and preserve the traditional art of weaving," Mr Finlayson said. "She provided inspiration for many weavers and contemporary artists by sharing her knowledge, and was instrumental in the Renaissance of this art form."

"My sincere condolences go to her family," Mr Finlayson said.

Diggeress Rangitutahi Te Kanawa was awarded a CNZM. (Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit) in the 2000 New Year honours. She received many awards, including Te Waka Toi (Maori Art Board of Creative New Zealand's) premiere award, Te Tohu Tiketike o Te Waka Toi for a Lifetime Commitment to Maori Weaving in 2006. She was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Waikato for her dedication to keeping alive the traditions of fine weaving.
