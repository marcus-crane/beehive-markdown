Tariana Turia today welcomed a report on government engagement with citizens and communities.

*From Talk to Action* was written by the Building Better Government Engagement reference group, members of which come from community organisations, local and central government.

"I am pleased to receive the reference group's ideas about how government agencies can communicate and collaborate well with citizens and communities," Mrs Turia said.

 "One of my goals is to help build strong and trusting relationship between the community and government - people have a right to be involved in decisions that affect their lives."

The report lays out challenges to the community and government to achieve trusting, respectful relationships.

Mrs Turia will be organising a national community-government forum in November so they can discuss the next steps for working together in partnership.

"I thank the reference group for its valuable contribution to this conversation. In these changing social, economic and environmental times it is even more important that we continue to share our skills, value our connections and build strong communities."
