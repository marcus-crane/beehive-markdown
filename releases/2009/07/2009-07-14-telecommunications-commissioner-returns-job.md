Telecommunications Commissioner Dr Ross Patterson will return to his job on Monday 27 July after stepping down in September last year to deal with an alcohol-related health issue.

Commerce Minister Simon Power says he is satisfied Dr Patterson has met all the requirements for a return to work.

"A process was put in place by the previous government last September, and I am satisfied Dr Patterson has met the requirements of that process and that he is ready to resume his role as Telecommunications Commissioner.

"He has received medical treatment, and I have received independent medical advice on that treatment and have considered very carefully all aspects of the matter.

"I am also informed that Dr Patterson has been keeping himself up to speed on telecommunications and Commerce Commission matters, which will help ensure a smooth resumption."

Mr Power says because the matter is a sensitive one relating to a personal health issue, he will not be commenting further.

The Telecommunications Commissioner is a regulatory role established under the Telecommunications Act 2001. The Commissioner is also a member of the Commerce Commission, for which the Minister of Commerce has overall responsibility.
