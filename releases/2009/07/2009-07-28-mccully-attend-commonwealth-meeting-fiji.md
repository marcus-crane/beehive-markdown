Foreign Minister Murray McCully heads to London tonight to attend a Commonwealth meeting on Fiji, before going to Australia to attend the Pacific Islands Forum.

"The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) meeting on Friday will take stock of developments in Fiji since March when it last met," Mr McCully said.

"At that time, a clear warning was issued that Fiji would face suspension measures under the Commonwealth's Millbrook Declaration if it failed to heed calls, made by Pacific Island Forum leaders earlier this year, to make progress towards a return to democracy.

"Regrettably since March the situation in Fiji has deteriorated further, with the abrogation of the Constitution; removal of the judiciary and constitutional office-holders; blanket media censorship controls, and further human rights breaches, all contrary to the calls made by Forum leaders and the Commonwealth."

Following the CMAG meeting, Mr McCully will fly to Brisbane, where he will deliver a speech at he Lowy Institute on the effect of the global economic crisis on the Pacific. 

He will then join Prime Minister John Key at the Pacific Islands Forum in Cairns, where the economic crisis, and the importance of effective development assistance are expected to be key topics of discussions.
