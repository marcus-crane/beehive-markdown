A ceremony in Turangi tomorrow marking the transfer of approximately $450 million in land and cash to eight Central North island Iwi completes the largest single settlement of historical grievances by the Crown, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson said.

The transfer completes the Crown’s key obligations under the terms of the Central North Island Forests Land Collective Settlement Act 2008.

The ceremony will be attended by Deputy Prime Minister Bill English, Minister of Maori Affairs Dr Pita Sharples, and Mr Finlayson.

The 176,000 ha and $280 million in cash have been transferred to CNI Iwi Holdings Ltd, owned by the eight iwi that make up the Central North Island Iwi Collective. The Crown holds a 10% shareholding on behalf of groups in the region that are not members of the Collective and may have historical claims to the land.

“This settlement is an historic one and reflects a determination by both iwi and the Crown to achieve an innovative settlement that allows the transfer of a significant resource base to iwi in the region. I would like to congratulate all the iwi involved,” Mr Finlayson said.

“I would also like to note that the value of the settlement was recognised by all parties in Parliament who were unanimous in their support of the settlement legislation. In doing so political parties recognised the importance of settling historical grievances with just and durable settlements. They also recognised that that this settlement was good for the region and good for all New Zealanders.”

“The Crown will continue to work with the Collective to help ensure that the economic and commercial benefits of the settlement are realised.

“This settlement marks the arrival of a major long-term investor in both the forestry industry and economic opportunities in the region generally.”

 

**Background**

The Iwi that make up the Central North Island Iwi Collective are: Ngai Tuhoe, Ngati Rangitihi, Ngati Whare, Ngati Tuwharetoa, Ngati Manawa, Ngati Whakaue, and Raukawa and the affiliate Te Arawa iwi and hapu that make up Te Pumautanga o Te Arawa. Together these iwi have more than a 110,000 members.

The Crown forest lands in the Central North Island total more than 176,000 ha. They include the following forests: Kaingaroa, Waimihia, Crater, Horohoro, Pureora South, Taurewa, Tokorangi Waituhi and Whakarewarewa. These forests are owned by the holders of Crown Forest Licenses and the land, until it was transferred to the CNI Collective, was owned by the Crown.

Crown Forest Licenses were created by the Crown Forests Assets Act 1989 to allow the transfer of state forest assets while protecting the rights of Maori to historical claims for the underlying land. The licenses provide for the use of the land for forestry purposes. The licenses can be traded and are valid for up to 35 years following the transfer of the underlying land to iwi in settlements. Since 1989 annual rentals accumulated in the Crown Forestry Rental Trust awaiting settlement and transfer of the forest land to which they apply.

The Collective iwi have already agreed how they will distribute the accumulated and ongoing rentals amongst themselves. Their relative shares in the forest land will be determined by a mana whenua process over the next two years.

The annual rental income from the Crown Forest Licences on these lands totals $15m.

The Crown 10% shareholding in CNI Iwi Holdings Ltd will be held for use in settlements with any group that has direct interests in the CNI forest land but is not a member of the Collective, and to provide cultural redress.  Any residual land remaining will be made available to the Collective at a to be agreed value after six years.

The Collective is to have a right of first refusal over certain Crown-owned property in the region.

The participating iwi will negotiate the remainder of their historical settlements directly with the Crown. This will include a Crown Apology, Crown Acknowledgements for any breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi, an historical account, any further commercial redress and a cultural redress package that each iwi can use to assist in the recognition and protection of their cultural values and sites in their rohe. The affiliate Te Arawa iwi that make up Te Pumautanga o Te Arawa have already completed negotiations for their settlement.  Ngati Manawa and Ngati Whare are in negotiations and nearing final settlement agreements
