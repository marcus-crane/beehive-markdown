Director and chair appointments and reappointments to the boards of seven Crown Research Institutes were announced today by Minister of Research, Science and Technology Wayne Mapp.

There are 12 new appointments, five reappointments and one promotion of a current director to deputy chair. They include new chairs for the Institute of Environmental Science & Research Ltd (ESR) and the National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research Ltd (NIWA).

Auckland businessman Chris Mace is the new chair of NIWA. Mr Mace has previously served as chair of the New Zealand Antarctic Institute (now Antarctica New Zealand) and ESR. He was also a founding member of the New Zealand Institute, which introduces new and creative thinking into economic and social policy debate.

At ESR, Dr Susan Macken, also Auckland-based, will take over as chair. Dr Macken is a director of several public and private companies including Bank of New Zealand and Southern Cross. She is a business consultant with particular expertise in business strategy, marketing and strategic relationship development.

Dr Mapp acknowledged the strong leadership provided by outgoing chairs Sue Suckling (NIWA) and Ian Wilson (ESR). "Both companies have consistently been the strongest performing Crown Research Institutes," he said.

"They have enhanced New Zealand's scientific and commercial expertise. They have both been top performers."

Dr Mapp thanked Mr Mace and Dr Macken for agreeing to serve in the chair roles. "I look forward to working with them both to pursue the continued success of these businesses," he said.

Other new appointments and reappointments to the CRI boards are listed below. A small number of further new appointments to the boards will be announced shortly.
