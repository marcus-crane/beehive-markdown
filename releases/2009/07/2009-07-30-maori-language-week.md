From modest beginnings in 1975, Māori Language Week has blossomed, transforming the landscape in a manner few New Zealanders could have anticipated, Associate Minister of Maori Affairs Georgina te Heuheu says.

"As Māori reassert their special place in New Zealand we've marked Māori Language Week every year since 1975. We've come a long way since the1980s when the Waitangi Tribunal found in favour of claimants and Māori was made an official language.

"More people speak the language; we have Māori language schools, Māori radio stations, Maori television, Māori language recovery programmes, kohanga reo, kura kaupapa and wananga.

"This year's celebration is a watershed event for te reo," Mrs te Heuheu said.

"Readers, writers, publishers, software developers, TV and radio producers and a host of other players with an interest in preserving and promoting te reo have brought together resources which range from the simple, fun and effective ways of teaching basic Māori words and concepts, to more sophisticated opportunities for more fluent speakers to engage in ongoing vigorous discussion.

"Television, radio the print media and other electronic outlets provide a platform for the normalisation of the language in the wider fabric of New Zealand's identity and culture," she said.

"SpongeBob SquarePants is a classic example and SKY Digital's younger viewers have been very excited to learn that Nickelodeon New Zealand is this week bringing SpongeBob SquarePants and his sea-dwelling friends Squidward, Mr Krabs and Patrick to our screens for five days in te reo Māori.

"Radio and television are making special programmes looking at the state of te reo today, while greetings, place names and graphics are in Māori.

"Every activity, big or small, is helping to make te reo Maori a normal and natural element of New Zealand society.

"Who can forget the bravery of telephone operator Naida Glavish (Ngati Whatua) who greeted callers with a cheery kia ora, sparking a national controversy in 1984."

Mrs te Heuheu says the role of successive governments in supporting the transformation has been critical.

"This National-led Government is fully behind all endeavours to promote Māori language and culture and to expand and normalise its place in New Zealand.

"Tomorrow I go to Auckland to launch a Māori language application for mobile phones for Maori Television. m.Māori allows the downloading of 40 fun Māori language audio phrases and words to their cell phone - positioning te reo as modern and relevant."
