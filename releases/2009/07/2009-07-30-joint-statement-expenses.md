Expenses claimed by members of Parliament will be publicly available every three months, the Prime Minister, the Hon John Key, and the Speaker of the House, the Hon Dr Lockwood Smith, have announced.

The first disclosure of expenses was made today up to June 30, 2009, covering the first two quarters of this year.

They said the decision to disclose the information was made by a cross-party committee on expenses. The committee was convened by the Speaker following a request by the Prime Minister and first met early last month.

"We believe the disclosure reflects a commitment by members of Parliament to be open and accountable to the people of New Zealand.

"Information released today covers those expenses paid under the Speaker's Directions to individual members of Parliament by the Parliamentary Service for Wellington accommodation, out-of-Wellington accommodation, air travel and surface travel costs."

"Payments for travel under the inter-Parliamentary programme by the Office of the Clerk and for Ministerial travel and accommodation by Ministerial ?Services are also being released.

"This disclosure will provide a comprehensive picture of expenses paid to members of Parliament by the three relevant agencies, Parliamentary Service, Office of the Clerk and Ministerial Services," they said.

A full schedule of expenses claimed by members of Parliament is available on [http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/MPP/MPs/Expenses](http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/MPP/MPs/Expenses) and for Ministers [http://www.dia.govt.nz/press.nsf/index](http://www.dia.govt.nz/press.nsf/index)

The next disclosure is expected at the end of October for the quarter ending September 30, 2009.
