Corrections Minister Judith Collins today announced that three additional Drug Treatment Units will be operating in New Zealand prisons by December 2011, doubling the number of prisoners able to undertake rehabilitation.

Launching the Department of Corrections' Drug and Alcohol Strategy 2009 - 2014 at Arohata Prison, Ms Collins said drugs and alcohol were major drivers of crime in New Zealand and two-thirds of prisoners entered prison with drug and alcohol problems.

The new Drug Treatment Units would be at Otago Corrections Facility, Wanganui Prison and at a yet-to-be determined prison in the northern region. There are currently six Drug Treatment Units at prisons around New Zealand.

"If we are serious about reducing the number of people in our prisons and making New Zealand a better and safer place we need to give real commitment to providing the resources, expertise and opportunity to break the cycle of misuse," Ms Collins said.

"Tackling drug and alcohol addiction is a priority for this Government. Today, we are meeting our commitment to double the number of places in prison providing drug and alcohol treatment, from 500 to 1000 by 2011.

"Corrections will also introduce a second drug treatment programme that is shorter but equally intensive, to help prisoners who are serving shorter sentences."

Ms Collins said addressing drug and alcohol misuse in New Zealand would require collaboration between Corrections and community groups and other government agencies such as the Ministry of Health and District Health Boards.

The strategy will also provide for additional staff training on drug and alcohol dependency and improved drug prevention and detection systems.
