Minister for Arts Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson announced today the appointment of two new members, Anne Rush and Jimmy Wallace, to the Arts Council of New Zealand.

The Arts Council is responsible for overall policy development for Creative New Zealand, which operates at arm's length from government in encouraging, promoting and supporting the arts in New Zealand.

"I am very pleased to announce the appointment of Anne Rush and Jimmy Wallace," Mr Finlayson said. "They both bring an interest in arts and heritage issues from a community perspective, and have long records of service to the arts and heritage causes."

Anne Rush is an arts and heritage advocate from Nelson. She is a former member of the Queen Elizabeth Arts Council Central Regional Committee, and is a member of the Nelson Heritage Advisory Group. She was a member of the 1999 APEC Prime Ministerial Arts and Culture Advisory Group.

Jimmy Wallace is a Geraldine lawyer, and has been in private practice for over 40 years. He has been a board member and trustee of a number of charitable and heritage trusts, including the South Canterbury Historic Places Trust.

Anne Rush and Jimmy Wallace's three year terms began on 1 July.
