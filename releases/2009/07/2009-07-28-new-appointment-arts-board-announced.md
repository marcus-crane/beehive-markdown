Minister for Arts Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson announced today the appointment of former Member of Parliament Nandor Tanczos and the reappointments of Pele Walker and Michael Prentice to the Creative New Zealand Arts Board.

The Arts Board is responsible for encouraging, promoting and supporting the development of the arts, including the art of Pasifika people and the diverse cultures in New Zealand, through the allocation of funding to artists, arts organisations and art projects.

Nandor Tanczos was a Member of Parliament for the Green Party between 1999 and 2008. He was the Green Party's spokesperson for the Environment and Sustainable Land Management, Justice, Information and Communication Technology, Constitutional Issues and Commerce.

"Nandor Tanczos was an outstanding Member of Parliament and I am pleased he has agreed to continue his contribution to public life," Mr Finlayson said. "I am pleased to announce he will join Pele Walker and Michael Prentice, whom I have reappointed in recognition of their excellent work on the Board."

Mediation consultancy principal Pele Walker is currently chair of the Board's Pacific Arts Committee. She has sat on the Board since 2006 and is also chair of the Pacific Women's Economic Development Advisory Board.

Marketing and advertising expert Michael Prentice has been reappointed to the Board for a further term, after first being appointed in 2006.

The three year terms began on 1 July.
