Customs Minister Maurice Williamson, has recognised Auckland Customs officer Brian Morrison's 50 years of service to New Zealand. Mr Morrison now stands alongside John Hopkins and Brian Redfern who each have over 50 years of service to Customs.

At a ceremony in Auckland today the Minister presented the New Zealand Customs Service Medal, which recognises 14 years of an officer's frontline service, to 11 Customs officers. Eleven other officers were awarded additional clasps to their medals for every seven years of subsequent service.

Mr Williamson says he is delighted to be able to recognise the officers' work in protecting New Zealand's border.

"It is a special opportunity to recognise these frontline officers who help protect the community from the scourge of illicit drugs, such as P, which destroys our communities.

"I have the greatest respect for the work that Customs officers undertake everyday to help achieve this goal," says Mr Williamson.

Comptroller of Customs Martyn Dunne paid tribute to the recipients' record of service.

"It's a credit to New Zealand Customs that it has retained so many long-serving officers. It reflects the mutual commitment that the Service and its staff make to each other," he says.

The medal recognises long service, professional conduct, and contribution as a frontline Customs officer. Long service awards are presented to all Customs personnel who have completed specified periods of service.
