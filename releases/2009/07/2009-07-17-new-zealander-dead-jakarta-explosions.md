Prime Minister John Key is expressing sorrow that a New Zealander has been killed in explosions in Indonesia today.

Embassy staff in Jakarta this afternoon confirmed the death of a New Zealander. They are continuing with efforts to identify any other Kiwis caught up in explosions at the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels.

“Everything I have seen suggests that this is a deliberate attack designed to kill and wound innocent people,” Mr Key said.

“While we are still receiving information from the Embassy about what happened, I would like to convey my deepest sympathy to the family and friends of the New Zealander killed.

“I extend my deepest sympathy also to the people of Indonesia and all others who have been caught up in this terrible event.”

Embassy staff have been checking hospitals to locate any injured New Zealanders and making contact with those registered on its database.

If anyone in New Zealand has family or friends in Jakarta who they are concerned about, they should first try to contact that person directly. If they continue to hold concerns they should contact the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade on (04) 439 8000.

Mr Key is planning to contact Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.

MFAT will be providing updates as more details become available.
