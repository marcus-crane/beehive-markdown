Changes to regulations covering early childhood education services will reduce unnecessary bureaucracy while ensuring the health and safety of children, Education Minister Anne Tolley said today.

"The changes include ‘in perpetuity' licences for early childhood education services and a new minimum age for home-based educators of 17 years," Mrs Tolley said. "They follow consultation with the sector and parents."

Other changes include a new Police Vetting requirement for people aged 17 and over living in a home-based educator's home, and a new licensing fee for new services only, she said.

"Sleep rooms and plumbed wash facilities will not be required, though services will still be required to have a clear procedure for how they will ensure hygiene and meet sleep requirments. There will also be changes to the risk procedures and role of persons responsible for outings.

"These important changes follow the review I directed of the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008,"Mrs Tolley said. "They provide appropriate regulation that assures safe and caring learning environments without placing unnecessary burdens on services."

Officials will do further work on other issues covered in the consultation but not addressed in these changes, including options for regulating limited attendance services, regulating group size and maximum centre size, and managing multiple licences to reduce compliance costs. 

The amended regulations and criteria are expected to take effect in August 2009.
