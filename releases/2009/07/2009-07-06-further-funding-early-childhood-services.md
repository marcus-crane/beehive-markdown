Education Minister Anne Tolley today announced $127,095 in funding to assist six early childhood education centres in Ashburton, Christchurch, Mangere, Oxford, New Plymouth and East Cape.

The grants, from the Ministry of Education’s Establishment Funding initiative, help community based centres purchase equipment and resources, and assist them in becoming licensed. Four of the centres will also use their grants to help meet the costs of recruiting and employing qualified staff. 

“This funding directly assists centres to open or increase the number of places they offer their communities,” said Mrs Tolley.

“The government is committed to ensuring all children get the best start in education. By providing these grants we are directly increasing the number of places available for families to access early childhood education.”

Establishment Funding of $1.2 million is available every year to new services or those that are increasing the number of places they offer by five or more. Funds are allocated four times during the year and services can receive up to $30,000 each.

Applications for the next available round of Establishment Funding close on 31 July 2009.  Further information and application forms are available at [http://www.lead.ece.govt.nz/EstablishingAnECE/EstablishmentFunding/default.htm](http://www.lead.ece.govt.nz/EstablishingAnECE/EstablishmentFunding/default.htm)
