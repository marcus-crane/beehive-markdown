The Government has given a boost to projects aimed at bringing the world of information, computers and technology to people who are digitally disadvantaged.

About $5.99 million from the Community Partnership Fund (CPF) is being distributed to 28 information and communication technology projects, with the aim of building skills and capabilities in New Zealand communities where access to ICT is limited.

Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Tariana Turia said the funding would work to expand existing projects.

"I‘m happy to see that 1500 more families will benefit from the funding of further Computers in Homes projects because it aims to help parents support the learning needs of their children," Mrs Turia said.

Mrs Turia was also pleased to hear the latest CPF funding round would enable three computer clubhouses - or community hubs that will help young people explore ICT ideas and develop their skills - to open in Lower Hutt, Hamilton and Whanganui.

Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce said funding from the CPF will help ensure more New Zealanders are digitally literate and are able to use ICT to improve their lives.

"There are an estimated 20-30% of New Zealanders who are currently excluded from the digital world. This is both in terms of access to digital tools and the capability to use them.   This sort of funding will help us turn that around.

"For both economic productivity and social reasons, there is a role for government in helping ensure everybody can participate in the 21st century digital world we live in.
