Housing Minister Phil Heatley has announced the appointment of three new members to the board of Housing New Zealand Corporation and the reappointment of two existing members.  The new members have been appointed for a term of three years, beginning on 21 January 2010.

New member Adrienne Young-Cooper replaces Lope Ginnen as Deputy Chair, who has been reappointed and will remain on the board as a member for 12 months. 

Existing member Colin Dale has also been reappointed, for a period of two years.  The other new members are Amos Forrester and Jeff Staniland. 

"The new members join the board at a challenging time.  They have been carefully chosen to bring a renewed focus to the Board that needs to strategically balance the requirement to deliver equitable social housing outcomes with the commercial realities of managing a large state house asset. 

"It is important that the Corporation delivers social housing to those most in need, in the most efficient and effective manner possible.  We think that the changes made to the Board will assist the Corporation to achieve this," Mr Heatley said. 

"While the new members will provide fresh impetus to the board, it is also important to maintain continuity on the Board; for this reason, Colin Dale and Lope Ginnen were reappointed."

Departing members Anthony Paine, Jo Brosnahan, Sandra Lee, and Garry Wilson have been thanked by the Minister of Housing for their work on the board.

"The efforts of the members leaving have been much appreciated and I thank them for their contributions to the Board," Mr Heatley said.

"I look forward to continuing to work with the Chair - Pat Snedden - and the new board in the future."

**Background**

The Housing New Zealand Corporation was established under the Housing Corporation Act 1974 and is a Crown entity under the Crown Entities Act 2004.  Members are jointly appointed to the Board by the Minister of Finance and Minister of Housing.

Pat Snedden remains Chair of the Corporation, and Greg Hinton as a board member, with both their current terms expiring on 16 December 2010.
