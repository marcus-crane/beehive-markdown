Transport Minister Steven Joyce says building a third harbour crossing will be a key transport priority for the government in the soon-to-be-released 20-year infrastructure plan.

The NZ Transport Agency has today moved to future proof Auckland's transport needs by protecting a route for an additional harbour crossing, as well as confirming additional funding to strengthen the existing bridge.

"The Auckland Harbour Bridge is a key piece of our transport infrastructure - providing a vital link between north and south, both physically and economically," says Mr Joyce.

"As such, the NZTA is monitoring it closely to ensure the existing Harbour Bridge remains a strong, safe and viable link into the future.  Regular and routine maintenance will ensure this continues to be the case.

"In parallel to this, planning is now moving up a gear for the third harbour crossing which will in time relieve much of the pressure on the existing harbour bridge.

"It's my expectation that the third harbour crossing will increase the number of lanes across the harbour and also allow for public transport corridors and walking and cycling lanes."

Mr Joyce says he has not yet formed a view on whether a tunnel or a bridge is most appropriate.

"It is my current expectation that construction will largely occur in the second half of the twenty year period."
