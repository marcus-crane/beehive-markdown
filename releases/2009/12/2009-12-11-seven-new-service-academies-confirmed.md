Seven new Service Academies will open at New Zealand secondary schools in 2010, Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced.

"The extra academies mean even more young people will have the opportunity to take part in a challenging and motivating programme, learn new skills, and be given a chance to succeed," said Mrs Tolley.

The military-style programmes for year 12 and 13 students, part of the Government's Youth Opportunities package announced by the Prime Minister in August, will be provided at schools with the help of the New Zealand Defence Force.

Students will take part in courses such as leadership and outdoor education, and work towards reaching NCEA Level 1 Mathematics and English or above.

"Service Academies are aimed at young people who may otherwise leave school and find it difficult to get a job or move on to tertiary education.

"After completing the year-long programme, the aim is for these students to return to a mainstream school, go on to tertiary education or find a sustainable job."

The additional academies join the existing 11 which are operating across the country.

The seven new Service Academies will be run through the following schools:

Tikipunga High School (Whangarei)

Otahuhu College (Auckland)

Gisborne Girls' High School (Gisborne)

Tokoroa High School (Tokoroa)

Tamaki College (Auckland)

Wanganui City College (Wanganui)

Te Kuiti High School (Te Kuiti)
