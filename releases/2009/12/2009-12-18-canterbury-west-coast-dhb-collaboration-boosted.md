Health Minister Tony Ryall has announced that Canterbury DHB board member, Mr Peter Ballantyne has been cross-appointed to the West Coast DHB, while current West Coast board member Dr Paul McCormack will fill the Deputy Chair position.

Dr McCormack will take over the Deputy Chair from the retiring Dr Christine Robertson.

"The cross-appointment of Mr Ballantyne to both Boards, and having Dr McCormack in a senior role strengthens the links and opportunities between Canterbury and West Coast," Mr Ryall said.

"Mr Ballantyne has experience as a chartered accountant and auditor. He chairs the Canterbury DHB's Quality, Finance, Audit and Risk Committee, and is on Canterbury University's Audit and Risk Committee."

"Dr McCormack has an extensive background in clinical practice and management. He has lengthy experience as a GP. He was Managing Director of the Christchurch-based GP group Pegasus Health for five years, and its Executive Chair before that."

"He is also the chair of the Government's Access to Highly Specialised  Medicines Review Panel."
