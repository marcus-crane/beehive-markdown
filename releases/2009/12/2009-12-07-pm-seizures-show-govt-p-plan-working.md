Prime Minister John Key today welcomed significant results achieved just weeks after announcing the Government's plan to tackle the dangerous drug ‘P".

"In early October I outlined the National Government's plan to tackle the menace that is ‘P'.  The Government Plan on Methamphetamine included a range of initiatives involving various agencies like Police and Customs. 

"This seriously addictive drug is ruining lives and costing society.  Part of our approach has been to attack the supply chain of this drug," says Mr Key.

"In an intensive period from the start of October through to November, Customs intercepted a total of 230kgs of methamphetamine precursor pseudoephedrine at the border, compared with 67kgs over the same period last year.  Fifteen arrests were also made.

"The 230kgs seized has come in a large number of interceptions of smaller amounts of the precursor, not through one or a small number of large hauls.

"The amount seized in that period is more than three times as much as was seized in the same period last year.

"Customs advises that this is the most successful eight weeks on record, stopping what would have been an estimated $84 million worth of ‘P' hitting the streets with all the consequent harm that causes.

"The success so far from these interceptions is evident not just in the amounts being seized, but also anecdotal evidence that the price of the drug has increased on the streets.

"Part of the Government Action Plan involved the redeployment of up to 40 Customs staff from other duties to aid in the effort.

"More than 140 Customs staff are involved now, and criminals should be warned that Government agencies, including Customs, will be maintaining the pressure.

"The plan announced in October attacked the ‘P' problem from all directions -cracking down on precursors, breaking supply chains, providing better routes to treatment, supporting families, and strengthening leadership and accountability.

"The Government will not let up in its efforts to target the ‘P' trade, which is causing so much harm to society.  We will continue our approach, and look at new equipment, new tactics, and new ways to combat the trade."
