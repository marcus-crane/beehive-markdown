The Associate Minister for Disability Issues, Minister Pansy Wong marks International Day of Persons with Disabilities today with the release of social development information in New Zealand Sign Language.

"The *Accessing our Services* video will make it easier for sign language users to know what services are available from the Ministry of Social Development," said Minister Wong.

The information will help people looking for work, wanting to study, needing care and protection for children, or financial assistance.

"We all need to know who to call to access job vacancies, or how to apply for a student allowance or how to keep our communities free from violence so we can have safe, strong families," said Minister Wong.

This is the first time that comprehensive information on government services has been made available in New Zealand Sign Language.

"Most Deaf people are independent and *Accessing our Services* is an efficient and effective way for the Deaf community to learn about services available in their own language, New Zealand Sign Language," said Minster Wong.

The resource was produced in collaboration with Deaf Aotearoa New Zealand, which represents over 7,000 Deaf people. It is available online and as a DVD.

"A key priority for the Disability Issues portfolio is an accessible New Zealand and I am pleased to be able to deliver this resource that improves information access for our Deaf community," said Minister Wong.

The theme for this year's International Day of Persons with Disabilities is about providing people with disabilities around the world with the opportunities to reach their potential and be an integral part in the social and economic development of their community.
