Proposals for rolling out new food laws over a five year period have gone out for consultation, Food Safety Minister Kate Wilkinson announced today.

"The food sector will have five years to shift from the old Food Hygiene Regulations to the new food regime in a staged approach," Ms Wilkinson says.

"This will give businesses adequate time to adjust to the new system and allow the New Zealand Food Safety Authority and territorial authorities to replace the old Food Hygiene Regulations in a structured way."

The new Food Bill, which is planned for introduction to Parliament next year, requires everyone who deals with food for sale to use one of three different tools based mainly on how risky the food is to consumers.

"This Bill heralds a major shift in the way operators in the food sector conduct their business and it is important that we get input and buy-in from the people at the frontline," Ms Wilkinson says.

Changes to the Bill have shifted the focus onto national programmes - a broad based regulatory tool that is suited to medium to low risk businesses. Food control plans continue to play a vital role for businesses dealing with higher or broader risks and businesses that are more complex.

Businesses with very low risks and impact, such as bed and breakfasts, will be given food handler guidance information to help them produce food safely.

The consultation document details which tool will apply to each sector and contains a timeline for adoption of the new tools. Consultation closes February 12, 2010.
