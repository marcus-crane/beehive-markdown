Associate Energy and Resources Minister Pansy Wong is urging people to take care this summer while working around electrical mains and appliances this summer.

Many serious electrical-related injuries happen while people are doing work around their houses or in outdoor situations. 

"The summer season brings a hype of DIY activity as people take advantage of the sunshine to work on and around their homes. However, by taking some simple precautions this summer we can reduce needless injuries and ensure that we all have a safe and productive summer," Mrs Wong says.

Energy Safety recommends the following precautions when working with and around electricity this summer:

- Plan ahead before starting on any jobs inside or outside; make sure you locate internal electrical cabling, outside power lines or underground cables to eliminate the risk of damaging them or worse, receiving a serious or fatal electrical shock.
- Always use electrical safety devices like a Residual Current Device (RCD) or isolating transformer - this is particularly important when using electricity in damp areas or outside.
- Always check your power cords, plugs and appliances for any signs of damage before using them. If they are damaged have them immediately repaired or replaced and ask the repairer to fit an inspection tag to show that they have been tested properly.
- Have your electricity company turn the power off if you are going to be working outside near a power cable or line.

"By taking these precautions we can ensure a safe and enjoyable summer for everyone," Mrs Wong says.
