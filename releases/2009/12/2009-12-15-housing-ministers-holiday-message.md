Housing Minister Phil Heatley is wishing all Housing New Zealand Corporation tenants a happy holiday, and is also offering them every opportunity to seek assistance if they have any difficulty managing their finances over the Christmas period.

"This has been a tough year for many New Zealanders and I don't want to see unnecessary hardship over the holidays. 

"Christmas can be a stressful time, with greater than usual expenses.  If you need help with managing rent payments it's only a phone call away.

"As the saying goes, a problem ignored is a crisis invited.  If things are getting tough please feel free to call your tenancy manager," Mr Heatley said.

While Housing New Zealand neighbourhood units will be closed for the statutory holidays, housing advisors at the corporation's contact centre will be available to take calls at any time over the festive break on 0800 801 601.
