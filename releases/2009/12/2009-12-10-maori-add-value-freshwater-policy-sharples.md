Maori involvement in decisions on freshwater is critical to developing robust policy, according to the Minister of Maori Affairs, Dr Pita Sharples.

Speaking at the Iwi Leaders Forum on Freshwater in Wellington this morning, Dr Sharples said the principles of justice and the ethic of partnership set out in the Treaty "provide a compelling case as to why we need to look at Māori rights and interests in freshwater".

"The Cabinet paper which outlines the freshwater strategy states that ‘meaningful, Treaty-based engagement with Māori' is central to a robust policy process, and that discussion is needed on the roles, rights and interests of Māori in order to make progress on issues such as water allocation," he said.

"The Prime Minister and several other Ministers, including myself as Minister of Māori Affairs, have committed to an ongoing engagement with the Iwi Leaders Group," he said, which "allows rangatira-to-rangatira discussion on high-level issues such as Māori rights and interests in freshwater.

"Progress will be rapid if the ethic of kaitiakitanga is welcomed to the centre of the debate around freshwater management.  And in turn, the contribution that tangata whenua can make towards sustainably managing our water resources will be of benefit to all New Zealanders," said Dr Sharples

"But I want to extend the Treaty relationship to also note the key relationships that must be forged not just with the Crown but at the local level between local authorities," he said.

"Local hapū and iwi need to be full participants in decisions on water management in their areas, and water ownership issues need to be allowed to come onto the local and national agenda. 

"Not everyone has the awareness and specialist knowledge that can help to shape our management of our natural resources.  We need to build capability.

"This may require further investment in education to spread understanding," said Dr Sharples.

Dr Sharples said the Maori worldview is that ‘all of our natural resources are inter-related, and intricately woven across our economic, cultural and spiritual aspirations', and that is ‘part of the unique signature tangata whenua have brought to this debate'.

 "While the Ministry of Environment might look at ‘ecological flows' or allocation as the issue under scrutiny, Maori bring a holistic vision to revive and revise the new thinking around freshwater," he said.

"We should celebrate the breadth of this vision, and as a nation welcome the groundbreaking difference we can make in incorporating indigenous knowledge alongside resource management strategies.

"We have an opportunity as a nation to set the standard high; to work with matauranga Maori and western science in parallel, investing both with equal importance," said Dr Sharples.
