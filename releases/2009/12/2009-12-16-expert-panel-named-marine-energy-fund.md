A panel of four experts has been chosen to consider applications to the Marine Energy Deployment Fund, Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee announced today.

The panel will allocate grants to projects which aim to develop and harness New Zealand's tidal and wave technology.

"This country has enormous potential to create renewable electricity generation from its oceans," says Mr Brownlee.

"It's vital we have the right mix of people on board with the vision to help new projects get off the ground and capitalise on our natural resources."

The four panellists include:

- Nick Barneveld, Investment Services Executive, PB New Zealand Ltd
- Tony Carter, Managing Director, Foodstuffs (New Zealand) Ltd
- Emily Rudkin, Renewable Energy Specialist, MWH New Zealand Ltd
- Andrew Thompson, South Island Commercial Manager, Fulton Hogan Ltd.

"Bringing on the development of our marine energy industry opens up a number of possibilities for the wider energy sector. Technological advances are being made continually and it's to our advantage to stay at the forefront of these as we explore the potential of the country's waters," says Mr Brownlee.

The Marine Energy Deployment Fund was set up through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority in 2008 to allocate grants over a four-year period. Projects granted funding will provide insights into the performance of marine technology in New Zealand's environment.  Two rounds of funding have been completed, with third-round funding recipients due to be announced by July 2010.
