Tariana Turia is marking International Day of People with Disabilities by commending families throughout New Zealand who care for a loved ones with a disability.

"I can not praise enough the efforts of people who care for a family member who has a disability," Mrs Turia said.

"My personal connection with disability comes through my brother who was tetraplegic. I remember the experiences so vividly and wished that he could enjoy the pleasures of life, to be able to participate in the way he determined, and to feel that nothing was beyond him.

"I am passionate about the right of families to care for family members in their own homes, with flexible support that allows them to have greater choice and control of their lives.

"And this is an area that I will be focussing on as the Minister of Disability Issues."

Another priority of Mrs Turia's for disabled people was ensuring they could talk for themselves.

"There will be those who are severely disabled who will not be able to speak for themselves, but there are also those who can and we must ensure they are given the opportunity to make the decisions that will affect their lives."
