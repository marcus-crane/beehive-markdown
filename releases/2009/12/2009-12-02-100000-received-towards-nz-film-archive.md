New funding of $100,000 confirmed today from Pub Charity towards a storage facility for the New Zealand Film Archive was welcomed by Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Hon Christopher Finlayson.

"Pub Charity Chief Executive Martin Cheer is to be applauded for his vision in helping to secure our cultural heritage for present and future generations of New Zealanders," Mr Finlayson said. "It is pleasing to see a significant vote of confidence from Pub Charity within such a short time since the launch of the Archive's fundraising drive."

The Archive's building project will provide a facility to protect and preserve the national moving image collection.

"This is an example of the kind of cultural philanthropy I am committed to fostering in New Zealand," said Mr Finlayson, who has established a Philanthropy Taskforce of leading philanthropists, chaired by Peter Biggs to look at ways to improve the environment for charitable giving in New Zealand.

"Changes to taxation law mean it costs less to donate, and we are looking at ways to increase financial support for arts, culture and heritage institutions from the private sector."

The building project has a total cost of $750,000, with the Film Archive hoping to raise a large percentage from the community. When constructed, the new storage building will enable the Film Archive to move approximately 150,000 cans, reels and cassettes of film and video out of substandard vaults and house them in temperature controlled conditions.

The Minister launched the Film Archive's fundraising project on Monday 23 November at a function at Park Road Post.
