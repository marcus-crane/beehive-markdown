New Zealand is making a $100,000 contribution to relief efforts in Fiji following Cyclone Mick, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.

"Tropical Cyclone Mick forced around 3800 people in Fiji to evacuate their homes, and we have reports that three people have died and three others are missing," Mr McCully said.

"There is localised damage to homes, roads and public utilities in Fiji as well as a need for humanitarian assistance in some areas.

"Fiji remains a close neighbour despite our differences with the regime. Our contribution to relief efforts in the wake of Cyclone Mick is a reminder of New Zealand's continued willingness to help the people of Fiji.

"The money will be used on essential relief supplies, including the replenishment of supplies used by the Red Cross to assist people in the immediate aftermath of the cyclone.

"We will continue to monitor the situation in Fiji, and await further damage assessments," Mr McCully said.
