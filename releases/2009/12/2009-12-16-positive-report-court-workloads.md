An Auditor-General's report on the Ministry of Justice's management of court workloads was released today.

Courts Minister Georgina te Heuheu said the audit was predominantly favourable, and she was pleased that the Ministry of Justice's effectiveness and efficiency in this area had been acknowledged.

"The report rightly identifies that court workloads are a critical issue.  It found that the Ministry is doing the right things to address workloads including working well with the sector, and is in a good position to meet future challenges." 

Mrs te Heuheu said she supported the Auditor General's recommendation to place greater emphasis on collecting and sharing information about better practice in managing court workloads throughout all courts.

 "I am confident that the Ministry will identify action it can take in response to the report's recommendation regarding the collecting and sharing of information surrounding best practice in managing court workloads. 

The Ministry has many projects underway which will lead to further improvements to the Court system throughout 2010 and beyond, in particular the Criminal Procedure Simplification project, and plans to shift to electronic operating for courts. Further, the Courts (Remote Participation) Bill, which was introduced to the House on 8 December, will allow the expanded use of audio visual links in criminal proceedings
