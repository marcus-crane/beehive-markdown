The Education (Polytechnics) Amendment Bill passed today will improve the performance of polytechnics, says Tertiary Education Minister Anne Tolley.

"This Government is striving for a world-leading education system that equips all New Zealanders with the knowledge, skills and values to be successful in the 21st century," says Mrs Tolley.

"High quality polytechnics are a vital part of this, and the Government is determined to lift their performance.

"The legislation passed today will enable polytechnics to create strong, effective councils, and allow the Crown to respond more effectively when polytechnics are not performing well."

New eight-member councils for all polytechnics will be in place by 1 May 2010. Four members on each council will be appointed by the Minister for Tertiary Education and four by the polytechnic.

"This gives polytechnics the ability to form councils that meet the needs of their communities.

"Suggestions by opponents of the Bill that it removes guaranteed Maori representation are wrong. There has not been a requirement in the Education Act 1989 for the appointment of Maori to councils. 

"This Bill has in fact strengthened Maori representation. The legislation states that it is desirable in principle for a council to have Maori representation.

"I would like to thank all those on polytechnic councils who are working to implement these changes."
