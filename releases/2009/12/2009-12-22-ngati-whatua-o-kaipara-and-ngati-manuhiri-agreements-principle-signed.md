The Crown will sign separate Agreements in Principle with Ngāti Whātua o Kaipara and Ngāti Manuhiri in Auckland today, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson announced.

Mr Finlayson said it was a great achievement and marked a good start in progressing settlement of all claims within Kaipara, Tāmaki Makaurau, and Hauraki.

 "These signings create a platform of goodwill for other iwi within the region to reach agreements with the Crown," Mr Finlayson said.  "I hope to have further positive announcements to make early in the New Year."

"The region between the Kaipara and Hauraki, including Tāmaki Makaurau, is a complex and important one for Treaty settlements with many claimant groups, and the signing of these offers show that we are making real progress in the area."

Both Agreements in Principle outline broad settlement packages which include cultural, historical and commercial redress to settle the historical Treaty claims of the iwi.

The Ngāti Whātua o Kaipara agreement includes a $22.1 million quantum and the offer to transfer Woodhill Forest with accumulated rentals from the Crown Forest Licence. Ngāti Whātua o Kaipara has about 6,000 members and its area covers five marae in the south Kaipara area.

The Crown has also offered other land, properties and further cultural redress to recognise the grievances of Ngāti Whātua o Kaipara. This includes part of the 10 acre block in Helensville, gifted to the Crown in 1864, but some of which is now no longer used for the purpose intended. 

Ngāti Manuhiri's agreement in principle includes redress of $9 million, and an offer to transfer South Mangawhai Forest subject to covenants . The iwi has about 1250 members. Its area is based around the eastern coast of North Auckland and Mangawhai to Whangaparoa.

"Cultural redress for both these iwi is particularly important and in the case of Ngāti Manuhiri the Crown wishes to recognise the cultural and spiritual significance of Little Barrier Island to the iwi," Mr Finlayson said.  In 1895, the Crown passed legislation to acquire the Island from those owners who had refused to sell it. The remaining residents were later evicted from the land.
