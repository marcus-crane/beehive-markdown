Education Minister Anne Tolley has welcomed the outcome of the judicial review at the High Court in Christchurch into the closure process for Aorangi School.

"The decision to close the school was not an easy one, but I was confident all along that a proper process had been followed and the judge has confirmed this," said Mrs Tolley.

"The main focus should now be on the students, and the Ministry of Education's change manager has assured me that all of the children will be placed in nearby schools for the start of Term 1 2010.

"The Ministry will continue to work with parents to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible for the students."

The Minister will be making no further comment on today's decision.
