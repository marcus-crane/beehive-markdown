The Community Response Fund is delivering more support to critical social services groups with nearly $11 million being rolled out in the latest funding round.

Paula Bennett, Minister for Social Development and Employment, today announced that $10.86 million has been granted to 184 community  organisations under severe financial pressure.

"This Government is committed to making sure that the groups providing vital community services can continue to respond and cope with the added demands from the public," Ms Bennett said.

"After two rounds of the Community Response Fund, $19.6 million has been provided to 344 organisations across the country and the third round is now open for applications.

"We know families and individuals are under pressure and so are many of the community groups that help them. This funding will help ease the financial strain these organisations are feeling and let them concentrate on helping people access the services they need, when they need them, in their own communities.''

Two of the 10 national organisations granted funding include the National Collective of Women's Refuges which received $818,000 while The Open Home Foundation of New Zealand received $750,000. Today's grant to Women's Refuge follows the $970,000 provided in round one.

The Community Response Fund was established in May to assist those groups providing vital social services during the economic downturn which are under severe financial strain or experiencing increased demand. Up to $104 million is being made available over two years.
