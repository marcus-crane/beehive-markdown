Young people in Auckland will have a chance to challenge themselves across a range of sports and activities thanks to the new Break-Away school holiday programme.

Paula Bennett, Minister for Social Development and Employment, today confirmed that 26 community organisations have been selected to run the 15,000 one-week placements for 11 to 17 year olds in the January and April school holidays.

Activities will range from rugby, league, soccer and boxing to hip hop dancing, arts,drama and games.  The programme is part of the Break-Away package of youthinitiatives announced by the Prime Minister in August.

"The school holiday programmes are an important part of the work this Government is doing to help young New Zealanders reach their potential,'' Ms Bennett said.

"The programmes, which are free, are mostly based in Auckland as they target families under pressure in high needs communities. Often these young people will not have the means or opportunity to participate in fun holiday programmes, now they do.

"Over time we will roll these programmes out to other parts of New Zealand increasing the placements to 30,000 from next year onwards,'' Ms Bennett said.

Besides Auckland, some school holiday programmes are also being run in East Coast and Northland. The Government has committed $10.5 million over four years to fund 15,000 one week places in the six months to June 2010 and then 30,000 more places each year after that.
