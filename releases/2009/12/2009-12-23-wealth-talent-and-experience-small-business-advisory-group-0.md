The nine people appointed to the new Small Business Advisory Group provide a wealth of talent and experience, Minister for Small Business Maurice Williamson says.

Announcing the appointment of the group today, Mr Williamson said its members came from a diverse range of sectors and regions, but the most important factor they had in common was hands-on experience in small business.

"Direct experience on the ground, and strong networks within the small business sector, were the most important things we were looking for," Mr Williamson said.

"We want to hear the advice of people in *real* small businesses, which can be very different from what big business, officials or academics are telling us."

Over 220 applications for the positions were received, and the following nine members have been appointed:

- **Graham Dockrill**, Canterbury, information technology and export
- **Rae Finlay**, Canterbury, events management
- **Jeannette Samundsen**, Hawke's Bay, food manufacturing and health services
- **Mark Duxfield**, Auckland, manufacturing
- **Nancy Beck**, Auckland, horticulture and export
- **Peter Clinton-Baker**, Nelson, tourism
- **Herani Demuth**, Wellington, education services
- **Bryan Nunweek**, Auckland, building services
- **Suzanne Hall,** Northland, health services and manufacturing

Members have been appointed for a term of three years from 1 January 2010. 

Mr Williamson acknowledged the work of the current group who will finish their term at the end of this year. "I have been very fortunate to have such an able group to advise me, particularly during recent economic times."

Mr Williamson said the Small Business Advisory Group would provide a business sector view on the development of policy relating to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and provide a deeper understanding of how the Government can work most effectively with SMEs.
