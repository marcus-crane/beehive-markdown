Health Minister Tony Ryall has announced that Mr Rea Wikaira is the new chair of the Alcohol Advisory Council (ALAC), and there are two new board members.

"Mr Wikaira is Chair of the Auckland Primary Health Organisation, and Executive Trustee of the Central Region Emergency Services Trust.

"He brings extensive management and governance experience to ALAC, including as a Director of Health Waikato and the Waikato DHB, and Chief Executive of the Auckland Westpac Rescue Helicopter Trust."

Also joining the Board is Dr Ian Miller, a registered psychologist who has worked for both the Justice Department and the New Zealand Police.

"Dr Miller has clinical expertise in the area of alcohol misuse and its harms, and understanding human motivations. He is also a member of the New Zealand Psychologists Board," Mr Ryall said.

"The third new Board member is Mrs Barbara Docherty, who has 25 years primary health care nursing experience at clinical, educational, policy, and research levels."

Mrs Docherty is the Director of Training and Development Services for the Brief Interventions for Harmful Behaviours Unit at the University of Auckland.

"I would like to thank the three members whose terms expire at the end of this year. In particular, Peter Glensor who has been chairing ALAC at this busy time," Mr Ryall said.
