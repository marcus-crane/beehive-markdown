Customs Minister, Maurice Williamson, today outlined the history of Customs services at Hamilton Airport.

"Air New Zealand operated its last regular scheduled international flight into Hamilton Airport on 21 April 2009."

"As Hamilton Airport did not indicate that any other service would be commencing in the medium term, Customs staff were redeployed or made redundant as from 22 April 2009.  This was at a considerable cost to the Government."

Mr Williamson says that at a press conference on 3 June 2009, Pacific Blue announced the commencement of flights between Australia and Hamilton Airport from 1 September 2009.

"This announcement meant that Hamilton Airport was going to start up as an international airport."

"Hamilton Airport is being treated exactly the same as all other airports that choose to start up international services."

"Customs is committed to facilitating such new services and commenced recruiting and training new staff to meet the commencement date."

"Customs has no budgeted funding to cover start up costs or ongoing operational costs at Hamilton Airport."

"Hamilton International Airport Limited was advised at the outset that Customs would be seeking to recover the costs of servicing international flights at the airport.  The details are still subject to ongoing discussions and work is continuing towards a settlement that will be acceptable to both parties."

"Customs has delivered, and will continue to deliver, passenger clearance services at Hamilton Airport."
