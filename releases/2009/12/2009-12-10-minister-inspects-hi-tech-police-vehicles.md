A range of hi-tech Police vehicles, which are being put into frontline service, will give Police the edge over criminals, Police Minister Judith Collins said.

Ms Collins today inspected the new vehicles at Special Projects Engineering Ltd at Trentham. The company builds specialist vehicles, including Army vehicles, Police vehicles and fire engines.

Ms Collins said she was impressed by the new vehicles which contain the latest electronics and communications equipment.

"These vehicles are a huge advance over Police vehicles of just a few years ago," Ms Collins said.

"With these vehicles Police officers will have a wealth of real-time information available with which to make better and faster decisions when responding to incidents and emergencies.

"It is important that Police have the latest tools to give them the edge over criminals and to ensure their own safety while serving the public.

"These vehicles demonstrate the Government's commitment to a Police service that is well resourced, well trained and well supported."

The vehicles inspected by the Minister included the latest Armed Offender Squad command vehicle - a self-contained command centre capable of being deployed anywhere. The vehicle is designed to be the control point for AOS and emergency operations.

Ms Collins also inspected a NZ Police concept car - a research and development vehicle where new concepts are trialled. The car was fitted with a mobile data screen, in-car video and real-time automatic vehicle location.

Other vehicles unveiled included the latest versions of prisoner transport vans, team policing vans, new speed camera vans and a new utility-based dog wagon.
