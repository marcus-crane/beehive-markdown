Courts will be able to make greater use of video links in criminal proceedings under the Courts (Remote Participation) Bill which was introduced to Parliament today by Justice Minister Simon Power.

Greater use of video links in courts will:

- Improve court efficiency.
- Increase safety and security.
- Increase access to justice.
- Improve the quality of evidence heard in our courtrooms.

"This is one of the first steps to be taken by the National-led Government to reform criminal procedure," Mr Power said. 

"We desperately need to increase the efficiency of our justice system.

"The law currently requires defendants to physically attend court for many minor procedural hearings, but witness testimony is already often heard by video link.

"This legislation will allow defendants, witnesses, counsel, and even judges and juries to appear in court by video link."

The bill will:

- Set out criteria on the use of video links. The criteria will protect the rights of all participants, including defendants and witnesses.
- Allow a judicial officer or registrar to require any participant to appear by video link in a criminal procedural matter, provided the criteria are satisfied.
- Allow the use of video links in criminal substantive matters (where evidence is being presented) on the application of any party.
- Allow the use of video links in civil matters where the parties consent, or, where there is disagreement between the parties, on the application of any party or as decided by the judicial officer.

The ordinary rules of court procedure, with any necessary modifications, apply to any proceeding in which a participant is appearing by video link.
