Musical Island Boys latest CD *Once Upon A Time* was launched last night in Wellington by Georgina te Heuheu, Minister of Pacific Island Affairs and Associate Minister of Māori Affairs.

The release followed a string of exceptional performance milestones in what is comparatively speaking, still a youthful career for the four-strong barbershop quartet.

The Minister said few people would disagree that when talented and determined young people were supported by their whānau - they thrived.

"It is at home and school, initially, where conditions for success are created.

"In the case of the *Musical Island Boys* you were clearly raised in homes and families that nurtured your creativity.

"With their love and support, you have excelled in music generally."

The Musical Island Boys barbershop achievements in Aotearoa and in the United States were simply staggering, she said.

"It is a precise and exacting musical genre with rigorous competition standards.

"I am sure each and every member of your various families is brimming with pride for your achievements to date; which are quite remarkable for ones so young."

The quartet was born in 2000 and their competition careers began when **Jeff**, **Lusa**, **Will** and **Matt** won Gold at the 2002 Secondary Schools Regional competition. This was the first of 56 Gold Medals from 14 competitions.

Just two years after that first Gold medal win; they entered the international arena taking third place in 2004 in the country that gave birth to the barbershop style.

Two years later the boys went on to win a Gold medal at the International Collegiate Quartet Competition in Indianapolis-the first time a non-American quartet has won an international barbershop title.

Just this year, in June, their most recent international achievement was at the International Open Men's competition in California - one of the toughest barbershop singing competitions in the world.

It was their first entry into that competition and their performances in the finals earned them 10th place.

"This win places them in the top 10 in the world. This is a great coup for New Zealand," Mrs te Heuheu said.

"As young, confident Polynesian men, they also strive to provide strong leadership for young people in Aotearoa.

"It came as no surprise to me to learn of their hope that their success is a story that might inspire others, not just in the barbershop style or music, but in any area."
