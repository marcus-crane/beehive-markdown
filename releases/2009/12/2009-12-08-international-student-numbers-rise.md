The number of international students coming to New Zealand is increasing, Education Minister Anne Tolley announced today.

"There was a steady decline in the number of international students in New Zealand from 2003 to 2008. These latest figures show we have reversed this trend," said Mrs Tolley.

This year there were 76,562 fee-paying international students in New Zealand compared with 72,540 last year - an increase of more than 4000 students.

"Education is one of our top three service exports. Last year it contributed $2.1 billion to our economy, supported more than 32,000 jobs, and provided our education institutions with nearly $600 million in fees.

"The fact that more international students are choosing New Zealand as a study destination is great news."

The latest figures can be found on the Education Counts website: [http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/statistics/export\_education\_levy\_statistics/august-2003-2009](http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/statistics/export_education_levy_statistics/august-2003-2009)

Figures are based on the number of fee-paying international students who started a course of study in the period 1 January to 31 August each year.
