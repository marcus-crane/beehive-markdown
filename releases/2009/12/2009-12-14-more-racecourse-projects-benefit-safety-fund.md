The Minister for Racing John Carter today announced that 29 projects to enhance safety at New Zealand racecourses would receive grants totalling almost $525,000 from the Racing Safety Development Fund.

This contestable Fund provides around $1 million per annum to match dollar-for-dollar contributions from racing clubs for projects that enhance the safety and therefore raise the quality and standard of racecourse facilities.

"This year's first funding round has addressed a wide range of projects from horse containment fencing and safety running rails, to new stabling areas and tie up stalls."

"All of the successful projects will contribute to the improved safety of racecourses and racecourse facilities for industry participants."

"In accepting the Government's lead, there have already been a number of clubs that have shown they are willing to match the Government's financial contribution and put in place projects to upgrade the standard of facilities at racing venues.  Congratulations to the successful clubs that have benefited from the fund to date", Mr Carter said.

Application forms for the next funding round will be sent to all racing clubs by 1 February 2010.  Applications will close on 31 March 2010.

"I would encourage all racing clubs and the racing code bodies to look seriously, and review health and safety at their racecourses, and to apply to the Fund where there are any issues to be addressed" the Minister concluded.
