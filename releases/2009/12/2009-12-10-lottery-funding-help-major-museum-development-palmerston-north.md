Internal Affairs Minister Nathan Guy has announced today a grant of $500,000 from the Lottery Environment and Heritage committee to help develop Palmerston North's Te Manawa Museum and incorporate the New Zealand Rugby Museum.

The funding will help enable a major redevelopment project, involving internal and external changes to the existing buildings and the addition of new galleries and storage space.

"This is a great boost to the region and will be an added attraction for visitors during the 2011 Rugby World Cup, when Palmerston North will host two games," said Mr Guy.

"It will enable the New Zealand Rugby Museum to move from its current sub-standard premises into a gallery within Te Manawa Museum, increasing its exposure and visitor numbers.

"It will become one of the many iconic features in the wider Manawatu region and capture our proud history as a rugby nation."

Lottery Environment and Heritage committee makes grants for projects that promote, protect and conserve New Zealand's natural, physical and cultural heritage.

In total, $178 million will be distributed amongst the community this year by the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board. For more information on Lottery grants see [www.dia.govt.nz](http://www.dia.govt.nz%20/) or [www.cdgo.govt.nz.](http://www.cdgo.govt.nz./)
