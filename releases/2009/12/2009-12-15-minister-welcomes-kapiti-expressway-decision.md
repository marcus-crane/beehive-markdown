Transport Minister Steven Joyce has welcomed the announcement of the NZ Transport Agency's preferred corridor for the upgrade of State Highway 1 along the Kapiti Coast.

He says the decision to progress the Sandhills Expressway will bring long-awaited certainty for local communities and advances plans for the development of a long-term corridor for State Highway 1 through the district.

"As part of our commitment to the corridor as a road of National Significance, we are looking to see an accelerated upgrade to that highway to improve safety and reduce journey times.

"Earlier this year I called for a strategic plan for this section of State Highway 1 as I was concerned about a lack of coordinated future planning in the area.

"It was important to have a discussion with the community and settle on a permanent alignment for the highway before construction work commenced on other local projects that would have reduced the viable options."

The Sandhills option will see the State Highway expressway built along the currently designated western link route, with the current state highway becoming a local road through the district. 

Mr Joyce says this will preserve the townships of both Waikanae and Paraparaumu and will ensure local railway stations continue to be easily accessible for local rail commuters.

The Sandhills Expressway is expected to be built for between $380 and $500 million, with a much smaller number of properties (20 - 50) affected than would have been the case with either of the two other corridor options considered and consulted on publicly.

"It's good to now have a long-term strategic plan for the future of State Highway 1 through the district and serving the entire lower North Island," says Mr Joyce.

"I thank the community for their patience and involvement in the consultation process.  Now that decisions have been made, I look forward to work beginning as quickly as possible to improve roading on the coast."
