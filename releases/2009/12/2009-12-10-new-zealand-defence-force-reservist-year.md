Associate Minister of Defence Heather Roy will this weekend announce the inaugural New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) Reservist of the Year at a special award ceremony in Wellington.

"This new award is recognition of the contribution made by Reserves to the NZDF," Mrs Roy said.

"Reserves are part-time military personnel who have made important contributions both at home and abroad - having deployed to Timor Leste, Solomon Islands, South Korea, the Middle East, Bosnia, Sinai, Cambodia, Sudan, Bougainville, Iraq and Afghanistan,"  
   
"The Reservist of the Year will be selected following a series of military tasks - including driving, weapons-handling, first aid and physical fitness - at Trentham Military Camp on Saturday afternoon.  Candidates are also required to give a speech at Defence House during the evening.

"Reservists are New Zealanders who, in addition to their full-time jobs, volunteer to do their bit for our security and freedom.  This new award is fitting recognition of that," Mrs Roy said.

***The inaugural NZDF Reservist of the Year Award ceremony will follow a day of military drills and challenges.  All media are invited to attend these events at Trentham Military Camp, Upper Hutt; 1pm-4pm, Saturday December 12 2009.***

***Note: Due to security requirements media wishing to attend the competition need to register their interest with Lieutenant Jeremy Seed, no later than 4pm Friday on 021-0233-2663.***
