Revenue Minister Peter Dunne is delighted that the Public Service is getting behind the new payroll giving scheme that offers staff the chance to donate to charities.

The new scheme takes effect from 7 January next year. Employers simply deduct any donations from workers' pay, reduce their PAYE tax by the appropriate tax credit, and send donations to the chosen organisations.

He said the scheme was purely voluntary and was "about social conscience at the levels of both employees and employers".

"I'm delighted to hear from State Services Minister Tony Ryall that the State Services Commissioner will be contacting all Public Service heads to promote the scheme.

"I'd really encourage employers - be they in the public sector or private - to offer this initiative as it provides a simple and easy way for their staff to give to a chosen charity or cause," Mr Dunne said.

He said the new scheme was convenient for workers who will get the tax credit when they make the donation rather than at the end of the tax year, and it was low cost and effective for charities.

The scheme will be available to all employers who file their employer monthly schedules electronically.
