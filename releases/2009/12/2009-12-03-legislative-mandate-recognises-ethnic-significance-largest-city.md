Direct ethnic participation in the affairs of Auckland received a boost today with the announcement of a legislative mandate for an Ethnic Advisory Panel to be established under the new Auckland local governance structure, says Ethnic Affairs Minister Pansy Wong

"As Minister for Ethnic Affairs, I have strongly lobbied for greater participation of ethnic communities into decisions that affect the economic, cultural and social well-being in New Zealand's largest city."

"The panel will ensure that ethnic Aucklanders, who represent 20 per cent of the city's population, can participate directly in Auckland's decision making processes," says Mrs Wong.

She says that ethnic communities are already making a strong contribution to the local Auckland economic initiatives and are contributing through trans-national trade connections; entrepreneurialism and suburban development. "It's important that ethnic communities move beyond being heard. Their input and ideas, expressed through this panel, will ensure that the new Auckland city is culturally and economically enriched by their contribution. 

"We are already seeing some of the benefits that ethnic communities are bringing to Auckland through the economic contribution they make through their local and international connections. The establishment of the Ethnic Advisory Panel provides the opportunity to harness and develop the rich potential within Auckland," says Mrs Wong.

The proposal for the panel will be considered by the Auckland Governance Select Committee.  "I encourage ethnic communities to seize the opportunity and to make submissions to the Select Committee."
