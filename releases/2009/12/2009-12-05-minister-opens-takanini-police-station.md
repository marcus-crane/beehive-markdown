Takanini's new Police Station is a great example of how Police and the community can work together to reduce crime, Police Minister Judith Collins said.

Ms Collins joined Police and the Takanini community at the opening of the station today.

Initially the station will be the base for Constable P.J McNab, the Takanini Community Constable. Next year, he will be joined by a six-strong neighbourhood community support team which will significantly boost the permanent Police presence in the area.

"Few things deter crime like a healthy Police presence. This station and the officers that serve in it will send a strong signal that this community is serious about making Takanini a safer and better place to live," Ms Collins said.

"This station was made possible by the generosity of the local community and a Police service that now has enough officers to substantially increase its commitment to this community."

Increasing the number of frontline police in South Auckland was a major policy priority for the Government. It promised to put an extra 300 officers into Counties-Manukau by the end of 2010. Already more than 165 extra officers are working in the district.

The ratio of Police officers to people in Counties-Manukau has increased from 193 per 100,000 in June 2008, to 205 per 100,000 population in June 09 and 224 per 100,000 population at 30 November 2009.

The idea for the new station arose from a public meeting in August to discuss law and order in the area.

Local businesses have donated items to the new station which occupies an existing building at 16A Princess Street, Takanini.

Ms Collins thanked those who had made the new centre possible, including Counties-Manukau District Commander Mike Bush and Papakura Mayor Calum Penrose.
