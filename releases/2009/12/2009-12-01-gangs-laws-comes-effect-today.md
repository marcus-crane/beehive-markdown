Laws that reduce the influence of gangs in organised crime and in the manufacture and spread of methamphetamine came into effect today.

Under the laws:

- Police have expanded surveillance powers which enable them to apply for an interception warrant to investigate participation in an organised criminal group, and for a wider range of serious violent offences.
- The maximum penalty for participation in an organised criminal group is doubled, from five to 10 years' imprisonment.
- Participation in an organised criminal group is now an aggravating factor at sentencing.
- Police and territorial authorities can seek a removal order against gang structures that are intimidating in nature.

The laws are contained in the Crimes Amendment Act, the Local Government Amendment Act, and the Sentencing Amendment Act (No 2), which were formed out of the Gangs and Organised Crime Bill.

Justice Minister Simon Power says the changes are an important step toward increasing the range and effectiveness of tools available to police for investigating and disrupting organised criminal activity, and prosecuting those involved.

"Not only do gangs cost the economy in economic, social, and health terms, they are a source of unacceptable victimisation, intimidation, and harm to members of the community.

"Gangs and organised criminal groups are heavily involved in violent, drug-related, and property crime. A significant proportion of the importation, manufacture, and supply of illicit drugs can be attributed to organised criminal groups.

"Getting tough on gangs is part of the Government's priority to improve public safety.

"The combined effect of these tools means police are much better equipped to safeguard public safety by combating the insidious problem of gangs and organised criminal activity."
