Police Minister Judith Collins today honoured outstanding achievements of Police staff in the Auckland City District and presented awards to members of the public who went the extra mile to help Police.

The Minister joined Police officers, their families and friends at the district's medal and awards ceremony.

She presented medals for long service and good conduct, the District Commander's Commendation, the Commissioner's Commendation and Silver Merit Award for Police.

"New Zealanders rely, without question, on the professionalism, skill and courage of our Police to protect us and uphold the rule of law," Ms Collins said.

"As we see in the newspapers every day, they rise to that challenge with authority, professionalism and good humour for which we all owe them a debt of gratitude.

"Our Police are without a doubt among the finest in the world. And we are very fortunate that some of the finest of the finest are with us here today."

Ms Collins also paid tribute to the members of the public who received the District Commander's Certificate of Appreciation.

"The Police rely on the support and assistance of the public to be their eyes and ears, to provide support for crime-prevention programmes and to provide services that ensure the smooth running of the police.

"Occasionally, members of the public go the extra mile - be that through extraordinary acts of selflessness and courage or many years of work to assist the Police and enhance community safety."
