Tariana Turia today announced the launch of the Government's latest campaign against family violence.

The television, radio and print campaign is part of *E Tu Whanau Ora Programme of Action* - the Maori family violence strategy which Mrs Turia launched in August.

"Keeping whanau safe, strong and free from violence is the aim of the strategy and I am looking forward to the latest campaign which will centre around aroha," Mrs Turia said.

The *It's Not Okay* television campaign laid the groundwork in getting the message out there. Police have attributed it as having a major role to play in the rise of reports in domestic violence incidents, Mrs Turia said.

"It's one thing to say enough is enough to violence but it's quite another to know what to do about it. *E Tu Whanau Ora* helps to make the transformation possible by sending out a number of messages aimed at the importance and benefits of loving, caring and being with whanau.

"I truly believe that if a person really loves and cares about their whanau then they will not harm them."

After wide ranging hui with community members, six core themes for the campaign have been developed:

- Aroha - expression of love/feeling loved
- Whanaungatanga - it's about whanau, being together, doing things together
- Korero, awhi - open communication, being supportive
- Mana, manaakitanga - uphold people's dignity/giving of yourself to others
- Whakapapa - knowing who we are
- Tikanga - doing things the right way according to our values

The Aroha in Action campaign will consist of:

- A resource book written especially for whanau,
- Advertisements on Health TV which has an estimated Maori audience of 46,606;
- Advertisements on iwi radio which an estimated 52% of the Maori population listen to; and
- Advertisements in Mana Magazine.
