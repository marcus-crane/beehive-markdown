This week's meeting on managing tourist shipping in Antarctic waters must find ways to prevent a humanitarian or environmental disaster happening there, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.

The three-day meeting which starts in Wellington tomorrow has attracted experts and delegates from Antarctic Treaty countries, and organisations with a direct interest in Antarctica and Antarctic tourism.

"Considering Antarctica's harsh conditions and remoteness, the Antarctic ship-borne tourism industry is currently inadequately regulated," Mr McCully said.

"The sinking of the tourist vessel *Explorer* off the Antarctic Peninsula in 2007 was a wake-up call, but it is not an isolated incident.  Four vessels have gone aground on the continent in the last three years, and the fact that nobody lost their life in those incidents owes more to good luck than good management.

"Because of the demand for cruises, shipping companies have been putting up larger vessels which are not suitable for the conditions they encounter.

"Some carry up to 5000 people, and even with the best efforts of all concerned, it is hard to see how that number of people could be rescued if an emergency occurred.

"The environmental impact from a vessel spilling fuel after going aground or sinking is also unthinkable.

"We currently have legislation before Parliament that will make those operating in the Antarctic, including tour companies, liable should such a catastrophe occur.

"However preventing a tourist vessel disaster from ever occurring there remains paramount, and I urge participants at this week's meeting to come up with workable recommendations to ensure that is the case," Mr McCully said.
