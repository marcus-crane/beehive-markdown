Internal Affairs Minister Nathan Guy has launched a new identity verification service (IVS) allowing people to access more government services online.

The igovt ID lets customers order certificates or printouts of recent birth, death, marriage and civil union records online, avoiding the hassle of having to prove their identity in person for every transaction.

"This is another significant step towards online access to a range of government services. It will assist people researching their family history and much more.

"Once customers have registered in person with the Department, this is a secure and convenient way of proving who you are over the internet."

Mr Guy has signed up for the free service himself this morning at the Department of Internal Affairs mobile office using his passport and cellphone.

"I signed up and got myself a username and password. It's straightforward and I can see that it will save time for people who regularly seek this information.

"The government wants innovations in the public service like this to improve front line services.

"This initiative puts New Zealand at the forefront of international efforts in designing secure identity verification services."
