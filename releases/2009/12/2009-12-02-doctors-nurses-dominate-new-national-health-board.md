Seven of the ten new National Health Board (NHB) members announced today are doctors and nurses says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

"We need much greater clinical leadership in the public health service as well as a sharper national focus on District Health Boards and the Ministry of Health working together."

"That is why we've ensured there is a strong clinical leadership on the new board as well as financial and health management expertise" says Mr Ryall.

"This Board will be very influential in how New Zealand's health services will develop into the future."

Establishing a National Health Board was announced recently as part of a drive to improve frontline health services and better supervise the $10 billion of public health funding the 21 DHBs spend on hospitals and primary health care.

"We need to stop the 21 District Health Boards reinventing the wheel 21 times" says Mr Ryall. "We need to get public health services working as one system, and the NHB is a part of that."

The new NHB, working within the Ministry of Health, will consolidate national planning and funding of all IT, workforce planning and capital investment. It will also take national responsibility for vulnerable health services such as paediatric oncology.

"Placing our doctors and nurses at the centre of how we deliver health services is crucial to lifting performance of the public health service. The new NHB contains very strong clinical, financial and health management expertise."
