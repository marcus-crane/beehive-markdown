Fisheries Minister Phil Heatley today announced his decision on management measures for the 2009-10 Auckland Islands squid trawl fishery (SQU6T).  This includes setting a fishing related mortality limit (FRML) for sea lions that may be accidentally caught by fishing trawlers. 

The maximum number of accidental fishing related sea lion deaths for the 2010 fishing season will be set at 76 sea lions.

Last year the limit was set at 113 but was then voluntarily reduced to 95 by the fishing industry after the latest research showing a decrease in sea lion pup numbers became available.

"I was very mindful of the recent and significant decline in the number of sea lion pups and I have taken a particularly cautious approach and set a much lower limit than last year" Mr Heatley said.

"This is always a hard decision to make; I have to balance the need to protect our native sea lions with my obligation under the Fisheries Act to allow for fishing of the squid resource around the Auckland Islands" said Mr Heatley.

For the year to October squid fisheries bought in $73 million in export revenues for the country.

"I carefully considered the best scientific and management information available as well as submissions from the fishing industry, environmental groups and the public before making my decision. I believe my decision is cautious and will allow for squid fishing while ensuring this fishing activity does not impact the long term future of the sea lion population."

The squid fishing industry voluntarily uses sea lion exclusion devices (SLEDS), which allow sea lions to escape from trawl nets. There is research currently underway to improve the information on how effective SLEDs are at allowing sea lions to escape from nets.

"I want to have the best information I can get on how effective the SLEDs are. I expect this research to be completed in time for it to be part of the decision process for the 2010/11 squid season.  I am determined to make future decisions with this important science considered" Mr Heatley said.

Before the squid fleet leave port their SLEDs will be audited to ensure they are installed correctly and meet the required standard. In addition, SLEDs will be regularly checked by Ministry of Fisheries observers and Fishery Officers throughout the season to ensure they are being used correctly.

Last fishing season four sea lions were reported as accidentally killed last year, two on trawlers carrying Ministry of Fisheries observers and two on trawlers not carrying observers.

"I would like to thank the squid fishing industry for their continuing co-operation with government and ongoing efforts to improve the fleet's performance against the operational plan" said Mr Heatley.

### Background

New Zealand sea lions, amongst other things, eat squid, which aggregate in large numbers in the deep waters surrounding the sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands. They are at risk of being accidentally caught and drowned when they follow squid into trawl nets. The SQU6T fishery operates between February and May each year or until the sea lion fishing related mortality limit is reached.

The mortality limit is calculated using a scientific model developed specifically for the New Zealand sea lion population and uses the latest available information on the sea lion population and pup numbers.

The New Zealand sea lion, formerly known as the Hooker's sea lion, is classified as threatened under the Marine Mammals Protection Act.  This means it is not immediately threatened with extinction but is potentially vulnerable to population decline. Its status is largely driven by the fact that it primarily breeds in one place - the Auckland Islands.

Arrow squid is one of New Zealand's largest and most valuable fish exports. Arrow squid live for one year and die shortly after spawning. Their population varies widely from year to year, based on hatching success and the numbers of juvenile squid reaching maturity, which is in turn primarily influenced by natural conditions. As a result the catch can be highly variable from season to season.

The sea lion mortality limit is monitored by keeping track of fishing effort, which has an assumed level of sea lion mortality. Therefore the fishery is not closed when 76 actual sea lions have been observed to be killed but when there has been sufficient fishing activity so that 76 sea lions are assumed to have been killed.

For the coming season the Minister has set a ‘strike rate' of 5.65%. This means that for every 100 trawl ‘tows' carried out by a fishing vessel in the SQU6T fishery, where a SLED is not being used, 5.65 sea lions are presumed to have been killed and counted against the sea lion limit.

Strike rate is used to access performance against the FRML, because it is not possible to record the total number of captures as SLEDs permit sea lions to escape after they enter the trawl net.

Squid fishing vessel operators who use an approved SLED and meet all the requirements of the sea lion operational plan are permitted a discount on this strike rate. This reflects the increase likelihood that sea lions will escape from trawl nets fitted with SLEDs and survive. For the coming season the Minister has permitted a 35% discount on the strike rate. This means that for every 100 tows, when the vessel uses an approved SLED, 3.67 sea lions are presumed to have been killed and counted against the limit.
