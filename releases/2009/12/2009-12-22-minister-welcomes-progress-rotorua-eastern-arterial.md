Minister of Transport Hon Steven Joyce has welcomed the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) decision to approve funding for the investigation work on the new Rotorua Eastern Arterial.

"This is the first step in easing traffic congestion through this important corridor," says Mr Joyce.

"I am very pleased the hard work of Rotorua MP Todd McClay, the NZTA, and the local council has finally got this project off the ground after many years of waiting," says Mr Joyce.

The Rotorua Eastern Arterial project provides a six kilometre bypass of State Highway 30 to promote economic growth, aid urban development and improve safety. In addition it provides an important link between the city of Rotorua and key infrastructure including Rotorua International Airport, the Port of Tauranga and the wider Bay of Plenty region.

"The Government is committed to lifting productivity, creating jobs and helping get our goods to market faster. Strong investment in our state highways and the completion of projects such as this will help deliver on these priorities," says Mr Joyce.
