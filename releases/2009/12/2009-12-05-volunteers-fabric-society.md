The Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector Tariana Turia would like to acknowledge all volunteers in New Zealand today - International Volunteer Day.

"Every Saturday, many people are out volunteering by sharing their work skills to build homes, coaching sports and kapa haka, teaching children to read, dance and sing or transporting and caring for older New Zealanders," said Minister Turia.

More than 1.2 million New Zealanders are actively involved in voluntary work, generously contributing over $3.3 billion worth of free labour annually to our communities.

"The very fabric of New Zealand, socially and economically, needs these committed individuals and volunteer organisations. Recent research shows that support for community organisations is stable," said Minister Turia.

*How do New Zealanders give? 2008 Update* found that around three quarters of New Zealanders surveyed in 2008 either volunteered, made donations or gave in others ways, such as purchasing products, in the previous year. This is the same result as the previous survey in 2007.

The percentage of people volunteering and those making committed donations also remained stable, at around one third of New Zealanders.

The research indicates that while existing donors and volunteers are spreading their time and money more widely, the overall pool of "givers" is not growing.

"Giving and volunteering are crucial for strong communities and I encourage all New Zealanders to get actively involved this weekend, said Minster Turia.

Many organisations are planning lunches and activities for the day, so keep an eye on your local media.

*How do New Zealanders give? 2008 Update* is based on data collected through Nielsen Media Research's Panorama survey, which asks 12,000 people annually about how they support their communities.
