Fisheries Minister Phil Heatley today welcomed the graduation of nine new full-time Fishery Officers following completion of their studies at the National Police College in Porirua.

"National campaigned on significantly bolstering fisheries officer numbers and I'm very proud to welcome these new recruits to the force," Mr Heatley said.

The 2009 Budget included $4.2 million over four years to boost full-time fishery officer numbers from 95 to 104 and the honorary fishery officer network from 172 to 250.

The full-time officer graduates and the areas they will be working in are Jon Kerse, Anna Willison and Craig Wright (North Harbour), Tahinganui Hina and Maki Strickland (Manukau), Taroi Rawiri (Waikato/ Bay of Plenty), Ray Dever and Tokanui Ihaka (Poverty Bay) and Anna Spencer (Wellington).

"Also currently training are 20 Honorary Fishery Officers, who upon graduation will take up duties throughout the North Island," Mr Heatley said.

The 20 Honorary Fishery Officers are currently attached to Kaitaia (5), Auckland (6), Opotiki (1), Hamilton (2) and Wellington (6).  The next intake of honorary trainees will be dispatched to other areas around the country.

"The compliance team at the Ministry of Fisheries has been doing a great job over the past year, with a number of notable busts for illegal behaviour.

"I know they'll welcome the helping hand these new officers will provide in educating the public about sustainable fishing practices and enforcing compliance of fisheries regulations.

"A key aspect of the Fisheries 2030 goal and plan of action is to optimise the level of voluntary compliance with fisheries laws and standards, and maintain an effective deterrence against illegal activity.  These new officers will help achieve that," Mr Heatley said.
