Transport Minister Steven Joyce says he is pleased with the steady progress the NZ Transport Agency is making towards completing Auckland's Western Ring Route which has been identified as a Road of National Significance.

The NZTA Board has now confirmed the final alignment for State Highway 20 from Mt Roskill to the Northwestern Motorway.  This alignment will see a total of 160 fewer properties affected than was previously thought to be the case.

Mr Joyce says he feels for the owners of all affected properties but is pleased that the community now has more certainty about what will be happening where.

"There were no easy options here but I believe this fine-tuning of the alignment goes further towards easing the concerns of many, while being cost-effective for New Zealand.

"The completion of the route is essential to the continued growth and economic development in the Auckland region.

"It will also contribute to better links for business and freight between key industrial hubs in the cities of Manukau, Auckland, Waitakere and North Shore.

"I am expecting the Western Ring Route to be delivered on budget and on time, with construction starting in mid-to-late 2011 and finishing in the 2015/16 financial year."

The Waterview Connection is part of one of the seven Roads of National Significance the government has singled out as essential routes that require priority treatment. It is the last link to complete the Western Ring Route, linking Manukau, Auckland, Waitakere and North Shore while bypassing State highway 1 and the Auckland Harbour Bridge.
