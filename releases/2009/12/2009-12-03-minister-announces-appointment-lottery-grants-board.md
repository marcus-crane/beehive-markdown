Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy has announced the appointment of Tina Wehipeihana-Wilson to the Lottery Grants Board.

"Ms Wehipeihana-Wilson has a wide range of business and community experience that will be a real asset to the work of the Board," says Mr Guy.

"She has been a financial mentor for Māori organisations and widely involved in her local community."

Based in Taupo, Ms Wehipeihana-Wilson is the Managing Director of Tem Corporation Aotearoa Ltd which provides accounting and business management services to small to medium sized Māori organisations.

She is also a current member of two audit and risk committees and an asset holding company, and has governance experience as a member of the Career Services Board. She has strong financial skills and a Bachelor of Business Studies in Accounting. 

The Lottery Grants Board exists to distribute the profits of New Zealand lotteries, from activities such as Lotto, Lotto Strike, Instant Kiwi and Keno. Its primary function is to determine the proportions of lotteries' profits to be allocated to the various distribution committees and agencies.

Ms Wehipeihana-Wilson has been appointed to fill a vacancy created by the resignation of Margaret Mohi and is appointed for the remainder of that term, commencing on 7 December 2009 and expiring on 31 January 2011.
