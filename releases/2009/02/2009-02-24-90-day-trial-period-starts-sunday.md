Workers will have the opportunity to seek employment on a trial basis of up to 90 days from this Sunday, March 1.

The new legislation will be a real boost for people on the margins of the workforce who simply need an employer to give them a chance in a new job, Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson says.

“The 90 day trial period is part of a package of initiatives this Government is undertaking to help both workers and businesses survive the recession.

 “In the current economic climate this will encourage small businesses to give a prospective employee a go without fear of costly and protracted legal proceedings if the relationship doesn’t work out,” Ms Wilkinson says.

“It must be remembered that a trial period is voluntary and can only be implemented if both the prospective employee and employer agree to it in writing.

“There are safety mechanisms to ensure that it is fair and balanced, including the preservation of good faith provisions – a win for both employer and employee.”

The Act only relates to personal grievances on the grounds of unjustified dismissal. It retains other rights so that the employees still have the right to protections against discrimination, sexual and racial harassment, duress or unjustified action by the employer that disadvantages the employee.

Those on the benefit who enter the workforce on a trial period have the added assurance they will not be subjected to a stand down period to go back on the benefit if their new job does not work out.

The Department of Labour has updated its online Employment Agreement Builder to help employers develop employment agreements with new staff.

It can be reached through the employment relations section of the Department’s website - [http://www.ers.dol.govt.nz/](http://www.ers.dol.govt.nz/).
