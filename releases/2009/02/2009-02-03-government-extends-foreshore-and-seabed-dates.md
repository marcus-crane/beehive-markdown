Attorney-General Chris Finlayson announced today that the Crown has agreed with representatives of nga hapu o Ngati Porou to extend the timeframe for court documents to be filed under Nga Hapu o Ngati Porou Foreshore and Seabed Deed of Agreement, which relates to parts of the foreshore and seabed on the East Coast.

"The time for nga hapu o Ngati Porou to apply in the High Court for recognition of territorial customary rights, and for the Crown to file affidavits in support of their application, has been extended," said Mr Finlayson.

The extension was sought by Ngati Porou to give the hapu an opportunity to consider the Terms of Reference for the review of the Foreshore and Seabed Act. The government has committed to undertake a review of the Foreshore and Seabed Act as part of the National Party's Relationship and Confidence and Supply Agreement with the Maori Party.

"This will also allow more time for ministers in the new government to become familiar with the proposed areas before finalising and filing Crown documents" said Mr Finlayson.

The Deed of Agreement originally named 31 January as the deadline for filing the application to begin the process. The parties agreed the new date for filing will be 30 April 2009.
