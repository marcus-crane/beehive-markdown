The New Zealand Government is providing strong support for the candidacy of Helen Clark for the position of Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Prime Minister John Key confirmed today.

"Helen Clark's application for this senior position in the United Nations system has the full and formal endorsement of the New Zealand Government," Mr Key says.

"Helen Clark has shown the leadership qualities needed for a complex organisation such as UNDP in these difficult times. The Government believes she would do an excellent job of running UNDP and leading the United Nations' development efforts.

"I am delighted that New Zealand has a candidate of the calibre of Helen Clark for this position. Her time as New Zealand Prime Minister established her credibility internationally, engaging with leaders from the developed and developing world alike.

"UNDP needs someone who can front for them, mobilise resources and represent the organisation effectively. Helen Clark is a very strong candidate," Mr Key says.

Mr Key has written to the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon directly to convey this message.

Leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum have also given their support to Helen Clark. Reaction from other United Nations member countries has been to universally welcome Helen Clark's interest, showing that she is considered a very serious contender.

There is a formal process ahead of shortlisting and interviews, driven by the United Nations Secretary General, and so some time to go before any final decisions. It is still too early to predict whether she would be successful.
