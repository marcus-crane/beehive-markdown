Prime Minister John Key today paid tribute to Green Party co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons, who has decided to step down from her leadership role after 14 years at the helm.

"Even though we have not always agreed on policy positions, I do respect the way Ms Fitzsimons has carried out her role with integrity and belief," Mr Key says.

"She has been a long-serving and effective leader for the Green Party, and only last week I enjoyed meeting with her and co-leader Russel Norman to discuss areas where we might be able to work together.

"I wish the Green Party well as they seek to replace a leader who certainly leaves big shoes to fill," Mr Key said.
