The Government's ReStart assistance package is already making a difference to nearly 800 New Zealand families, says the Minister for Social Development and Employment Paula Bennett.

ReStart was set up at the end of last year to help provide breathing space for those hardest hit by redundancy, and as of mid-February there were 771 people were receiving some form of ReStart assistance.

"The Government wanted to set up ReStart as soon as possible to target people who need the most help to get back on their feet after the shock of redundancy. We know there are tough times ahead for many Kiwi families, and ReStart is there to ease the financial pressure," Ms Bennett says.

ReStart is available to those who have been in work for at least six months, including the self-employed and people who have changed jobs or employers in that time. The assistance is available for 16 weeks or until they move into work.

The three ReStart components include ReCover - a payment for families with children who are no longer eligible for the In Work Tax Credit, RePlace - for those who qualify for the maximum Accommodation Supplement after being made redundant and ReConnect - which comprises employment and job services.

"We know there's been a lot of interest in the ReStart package, which is helping to ease the burden on many Kiwi families. For those who don't qualify for ReStart, other assistance is available from Work and Income."

"The Government wants to grow this economy and stave off the worst effects of the economic storm buffeting the world. We're focused on job creation. But when the realities of today's tougher financial times catch up to people, initiatives such as ReStart are there to help give them time to adjust to their new circumstances."
