The influence of gangs in organised crime and the manufacture and spread of methamphetamine will be severely reduced by a bill introduced to Parliament this evening by Justice Minister Simon Power.

The Gangs and Organised Crime Bill:

- Doubles the penalty for participation in a criminal gang to a maximum of 10 years’ imprisonment.
- Makes involvement in a criminal gang an aggravating factor in sentencing.
- Gives police authority to apply for interception warrants to investigate the offence of participation in a criminal gang, and lowers the threshold for offences that can be used as the basis for warrants, from those attracting 10 years in prison to those attracting seven years or more.
- Enables removal orders to be sought from a court to remove gang forts.

Mr Power said the bill was necessary because in nine years the Labour Government had done little to combat gangs.

"It wasn’t until Wanganui toddler Jhia Te Tua was shot in 2007 that Labour did anything, and even then it was very similar to plans already announced by John Key. Then it took them 11 months to introduce it to Parliament.

"No government can afford to get complacent when it comes to gangs, and this bill reflects how seriously this Government takes this issue.

"By doubling the sentence for participation in a gang we are reflecting the culpability of those gang leaders who organise the manufacture and distribution of methamphetamine, and we are addressing the low rate of successful convictions.

"Between 2004 and 2007, the average sentence for participating in a gang was just two years, and of 339 prosecutions there were only 19 convictions. That, along with making membership an aggravating factor at sentencing, should increase the penalties handed down.

"And by expanding the ability of police to undertake surveillance and by lowering the threshold for offences used as the basis for warrants, we are sending a message to gangs that the net on their criminal activities is widening.

"This Government believes gang forts are not only a threat to public safety because they cloak their illegal activity, but their very presence makes the neighbourhood feel less safe. This bill will give additional powers for such ‘intimidating’ structures to be removed.

"Gang activity is insidious, and so requires a comprehensive, integrated response. This bill is just one part of that response, providing more effective investigative powers and strengthening penalties.

"Although it is one of the first actions of this Government, it will not be our final action on gangs."
