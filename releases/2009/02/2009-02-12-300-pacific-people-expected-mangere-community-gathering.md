Three hundred people from Auckland’s seven main Pacific ethnicities are expected in Mangere tonight to meet Pacific Island Affairs Minister Georgina te Heuheu.

The meeting is a forerunner to a day-log Pacific fono in Wellington on 19 February to discuss ways of minimising the impact of the global economic recession on Pacific people.

The fono will also canvas a Pacific perspective for the Government’s job summit later in the month.

Mrs te Heuheu said the current global economic climate presents challenges for all New Zealanders including Pacific communities. 

Decreasing global demand for New Zealand products would have significant impact on the industries that employ Pacific people. Unemployment was likely to rise particularly for lower skilled workers in primary and manufacturing industries.   

"We need to lift the education and skill levels of Pacific people so they can take up broader employment opportunities."

Mrs te Heuheu said the Government was working quickly to find ways to stimulate the economy. 

"This week’s announcements on the minimum wage and infrastructure show that this National-led Government is listening to the community.  Both contain benefits for our Pacific Island community, who all too often are the buffer at the bottom of the social and economic statistics."

Mrs te Heuheu said she was committed to ensuring that Pacific communities were well served and that their needs were considered and addressed.  Input from tonight’s gathering would help that process.
