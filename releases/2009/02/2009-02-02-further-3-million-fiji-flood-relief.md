New Zealand is to give Fiji a $3 million flood recovery package, to be managed by the government's aid and development agency, NZAID, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.

"With the emergency response to the flooding in Fiji now largely over, the focus is turning to rehabilitation and recovery work," Mr McCully said.

"Most of the rescue centres have closed and the more than 100,000 people affected by the floods now face the task of rebuilding their lives and their local economies. 

"The New Zealand Flood Recovery Package will have a clear focus on reconstruction, providing social services, and helping to mitigate the impact of future disaster events in Fiji. 

"Economic recovery is essential to minimising any ongoing negative impact of the floods on the people of Fiji and New Zealand wishes to support this process.

"Fiji remains a close neighbour.  The contribution New Zealand is making here is further evidence of our concern to lend a helping hand to the people of Fiji.

"Our support will be channelled through local, regional and multilateral organisations working on the ground in Fiji.  There is also scope for partnering with other donor governments providing assistance. 

"No direct financial assistance will be provided to the Fiji interim government," Mr McCully said.

To date, New Zealand has provided $600,000 to support immediate disaster relief needs in Fiji, focussed largely on securing immediate food and water supplies for flood-affected people. A further $75,000 has been provided to support ongoing education for children in flood affected regions.
