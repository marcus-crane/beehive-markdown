Environment Minister Nick Smith today announced the start of a search for New Zealand's latest batch of environmental champions, calling for nominations for the 2009 Green Ribbon Awards.

"For nearly 20 years these awards have acknowledged and thanked New Zealanders who put their commitment to caring for our environment into action.

"Nominations are open to all individuals, businesses and community organisations. The 2009 nomination categories reflect the many different areas in which New Zealanders contribute to reducing the impacts we have on our environment.

"This includes a new category which has been added to the awards in recognition of New Zealand's successful hosting of World Environment Day in 2008. The award will honour an event or project which prompted action for the environment within the community on World Environment Day."

The nine categories this year are:

· Community action for the environment - young people

· Urban sustainability

· Community action for the environment - volunteers and not-for-profit organisations

· Sustainable land use

· Businesses making a difference

· Making a difference to household sustainability

· Innovative solutions for the environment

· Environment in the spotlight

· Community action for World Environment Day.

"Tackling environmental issues is not easy - it takes initiative and dedication. The Green Ribbon Awards pay homage to the incredible efforts being undertaken in homes, schools, communities and workplaces to address the environmental challenges we face."

Nominations close on Monday 23 March 2009. For more information visit [www.mfe.govt.nz/withyou](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/withyou) or email [green.ribbon@mfe.govt.nz](mailto:green.ribbon@mfe.govt.nz)
