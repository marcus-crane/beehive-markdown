Education Minister Anne Tolley today released the public consultation document initiating the review of early childhood education regulations.

The review of Labour's Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008 was announced in November by Mrs Tolley.

"This government is totally committed to providing high quality and accessible early childhood education and I want to be sure that we have the right balance between regulation and choice," Mrs Tolley said.

"The review of the 2008 regulations was a promise this National-led government made to parents and early childhood education services after feedback from the sector that the 2008 regulations were overly bureaucratic," she said.

Mrs Tolley said she wanted to be sure that any regulations were the best thing for parents, their children and early childhood services. Feedback from earlier consultation would be included in the review.

The consultation document looks at a range of matters including six-yearly re-licensing; separate sleep rooms; police checks for home-based services and written risk assessments for home-based services
