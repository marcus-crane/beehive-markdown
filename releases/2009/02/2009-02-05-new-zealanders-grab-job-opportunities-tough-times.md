Unemployment figures out today underline the importance of the Government's jobs and growth plan, says the Minister of Social Development and Employment Paula Bennett.

The Household Labour Force Survey puts the official rate of unemployment at 4.6 percent, up from 4.2 percent on the September quarter.  
   
"Unemployment had been forecast to rise for some time, and we're seeing that in today's figure. It's likely there'll be more bad news like this to come."  
   
One surprise was that the labour force participation rate hit a record high of 69.3 percent. The labour force grew by 31,000 with 21,000 in employment and 10,000 in unemployment.

"This suggests most of those who are looking for work are finding jobs. People are seizing the employment opportunities that are out there."

And Ms Bennett says New Zealand is better placed to weather the economic storm compared to other OECD countries.

"There's help available for those that need it. The Government's ReStart package builds on existing measures to help Kiwi workers and their families affected by redundancy. Just yesterday Prime Minister John Key announced measures to assist small businesses, and the Job Summit later this month will investigate initiatives to keep Kiwis in work during the tough times ahead".
