The new Securities Disclosure and Financial Advisers Amendment Bill, introduced into Parliament today by Commerce Minister Simon Power, will provide greater certainty to businesses wanting to raise capital in today's troubled markets.

Mr Power said the bill, which flows from the recommendations of the Capital Market Development Taskforce, will make it easier for businesses to raise capital while ensuring the timely and accurate disclosure of information to prospective investors. 

"A simplified disclosure prospectus will help do away with a lot of duplicated information that many businesses listed on the Stock Exchange face when making a securities offer," said Minister Power.

"The new prospectus will enable listed companies to offer certain debt and equity securities without the need to duplicate information that is already publicly available under the continuous disclosure obligations. This is a good thing - both for the issuers and the investors. It will help reduce the costs and time for companies raising capital in this financially challenging environment while ensuring the timely disclosure of information to investors.

"At the same time I am mindful of investor protection. The bill does not reduce that protection, and existing rules to ensure investors are protected will continue to apply."

The bill also proposes other technical changes to categories of people exempt from disclosure requirements that will make it easier for all companies, listed and unlisted, to raise capital.

"This part of the bill will particularly benefit small and medium-size businesses that traditionally seek capital by 'shoulder-tapping' known investors.

"I am confident this bill will help New Zealand respond to the current financial crisis. Certainly the work provided by the Capital Market Development Taskforce and its interim report of November 2008 identified this as a key priority to help our capital markets."

"I encourage both industry and investors to remain actively involved in the development of the bill through the Select Committee process".
