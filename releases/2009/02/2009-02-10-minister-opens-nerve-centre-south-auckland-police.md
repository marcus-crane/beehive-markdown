Police Minister Judith Collins today opened the second stage of the new $35 million Manukau police station, the nerve centre for policing in South Auckland.

Work on the new station began four years ago and brings the Manukau district police headquarters and other police units together under one roof.

"Counties-Manukau is a modern city that requires a modern police service,"; Ms Collins says.

"I am confident that this state-of-the-art new facility will enable the police to serve the people of Manukau City and Counties-Manukau with professionalism and pride.";

The first stage of the new station was opened in February 2007. The entire project cost $35 million and will house a staff of about 300.

Ms Collins paid tribute to people within the police who began planning many years ago for the future needs of police in the district. These included Assistant Commissioner Steve Shortland and Project Director from the Police National Property Office, Jonathan Leach.

A further four new police stations are due to be opened throughout New Zealand in the coming year, along with two stations that have undergone extensive refurbishment.

Ms Collins says she is confident that the Government’s plans for additional police manpower and new laws targeting gangs, repeat violent offenders and the manufacturers and dealers of the drug P will make a significant impact on the front lines of crime.

The Government will be deploying an extra 300 frontline police staff in Counties-Manukau by the end of 2010.

"This new station reinforces the Government’s commitment to safer communities and ensuring police are well resourced and supported,"; Ms Collins says.
