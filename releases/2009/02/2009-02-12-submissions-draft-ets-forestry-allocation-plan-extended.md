The Minister for Climate Change Issues Nick Smith and the Minister of Forestry David Carter today announced an extension to the closing date for submissions on the draft forestry allocation plan under the NZ Emissions Trading Scheme.

“The forestry aspects of the NZ ETS became effective on 1 January 2008 and remain in force,” Dr Smith says.

“However, in light of the Government's confidence and supply agreement with ACT, climate change policy is being reviewed by a Special Select Committee. That Select Committee is expected to report back to Parliament in April.

”While the Select Committee review is underway the Government is seeking to avoid any confusion and move out the dates for submissions on the draft forestry allocation plan until 30 April 2009.”

David Carter said the Government will be putting public notices in newspapers to inform people of this extension.

“Subject to the Government's consideration of the findings of the Select Committee review, we also intend pushing out the closing date for when landowners with less than 50 hectares can apply for exemption from the NZ ETS deforestation provisions.”

These actions are not pre-empting the final findings of the Select Committee review and are part of the obligation under the existing climate change legislation.
