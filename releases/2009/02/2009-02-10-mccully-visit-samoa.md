Foreign Minister Murray McCully leaves for a two-day visit to Samoa tomorrow.

While in Apia, Mr McCully will meet Head of State Tui Atua Tupua Tamasese Efi; Prime Minister Tuilaepa Lupesoliai Sailele Malielegaoi; Deputy Prime Minister Misa Telfoni, and a number of other ministers and public leaders.

"Samoa is one of New Zealand’s closest friends in the Pacific.  The ties that bind our two countries are deep and long-standing, underpinned by strong family ties and our unique Treaty of Friendship," Mr McCully said.

"This visit offers a chance to underline the importance New Zealand attaches to its relationship with Samoa, and to strengthen relations with its leaders.

"My discussions will cover a number of regional issues, including the outcome of the Special Forum Leaders’ Meeting on Fiji, and the impact of the global economic crisis. 

"I am also meeting with a number of business leaders to discuss how New Zealand can assist private sector growth in Samoa, and will see first-hand some of our development programmes in action,"; Mr McCully said.
