Prime Minister John Key says the signing of letters of agreement today between the Crown and three iwi groupings shows the National-led Government’s commitment to accelerating the momentum to settle outstanding Treaty claims. 

The signings – with iwi groupings Kurahaupo Ki Te Waipounamu Trust, Tainui Taranaki kit e Tonga and Ngati Toa Rangatira – mean that all historical claims in the South Island are now on their way to being resolved. 

“These signings are very significant because not only do they mean that all outstanding historical Treaty claims on the South Island will be resolved, but also on a large part of the Wellington region and lower North Island as well.

“It demonstrates the National-led Government’s commitment to settling all historical grievances under the Treaty of Waitangi.

“The three groups represent eight iwi.  The three groups will receive a total of $171.45 million in redress and a further $128.4 million in accumulated Crown forest rentals, emission credits and other payments in lieu of Crown forest redress.

“Today’s ceremonies are also a testament to the iwi groupings involved.  They worked together despite past differences to reach a settlement with the Crown that was acceptable to all parties and allowed the iwi to move forward in their regions.”
