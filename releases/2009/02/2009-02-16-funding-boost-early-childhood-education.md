Education Minister Anne Tolley today announced funding to assist 14 childhood education groups across the country. The grants will make more than 500 new early childhood places available.

More than $5 million has been allocated under the latest round of the Discretionary Grants Scheme.  The funding will enable groups to plan and build new services and extend existing ones.  

"The government is committed to supporting local communities to boost participation in early childhood education," Mrs Tolley said. 

"This is in line with government policy of boosting participation in  early childhood education for Maori and Pasifika who have traditionally low participation rates.

"The funding is a direct injection to the front line and supports the work of community organisations providing quality early childhood education. By making these places available we will increase choices for parents, families and whanau."

The Discretionary Grants Scheme has $14.459 million available each year for allocation over two rounds.
