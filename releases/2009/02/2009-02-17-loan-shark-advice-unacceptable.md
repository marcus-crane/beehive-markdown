Any suggestion by Work and Income staff that beneficiaries should head to loan sharks to cover their debt is "totally unacceptable", says Social Development and Employment Minister Paula Bennett.

Ms Bennett says she's appalled at advice provided to a Work and Income client that they take out loans to cover arrears.

"I've asked the chief executive of the Ministry of Social Development to get to the bottom of this matter. I'm confident his investigation will be thorough".

"I want assurances that this hasn't been standard practice under the previous Labour-led government. Going to loan sharks certainly will not be advice given out by Work and Income under this National-led government in the future."

"There are tough times ahead, and the last thing we need is people who are relying on help from the state getting into a greater debt trap."
