Schools with proven good performance records will be reviewed less often by the Education Review Office from the beginning of next month, says Minister responsible for ERO, Anne Tolley.

"I have asked ERO to identify schools that are performing consistently well and, accordingly, from March 1, these schools will be exempt from the current three-yearly ERO reviews and will instead be reviewed every four to five years.

"These schools will have shown that they are capable of reviewing their own performance and processes and using that information for the benefit of their students.

"This will minimise the compliance demands placed on these schools and allow them to get on with the business of teaching and learning."

Mrs Tolley says by contrast, schools that are not performing consistently will be reviewed more frequently.

"I make no apology for this. We need to ensure those schools that are struggling in a number of areas are closely and more frequently monitored to ensure their situation doesn't worsen, and that they receive the appropriate help and, if necessary, intervention so they can deliver a better education and learning experience for their students.

"I am confident these changes to ERO's reviews will encourage schools to share excellence by cooperating with other schools to expand innovative and successful approaches to teaching and learning.

"National promised that it would allow schools that are consistently performing to get on with the job of educating their students and focus government education agencies on the schools that require additional help. This is the first step in meeting that promise."
