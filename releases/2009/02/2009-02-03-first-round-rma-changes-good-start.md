The changes to the Resource Management Act (RMA) announced today are a good start and a move in the right direction, but there is still plenty of work to be done so we can get this legislation properly reformed, Minister for Regulatory Reform Hon Rodney Hide said today.

"The RMA has cost New Zealand dearly and has contributed to New Zealand incomes falling further behind other countries."

The changes include removing frivolous, vexatious and anti-competitive objections, streamlining processes for projects of national significance and improving resource consent processes.  The reforms announced today are a direct result of the National-ACT confidence and supply agreement and demonstrate the good relationship between both parties.

"We know that the present Act is a barrier to good ideas and initiatives.  For too long this legislation has become an excuse for unacceptable delays and costly compliance and litigation.  We know, for example, that the Act has been used to indulge in anti-competitive behaviour.

"Since I became Minister I have received overwhelming correspondence expressing concern and frustration with the RMA.

"The changes announced today will go some way to addressing these concerns.  We need to keep the momentum going and I am looking forward to the announcement of further simplification and streamlining to the RMA over coming months.

"With the world economic situation deteriorating it is even more imperative to provide New Zealanders with a better and simpler piece of legislation that will encourage the investment and infrastructure to boost our productivity growth rates and lift the incomes of working people.

"As Minister for Regulatory Reform I am totally committed to ensuring that New Zealand business can move ahead and provide jobs and income for New Zealanders without a poorly designed RMA putting barriers in the way," says the Hon Rodney Hide.
