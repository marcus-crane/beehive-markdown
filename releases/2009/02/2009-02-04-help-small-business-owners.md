Being able to call for help and advice when times get tough is a valuable resource for small businesses, says Economic Development Minister Gerry Brownlee.

"When I've talked to business owners to ask what they need to deal with an economic downturn they've all identified the need for good advice," Mr Brownlee says.

**"**For this reason we are expanding and promoting the advisory services available to business operators, and will be advertising further what help is available.

"A small business operator will only need to pick up the phone to get some practical advice and mentoring. It won't cost them anything and they'll be talking to people who have experience dealing with tight situations.

"Many of these services have been available previously in some form, but they will be of greater value now if a small business operator comes under stress," Mr Brownlee says.

The assistance includes a rejuvenated Biz 0800 hotline, free business health checks, and a free mentoring service.

The advice can extend from dealing with cash flow, to management strategies, the best ways of trading through an economic downturn, and how to maximise the advantages from the range of other government initiatives announced today.
