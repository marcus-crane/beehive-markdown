Community and Voluntary Sector Minister, Tariana Turia, has added her congratulations to the stunning success of the New Zealand Schools Debating Team in being voted ‘best in the world' in the Athens world championships today.

"I was delighted to hear the news, of the world title awarded to Holly Jenkins from Lower Hutt; Jen Savage from Whanganui; *(who in the 2008 champs was voted Best Speaker in the World);* Tom Chen of Hamilton; Ben Kornfeld of Auckland; and Team Captain  - the Second Best Speaker in the World for 2009- Maria English" said Mrs Turia.

"It is a fantastic achievement, and it reflects the impressive support of their dedicated coaches (Julia Fetherston and Kevin Moar); the strength of the support of the families and the school communities around them" said Mrs Turia.

"This young team of debaters defeated 39 teams across the world and it is only right that we celebrate them and recognise their success" said Mrs Turia.

"And perhaps it is also only right to reflect  that the brilliance demonstrated by these young people is a brilliance that we could hope all our young people aspire towards" added Mrs Turia. 

"As many of our talented young performers prepare today to take the stage at *Te Matatini* in Tauranga, I think it is a great opportunity for all of us to reflect - and respect - the awesome potential of the young people of Aotearoa".
