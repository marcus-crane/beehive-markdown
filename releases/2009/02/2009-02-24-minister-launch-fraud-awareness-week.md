Minister of Consumer Affairs Heather Roy will next week launch Fraud Awareness Week - a joint initiative that focuses on raising awareness of scams in the community.

Run by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs and the Commerce Commission, as part of the Australasian Consumer Fraud Taskforce, Fraud Awareness Week also directs people to visit the Ministry of Consumer Affairs' Scamwatch website (www.scamwatch.govt.nz).

"It's time to turn the tables on scammers, and for consumers to be on their guard against fraudsters' unscrupulous tactics," Mrs Roy said.

Also attending the launch will be Trade Me Chief Executive Jon Macdonald, Netsafe Principal Knowledge Officer John Fenaughty and Consumer Affairs Ministry Manager Consumer Capability and Information Liz Stretton.

"The current global financial situation means that now, more than ever, consumers can ill afford to lose money to scammers.  Educating and informing consumers is the best way to prevent scams and fraudulent behaviour," Mrs Roy said.

Fraud Awareness Week Official Launch; Trade Me, Level 3, NZX Centre, 11 Cable Street, Wellington; 12pm-1pm, Monday, March 2 2009.
