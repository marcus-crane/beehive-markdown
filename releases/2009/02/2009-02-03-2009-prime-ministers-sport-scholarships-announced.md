Twenty-eight coaches, 380 athletes, 23 officials, and 41 support team members will receive Prime Minister's Sport Scholarships this year, Sport and Recreation Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"The scholarships help ease the financial pressures faced by New Zealand's elite athletes as they juggle training with tertiary study," Mr McCully said.

"The scholarships also enable coaches, officials and support team members to improve their skills through professional development opportunities.

"A total of $4.25 million is allocated each year. Athletes receive up to $10,000 for tertiary fees and a living allowance of up to $6000 for an academic year, while other recipients can undertake projects worth up to $50,000 each year for three years.

"This year's recipients include Silver Ferns coach Ruth Aitken; Kirsten Hellier, who coaches Olympic gold medallist Valerie Vili; boardsailing gold medallist Tom Ashley; rowing bronze medallist Nathan Twaddle, and swimmer Moss Burmester.

"The list also includes rising young coaches such as rowing coach Calvin Fergusson, who has coached Olympic bronze medallist Mahe Drysdale; and Shane McLeod, who coaches the Black Sticks men's hockey team.

"Support team recipients include sport scientist Craig Palmer, who helps BikeNZ's elite cyclists including Olympic track cyclist Alison Shanks; and strength and conditioning specialist Brad Conza, who works as a physical conditioner for the New Zealand Football Ferns women's football team and for Swimming NZ," Mr McCully said.

Award ceremonies for the recipients will be held throughout the year in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.
