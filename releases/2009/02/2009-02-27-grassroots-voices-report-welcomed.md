The Government has welcomed a new report out today on the delivery of social services to families, says the Minister of Social Development and Employment Paula Bennett.

Grassroots Voices has been prepared by the New Zealand Council of Christian Social Services. It focuses on the experiences of family and whanau in receiving assistance from Christian social services and government agencies.

"It's essential that, as the largest provider of social services throughout this country, the Government knows the support and assistance being provided to people is effective", says Ms Bennett.

"Research like this provides a valuable part in helping to make services more readily available to those in need.

"I'm pleased to note the report highlights the need for a collaborative approach between government agencies and community organisations.

"I'm committed to ensuring the Ministry of Social Development continues to focus on strengthening its ties with community agencies.

"It's those agencies within our communities making the most difference to our most vulnerable families that this government is committed to supporting in these tougher economic times. We've always said we'll back what works."
