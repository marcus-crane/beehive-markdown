Education Minister Anne Tolley today released Ngā Haeata Mātauranga - the Annual Report on Māori Education, 2007/08.

"This report is retrospective and reflects on progress under the previous government. Ngā Haeata Mātauranga indicates that incremental progress is being made, however, there are still many challenges ahead. Inequitable education outcomes for Māori have persisted for too many years. Lifting Māori educational achievement will help raise the overall performance of our education system, productivity and the economy."

Mrs Tolley says she expects improvements to come from key government initiatives, including the National Standards on literacy and numeracy, trades in schools, ERO's strengthened scrutiny of under-performing schools, the extension of Te Kotahitanga to more secondary schools and the government's truancy and Youth Guarantee work.

In the meantime, I am confident that a strong and concerted effort from everyone responsible for Māori education - students, early childhood education centres, schools, teachers, the government and whānau - will enable us to make solid progress over the next year. We must work together to focus on what works for Māori students. It's time for us all to step up."
