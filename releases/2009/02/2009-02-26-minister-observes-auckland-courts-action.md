Courts Minister Georgina te Heuheu observed court workloads first-hand during a day-long visit today to Manukau and Waitakere Courts and the District and High Courts in Auckland.

‘At least a third of the national criminal caseload is dealt with in Auckland - the heart of New Zealand's commercial world.

‘Service delivery by our courts is crucial wherever they are located,' she said.

‘But in Auckland it is a critical component to our economic performance.'

Mrs te Heuheu said she was impressed at the way the judiciary and court staff dealt with the high caseloads, often in stressful circumstances.

In discussions with judges, she reassured them that court security was a priority for her.  As Minister in the previous National-led Government, Mrs te Heuheu was responsible for the Courts Security Act, which enabled the appointment of Court Security Officers.

‘I'm aware that in the intervening time, court security and infrastructure have come under added pressure from increased workloads and types of offences.

‘Today's visit enabled me to discuss these points with the judges and court staff.'

The Minister said she was impressed with the dedication shown by staff and judges. She intends to visit courts in other areas as and when her Ministerial duties allow.
