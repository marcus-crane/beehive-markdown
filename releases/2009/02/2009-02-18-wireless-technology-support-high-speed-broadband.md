Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce today announced the outcome of consultation which will enhance take-up of wireless technology to support high-speed broadband networks. 

Feedback from industry participants has now been received on the discussion paper, *High Capacity Short Haul Point to Point Linking in the 70 to 90 GHz Band*.

Wireless technology using this band may provide a cost-effective option to extend the fibre optical network in support of high-speed broadband networks, particularly in metropolitan areas.  Several manufacturers already supply appropriate equipment, making the technology an increasingly attractive and practical option for network providers. 

Offering access to this band will support the government's priority of rolling out high- speed broadband infrastructure. 

"The outcomes of this consultation will ensure that spectrum management in the 70-90 GHz band contributes to our goal of widespread delivery of ultra-fast broadband, and maximises the value of this spectrum to industry participants and consumers," says Mr Joyce. 

Submissions received on the consultation paper show that demand exists for access to the 70-90 GHz band.  The consultation process also resolved a number of issues around the appropriate choice of technical standards and operating parameters.  Submitters expressed a preference for long-term interference protection over ease of access to the band.  Interference protection using the standard administrative radio licensing regime rather than the more light-handed general user licence approach was the preferred option.

"The government proposes that changes are made to current policies to permit licensing of fixed point to point links in the 70-90 GHz band under the administrative licensing regime," says Mr Joyce. 

The new policies will be put in place by the middle of the year.
