Minimising the impact of the global economic recession on Pacific people is the goal of tomorrow's fono called by Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, Hon Georgina te Heuheu.

The fono will canvass a Pacific perspective for the Government's jobs summit later in the month.

Mrs te Heuheu said the current global economic climate presents challenges for all New Zealanders including Pacific communities.

Decreasing global demand for New Zealand products would have significant impact on the industries that employ Pacific people. Unemployment was likely to rise particularly for lower skilled workers in primary and manufacturing industries.

Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs Chief executive Dr Colin Tukuitonga said Pacific people are arguably already disadvantaged in the labour market.

‘They tend to work in low-skilled and low-paid jobs. The average Pacific worker earns $3.66 an hour less than other workers.

‘Almost one in four of Pacific people have jobs work in manufacturing - and we know that some of those jobs are starting to disappear.

‘We will look at what we can do to keep people in work as long as possible - whether by protecting existing jobs or creating new ones.

‘Where that isn't do-able, and people are laid off and unable to find new jobs, we want to focus on skills and training and higher education so they make best use of the time off work and set themselves up for better jobs when the upturn comes.

‘Let's not forget that the youthfulness of the Pacific population means that they will be an increasingly important part of the future workforce, under pressure to support an aging New Zealand population.

‘It's in all our interests that they are supported to stay in work, or where that's not possible, helped to stay positive and focussed on getting work, retraining or studying for higher qualifications.'
