The Government has declined Rex Haig's application for compensation for wrongful conviction and imprisonment, Justice Minister Simon Power said today.

Mr Haig was convicted in 1995 for the murder of fishing boat crewman Mark Roderique and spent 10 years in prison before his conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal. He then applied for compensation.

Mr Power said he had declined Mr Haig's application after accepting the finding of an investigation by Mr Robert Fisher QC. The Cabinet had been notified.

In his report, Mr Fisher finds that it was more probable than not that Mr Haig participated in Mr Roderique's murder.

"After carefully considering Mr Fisher's report, including meeting with him face to face to discuss his conclusions, I have decided to accept his advice, and today have informed Mr Haig that his claim for compensation has been declined," Mr Power said.

Mr Haig applied for compensation in November 2006, and the claim was referred to Mr Fisher for assessment in September 2007 by then-Justice Minister Mark Burton.

"A fundamental requirement for payment of compensation under the Cabinet guidelines is that a Queen's Counsel is satisfied that the claimant is innocent on the balance of probabilities of the crime for which he was convicted and imprisoned.

"In this case, Mr Fisher had to establish that it was more likely than not that  Mr Haig was not involved in the murder of Mr Roderique, either alone or as a party," Mr Power said.

"Mr Fisher found it was more probable than not that Mr Haig participated, together with his nephew David Hogan, in the murder of Mr Roderique.

"I am satisfied that Mr Fisher followed a robust process and that his report is clear, authoritative and persuasive," Mr Power said.

In quashing Mr Haig's conviction in 2006, the Court of Appeal ruled that Mr Haig cannot be prosecuted again and Mr Fisher's advice does not change this.

Mr Fisher's report is available on request under the Official Information Act.  Requests for a copy of the report can be directed to [Brent.Webling@parliament.govt.nz](mailto:Brent.Webling@parliament.govt.nz).
