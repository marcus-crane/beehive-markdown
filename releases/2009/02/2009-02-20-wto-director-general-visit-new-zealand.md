Trade Minister Tim Groser today announced Pascal Lamy, Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), will be visiting New Zealand for a series of meetings in early March. 

"This is an important opportunity for New Zealand to reinforce our strong commitment to the multilateral trading system, and our credentials as an active and constructive WTO Member.

"The timing of the visit is critical given the important role the WTO will play in the emerging global response to the ongoing economic crisis. As Director-General, Lamy is central in determining how the WTO mobilises to try and turn the crisis around.

"In particular, this visit presents an opportunity for New Zealand to continue to press the case against the introduction of new trade protectionist measures by WTO Members. I will emphasise our view that trade liberalisation through a successful conclusion to the Doha Round - not protectionism - is the best solution to the global economic crisis the world faces," said Mr Groser.

Lamy, who will be in New Zealand from 4 - 6 March, is well known to New Zealand having held the position of Director-General of the WTO since September 2005, and previously having served as European Trade Commissioner from 1999-2004. 

While in New Zealand, Lamy will meet with the Prime Minister and other relevant Ministers, as well as a range of government officials and business leaders. How to progress the Doha Round of multilateral trade talks and discourage others from introducing new trade protectionist measures will be core issues for discussion.

"Achieving a successful outcome in the WTO remains New Zealand's number one trade objective. We will be assuring Lamy that New Zealand will actively support his efforts to re-invigorate negotiations and reach a successful outcome to the Round," Mr Groser said.
