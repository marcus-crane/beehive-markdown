Foreign Minister Murray McCully heads to Europe on Sunday to attend a Commonwealth meeting on Fiji and to make calls on ministerial counterparts in London and Paris.

"The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group meeting on Fiji is an important one, and I expect Ministers will want to take full account of the recent call by Forum leaders in Port Moresby for Fiji's interim government to come up with a roadmap to elections by 1 May," Mr McCully said.

"While the Forum has taken the lead on Fiji, the Commonwealth is also playing an important role promoting efforts to encourage a return to democracy in Fiji."

While in London, Mr McCully will also meet high-level ministers, including Foreign Affairs Secretary David Miliband, and Foreign Affairs Under-Secretary Gillian Merron.

Mr McCully goes to Paris on 5 March to meet French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner and State Secretary for Overseas France Yves Jégo.

"I am looking forward to meeting my Ministerial counterparts to explain the new Government's strategy and underline the value of our relationships with close partners in Europe," Mr McCully said.

Mr McCully will also meet sports officials in London and Paris, and French Sports Minister Bernard Laporte to promote the 2011 Rugby World Cup. While in London, he will also deliver a speech to the New Zealand Chartered Accountants Institute's London branch.
