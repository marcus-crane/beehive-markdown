Hundreds of events will be held around the country this Sunday March 1 to celebrate Children's Day.

"Children's Day provides a wonderful opportunity to enjoy being with our kids. It's the day to remind ourselves how lucky we are - and to just play, have fun and listen to our children," says the Minister for Social Development and Employment Paula Bennett.

"This year I'll be joining in celebrations at the Toddler Day Out and Great Parenting Fair in my home patch of Waitakere, and later at the Children's Day event at Jordan Field in Tauranga."

The theme of this year's Children's Day is ‘Listening and Talking',  which is vital for the social, emotional and cognitive development of children and young people.

"This is the ninth year in a row we've held Children's Day, but really - we should celebrate our kids everyday. As parents, we're constantly learning what it means to nurture, cherish and raise our children.

"I know being a parent is the best - and sometimes most challenging - experience anyone can have. That's why this year's theme is so important. It's only by listening and talking to our kids that we really get to know who they are, and they get to grow to be adults, comfortable and confident within themselves. And it's something that shouldn't stop as your children get older. Your kids will always be your kids, no matter how old they are.

"I want to thank all the organisations and the people out there who have worked hard to make their events a success. I look forward to joining you in celebrating our children."
