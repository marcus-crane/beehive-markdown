A scheme rewarding new vet graduates who choose to work in understaffed rural areas will benefit the practices they work at, and rural communities, says Agriculture Minister David Carter.

The voluntary bonding scheme for vets encourages new graduates to stay in an eligible practice by providing a taxable payment of $11,000 for every year, up to five years, that they are working in an understaffed area. 

Payment for the first three years will be made as a lump sum at the end of three years, with an annual payment for the fourth and fifth years. 

"This scheme is a win-win situation," says Mr Carter.  "The vets who opt in get a significant financial incentive, while eligible vet practices can have confidence they can retain graduates.

"Because the scheme encourages new vets to remain in the practice, rural areas will benefit from having vets settle and become part of the local community."

Mr Carter says the scheme is targeted at rural vet practices working with farmed animals.

The first year of the scheme will be a transition year to allow the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and vet organisations to gather information and review eligibility for the scheme.

"This scheme will adapt to meet the changing needs of New Zealand's rural communities. The areas of greatest need may shift over time and we need to reflect that."

Mr Carter said any future changes to eligibility would not affect vets already in the scheme.

#### Questions & Answers - Voluntary Bonding Scheme for Vets

**Who is eligible?**  
The scheme is available to veterinary science graduates who have completed their qualification within 12 months of applying for the scheme.  In the first year of the scheme, graduates who completed their veterinary science qualification in 2005 or later can also apply if they are already working in an eligible understaffed, rural area.

The eligibility requirements of the scheme are that a graduate must:

- be a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident
- have a Bachelor of Veterinary Science from Massey University (Massey University is the only university in New Zealand delivering this programme)
- be registered to practice in New Zealand and hold a current practicing certificate;
- have a permanent, full-time position in an eligible practice in one of the targeted understaffed, rural areas; and
- work with production animals as part of this position.

If a new graduate has been offered a role in an eligible position they can still apply for the scheme whether or not they have started working.

**If I meet the criteria and eligibility requirements, what am I entitled to?**  
The scheme entitles eligible graduates to a taxable payment of $11,000 for every year, up to five years, that they are working in an eligible area.  Payment for the first three years will be made as a lump sum at the end of three years, with an annual payment for the fourth and fifth year.

**What practices or places of work will be eligible?**  
The scheme aims to target those veterinarians who are working with livestock industries in order to assist New Zealand to maintain world-class standards in biosecurity, animal welfare and food safety.  Therefore the scheme targets mixed practices and practices based on production animal veterinary medicine, or places of work which are servicing the needs of livestock industries.

**Why have certain geographic areas been targeted?**  
The scheme will apply to rural areas considered to have the greatest need based on the significance of livestock in the region, the number of veterinarians and recruitment and retention difficulties.  For the transition year of the scheme research and information from Massey University, the New Zealand Veterinary Association and the Veterinary Council of New Zealand has been used to target the territorial authorities of:

- Gisborne (excluding the urban area of Gisborne city)
- Wairoa
- Central Hawke's Bay
- Tararua
- Buller, Grey and Westland
- Southland
- Gore

The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will work with the New Zealand Veterinary Association and the Veterinary Council of New Zealand to review eligibility for the scheme to ensure that it continues to target those areas of greatest need.

**What is the scheme expected to cost?**  
First payments will be made in 2012 when eligible graduates will have completed three years under the scheme.  The cost in 2012 is expected to be $1.32 million rising to $1.76 million in 2014.

**How do I apply, and when?**  
Eligible graduates will need to complete an application form and have their practice principal or manager attest to their eligibility for the scheme.  Applications for the scheme can be made from 1 March 2009.
