An open day on New Zealand farms is a great way to cement connections between town and country, says Agriculture Minister David Carter.

Federated Farmers Farm Day is being held on 27 farms throughout the country this Sunday (1 March) offering New Zealanders a chance to see working farms in action. 

"Research done by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry shows that city dwellers appreciate the contribution the rural sector makes to our economy, and understand that if rural New Zealand is doing well, the whole country is better off," says Mr Carter.

"This is great news for farming communities who can sometimes feel disconnected from urban New Zealand.

"The reality is the primary sector is New Zealand's engine room. It is what keeps the lights on and allows us to prosper. Revenue generated from land-based sectors accounts for around two-thirds of this country's export earnings and delivers thousands of jobs - not just in rural and provincial areas, but in our cities as well.

"I encourage New Zealanders to take part in Federated Farmers Farm Day this Sunday. Coincidentally, it is also Children's Day so this is a great opportunity for families to get together and spend a day in the country. I will certainly be doing this with my family at Claxby near Rangiora.

"This is all about building connections between town and country, especially in these challenging times, and I welcome the move," says Mr Carter.
