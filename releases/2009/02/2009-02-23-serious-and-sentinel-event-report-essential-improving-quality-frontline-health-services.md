"Openly disclosing preventable incidents in our hospitals is essential if we are to improve quality in frontline health services," says Health Minister  Tony Ryall, commenting on today's second annual Serious and Sentinel Events Report from the Quality Improvement Committee and the 21 District Health Boards (DHB).

"This is part of the health services being open and upfront."

"No one knows the right number of serious and sentinel events. But we've told people to look and so we're finding them. DHBs are getting better at identifying and investigating these events. I would expect the figures will increase further next year as the system become more accurate at identifying them."

"It is also vital frontline health providers have the best possible and latest information available to help them," says Mr Ryall.

"I've indicated that DHBs ensure this information reaches frontline staff so they can share the lessons learnt with each other - informed debate is an essential part of improving patient safety and service."

"The Quality Improvement Committee is recommending that all DHBs discuss the serious and sentinel events from their area in the public portion of their next Board meeting."
