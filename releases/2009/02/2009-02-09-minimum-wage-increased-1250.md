The Government has moved to increase the minimum wage from $12 to $12.50 in line with the Consumer Price Index, Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson announced today.

The training and new entrants' minimum wages will increase from $9.60 to $10.

"In reviewing the minimum wage it was clear that, given the current recession, we needed to find a balance between protecting jobs and fair pay for workers.

"We do not want to see workers priced out of the market during these difficult times, but we are confident that a 50c increase, in line with inflation, will not harm businesses.

"The Government is working hard to combat the effects of the economic downturn and ensuring workers can maintain the buying power of their wages is part of that," Ms Wilkinson says.

The new minimum wage rate will come into effect on April 1, 2009.
