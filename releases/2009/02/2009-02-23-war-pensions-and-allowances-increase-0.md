All War Disablement Pensions and allowances available to assist veterans will increase from 1 April as part of the annual cost of living adjustment, the Minister of Veterans' Affairs Judith Collins announced today.

The increase of 3.38 per cent equates to the increase in the cost of living for the year to December 2008, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

"The decision to increase pensions and allowances recognises that the increased cost of living is a concern for our veterans," Ms Collins says.

"Veterans who rely on their pension and allowances to help fund healthcare and other necessities shouldn't be disadvantaged."

- Examples of the increases are:A veteran on a 100% War Disablement Pension will now receive a tax free payment of $188.17 per week.
- A Surviving Spouse's Pension will increase to $138.80 per week, tax free.

All allowances are also adjusted in line with the increase in the CPI.
