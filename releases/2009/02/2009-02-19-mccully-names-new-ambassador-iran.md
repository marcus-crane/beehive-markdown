New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Iran will be career diplomat Brian Sanders, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

Mr Sanders will also be accredited to Afghanistan and Pakistan.

“New Zealand and Iran have a constructive relationship. We talk regularly about matters of mutual interest and international concern, including Iran’s nuclear ambitions, human rights, and broader developments in the Middle East,” Mr McCully said.

“At the same time, the Iran-New Zealand Political and Economic Cooperation Commission (PECC) provides a framework for trade and economic exchanges, with the most recent PECC meeting taking place in Wellington last June.

“Iran is a growing market for our products and services, including education, electronics, software, and agricultural technology. New Zealand exports to Iran were worth over $160 million last year, while imports stood at just under $120 million.”

Mr Sanders was previously High Commissioner in Honiara, and has also been posted to Washington, Moscow, Riyadh, and Bangkok.

He takes up his post in May, replacing Hamish MacMaster who is returning to Wellington.
