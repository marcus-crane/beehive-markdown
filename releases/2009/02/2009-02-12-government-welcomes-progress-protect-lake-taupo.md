Minister for the Environment Nick Smith today welcomed a deal by the Lake Taupo Protection Trust to convert more than 930 hectares of farmland into forestry.

“Water quality is one of the most challenging issues facing New Zealand. It is particularly difficult in the Lake Taupo catchment where we are dealing with long-term effects.

“The reason I am so enthusiastic about the Trust’s work and this initiative with the owner of the land, Boat Harbour Holdings, is that it involves parties engaging and agreeing on solutions that work both economically and environmentally.

“I congratulate the Trust for this and for developing a programme of work that will reduce the amount of nitrogen flowing into the lake by 20 percent over 15 years.

 “We will need more of this kind of innovative approach if we are to win the water quality battle in Lake Taupo and other parts of New Zealand.”
