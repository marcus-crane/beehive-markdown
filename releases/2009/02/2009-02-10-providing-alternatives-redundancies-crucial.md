The Government welcomes businesses adopting creative solutions that save jobs in these tougher economic times, says the Minister for Social Development and Employment Paula Bennett.

Rio Tinto's Tiwai Point smelter has asked staff to consider reducing their hours or taking unpaid leave in a bid to prevent job losses amid falling aluminium prices.

Ms Bennett says this is a welcome example of an alternative to cutting jobs, and the Government will help where it can.

"We know economic conditions are going to be challenging over the coming year. While reducing hours isn't ideal,  it's preferable to jobs being cut permanently. By adopting innovative and practical ways to tackle this recession we may be able to secure more jobs.

 "If someone does find their hours have been reduced or they face taking a sabbatical, Work and Income has a range of support and financial assistance that could help workers facing cut-backs," Ms Bennett says.

Affected staff may be entitled to Working for Families tax credits or other assistance from Work and Income.

For people who have been made redundant, help may be available through the Government’s ReStart package which provides extra support for workers to help them get back on their feet.
