The government has kick-started New Zealand's response to an appeal for Victoria's bushfire victims by donating $500,000, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.

"The loss of life and property in Victoria is devastating. Whole communities have been destroyed, and many others remain under threat as the fires continue to burn," Mr McCully said.

"Australians are our closest friends and neighbours, and we want to help them as much as we can in their time of need.

"Our donation will support those people whose lives have been shattered by this disaster. It follows yesterday's offer of 100 New Zealand firefighters to join the firefighting efforts in Victoria.

"The government's contribution will go to the Victorian Bushfire Appeal Fund, which has been set up by the state government in partnership with the Australian federal government and the Red Cross.

"New Zealanders wanting to make a donation can do so through the New Zealand Red Cross, by making an automatic $20 donation by calling 0900 33200; by visiting [www.redcross.org.nz](http://www.redcross.org.nz/), or by going to their local Red Cross office," Mr McCully said.
