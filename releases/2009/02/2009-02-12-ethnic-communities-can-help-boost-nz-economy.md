Ethnic Affairs Minister Pansy Wong says Parliament's Chinese Year of the Ox Economic Dinner Forum shows the important role New Zealand's ethnic communities have in helping New Zealand through the tough economic climate.

About 80 leaders from the Chinese New Zealand business community gathered at Parliament on Tuesday to discuss ways of boosting New Zealand's economy with Prime Minister John Key, Trade Minister Tim Groser and Immigration Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman.

 "For far too long, the role of our ethnic communities has been one of a passive bystander in the decision making of this great nation. This must change if we are to come together to build a brighter tomorrow," she says.

"The Economic Dinner Forum demonstrated a new era of government where we will have engagement with substance, where every New Zealander has a role in ensuring this country remains great and strong."

Mr Groser says the forum highlights the inclusive strategy of the government

"Statements we have made about involving ethnic communities are not just rhetoric - ethnic diversity is an important focus of this government," he says.

Dr Coleman says the forum shows that ethnic communities have a lot to offer the government.

"The forum uncovered a huge amount of untapped potential within our ethnic communities. Our government is keen to connect and work with those communities," he says.
