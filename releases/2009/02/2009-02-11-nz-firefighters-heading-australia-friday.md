New Zealand firefighters will fly to Australia on Friday \[13 Feb] to help fight the devastating bushfires in the state of Victoria, says the Minister responsible for New Zealand’s fire services Richard Worth.

Prime Minister John Key will farewell a team of 53 firefighters, crew leaders and management staff from rural fire authorities across New Zealand at Auckland Airport on Friday afternoon.

The New Zealand Defence Force will provide air transport to Melbourne in a Boeing 757.

In addition a New Zealand Liaison Officer from the National Rural Fire Authority will leave for Melbourne today.

Dr Worth said the fires were absolutely devastating and New Zealand was pleased to offer any practical assistance it could. “We are all deeply shocked at the loss of life and the impact these wildfires are having on wildlife and property.”

An agreement of mutual support exists between the Victoria Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) and the New Zealand National Rural Fire Authority to help each other with wildfire suppression and other fire management activities.

New Zealand’s National Rural Fire Office Murray Dudfield said the DSE today made a formal request for support from New Zealand to assist with managing a number of large wildfires not yet contained on state lands in Victoria.

The formal request followed discussion between Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Mr Key last weekend.

Mr Dudfield said the firefighting contingent would have remote high country and forestry firefighting experience. “They will be required to walk into the remote wildfires in forested lands and assist with containment of these wildfires.”

“The wildfires occurred last weekend and many still remain uncontrolled,” said Mr Dudfield. By Sunday the New Zealand contingent will provide relief for and allow rest days to be taken by some fire crews and management involved in the wildfires since last weekend.   

Confirmation of the firefighters, crew leaders and management staff will be confirmed within the next 24 hours. The deployment is for an 18-day period starting on Friday.
