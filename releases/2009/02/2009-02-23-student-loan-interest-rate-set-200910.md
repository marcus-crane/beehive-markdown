The student loan interest rate will increase from its present level of 6.7% to 6.8% on 1 April 2009, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne announced today.

As interest is written off for borrowers in New Zealand, the increase will affect only those borrowers who are based overseas - those who leave New Zealand for more than six months.

Mr Dunne said there had been a marginal increase in the rate because it is calculated on a "long-run average".

"The interest rate is based on a five-year average of the ten-year bond rate, plus a margin to cover administration costs.  A long-run average is used to smooth movements in market interest rates.  Current interest rates will be taken into account when setting next year's interest rate," Mr Dunne said.

The new rate was approved by Order in Council today.
