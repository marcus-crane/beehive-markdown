Today’s Government announcement bringing forward capital expenditure on infrastructure projects in the education, transport and housing sectors is good news for Maori and Pacific communities, Associate Minister of Maori Affairs and Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Georgina te Heuheu said today.

‘Coming on top of the increase in the minimum wage, speeding up this capital expenditure shows this National-led Government is listening to the community,’ she said.

‘Boosting economic activity does not have to be at the expense of our most vulnerable.  Women, Maori, Pacific people and youth will be the winners from today’s decisions aimed primarily at ensuring New Zealand can ride out the worldwide economic recession.

‘Maori and Pacific Islanders all too often provide the buffer at the bottom of the social and economic statistics.

‘It will take time to fully address these issues, but this week’s announcements are a good start.’

On Thursday  the Minister will attend a community meeting in Mangere, organised to enable her to meet with Pacific people in Auckland.  More than 300 people from Auckland’s seven main Pacific ethnicities are expected to attend.
