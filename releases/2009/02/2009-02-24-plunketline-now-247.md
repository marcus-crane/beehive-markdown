PlunketLine is now a 24/7 operation helping New Zealand parents and children, the Health Minister Tony Ryall confirmed today.

Fast tracking funding for PlunketLine was one of National's 100 day commitments, to tackle issues that matter to New Zealanders.

"From today, and through tonight, PlunketLine will be offering support and advice to the parents of young New Zealanders 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

 "PlunketLine's phone service complements the face-to-face services that Plunket delivers in the community. Plunket offers services that Kiwi parents value, use, and wish to see maintained," Mr Ryall said.

The extended service is being funded through a grant of $3.75 million over 15 months to the end of March next year ($3 million per annum). By that time, a review of Well Child parent information programmes will have been completed and new contracting arrangements will be in place.

The parent information review could extend support services to include e-mail and online information and chatrooms.
