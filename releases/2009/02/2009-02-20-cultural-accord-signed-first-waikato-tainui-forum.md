A strong delegation of ministers met with iwi today at the inaugural Waikato-Tainui - Crown Relationship Forum  in Hopuhopu, which culminated in the signing of a cultural accord under agreements related to the Waikato River deed of settlement.

The Crown was represented by Deputy Prime Minister Bill English, Minister for the Environment Nick Smith, Minister for Arts Culture and Heritage and Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson, and Associate Maori Affairs Minster Georgina Te Heuheu.

The forum was established to foster high level relationships and dialogue between the Crown and iwi.

Minister for Arts Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson signed the Taonga Tuku Iho Accord at the conclusion of the Forum.

Mr Finlayson said that the signing showed the Crown's commitment to its approach of co-management of the Waikato River environment with local iwi.

"The signing of the Taonga Tuku Iho Accord, and the very strong presence of ministers here today demonstrates the Crown's intention to deliver on co-management of the Waikato River environment," he said.  "Iwi, Crown, and local government are working together on co-management  with the goal of restoring and maintaining the river's health and wellbeing."

The accord sets out processes for the Crown to interact with Waikato-Tainui in matters relating to the Projected Objects Act, such as the custody and ownership of local cultural artefacts, and their export from New Zealand.

It also provides a process for  Waikato-Tainui to interact with the Crown over matters such as relevant board appointments.
