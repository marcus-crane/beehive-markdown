The transfer of day services funding from the Ministry of Health to the Ministry of Social Development has been put on hold for three months.

The Ministers of Health and Social Development and Employment have decided to delay the transfer for three months while consultation is undertaken with the sector.

“Key people involved in providing these services have expressed concern about the transfer. We want to take the time to make sure we get the right decision, based on what’s best for the people using day services”, says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

The discussions will be led by the Ministry of Social Development, with support from the Ministry of Health.

Day services provide employment and community focussed activities for people with disabilities. Funding for these services was to have been transferred on 1 April 2009 to the Ministry of Social Development, which funds the bulk of vocational services.

Those currently receiving day services will not be adversely affected by any change in funding responsibilities.

“We’re aware that some longstanding funding issues remain unresolved.  We want to consult the sector to ensure their concerns receive a fair hearing,” Mr Ryall said.
