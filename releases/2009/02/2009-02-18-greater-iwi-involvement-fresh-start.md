Proposed law changes will give community and iwi-based groups the chance to make a real difference in the lives of our most serious young offenders, says Social Development and Employment Minister Paula Bennett.

The Children, Young Persons and Their Families (Youth Courts Jurisdictions and Orders) Amendment Bill, will have its first reading tonight.

"This Bill will give Youth Court judges the ability to determine what's needed to change the behaviour of some of our worst young criminals, and order them to follow through on it," Ms Bennett says.

"The Fresh Start approach will see serious and repeat young offenders ordered to attend drug and alcohol rehabilitation, parenting education courses and mentoring programmes.

"We want the best providers to deliver these Fresh Start programmes, and increased involvement of Maori and Pacific Island providers will be a priority. This will be achieved by consulting with both the Maori Party and iwi."

Ms Bennett says no standard solution will work for the 1000 young New Zealanders who are on a path to becoming the adult criminals of tomorrow.

"That's why we need to give the Youth Court judges a menu of options when tailoring a plan to each offender to stop them committing further crime.

"This is a fresh start for our most troubled and destructive young people that will help them break away from their offending lifestyle," Ms Bennett says.
