Defence Minister Wayne Mapp flies to Sydney this afternoon for his first meeting with his Australian counterpart, Joel Fitzgibbon.

“The ANZAC relationship has long been our most significant defence partnership and we maintain a high level of inter-operability with Australian forces,” Dr Mapp said.

“There is a regular programme of engagement between Ministers, officials and Defence personnel, and this visit will enable me to build on the close working relationship the two countries have.

“The Government’s upcoming Defence White Paper will be informed by the White Paper process in Australia and the meeting will also provide an opportunity to shape formal co-operation around our White Paper processes.”
