The Louis Vuitton Pacific Series provides New Zealand the opportunity to show case itself around the globe at a time when the world is facing huge economic challenges, said Associate Minister for Tourism Jonathan Coleman in a speech to international and local media.

"From the government's perspective, this event is a fantastic opportunity for New Zealand and we appreciate the role the media will play in keeping this country of ours on the international radar."

"An event such as the Louis Vuitton Pacific Series is publicity for this country that money just can't buy."

Minister Coleman also acknowledged the recent announcement that BMW Oracle is moving its main boat building operations to Warkworth as extremely encouraging and positive news in the current economic climate.

He paid tribute to the efforts of Grant Dalton and Bruno Trouble saying that the vision of these two men is directly responsible for the outstanding yachting that we are to be treated to over the next couple of weeks.

"Grant needs no introduction as a New Zealand sailing icon, but it's clear that his contribution to this country goes way beyond his sailing skills and Grant, for that New Zealand has a lot to be thankful for."
