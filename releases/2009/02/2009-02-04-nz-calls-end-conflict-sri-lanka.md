Both sides of the Sri Lankan civil war must agree to a ceasefire and return to negotiations for the sake of their own people, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.

"The recent escalation in fighting between Sri Lankan government forces and the Tamil Tigers is unacceptable," Mr McCully said.

"The Tigers must cease their terrorist acts, and lay down their arms. Equally the Sri Lankan government must halt its military action, and respect the rule of law in dealing with displaced civilians.

"Continued fighting threatens up to 250,000 civilians who have been forced from their homes. Many remain trapped in the combat zone.

"Reports of hospitals being hit in the fighting are worrying, and it appears the humanitarian situation in the north and east of Sri Lanka is deteriorating.

"There is a pressing need for agencies such as the United Nations and the International Red Cross to be allowed to monitor what is happening, and to deliver urgently-needed medical assistance and food supplies to civilians.

"On the eve of Sri Lankan Independence Day celebrations, New Zealand supports the United States and other nations in calling for an end to the fighting so that a lasting solution can be found," Mr McCully said.
