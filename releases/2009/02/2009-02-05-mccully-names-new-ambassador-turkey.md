Career diplomat Andrea Smith will be New Zealand's new Ambassador to Turkey, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today. 

New Zealand's Ambassador in Ankara also has responsibility for links with Israel, Jordan, and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.

"New Zealand and Turkey enjoy a warm relationship, which is founded on our shared experiences during the Gallipoli campaign in World War 1," Mr McCully said.

"Both countries suffered horrific losses during the campaign, but Gallipoli proved to be a turning point in our modern histories.

"There has been a steady development in the New Zealand-Turkish relationship in recent years, with high-level visits in both directions, and the establishment of the Joint Economic Commission which promotes trade and economic activity. Total trade between our two countries has nearly trebled since 1990, and is now worth well over $NZ135 million per year," Mr McCully said.

Ms Smith has previously been posted to Washington, Jakarta, and Brussels, and most recently was Foreign Policy Advisor in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. She takes up her posting in May, replacing Hamish Cooper, who is returning to Wellington.
