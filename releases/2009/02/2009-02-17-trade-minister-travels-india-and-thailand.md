Trade Minister Tim Groser departs today for India and Thailand where he will progress New Zealand's trade priorities and discuss international climate change issues.

Trade liberalisation will be high on Mr Groser's agenda throughout the trip. In New Delhi, discussions will be held on the India - New Zealand Joint Free Trade Agreement (FTA) Study and in Thailand Mr Groser will sign the 12 country ASEAN - Australia - New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA).

"We are in the closing stages of concluding the FTA Study with India and I look forward to discussing the issues in depth with my counterpart Kamal Nath. Concluding the study is a key step towards the launch of bilateral FTA negotiations.

"An agreement with India is potentially of huge long term importance to New Zealand. India is becoming a regional and global powerhouse - it is already a significant source of global capital and of specialist skills such as IT, science, and engineering.

"While in India, I will also take the opportunity to talk with key Indian opinion makers about the global economic situation and international climate change.  The global economic picture is of critical concern as we develop policies designed to promote growth and protect and create jobs at home," Mr Groser said.

Mr Groser then travels to Hua Hin, Thailand, where he will join with his Australian and ASEAN counterparts to sign the 12 country AANZFTA.

"Concluding this FTA is a huge achievement and will create new opportunities for New Zealand exporters and investors with one of the world's most dynamic economic regions. At this time of real global economic pressure it is a significant result. It sends an important signal to the international community about the importance of continuing regional economic integration and resisting protectionism," Mr Groser said.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, is made up of Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei Darussalam, Vietnam, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Cambodia.

ASEAN represents a market of more than 566 million people and accounts for more than US$1,400 billion in global trade. The region is of increasing importance to New Zealand, now ranking as our third largest export market - exports to the region having grown 121% since 2000 and worth around $4.6 billion in 2008.
