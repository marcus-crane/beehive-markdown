A bill aimed at helping address the financial and emotional costs that fall on victims of crime passed its first reading in Parliament last night and was sent to select committee.

The Sentencing (Offender Levy) Bill was introduced as part of the National-led Government's Action Plan on Violent Crime.

"Addressing the negative impact of crime on victims is a priority of this Government," Justice Minister Simon Power said in introducing the bill.

"Labour promised as long ago as 1994 to consult on a victims’ compensation scheme but did nothing during its nine years in office. This Government is doing this in its first 100 days.

"We want to put victims of crime at the centre of the justice system. They have been neglected for too long, and the purpose of this bill is to ensure that offenders contribute to addressing the harm they cause.

"At present, victims can receive compensation by way of court-ordered reparation, or may be covered for some costs under ACC or by discretionary grants from Victim Support.

"The difficulty is that victims often face significant emotional and financial costs as a result of crime committed against them that are not covered by those means. This bill changes that."

The bill imposes a $50 levy on all convicted offenders at the point of sentencing in court. This will be in addition to any sentence or court order. The levy will be collected after reparation and before fines and will be put into a special account administered by the Secretary for Justice, who will designate organisations as ‘an approved agency’ to be paid for services for victims.

"That will ensure that services for victims will be provided in a prompt manner, and that a greater number of victims can be supported through the justice system.

"We can never legislate away the pain and suffering faced by victims of serious crime, such as murder, sexual violation, and grievous assault. We can, however, respond to the practical needs and emotional costs that fall on victims of serious crimes in particular."

 

**The Government also plans to:&gt;**

- - **R&gt;**edirect unclaimed money in the Victims Claims Trust Account into the levy account.&gt;
  - &gt;Upgrade the Victim Notification Register so victims can be on an “active” register, which will notify them of developments relating to their case, or a “silent” register, for those who don’t want further involvement, but which will ensure offenders are not paroled to live nearby.&gt;
  - &gt;Review the Victims’ Rights Act 2002 to enhance victims’ rights and access to services.&gt;
