Good farm management and smart decision-making are key to coping with the continuing dry conditions, says Agriculture and Forestry Minister David Carter.

The Government is monitoring high risk areas closely and despite recent rain, most of the country is still very dry.

"North Canterbury and parts of the North Island east coast are on the edge, particularly following on from last year's drought.  These conditions are putting severe pressure on farmers," says Mr Carter.

"What this means is that good farm management is critical to seeing farmers through the rest of the summer and the coming winter.  Experience of previous droughts shows that farmers who have contingency plans in place and make timely decisions will get through.

"Many farmers are already doing a good job, but they need to plan early around selling stock and buying supplementary feed.

"Animal welfare is also important and I urge farmers to take best possible care of their stock in these challenging conditions, and to seek guidance if necessary," said Mr Carter.
