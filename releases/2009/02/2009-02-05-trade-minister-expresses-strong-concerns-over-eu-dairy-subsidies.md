Trade Minister Tim Groser today concludes a visit to Europe, where he has expressed New Zealand's strong concerns over the European Union's decision to reinsititute dairy export subsidies, and urged countries not to pursue further protectionist measures during the global economic crisis. 

"My trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, and then to Berlin and Brussels allowed me to strongly relate New Zealand's position against protectionist measures put in place by the EU on dairy exports.

"I met with several key European decision makers, notably Mariann Fischer Boel, the European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Baroness Catherine Ashton, the European Trade Commissioner, and Pascal Lamy, Director-General of the World Trade Organisation. 

"I related our desire to see an early end to the recently reintroduced EU dairy export subsidies, and of the growing concerns expressed - including by the Cairns Group - of the risk that the EU action could lead to an escalation of trade protection. 

"I also reminded ministerial counterparts, both in Brussels and at Davos, that G20 and APEC leaders last year had explicitly directed Trade Ministers to conclude the Doha Round of trade talks and not to resort to protectionist measures during the economic crisis. 

"A retreat to protectionist policies is not the way forward. Governments around the world must take a global political view and show they are committed to seeing an end to protectionism by concluding the Doha Round.

"So, I am very pleased Ministers at Davos have agreed to attach the highest priority to Doha," Mr Groser said.
