The National-led Government has delivered on its promise to introduce in its first 100 days law changes to combat violent crime and to repeal the controversial Electoral Finance Act.

The first reading today of the Sentencing and Parole Bill marked the eighth justice bill either passed into law or sent to select committee for public consultation since the Government was sworn in just 92 days ago.

Justice Minister Simon Power said the Government's prompt action to crack down on violent crime contrasted with the absence of action of the Labour Government in its dying years.

"On violent crime they did very little apart from making a lot of empty promises on gangs, youth crime, prison contraband, domestic violence, child sentencing the legal aid system, victims of crime, and prisoner compensation. They failed to deliver on any of them.

"By comparison, the National-led Government has acted swiftly and decisively in its first 92 days to change laws on:

- **Bail:** It is now harder for the wrong people to get bail.
- **Child sentencing** Courts are now required to take into account the defencelessness of children and long-term harm that can result.

We introduced laws that are at select committee for public consultation that:

- **Help combat family violence** by enabling police to issue on-the-spot protection orders.
- **Target gangs** by doubling penalties for being a member of a gang, and making it easier for police to intercept their communications.
- **Help clear unsolved crime** by enabling police to collect DNA from people they ‘intend to charge', and match it against samples from unsolved crimes.
- **Put victims at the centre of the justice system** by requiring offenders to pay into a fund to help victims with costs not available through other means.
- Remove parole eligibility for the worst repeat violent offenders and those convicted of the worst murders

"We also repealed the divisive and confusing Electoral Finance Act and put in place an interim regime that confirms cross-party talks and further consultation with the public to ensure broad agreement of enduring electoral law.

"The National***-***led Government has delivered on its promises to kick-start the battle against violent crime after years of neglect, and to repeal the EFA so New Zealand can once again have electoral law that is both fair and enduring," Mr Power said.
