The National Digital Heritage Archive - which will ensure New Zealand's digital memory is preserved in perpetuity - is being launched today by the Minister Responsible for the National Library Richard Worth.

Dr Worth said a public/private partnership between the National Library and international companies had resulted in the first commercially viable digital preservation system in the world.

"The NDHA will serve as the nation's storehouse for digital materials, websites, cds, dvds, images and digitised copies of print and audiovisual assets that make up our digital heritage collection," said Dr Worth.

"It will ensure that our digital heritage will be accessible years after the original technologies have become obsolete and that our country's digital memory is preserved."

Dr Worth said quality New Zealand content played an important role in promoting and enhancing our unique heritage, as well as helping businesses and communities build their knowledge and expertise. "Increasingly that content is digital and it is very important that we do not lose access to it."

He said the project was a great example of a successful collaboration between public and private partners with support from recognised thought leaders and innovators across the international library and academic communities. The Library partnered with international companies Sun Microsystems and Ex Libris Group.

Penny Carnaby, National Librarian and Chief Executive of the National Library, highlighted the benefits of this alliance. "A very important legacy of the National Digital Heritage Archive is the digital preservation and project management expertise that has been developed and retained within New Zealand through working with international partners."

The NDHA was established in 2004 with a budget of $24 million over five years. "I am very pleased that the project has successfully met its objectives and been delivered on time and to budget," said Ms Carnaby. "It is generating a lot of overseas interest and we are very proud to be leading the way in the future of digital preservation."
