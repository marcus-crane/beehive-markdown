Mr Ryall said, "Counties-Manukau DHB has the country's highest rate of diabetes. The DHB is to be applauded for its programme to try and reduce diabetes working with partner organisations."

"A huge amount of work is being done looking at different ways of treating kidney failure through renal dialysis. There is a big push to encourage and provide renal dialysis at home and in the community.

"Not everybody is well enough or confident enough to have renal dialysis at home or in a community house. The public still expects hospital based treatment - and it is needed for sicker people.

"I am encouraged to see the collaboration between primary and secondary care, and across the Auckland metro area as part of a larger plan to best meet the increasing need for renal treatment. The plan is to have a mix of community based and hospital treatment," the Minister said.

"This is a great example of how clinical leadership and regional collaboration will improve frontline services."

"There will be a tsunami of people with diabetes coming at us in the future and it is good to see DHBs collaborating on regional plans for the future management of this chronic disease."
