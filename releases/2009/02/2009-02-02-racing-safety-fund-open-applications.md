Racing Minister John Carter has announced that applications for the next round of the Racing Safety Development Fund are now open.

The Fund supports projects that enhance racecourse safety.

"The second round of the 2008/09 Racing Safety Fund is now open and racing clubs are invited to submit applications for funding," Mr Carter said.

"Racecourse health and safety is one of the most important issues in the industry. This includes the safety of riders, spectators, officials and others involved in racing, and the health and safety of the animals.

"Clubs need to actively address racecourse health and safety. The Fund is there to support their efforts.

"The Fund has supported a wide range of projects, including the installation of modern safe running rails, major structural repairs to hazardous grandstands, and the construction of safer horse stabling facilities," Mr Carter said.

"There are over 120 racing clubs racing at nearly 70 racecourses around the country. Clubs should be looking at the condition of their facilities and assessing whether they are a safe environment for their customers," Mr Carter said.

The Minister for Racing has written to all racing clubs inviting applications to the Fund. Applications need to be submitted by 31 March 2009.

Information on how to apply to the Racing Safety Development Fund, and a copy of the application form, is also available on the Department of Internal Affairs' website (www.dia.govt.nz) or by calling (04) 495 9391.
