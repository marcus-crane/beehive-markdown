New Zealand will make an initial contribution of $100,000 to help people affected by flooding in Solomon Islands, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today. 

"Heavy rain over the last week has caused significant flooding in parts of Guadalcanal Province, and the Solomon Islands government has declared a state of emergency," Mr McCully said.

"The official death toll currently stands at nine, and over 1000 families from 270 villages have been forced to leave their homes.

"There has also been extensive damage to infrastructure and food crops, and more rain is expected in the next few days.

"New Zealand's assistance will be channelled through the government's aid agency, NZAID, to groups in the Solomons who are managing the disaster response and helping affected communities with shelter, food, and water.

"The funding will also help the Guadalcanal provincial government establish its disaster centre, and charter ships to help with the relief effort where road access has been cut.

"Having recently visited the Solomons, I am acutely aware of how devastating the floods will be for a people who already face daily hardships.  On behalf of the government and all New Zealanders, I extend my condolences to the Solomon Islands government and its people," Mr McCully said.
