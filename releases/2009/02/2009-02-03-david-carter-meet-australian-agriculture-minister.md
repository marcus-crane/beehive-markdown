Discussions on the primary sector and climate change will be on the agenda when Agriculture, Forestry and Biosecurity Minister David Carter visits Canberra this week to meet his Australian counterpart, Tony Burke.

This will be the first time the Ministers have met, and it will be an important opportunity to discuss areas of mutual interest, said David Carter.

"The agenda will be wide ranging.  Australia and New Zealand share many issues of concern for the primary sector including drought management, water storage and infrastructure.  I also plan to look at the Australian experience with animal traceability systems and discuss the Australian Biosecurity Review with Tony Burke.

"We will compare notes on the economic state of the primary sectors in our two countries as part of a broader discussion on the challenging state of the global economy," Mr Carter said.

Mr Carter leaves for Canberra tomorrow.
