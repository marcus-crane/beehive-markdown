Health Minister Tony Ryall has thanked outgoing Waikato DHB chair Jerry Rickman for his contribution to the public health service.

"Mr Rickman has advised me that he is retiring as chair to avoid any perception of conflict of interest relating to contracts between the DHB and his ongoing consultancy to his former accounting firm," the Minister said.

"Mr Rickman has made an outstanding contribution to Waikato DHB, both as acting CEO and chair. His departure is a significant loss to the public health service. I thank him for his service and respect his decision.

"I have indicated to Mr Rickman that the public health system does not want to lose his expertise and experience, and that we are keen for him to return to a governance role elsewhere in the country when the opportunity arises," said Mr Ryall.
