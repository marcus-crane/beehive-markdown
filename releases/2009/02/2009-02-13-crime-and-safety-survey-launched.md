The New Zealand Crime and Safety Survey 2009, which gathers information on people's experience of crime and their views on public safety, will be launched tomorrow, Justice Minister Simon Power announced today.

Approximately 5,400 people throughout the country will be randomly selected to take part in interviews over the next for months.  Information from the three-yearly survey will be used in work to create safer neighbourhoods and communities.

"This survey provides information about crimes that have not been reported to police, which enhances our knowledge of New Zealanders' experiences of crime," Mr Power said.

"Results from the last survey carried out in 2006 showed only a third of offences recorded in the survey were reported to police.  People are also given the opportunity to express their views on safety and the impact of crime on their lives.

"The information gathered helps identify those most at risk of becoming victims of crime, the type of crimes being committed but not reported, and the services that victims are using."

Research company National Research Bureau will conduct the interviews, which will finished in June.

The survey is being managed by the Ministry of Justice, and data will be analysed by staff at the law faculty of Victoria University, the Ministry of Justice, and an independent statistician.  A report on the key findings is expected to be available by mid 2010.
