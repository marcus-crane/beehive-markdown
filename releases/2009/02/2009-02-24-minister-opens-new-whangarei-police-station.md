Police Minister Judith Collins today opened the new $20 million Whangarei police station, a facility designed to encourage greater community involvement in policing.

Ms Collins was joined by police and members of the community for today’s opening ceremony.

“I am committed to a police service that is well trained, well resourced and well supported. I am proud to be here today to open what is a truly world-class facility. But more than that, it is a facility built specifically to serve this community,” Ms Collins says.

The new station can accommodate150 staff and will be the hub of police operations in Whangarei. The facility is three times the size of the previous station which opened in 1963.

The building has a strong community focus. Iwi have been involved in the station from the planning stages, and there are community rooms in which police can meet and discuss issues with local groups.

The design of the facility also recognises the needs of victims of crime, with designated interview rooms that are not used for offenders, and purpose-built Victim Support facilities. The public and bail counters are also separate to prevent members of the public being intimidated by offenders.

“At the heart of policing is knowledge. This building is where knowledge of the community and knowledge of the people comes together,” says Ms Collins. “It is with this knowledge that the police and the community can work together to develop long-term solutions to law and order issues.”

A further three new police stations are due to be opened throughout New Zealand in the coming year, along with two stations that have undergone extensive refurbishment.

“This new station reinforces the Government’s commitment to safer communities and ensuring police are well resourced and supported,” Ms Collins says.
