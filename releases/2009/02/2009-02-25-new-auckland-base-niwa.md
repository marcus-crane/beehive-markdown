Minister for Research, Science and Technology Wayne Mapp opened the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research's new premises at the Viaduct Harbour in Auckland today.

The move to the refitted historic City Market building on Market Place from landlocked Khyber Pass Road brings NIWA closer to many of their key clients.

"The choice of the Viaduct is an expression of confidence in the future, and its profile in the science community. It gives an opportunity to showcase the importance of science, and particularly NIWA's role in oceanographic and climate research," Dr Mapp said.

"The role that NIWA has in these areas is of global significance. To have members of the NIWA team among the group of scientists who received the Nobel Peace Prize is a great testament to the quality of the climate research.

"NIWA's marine aquaculture is pioneering, particularly in the cultivating of paua. This is how whole new markets and products are developed. Their work in oceanographic and climate research is among the most important scientific research of the 21st century. I'm sure they will keep delivering that here, right by the ocean, one of the main focuses of their work."

The renovated building contains NIWA's corporate head office and laboratory space for its scientists. "NIWA's decision to renovate, rather than buy new, and the smart and efficient environmental choices made in that renovation, reflect the contemporary urban scene and New Zealand's pride in its environment," the Minister said.

"This new building shows an organisation that is strong and confident. It is a commitment to the people who make up NIWA. I congratulate the NIWA management and research teams on that expression of confidence, which is now so important, not just for yourselves but also the wider community."
