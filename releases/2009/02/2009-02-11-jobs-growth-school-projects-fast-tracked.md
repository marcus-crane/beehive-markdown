New schools will be built and refurbishments brought forward under a $216.7 million boost to education in the Government’s Jobs and Growth Plan.

Education Minister Anne Tolley says the money will be used to accelerate the construction of new schools, improve existing school buildings across the country, and to upgrade ICT infrastructure in schools.

"This work will create jobs and it is excellent news for communities which are in need of either new schools or better facilities,” Mrs Tolley says.

"The work will be spread widely across the country and will provide valuable work for businesses both large and small in the current economic environment."

The education boost includes:

- $68.7 million to accelerate the building of five new schools: Mt Wellington Primary, Papamoa Primary, Kerikeri Primary, Hingaia Primary and Papamoa Secondary.
- $30 million to allow 64 schools to have better administration buildings, halls and libraries.
- $9 million to expand facilities at special schools and satellite units.
- $34 million to upgrade ICT infrastructure in schools so that more of them are broadband ready.
- $30 million to improve four Upper Hutt schools: Upper Hutt College, Heretaunga College, Fergusson Intermediate and Maidstone Intermediate.
- $11 million to replace outdated and rundown buildings in seven schools: Pt Chevalier School, Manurewa East School, Cambridge High School, Kuranui College, Somerfield School, Christchurch South Intermediate, and Lyttelton Main School.
- $6 million to establish a trades academy on Southern Cross Campus in Mangere.
- $28 million to help schools accelerate existing building projects that have stalled.
