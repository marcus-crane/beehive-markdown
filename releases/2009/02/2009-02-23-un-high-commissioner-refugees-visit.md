The head of the United Nations refugee agency is coming to New Zealand for two days this week. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Antonio Guterres, will meet the Prime Minister, John Key, the Foreign Affairs Minister, Murray McCully and the Immigration Minister, Jonathan Coleman.

"It is great to be able to host Mr Guterres on his first visit to New Zealand," says Dr Coleman.

"New Zealand is internationally recognised for its refugee and resettlement practice. We are really looking forward to hosting the High Commissioner and to re-emphasising New Zealand's commitment to the refugee resettlement process."

New Zealand is one of a small number of countries in the world who, in addition to their Convention responsibilities, also accept an annual quota of refugees for resettlement. Everyone accepted under the refugee quota has been determined by the UNHCR as being refugees. The present refugee quota for New Zealand is 750 per year, plus or minus 10 per cent.
