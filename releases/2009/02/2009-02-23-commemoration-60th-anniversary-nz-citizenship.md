People from all walks of life - ranging from new migrants to eminent Kiwis - will today mark the 60th anniversary of New Zealand citizenship.

Minister of Internal Affairs Richard Worth is hosting an event at Parliament this evening to celebrate the milestone. The Governor General Anand Satyanand and Prime Minister John Key will be speaking at the event.

On 1 January 1949 the British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act 1948 came into force and most people living in New Zealand on that day became New Zealand citizens.

Prior to this date they were British subjects living in New Zealand. The Act also meant that most children born in New Zealand after 1 January 1949 were automatically New Zealand citizens. 

During the evening a small group of migrants will take the final step in the process of becoming New Zealand citizens. An educational website, which provides a range of citizenship education resources for teachers and students, will also be launched.

"The creation of New Zealand citizenship was an important step in New Zealand's path to independence as a nation," said Dr Worth.

"Citizenship is often taken for granted by people who are citizens by birth. This diamond anniversary is an opportunity to think about what New Zealand means to us all and what we can all do to make it greater."

Dr Worth said that every year thousands of migrants become New Zealanders in ceremonies held around the country. "In this 60th anniversary year those ceremonies will be particularly special. We welcome these new citizens into the New Zealand family."
