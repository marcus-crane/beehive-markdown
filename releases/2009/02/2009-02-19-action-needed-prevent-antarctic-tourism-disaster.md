Confirmation that passengers on a grounded tourist ship in Antarctica are safe is welcome news, but the accident highlights the need for stricter controls in the Southern Ocean, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.

"If nothing is done, it will be only a matter of time before there is a disaster in the Southern Ocean. The international community must take steps to ensure that never happens," Mr McCully said.

"To that end, New Zealand will host a conference later this year on Antarctic ship-borne tourism. The focus will be on how to prevent a major maritime accident, and how to put controls around what is a rapidly-expanding, but currently inadequately regulated industry.

"Tourist ships pose a significant risk not only to human life, but also to a pristine, fragile environment. The number of people cruising in Antarctic waters has quadrupled to 46,000 in the last 15 years, which has resulted in visits from bigger tourist ships that just aren't suited to the conditions.

"It is also critical that the industry recognises that the Southern Ocean is a remote, inhospitable, and dangerous place for tourist vessels, that is difficult for Search and Rescue services to reach in the case of an emergency," Mr McCully said.

Attendees at the conference will include experts from the 47 countries that are party to the Antarctic Treaty, along with representatives from the tourism industry, international institutions, and NGOs.
