Defence Minister Wayne Mapp leaves tomorrow \[EDS: Monday 16 February] to attend the annual International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) Defence Ministers meeting in Krakow, Poland, next Thursday.

On his way to Poland the Minister will hold talks with the British Minister for International Defence and Security, Baroness Taylor, in London. In his other portfolio, Research, Science and Technology, he will meet Lord Drayson, the British Minister of State for Science and Technology, before travelling to Krakow on Wednesday.

"New Zealand is making a highly-valued contribution to the work of the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Afghanistan," Dr Mapp said.

"This meeting will provide a forum for me to engage with fellow ISAF ministers on this key defence and foreign policy issue for New Zealand.

"I will also be having a series of bilateral meetings with Defence Ministers from our key partners in ISAF and NATO."
