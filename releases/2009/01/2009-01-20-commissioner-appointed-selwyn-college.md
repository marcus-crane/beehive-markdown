Education Minister Anne Tolley today announced that she has dissolved the board of trustees of Selwyn College and has directed the Secretary of Education to appoint a Commissioner to replace the board.

"My decision follows an Education Review Office report that recommends increasing the level of intervention currently in place. A specialist adviser was appointed to assist the board in 2007, and it is my opinion that the most appropriate step now is to appoint a Commissioner."

Mrs Tolley says there has been a history of differences between board members and the community which has had an impact on the operation of the school. Enrolments have declined and many families are opting not to send their children to their local school.

Among its findings, the ERO says *‘the board's progress is still marred by its inability to consult and communicate effectively with some groups in the local community'* and that *‘ERO is not confident that the board of trustees has sufficient capacity without external support to govern in the interests of all students and the Crown'*.

"This decision has not been taken lightly. I have come to the conclusion that appointing a Commissioner to Selwyn College is the right way forward. It is in the best interests of pupils, teachers, senior management and the wider community and, I believe, the best way to improve the quality of governance, teaching and student achievement."
