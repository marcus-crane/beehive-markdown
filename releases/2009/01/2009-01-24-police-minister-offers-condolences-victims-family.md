Police Minister Judith Collins today expressed her deepest sympathies to the family of 17-year-old Halatau Naitoko who died in a shooting on Auckland's North-western Motorway yesterday.

"I am deeply saddened, and today offered my sincerest condolences to Halatau's family," Ms Collins says.

"My thoughts are with them at this difficult time. As a parent, I can't begin to imagine the pain and sadness they must feel at the loss of their beloved son, brother and father.

"I have been assured by the Prime Minister that the government and its agencies will provide whatever assistance and support they can to help the family through the days and months ahead."

Investigations are being conducted by the police, the Independent Police Conduct Authority and the Coroner into the circumstances of yesterday's shooting.

"I have confidence that these investigations will establish how the incident unfolded and provide lessons that might prevent a similar tragedy from occurring in the future," Ms Collins says.

"My thoughts are also with the police who face difficult and sometimes life-threatening situations while serving the public. I'm sure they also feel devastated by these terrible events."
