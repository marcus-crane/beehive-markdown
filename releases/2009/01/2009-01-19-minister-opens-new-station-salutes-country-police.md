Police are the cornerstone of rural communities, says Police Minister Judith Collins who today opened a new police station in the South Waikato town of Piopio.

"In a town the size of Piopio, which has a population of about 2000, the local policeman is the cornerstone of the community," Ms Collins says.

"Therefore it is essential that police have the resources and support they need to keep the public and themselves safe."

Ms Collins was joined by police and members of the local community for today's opening ceremony.

The previous Piopio police station was opened in May 1960 and combined the station and the resident police officer's house. 

The new station creates a separate office area away from the officer's home and contains dedicated interview facilities, a holding room, fingerprinting facilities and a work area.

Ms Collins paid tribute to the role of police in rural communities throughout New Zealand.

"In rural towns such as this, the police are not just upholders of the law. They are helpers, rescuers, mediators, protectors, counsellors and the voices of common sense," Ms Collins says.

"Country cops are a special breed. I hope this building enables them to continue serving the people or Piopio with professionalism and pride."

A further five new police stations are due to opened throughout New Zealand in the coming year, along with two stations that have undergone extensive refurbishment.

"This new station reinforces the Government's commitment to safer communities and ensuring police are well resourced and supported," Ms Collins says.
