Agriculture and Forestry Minister David Carter says while recent rain over past weeks has relieved dry weather conditions in parts of the country, the Government will continue to monitor high risk areas closely.

"Reports show the situation seems to be holding and, in some areas, has improved over the past month. However, we are still keeping a close watch on North Canterbury and the east coast of the North Island.

"Recent rainfall has not been sufficient to remove the risk of drought for North Canterbury and the east coast of the North Island. High temperatures in these regions mean that low soil moisture content is still a cause of concern.

"While analysis shows that, overall, the national situation is better than it was this time last year, I urge farmers, especially those in at-risk regions, to prepare and plan for the balance of the season. This includes planning for winter feed supplies and stocking options. Farmers can obtain advice through their local rural support trust.

"The last drought had devastating effects for farmers and the economy. A key lesson learnt was recognising the signs early and having contingency plans in place," Mr Carter said.

"Farming communities are the backbone of New Zealand and the government is fully committed to offering support as required. We are monitoring the situation closely through officials and local drought committees. Processes are in place to provide special government assistance if a drought is declared.

"The agriculture sector is at the very heart of New Zealand's economic performance and the government is committed to doing all it can to support our rural communities."

**Background**

- Early 2008 the east coasts of both Islands were very dry, with Gisborne, Hawke's Bay, coastal Marlborough, North-Mid Canterbury and Otago rapidly approaching drought status. Other dry areas included Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Wairarapa, and Manawatu.
- Rain over the month has improved conditions for most parts of the country. North Canterbury, however, continues to be a critical hot spot, with conditions deteriorating in the past month. The East Coast of the North Island, particularly Gisborne - Wairoa, followed by Hawke's Bay also still has very dry conditions, although this may hold out according to NIWA's La Nina report (below).
- NIWA's seasonal climate outlook for January to March 2009 indicates that average or above average temperatures are likely across the whole country. Below normal rainfall is likely in much of the South Island, while normal or above normal rainfall is likely over the North Island. Soils are presently drier than normal in many eastern regions. Below normal soil moisture levels and below normal stream flows are likely in much of the South Island through to March, while near normal conditions are likely in the North Island. http://niwa.co.nz/ncc/seasonal\_climate\_outlook
- Between February and July last year, New Zealand was affected by a severe drought. Drought recovery measures such as special funding for farm management advice and counselling through organisations including Rural Support Trusts and Rural Women New Zealand, social and welfare support through the Ministry of Social Development and special tax measures through Inland Revenue were activated. The measures for the 2007/2008 drought ceased at the end of 2008.
