Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen will hold talks with Foreign Minister Murray McCully when he visits New Zealand on Thursday and Friday.

"I am delighted Mr Verhagen is able to come to New Zealand, as it has been several years since we last hosted a Dutch minister, and his visit will further strengthen our already rich bilateral relationship," Mr McCully said.

"Our countries have a long association - reflected in New Zealand being named after the southern Dutch province of Zeeland - and it is estimated that four percent of New Zealanders have Dutch ancestry.

"Mr Verhagen and I will discuss a wide range of issues, including Fiji, Gaza, and the potential for enhancing New Zealand's relationship with the European Union, of which the Netherlands is an active and important member."

Mr McCully will also host a dinner for Mr Verhagen, which will be attended by Trade Minister Tim Groser.
