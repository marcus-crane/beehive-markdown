The Minister of Maori Affairs called for Maori leaders to consider bold initiatives to address the impact of the economic crisis on Maori and New Zealanders, as he opened his economic workshop in Wellington this morning

Dr Sharples also announced that he will establish a Maori Affairs Ministerial Taskforce n the Economy, which he will personally chair.

"This parliamentary term will be defined by how we negotiate the swirling economic waters ahead," said Dr Sharples.  "We have faced these perils before, and for Maori, the experience was disastrous."

"We know that too many of our whanau are still recovering from the intergenerational effects of long term unemployment and grinding poverty," he said.

Dr Sharples said Research by the Child Poverty Action Group indicates that between 40 and 50 percent of Maori children live in benefit dependent families.

"The children of low income families are in a precarious state with too many lives at risk as a consequence of severe and significant hardship. These children must be in our every thought as we venture forwards."

However Dr Sharples said Maori were in better shape to face a recession, both economically and culturally.

"Generally our business and organisations are conservative, investment portfolios are careful; our strategic vision is shaped by building capacity and capital development." He said. "This offers a strong platform to bring forward infrastructure, community and educational programs.

"There is also another aspect to our story today, which some commentators are calling the "Maori edge" - basically our comparative advantage in business."

He said a tradition as explorers and entrepreneurs enables Maori to develop their growing asset base in innovative ways.

"My desire for this Maori economic workshop today \[is] that we bring together our knowledge and expertise and that indisputable Maori edge; to take a leading role in the nation's economy, in ways which are nothing short of outstanding."

Dr Sharples said the workshop was not just a one day wonder.

"We have entered a new era, with a commitment that is driven by kaupapa Maori, a vision that will be guided by tikanga.

"I am hopeful that the discussions today, will also lead into a bigger and bolder movement to sustain and engage Maori economic self-determination   It's now our time to take a leading role in New Zealand's economy," he said.

The Minister said the concentration of Maori assets in primary industries exposes them to global markets.

"Maori are also expected to suffer as small businesses and tourist operations suffer the consequences of a volatile market."

But he said Maori already have strong networks in Asian markets.

"Some predict that the new G7 countries by 2025 will be China, the USA, India, Japan, Brazil, Russia and Mexico.  Global population trends re-inforce this story of change.    We must ensure our Maori workforce is equipped to take to the world stage," said Dr Sharples.

He warned that a narrow focus on business and the economy, at the expense of the environment, is not sustainable.

"The concepts of guardianship, of respect for the earth and water, of care for the generations to come are central to our traditions and customary rights.  As Minister of Maori Affairs I want to make sure that the voice of Maori and the interests of Maori are listened to.

"We can not just carry on with a strategy which assumes exponential growth is the solution - without at the same time educating each other about how to manage in a post-carbon world.  That requires, at the very least, energy, social and agricultural reform to prepare for our future."

While the workshop focused on Maori business and economy, Dr Sharples called for leadership for the benefit of the nation as a whole.

"The challenge ahead of us all is deadly serious.  We must think of all our populations; all our communities; all our whanau in every deliberation we take today.
