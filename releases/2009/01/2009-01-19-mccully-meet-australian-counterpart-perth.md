Foreign Minister Murray McCully travels to Perth tomorrow for the latest round of six-monthly talks with his Australian counterpart, Stephen Smith. 

"These formal talks play an important role in managing New Zealand's most important international relationship," Mr McCully said.

"However it is a mark of the strength and closeness of the trans-Tasman connection that while this will be our first six-monthly dialogue together, it will be the third time we have met since November's election.

"The agenda will be wide ranging. We will compare notes on what we are doing together to support economic development and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. 

"Fiji will be another important focus, with Forum leaders due to meet in Port Moresby on 27 January.  Mr Smith and I will discuss how we can best work with counterparts from other Pacific countries to pave the way for a return to democracy in Fiji.

"We will also look at developments in Asia, which is a critical region for both countries, and exchange perspectives on Afghanistan and Timor Leste, where New Zealand and Australia both continue to make significant military, aid, and diplomatic investments.

"Other issues likely to be discussed will be the Middle East -- especially the fragile ceasefire in Gaza -- as well as whaling, United Nations issues, and Zimbabwe," Mr McCully said.
