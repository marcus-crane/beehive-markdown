New Zealand is to give a further $500,000 to organisations helping communities hit by flooding in Fiji, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.

"Latest reports from Fiji indicate the flooding is subsiding, but over 10,500 people remain in evacuation centres, and 11 deaths have now been confirmed," Mr McCully said.

"It is clear the people of Fiji are in need of assistance from the international community, and the New Zealand government is committed to providing immediate aid.   

"Our initial contribution of $100,000, announced on Monday, enabled Fiji Red Cross to replenish its emergency stocks and to continue relief efforts this week during the second period of heavy rain and flooding. 

"Of the funding announced today, $300,000 will go towards supplying items identified by Fiji's Disaster Management Committee as being urgently needed -- in particular water tanks and containers, water purification tablets, and rehydration salts -- which will be provided by international agencies such as UNICEF, or directly by NZAID.

"Up to a further $200,000 will be available for organisations with an established presence in affected areas, subject to a proposal process run through the New Zealand High Commission in Suva.

"It is clear that the flooding has caused significant damage to infrastructure, businesses and crops in Fiji. Over the coming weeks the immediate relief phase will become a longer-term recovery effort.

"As more detailed assessments come in from Fiji we will consider further requests for assistance.  

 "It is also appropriate at this point to acknowledge the generosity of communities and individuals in New Zealand who have supported the relief effort," Mr McCully said.

New Zealanders wishing to help with relief efforts or make donations are asked to visit the [NZAID How you Can Help webpage](http://web.nzaid.intranet/what-we-do/how-you-can-help.html) for information on how they can best provide support.

New Zealanders planning to visit Fiji should monitor the situation and contact their travel agent for the latest information, as there is a possibility that travel plans may be disrupted. New Zealanders currently in Fiji are encouraged to register their details on [www.safetravel.govt.nz](http://www.safetravel.govt.nz/).
