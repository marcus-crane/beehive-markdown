Prime Minister John Key has become aware within the past 24 hours of the existence of letters written by Paula Bennett to the Parole Board and to a court.

The letters were written before Ms Bennett became a Cabinet Minister and relate to Viliami Halaholo.

"I am disappointed I was not made aware of these letters a week earlier when I asked Ms Bennett about issues relating to this man," Mr Key says.

"However, I accept that no deliberate attempt was made to mislead me.

"I continue to hold the view that none of Ms Bennett's actions breach her responsibilities as a Minister.

"She continues to enjoy my confidence and I look forward to her making a good contribution as a Minister in my Cabinet.

"I encourage all of my Ministers to be upfront and open with me at all times," says Mr Key.
