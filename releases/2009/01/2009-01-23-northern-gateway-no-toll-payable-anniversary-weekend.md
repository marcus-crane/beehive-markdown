Motorists using the new Northern Gateway Toll Road this holiday weekend will be exempt from toll payments, following the road's opening this Sunday morning.

In making the announcement, Transport Minister Steven Joyce said it was a great opportunity for travellers to have their first use of the road at zero cost on Sunday and Monday.

"It will also minimise any chance of disruption resulting from people not familiar with the system or how the tolling works."

The road, which provides a more direct route between Northland and Auckland, will be New Zealand's first fully electronic toll road.

Mr Joyce says the road will bring a range of significant benefits - both to the communities concerned and the country as a whole.

"Although the road ends at Puhoi at the moment - as we signalled prior to the election, the Government is committed to advancing plans for further extensions of the four-laning of State Highway One as far north as Wellsford.

"The further extension will go a long way to remedying what has been a very troublesome stretch of highway - easing congestion and enhancing safety.

"The economic benefits to Northland and Rodney will be significant as access is made easier. Reduced travel times will make these regions even more attractive for tourism and businesses looking beyond Auckland for growth opportunities.

"I wish all road users safe driving this Auckland anniversary weekend," says Mr Joyce.
