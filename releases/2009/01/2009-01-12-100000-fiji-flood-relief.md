New Zealand is making up to $100,000 available to assist relief efforts following major flooding in western parts of Fiji, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"Heavy rain and strong winds have causing extensive flooding in recent days. A state of emergency has been declared in western Fiji, with the worst affected areas being Nadi, Sigatoka, and Ba," Mr McCully said.

"Four deaths have been confirmed and two Fijian teenagers are missing. To date floods have forced over 2,300 people to to move to evacuation centres, and more bad weather is predicted when a second tropical depression reaches Fiji later this week.

"The funding announced today will initially be made available to Fiji Red Cross. Further allocations will be made according to the needs of relief agencies who are working with communities affected by the flooding.

"New Zealand's assistance will help Fiji Red Cross replenish emergency stocks such as water containers, tarpaulins, and medical supplies. This will help ensure they are able to continue to help people if further bad weather hits Fiji as forecast." Mr McCully said.

New Zealanders wishing to help with relief efforts or make donations are asked to visit  the NZAID website (link to [http://www.nzaid.govt.nz/what-we-do/how-you-can-help.html](http://www.nzaid.govt.nz/what-we-do/how-you-can-help.html)) for information on how they can best provide support.
