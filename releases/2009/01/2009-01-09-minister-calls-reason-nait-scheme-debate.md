Biosecurity Minister David Carter today called for reason in the debate over the proposed National Animal Identification and Tracing (NAIT) scheme.

Mr Carter says there seems to be some scaremongering over the proposed scheme.

"The emotion needs to be taken out of this debate and the facts considered.  I want to reassure farmers I will be doing the best for our sector.

"Federated Farmers has raised some legitimate concerns about compliance costs.  The last thing this Government wants to do is impose unnecessary costs on farm businesses. As I have said before, the economics of any scheme must be affordable.

"I know the majority of farmers can see sense in having a robust and internationally credible traceability scheme.

"New Zealand's existing food safety systems are world class, but there are gaps and current schemes don't provide the lifetime traceability of individual animals that other countries are now implementing.

"NAIT has been proposed because assessments of current systems suggest that costs involved in adapting existing systems would cost more than building a new one.

"The proposed scheme is about future-proofing New Zealand agriculture.  It would ensure a common ID platform and standards.  The NAIT proposal is one tool that will meet the growing requirements of our trading partners, as well as improve New Zealand's ability to manage new incursions and existing pests and diseases.

"I'd point out that there's still a second stage business study to come from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, which will be completed in June.  It should answer the concerns raised by Federated Farmers.

"I want to reassure farmers that until the full cost/benefit analysis of the scheme is complete, the Government is not going to make a final commitment.  Federated Farmers plays an important role in advocating for farmers, and I sincerely hope they will engage constructively so we get the best solution for everybody."
