Discussions on the European Commission's recent decision to reintroduce dairy export subsidies will be high on the agenda as Trade Minister Tim Groser travels to Switzerland, Germany and Belgium from 28 January to 5 February 2009.

Mr Groser plans to meet with European Trade Commissioner Baroness Catherine Ashton while in Europe. 

"I will be seeking assurances from the EU that the decision to resume export subsidies is a temporary measure. The decision has sent a negative signal at a critical time for the global economy," he said.

Mr Groser will attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Heads of state, Finance, Trade and Energy Ministers from about 96 countries are expected to participate in the Forum.

"The quality of attendants at Davos makes this a valuable forum to discuss and debate the future of the world economy. This will be particularly so this year as countries make plans to recover from recession."

In Davos, Mr Groser will meet ministers from Australia, India, Brazil, Japan, and Indonesia and the Director-General of the WTO, Pascal Lamy, to discuss responses to the global financial crisis, including how to conclude the long-running WTO Doha Round of trade talks. 

Mr Groser will visit Brussels, Belgium where he will meet the European Union's Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development Mariann Fischer Boel to follow up these issues.

He will also travel to Berlin, Germany where he will meet with German Economic Minister Michael Glos and senior officials involved in both WTO and international climate change negotiations.

Mr Groser will take the opportunity to review efforts to strengthen New Zealand's presence in the German market. Germany is an important economic trading partner for New Zealand with exports including lamb, kiwifruit, dairy, fish, venison and wine.
