The United Nations' call to prioritise employment in economic planning is right in line with the initiatives put in place by the National Government to offset the global recession, says Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson.

"The Global Employment Trends report highlights just how extensive job losses could be throughout the world.

"The possibility of up to 30 million more people being unemployed globally compared to 2007 is extremely significant, and New Zealand is not immune to that.

Ms Wilkinson said the policy ideas laid out in the UN report, including wider coverage of unemployment benefits, re-training of redundant workers and tripartite discussions with employers and unions were already Government priorities.

"The Government has already moved to implement financial packages for workers made redundant due to the recession, while the 90-Day Bill will encourage small businesses to take on new staff who might not necessarily have the required experience for the job.

"Those on the benefit who enter employment on a trial period also have the security of knowing they don't have to wait 13 weeks - the normal stand down period - to go back on the benefit if the job doesn't work out."

The Prime Minister's Employment Summit announced for February is also a crucial forum as the Government looks to work with all sectors to ensure job security, Ms Wilkinson said.

"Our biggest priority must be to ensure the security of our workforce and limit redundancies by every means possible.

"It is inevitable that jobs will be lost, but through training initiatives, good management and investment in the workforce, New Zealand can emerge from this downturn with an internationally competitive economy."
