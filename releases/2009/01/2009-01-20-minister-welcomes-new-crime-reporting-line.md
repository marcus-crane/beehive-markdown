Police Minister Judith Collins has welcomed today's launch of a Crime Reporting Line (CRL) in Counties-Manukau as an important step in streamlining police responses to crime.

The CRL is a dedicated crime reporting service that will receive and action non-emergency calls, reducing pressure on the emergency 111 system.

CRL staff will take non-emergency crime reports on the phone, reducing the need for people to go into police stations in person to make a report.

"The CRL is part of an ongoing effort to streamline police processes and improve response times to crime," Ms Collins says.

"The CRL will not only make it easier for the public to report crime, but it will free up police to attend and investigate more serious or complex crime."

Counties-Manukau is the third police district to use the CRL. It has been operating successfully in the Auckland and Bay of Plenty Districts since November 2006.

Counties-Manukau residents who call their local police station to report non-urgent crime and incidents such as historic burglaries, unlawful taking, lost property, graffiti, stolen or abandoned vehicles will now be transferred through to the Northern Police Communications Centre, where CRL staff are based.

Specially trained CRL staff will take all the details of the incident and arrange for the appropriate response over the phone.

The service was initiated after the 2005 Independent Review of Police Communications Centres.

The public should continue to do exactly what they do now and give their local station a call if they have a non-emergency incident to report. The operator will then transfer them to CRL staff.

"The CRL reinforces the Government's commitment to safer communities and ensuring police are well resourced and supported," Ms Collins says.
