Education Minister Anne Tolley today unveiled a package of changes that reflect the government's commitment to providing quality and accessible early childhood education to all New Zealand families.

"Late last year I asked officials to review the 2008 regulations around early childhood education so that any unnecessary compliance burdens on services could be removed.

"Following that, I signalled my intent to amend some of the 2008 regulations while I consulted with both parents and the sector. These amended regulations will come into effect from tomorrow.

"It is important that we have an appropriate level of regulation that ensures safe learning environments for our children, but equally important that services are not drowned in red tape."

Mrs Tolley says she will consult with early childhood education services and meet with parents over the shape of any future regulations to ensure any proposals are well considered.

"We are also making it easier for parents to access 20 Hours ECE by removing the need to sign a separate attestation form stating how many services their children are enrolled in. From 1 March 2009, parents can make this declaration on their child's enrolment form. The 20 hours early childhood education programme will be renamed 20 Hours ECE - a more honest expression of the programme's intent that reflects what parents and early childhood services already know."

In addition, adult:child ratio changes planned by the previous government will not be introduced.

"While these are small steps, they reflect my desire to make things easier for parents and service providers by getting rid of unnecessary bureaucracy and ensuring all families have access to high quality early childhood education."
