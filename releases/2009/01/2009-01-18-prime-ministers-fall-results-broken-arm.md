Prime Minister John Key broke his arm in two places in a fall at an event in Auckland on Saturday.

The fall occurred while exiting the stage using some stairs at a Chinese New Year event at the ASB Showgrounds, Greenlane, yesterday morning.

This morning he sought specialist medical attention for his arm. It was found that his right arm was broken in two places.

The arm is now in a cast and Mr Key has a further appointment with a specialist tomorrow to see whether an operation will be necessary.

At this stage Mr Key is planning to carry on his usual schedule tomorrow.
