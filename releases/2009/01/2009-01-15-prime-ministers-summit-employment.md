Prime Minister John Key wants action from the Prime Minister's Summit on Employment to be held on 27 February in Auckland.

"The summit will be chaired by NZX chief executive officer Mark Weldon and will address a major challenge the country faces this year - how to retain and grow jobs.

"As I have stated many times, I am interested in what works, not ideology.

"New Zealand is facing challenging economic times as the global economic crisis washes over us. The National-led Government is implementing its economic plan, and we will see more initiatives in coming months.

"The summit will bring together business, union and other leaders in the community to address a vital part of a healthy economy - employment.

"A detailed agenda is still being developed, but we envisage that the summit will be open to the media.

"I am determined that this won't be a talk-fest. I want to see outcomes from the summit that we can move to examine and implement.

"In addition to the summit, I will be making a speech on the economy on Wednesday, 4 February, in Waitakere City.

"More details on the speech venue, and information on the summit, will be released in due course."
