Transport Minister Steven Joyce is encouraged by the record low road toll in 2008 but says there is no room for complacency on our roads.

The 2008 toll of 359 compares to 421 road deaths in 2007, and is the lowest annual total since 1959.

"It's good to see the road toll coming down but there are still too many lives lost or ruined on our roads," says Mr Joyce.

"Most fatal crashes are preventable - with alcohol and speed still the biggest killers on our roads."

Alcohol was a factor in 34% of deaths and speed was a factor in 36% of deaths in 2008.

No single factor was responsible for the lower road toll. The Government is focused on a combination of education, enforcement and engineering.

Other factors, such as higher fuel prices and the economic downturn are likely to have had an impact on the toll. International evidence shows economic activity can have an affect on the road toll, with a correlation between the number of journeys and the number of crashes.

Mr Joyce says there are still disturbing trends on the roads.

"The number of people seriously injured has not decreased, staying at around 2,600 per year for the last 10 years, and there has been a recent increase in the number of motorcycle accidents.

"We all need to keep taking real care on our roads, especially through the remainder of this holiday period.  Already we have had too many deaths and injuries on the road during the Christmas-New Year period."
