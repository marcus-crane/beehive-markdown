Prime Minister John Key has called a meeting of economic Ministers for Thursday to discuss the economic issues facing the country. 

"The economy will be the dominant issue for the country in 2009," he says.

"Ministers will be discussing the economic outlook, receiving briefings including an update on the international situation and planning future initiatives.

"The National-led Government is on-track with its action plan for the first 100 days, but we recognise more will need to be done to help address the challenges New Zealand faces.

"The Government's aims for the economy include putting more money in New Zealanders' pockets, better control of government spending and more productive use of public money, and building a stronger economy with more jobs by making businesses more productive and competitive.

"The meeting will take place in the Beehive on Thursday afternoon."

Ministers Bill English, Gerry Brownlee, Simon Power, Tony Ryall and Steven Joyce, will attend along with the chief executives of Treasury, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, and State Services Commission.
