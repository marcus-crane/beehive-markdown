It's 60 years to the day \[1 January 1949] since New Zealanders became New Zealand citizens in their own right. 

On this day in 1949 the British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act 1948 came into force and most people living in New Zealand on that day became New Zealand citizens.  Prior to this they were solely British subjects. 

It also meant that children born in New Zealand from 1 January 1949 automatically became New Zealand citizens. 

Minister of Internal Affairs Richard Worth said the creation of New Zealand citizenship was an important step in New Zealand's path to independence as a nation.

"New Zealand citizenship is the glue that binds the nation. It is a shared bond between most people born in New Zealand or to New Zealand citizen parents and people born in Tokelau, Niue and the Cook Islands. 

"Since 1949 many migrants to New Zealand have chosen to apply for citizenship. We welcome them into the New Zealand family.  Our shared citizenship transcends religion, ethnicity and cultural background, it is about fully belonging to New Zealand rather than just living here," Dr Worth said.

The Internal Affairs Department plans to hold a number of special commemorative events to mark this milestone year. 

The planned events include a Parliamentary function in February, the launch of an educational website, a school essay competition, and a number of special citizenship ceremonies throughout the country.  

The aim of these initiatives is to raise awareness of the meaning, importance and benefits of citizenship. There will be a number of citizenship ceremonies which the Minister of Internal Affairs will be attending and speaking at.

The key themes are:

Independence:  The creation of New Zealand citizenship was an important step towards New Zealand becoming a fully independent nation.

Importance: The rights and responsibilities of New Zealand citizenship mean that citizenship is an important aspect of the lives of New Zealanders. 

Inclusion: New Zealand citizenship is a 'shared bond' between migrants who have taken up the grant of citizenship, people born in New Zealand, people born to New Zealanders overseas and Tokelauans, Niueans and Cook Islanders.  The shared bond exists no matter what religion, ethnicity or cultural background each individual has.
