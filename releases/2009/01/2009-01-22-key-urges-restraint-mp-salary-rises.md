Prime Minister John Key has urged the independent Remuneration Authority not to increase MPs' salaries in the coming year as New Zealand faces tougher economic times.

Mr Key has today written to the authority to express the Government's view that it should exercise restraint when next considering salaries within its jurisdiction.

The National Party will also file a submission with the authority recommending a zero pay increase for Parliamentary salaries at the appropriate time.

"The New Zealand economy is facing what looks to be a difficult time ahead," Mr Key says.

"It is only right that in these changing economic times, as ordinary New Zealanders tighten their belts, MPs and ministers also play their part.

"While the Remuneration Authority is an independent body I would hope that it recognises the current economic climate calls for a cautious use of taxpayer money.

"The National-led Government is committed to getting New Zealand through challenging economic times and onto a path towards better economic growth.

"This Government is implementing its economic plan and more initiatives will be coming in the next month.

"I think it is wholly appropriate that the Government leads by example," Mr Key says.
