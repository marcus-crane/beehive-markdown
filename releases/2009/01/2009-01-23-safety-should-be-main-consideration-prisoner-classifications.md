The safety of the public and Corrections staff must be the main consideration when deciding prisoner security classifications, Corrections Minister Judith Collins says.

Ms Collins today said she was concerned that prisoners who might still be a threat to the public and Corrections staff could receive a low security classification under existing regulations.

"I will be taking a close look at the current regulations and seeing if there is any way they can be fine-tuned to better protect the public and Corrections staff," Ms Collins says.

The issue of prisoner security classifications was highlighted this week when Arai Hema, 30, disappeared from a work party at Auckland Prison on Wednesday. He was classified as low risk.

Only low to medium security prisoners are permitted to work outside the prison.

Hema was serving a 17-year sentence for the rape of a 16-year-old Napier girl and the attempted murder of 76-year-old Bruce Butler, who attempted to intervene.

During his sentence, Hema injured three Corrections staff. He threw boiling water over a staff member and attacked others, one with a shovel which caused permanent injuries.

The security classification system was last reviewed in April 2007. Currently, inmates who display good behaviour over an extended period of time and attend prescribed rehabilitation programmes receive progressively lower security classifications.

"It is of great concern that an inmate who has attacked staff with a shovel should be permitted to join a working party," Ms Collins says.

"Clearly, some prisoners who should have a higher security classification are being given a low security classification if they meet certain criteria.

"It is important to rehabilitate prisoners where we can, and to prepare them for life in the outside world at the end of their sentences.

"However, public and staff safety should be the overriding consideration when deciding on prisoner security classifications."
