Defence Minister Wayne Mapp is visiting the air force's Whenuapai base and the Devonport naval base this week.

Dr Mapp, accompanied by Associate Defence Minister Heather Roy, is at Whenuapai today and Devonport tomorrow, where they will tour the Navy's new multi-role vessel HMNZS Canterbury.

Canterbury will deploy to Australia in early February to take part in Operation Sealion, a joint amphibious exercise off the Queensland coast with the Australian Defence Force. She returns in late April.

Later in the day Dr Mapp will be joining Maori Affairs Minister Pita Sharples at the Navy's Te Taua Moana marae to watch kapa haka training for Waitangi Day celebrations.
