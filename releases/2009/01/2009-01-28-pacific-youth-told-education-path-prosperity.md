Pacific youth are an important part of the skilled workforce of tomorrow but the ‘yes' decisions have to be made today.

That's the message of an Auckland Methodist church expo, supported by the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs in which Pacific youth, their families, and community leaders have the opportunity to meet and mingle with more than 50 representatives of tertiary education and industry training institutions later this week.

Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, Georgina te Heuheu, who will launch the Vahefonua Tonga O Aotearoa Education and Training Expo says, that it is critical Pacific youth are encouraged to take up training so they can benefit from better incomes now and in the years to come.

"We need to actively support Pacific youth with their education and skills development so like their parents, they too can contribute to our country's economy. 

"The path to prosperity occurs through good jobs gained by higher education and skills development.

"Greater economic participation for Pacific people will happen if Pacific communities, educational institutions, industry and government work together," she says.

For the Tongan church group, Vahefonua Tonga O Aotearoa, this is its third education and training expo.  This year it has broadened the reach to other Pacific communities, making the 2009 expo the biggest to date.  It starts this Friday (30 January 2009) at the Lotofale'ia Methodist church in Mangere.

Having representatives of industry training organisations being on hand to meet with parents and children is a real strength of this community led initiative, say the organisers.

As a direct result of past expos, more Pacific youth have registered for training.

Vahefonua Tonga O Aotearoa consists of 37 Tongan church congregations throughout New Zealand and is one of the 15 synods of the Methodist Church of New Zealand.
