Justice Minister Simon Power has disbanded the Criminal Justice Advisory Board set up by the previous Government, as promised.

The board was established in April last year to give advice to justice sector ministers and was set up in response to a report by Ombudsman Mel Smith into issues involving the administration of criminal justice.

Mr Power said he wrote to members in late December to formally disband the board.

"We announced in August last year our intention to do this, and we have.

"Basically, the board was established by the Labour Government because that government had run out of ideas for the criminal justice system.

"I'm very grateful for the work the seven board members have done on justice issues and for the time they made available to this matter.

"With a change of government, priorities have altered and we can put this money towards other uses. The $90,000 the board costs each year will be used to help kick-start the Government's Victim Compensation Scheme, which will help provide greater access to services for victims of crime," Mr Power said.

These savings in the justice portfolio are also in addition to $4.57 million saved by disbanding the Experts Panel on Electoral Finance and the associated citizens forum.
