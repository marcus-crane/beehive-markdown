Health Minister Tony Ryall says the Government wants shorter waiting times in hospital emergency departments, and has released a report on improving EDs which recommends a new maximum waiting time of six hours.

Mr Ryall said, "The working group who wrote the report recommend a new health target so that hospitals focus on faster, better services for ED patients, and managers can be held accountable."

"Emergency Departments are barometers for how well hospitals are operating. Better ED times means better services and procedures further up the line in the wards and, for example, the x-ray department. ED performance is a measure of how well the different parts of the hospital work together. "

Other recommendations include plans to deal with an ED operating at full capacity, so that patients don't have to wait in corridors or ambulances.

Mr Ryall pointed out, "The most recent hospital benchmarking report, for the quarter ended September 2008, showed the worst overall performance bar one since recording started in 2001."

"A recent snapshot found that in one DHB, up to 20% of patients waited more than 8 hours in the ED. This working group report found that if you arrive at a large DHB's Emergency Department, you can expect to wait, on average, nearly five and a half hours to be treated."

"The new government has inherited a big problem and totally unacceptable delays for patients. While this won't be fixed overnight, we are determined that ED performance will improve for patients," Mr Ryall said.

Mr Ryall invites patients and the health sector to comment on the report over the next fortnight.
