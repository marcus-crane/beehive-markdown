Associate Tourism Minister, Jonathan Coleman, welcomes the inclusion of Mitre Peak in the New Seven Wonders of Nature competition.

"It's great that New Zealand's natural beauty is being recognised in this international competition, and I'm sure Mitre Peak will make a strong showing in the field," Jonathon Coleman said.

"This competition will draw attention to New Zealand's natural beauty and encourage visitors to come here.  You can't buy the sort of publicity this international competition can bring to New Zealand and the profile it can give to our natural wonders.

"International tourism is worth almost nine billion dollars a year to NZ, and one in ten people are employed in tourism related jobs.  Tourism is an industry that the government believes has the capacity to help the country weather the international recession."

Jonathan Coleman encourages New Zealanders to vote in support of the country's entry in the competition.
