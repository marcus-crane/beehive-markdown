News today that the Government's accounts have deteriorated further in the five months to November 30 is not surprising, Finance Minister Bill English says.

But the figures vindicate the urgency and prudent approach behind the Government's plan for managing the challenges facing New Zealand.

"The Government remains on track with its considered economic plan - based around a fiscal stimulus that is already large by world standards," Mr English said.

"Our immediate priority is to preserve jobs and then to put the economy on a more competitive longer-term footing. We have already done a lot and we're announcing more important policies - starting next week with the Prime Minister's speech outlining assistance measures for small and medium enterprises and moving through to the Jobs Summit on February 27.

"At the same time, as the government accounts show today, we must be prudent with spending taxpayers' money - every dollar we borrow today must be repaid, with interest, in future years.

Economic updates in the past few weeks confirmed the global outlook had deteriorated significantly since December, Mr English said. The Government financial statements for November provided more evidence that the fiscal position inherited by the new Government was already deteriorating.

The Treasury reported today that the Government's operating budget before gains and losses (Obegal) was in deficit by $200 million for the five months to November 30 and that the operating budget balance was in deficit by $5.7 billion for the same period.

"A feature of the operating deficit is the investment losses flowing through when world markets were falling sharply," Mr English said. "But we must remember that these investment funds are in place for the long term and we will ride through this short-term volatility."
