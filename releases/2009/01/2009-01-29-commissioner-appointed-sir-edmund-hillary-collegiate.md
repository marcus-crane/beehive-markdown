Education Minister Anne Tolley today announced that she has dissolved the board of trustees of Sir Edmund Hillary Collegiate in Otara, Manukau City, and has directed the Secretary of Education to appoint a Commissioner to replace the board.

"My decision follows an Education Review Office report that raises serious concerns about the board's governance especially in relation to student safety, the quality of teaching in the senior and middle schools and the board's capacity to govern effectively."

Mrs Tolley says the ERO report recommends intervention and it is her opinion that the most appropriate level of intervention is the appointment of a Commissioner.

"I am very concerned by the revelation that the physical and emotional abuse of students by a few teachers has been a long-standing issue that has been brought to the board's attention in the past. The abuse by some teachers includes hitting, swearing at and denigrating students.

"That is totally unacceptable. Student safety is paramount. ERO is not confident that trustees will address concerns about the provision of a safe physical and emotional environment with the urgency and determination that is required. This is in addition to serious concerns over governance and management. I therefore have no hesitation in appointing a Commissioner to replace the board.

"The Education Review Office intends to return to the Collegiate within 12 months to evaluate the progress that has been made in response to its recommendations. I look forward to receiving its evaluation."
