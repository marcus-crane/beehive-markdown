"The decision by Waitakere City to discontinue proceeding with their proposed district plan change relating to Whenuapai Airbase is a sensible response to Government policy," says Defence Minister Wayne Mapp.

Dr Mapp met with Waitakere Mayor Bob Harvey, Deputy Mayor Penny Hulse and city officials this morning to discuss the future of Whenuapai.

"I confirmed to them that the Government will be retaining Whenuapai as an RNZAF base. Cabinet will in the near future be considering measures needed to ensure efficient operations. After years of neglect, important remedial work particularly on the runway will be undertaken.

"Waitakere City agrees with the Government that the continuation of Whenuapai as an RNZAF base is the best long term option for both the Air Force and the city. We will be working with Waitakere City around any future developments on Defence property in the region."
