Racing Minister John Carter has announced that 26 projects to enhance safety at racecourses across the country will receive grants totalling $575,000 from the Racing Safety Development Fund.

The contestable fund provides around $1 million each year to match dollar-for-dollar contributions from racing clubs for projects that enhance the safety and therefore raise the quality of racecourse facilities.

"On course safety is a major issue facing many of our racing clubs," Mr Carter said. "This is a worthwhile initiative and well worth the support of the new Government."

This funding round was applied to a wide range of projects from the replacement of unsafe running rails to the replacement of a grandstand fire escape.

‘I wish to congratulate the clubs that received funding in this round, and also urge all racing clubs to review health and safety issues at their racecourses in time to submit their applications to the next funding round," Mr Carter said.

Applications forms for the next funding round will be sent to all racing clubs by February 1 2009. Applications close on March 31 2009.
