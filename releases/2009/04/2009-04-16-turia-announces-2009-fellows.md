### **Turia announces 2009 fellows**

Tariana Turia today announced the recipients of this year's Winston Churchill Memorial Trust fellowships.

"As new technologies and changing economic conditions bring the world closer together, we need to take advantage of opportunities to learn from the international community," Mrs Turia said. "This trust helps New Zealanders to carry out research in a variety of fields and bring that international knowledge back home."

For 2009, the trust has awarded $60,000 to 11 people. Fellows are granted up to 80 per cent of travel costs and can spend anywhere between three weeks to three months overseas.

Since the trust began in 1965, more than 600 New Zealanders have been able to conduct valuable research across a diverse range of fields. The 2009 Fellows will conduct research in the fields of health, ecology, literacy, social services and New Zealand history and culture, including:

- Patricia Wallace from Christchurch, who will document overseas examples of pre-1840 Māori cloaks and research specific weaving techniques that are in danger of being forgotten.
- Jenny Harding from Auckland, who will investigate how workplace literacy providers are supported and which models might be effective in New Zealand.
- Betsan Martin from Wellington, who will research the health of water ecosystems in the Pacific region.
