Today's abrogation of the Fiji constitution by President Iloilo is "a serious step backwards", Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.   "The events of the past few days will merely compound the problems faced by ordinary Fijians," Mr McCully said.

"The decision of the Court of Appeal declaring the Interim Government unlawful provided a way out for Commodore Bainimarama and his colleagues. It is a great pity that they did not take the opportunity they were afforded.

"The President's decision, no doubt prompted by the Commodore, to override the constitution, sack the judges, and depend upon the military to keep an unlawful regime in power, will compound the already serious economic difficulties confronted by Fiji.   "It will also further delay the point at which the international community can give Fiji the help that is urgently needed," Mr McCully said.
