New Zealand's relationship with the United States will benefit from fresh eyes and fresh energy with new administrations in both countries, Foreign Minister McCully said today, after meeting US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Washington.

"It was an excellent meeting. I came away confident that the impetus and commitment the New Zealand government intends to bring to this important relationship will be reciprocated," Mr McCully said.

"Discussions covered a range of issues, including Asia, the Pacific, Afghanistan, nuclear non-proliferation issues relating to North Korea and Iran, and cooperation in Antarctica. 

"Secretary Clinton thanked me for New Zealand's contribution to date in Afghanistan and briefed me on the recent US review of its approach to that conflict. I outlined the nature of the review we are currently conducting, and promised that we would give careful consideration to our future contributions.

"I expressed New Zealand's view that the TransPacific Partnership trade agreement had the potential to make a significant contribution to freeing up Asia-Pacific trade, and that we looked forward to the results of the US Administration's trade policy review."

Mr McCully also welcomed President Obama's recent leadership on the elimination of nuclear weapons. At the conclusion of today's meeting, he and Secretary Clinton signed an agreement for New Zealand's fourth contribution to the G8 Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons of Mass Destruction.

"This is a practical way for New Zealand to assist international efforts to prevent the smuggling of nuclear material, and therefore reduce the potential for nuclear weapons to end up in the wrong hands."

Mr McCully, who while in Washington attended celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the Antarctic Treaty, said Antarctic cooperation would continue to be a very important part of the NZ-US relationship given the significance of scientific research being conducted there, particularly in the area of climate change.

"I also took the opportunity to discuss the issue of outstanding US approval for the sale of the New Zealand Airforce's Skyhawks, and am hopeful that we will be able to resolve this item of businesses inherited by both of us from our predecessors," Mr McCully said.
