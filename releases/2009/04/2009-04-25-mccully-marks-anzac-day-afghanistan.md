Foreign Minister Murray McCully is commemorating Anzac Day with New Zealand Defence Force personnel serving in Afghanistan's Bamyan province.

"While Anzac Day is a day of remembrance for the sacrifices of those who served New Zealand in the past, it is also a time to recognise the sacrifices being made by the almost 400 NZDF personnel currently serving overseas," Mr McCully said.

"The 131-strong Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Bamyan is our second-largest overseas military operation (after Timor-Leste). Joining their Anzac Day dawn service offers me an opportunity to acknowledge the valuable contribution our defence personnel are making in many parts of the world.

"New Zealand is a strong supporter of reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. We share the international community's desire to see a stable, secure Afghanistan, free from the threats of insurgents and terrorists.

"Our PRT has been in Bamyan province since 2003, and we have also been contributing to development efforts, with a particular focus on rural livelihoods, education, health, and the needs of women and children," Mr McCully said.

While in Afghanistan, Mr McCully is also meeting with members of the Afghan government, as well as leaders of the international assistance effort.
