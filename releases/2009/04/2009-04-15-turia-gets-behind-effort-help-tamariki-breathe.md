A new programme to help Maori children who suffer from asthma has been commended by Tariana Turia - the minister responsible for Maori health.

"Being able to breathe properly should be every child's right but for far too many tamariki Maori that's not the case and I'm thrilled to see a programme that has heard the call of help from a group who really needs it," Mrs Turia said.

"As an asthmatic, I know the challenges that being breathless can bring; the anxiety that can come when I feel like I'm lacking the space to breathe so I can only imagine how hard it is for our babies."

"This programme is vital for our children and their whanau who suffer from asthma and I congratulate Pharmac, Tui Ora Ltd, Piki Te Ora Nursing Services, Te Aho Associates, Best Practice Advocacy Services and Tihi Ltd for coming together on this very important cause."

The Space to Breathe - He Tapu Te Ha programme, launched today at Te Kohanga Reo o Nga Pekanga in Waitara, is headed by Pharmac and regional health providers in New Plymouth and aims to promote among pre-school children and their whanau better awareness of asthma and how to manage it, including, helping whanau with personalised asthma management plans, providing them with resources such as reference manuals and story books.

**Quick stats**

- Asthma is a common condition in New Zealand children aged two to 14.
- Each year four out of every 1000 children under the age of 19 are hospitalised for asthma. For Maori, this statistic is higher (six out of every 1000) compared to NZ European (two out of every 1000).
- Maori children are four times more likely to die from asthma than NZ European children.
