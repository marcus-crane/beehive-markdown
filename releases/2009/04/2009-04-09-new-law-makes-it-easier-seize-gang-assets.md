A law that makes it easier for police to seize the assets and profits that gangs obtain illegally - including from the manufacture and supply of methamphetamine - was passed by Parliament today.

The Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Bill repeals the Proceeds of Crime Act 1991 and introduces a new civil forfeiture regime to complement an enhanced criminal forfeiture regime.

Justice Minister Simon Power says that for far too long, senior organised crime figures have been able to hide behind the people they hire to carry out their dirty work.

"This bill goes a long way to ending that.

"Till now, criminals have managed to hang on to the wealth they have accumulated by avoiding the conviction required under the current legislation before property can be forfeited.

"Under this legislation, a conviction is not required to trigger forfeiture proceedings for criminal proceeds.

"It will simply be sufficient to prove on the balance of probabilities that a person has unlawfully benefited from significant criminal offending.

"We have progressed this bill because the threat posed by organised crime to law abiding New Zealanders is real and unacceptable, and can best be managed by removing the funding necessary for such groups to operate.

"This is a particularly important tool in the fight against methamphetamine, given the large amounts of money being made by those who manufacture and supply this drug.

"This Government is not prepared to let public safety take a back seat."
