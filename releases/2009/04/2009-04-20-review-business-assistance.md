The government is beginning a wider review of government business assistance programmes while also initially changing the way New Zealand Trade and Enterprise delivers business assistance to high growth firms.

Economic Development Minister Gerry Brownlee said the review was part of the government’s response to private sector calls at the recent Job Summit to revamp business assistance.

“During the Summit there were numerous suggestions for how business assistance could be improved. Reforming business assistance is a priority for me.  I want to focus that assistance where it provides greatest value for money and delivers greatest economic benefit.”

The Minister released the review terms of reference (attached) and said that it would be completed by June 1.

“It’s important that any ideas for improvement that the review comes up with are tested with private sector leaders.  Job Summit participants John Shewan, chairperson of PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Andy Hamilton from Icehouse have agreed to be part of this process.”

While the review would provide valuable advice for the government to consider changes to business assistance later in the year, there were also some issues that need to be addressed immediately, said Mr Brownlee.

“In particular I have decided we can achieve greater value for money and improved economic benefit by focusing New Zealand Trade and Enterprise’s grants programmes on one smaller, but better targeted, programme.”

“I am sharpening the focus of our economic development spending so that it makes a more tangible and practical contribution to economic recovery and growth.

“We need a strong and resilient domestic economy with New Zealand firms that can prosper internationally.  Well targeted and packaged government support for businesses will contribute to that goal.”

Mr Brownlee said good progress was also being made on the five other work streams he has been allocated following the Job Summit::

- Managing regulatory approval process for complex and/or major projects
- Targeting and attracting offshore investment and entrepreneurial migrants
- Improving SME access to working capital
- Accelerating energy, environmental and water initiatives related to job opportunities and productivity improvements and
- Accelerating major infrastructure projects in Auckland
