Associate Minister for Health, Dr Jonathan Coleman yesterday opened the National Research Centre for Stroke, Applied Neurosciences and Neurorehabilitation.

The Centre is the first of its kind in New Zealand. It is the only national research centre to conduct high quality epidemiological and interventional research to improve health and outcomes in people with major neurological disorders, with emphasis on stroke, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and some other orders commonly affecting older adults.

"The impact of stroke and major brain injury or disorder is devastating for everyone involved. The establishment of a Research Centre like this will assist in coordinating nationwide knowledge in this area, and ties in with the Government's aim of providing consistent quality care across all District Health Boards," says Dr Coleman.

Stroke is the number two killer in the world and is the most common cause of adult disability in New Zealand. The Government recognises the importance of having the right services for people with these conditions.

"I welcome this initiative and look forward to seeing progress and positive results in this important area of research," says Dr Coleman.
