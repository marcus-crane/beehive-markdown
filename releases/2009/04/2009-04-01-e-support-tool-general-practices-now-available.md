Health Minister Tony Ryall today launched the first set of electronic tools designed to help doctors and nurses access guidelines and other clinical resources to provide better and more coordinated care.

The electronic "bestpractice Decision Support Tool" provides quick information and advice tailored to each patient. The electronic system also enables the practice to extract and save key patient information to their systems, advises when referral is appropriate and advises on appropriate medication choices with links to prescribing information and can generate prescriptions.

"These tools are designed to make the delivery of better care easier. Instead of reviewing numerous pages of guideline material before providing advice to a patient, practices can now access this information online in a matter of seconds," Mr Ryall said.

"With a wealth of information at their fingertips, it would be easier for doctors and nurses to diagnose and manage patients, access other resources, encourage self-management amongst patients and make referrals," he added.

"These modules are not designed to replace any systems that are already in place but today's launch means all practices will now be able to access these resources if they wish to use them."

Mr Ryall said the first set of nationally funded modules will be available to all practices across the country at no cost. These modules are:

- Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting: This module has been developed on behalf of Medsafe to improve and facilitate the electronic reporting of adverse drug reactions in general practice. An online reporting form, with information on a patient's current medications and vaccinations, is sent electronically to the Centre for Adverse Reactions Monitoring while a copy is retained in a patient's records.
- Adult Depression: This tool will make it easier to assess the severity of depression, access other resources, encourage self-management and make referrals. For mild to moderate depression, there is a shift away from medication to talking therapies and this tool will make access to those treatments much easier.
- Acne: The module is set up to provide an initial assessment of the individual and the severity of acne leading to appropriate advice and a range of treatment options.
- Childhood asthma: This module is an interactive presentation of current guidelines for diagnosing and managing childhood asthma. It assists in giving the probability of asthma based on a patient's assessment and management.
