Veterans' Affairs Minister Hon Judith Collins today welcomed the appointment of the Expert Panel on Veterans' Health. 

"Establishing this panel is an important step in better understanding issues relating to veterans' service-related health, and how they can be addressed in the war pensions and veterans' support systems," Ms Collins says.

The panel was one of the commitments agreed to in the Memorandum of Understanding signed by the Crown with the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association and the Ex-Vietnam Services Association to address the concerns of Vietnam veterans and their families.

The panel will be chaired by Professor John Campbell, of Dunedin, and includes Dr Marie Bismark, Associate Professor Brian Cox, Professor Des Gorman, Professor Timothy Maling, Dr Sandy Macleod, and John Campbell ONZM.

"I am delighted at the wealth of expertise and experience that the chairperson and other members bring to the panel," Ms Collins says.

"This is a real opportunity for the veterans community to address issues of health and wellbeing."
