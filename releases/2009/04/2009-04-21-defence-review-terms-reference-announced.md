The Terms of Reference for the Defence Review to be conducted this year were announced today by Defence Minister Wayne Mapp and Associate Defence Minister Heather Roy.

"This Defence Review fulfils the commitment that both the National and ACT parties made prior to the last election. A Defence White Paper will be published early next year setting out the Government's direction for Defence, particularly over the next decade," Dr Mapp said.

"The past 15 years have seen major increases in the number and duration of defence deployments, which have clearly stretched the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF). There have also been real challenges in the procurement programme.

"The last formal review of Defence was in 1997. The Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Select Committee undertook a major inquiry in 1999 - ‘Defence Beyond 2000'. Since then the world has changed. It is now time to have a comprehensive review so we can shape our Defence forces around our needs now and in the future.

"The Defence Review will be led by Secretary of Defence John McKinnon and will include a public consultation phase, as well as an independent Ministerial Advisory Panel. This Panel consists of Comptroller of Customs Martyn Dunne, Ernst & Young Chief Executive Rob McLeod and the retiring Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Murdoch. The White Paper itself will be prepared once the Review is completed," Dr Mapp said.

"We are very keen to have wide public consultation as part of the review process from interested organisations, groups and individuals," Mrs Roy said.

"New Zealanders are interested in defence issues, and this is an opportunity for them to engage in the policy development process."

A discussion document will be released in May and will be followed by a period of consultation, with the public having the opportunity to make written submissions or attend specially-organised meetings to have their views heard and recorded.

"As well as the main Review, I will personally be leading a set of companion studies. These will focus on our defence industry, on the role of the NZDF in youth programmes and the Cadet Forces, and voluntary national service," Mrs Roy said.

The Review will look out as far as 2035, with a more detailed focus out to the middle of the next decade.

"The reality is that decisions made today impact on Defence for decades. Poor choices can be a tremendous drain on resources. Therefore it is vital that the Review looks long-term - as we know, purchases made in the 1960s (C-130 Hercules, P-3K Orions, Iroquois) still form the backbone of some of our key capabilities today. We will need to put special emphasis on the next decade, when a number of critical capabilities such as air transport need replacement.

"The Review will be comprehensive and thorough. This Government takes Defence seriously and is committed to having relevant, effective and properly resourced forces for our long-term needs," the Ministers said.
