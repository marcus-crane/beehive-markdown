Trade Minister Tim Groser today welcomed the announcement that there is a consensus among WTO members to appoint New Zealand's Ambassador to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Dr David Walker, as the new Chair of the WTO Doha Round Agriculture Negotiations.

Dr Walker is expected to be formally elected Chair at the next meeting of the Special Session of the Committee on Agriculture.

"This is a key position in the negotiations and Dr Walker's appointment is a welcome step in helping ensure that we continue to see positive progress made on agriculture, an area of obvious importance to New Zealand, and the Doha Round as a whole," said Mr Groser.

Dr Walker is the third successive New Zealander to chair the Agriculture Negotiations. He replaces Crawford Falconer who concludes his assignment in Geneva at the end of this month. Mr Falconer will return to New Zealand to take up the role of Deputy Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. 

"The G20 Leaders recently underlined the importance of trade in helping to bring an end to the current global recession. A rapid conclusion to the Doha Round will be a very important element of this.

"Dr Walker is one of New Zealand's most experienced trade negotiators and I have no doubt he is fully committed to bringing the agriculture negotiations to a successful conclusion. 

"New Zealand is pleased to be able to make a further important contribution to the WTO process and I wish Dr Walker the very best of luck," Mr Groser said.
