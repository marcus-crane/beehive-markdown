Strong leadership will emerge from a national committee in charge of a multi-million dollar fund for community groups through these tough times, Tariana Turia says.

"Our communities are in a time of high need given the current economic recession and it's pleasing to know there's strong leadership among the new committee members."

Five people, all recognised in their respective communities for their voluntary services, have been elected to the National Community Organisation Grants Scheme Committee - responsible for the governance of the fund.

"COGS is a well recognised and important source of money for many of our community groups and as funding shortfalls continue to unfold, it will become valued even more."

Last year, $14 million of COGS funding was distributed to 3602 community groups with most grants going for $3000 or less to help with ongoing running costs such as rent, travel, volunteer and administration expenses.

The members of the new national committee, who were voted in by the 37 voluntary local distribution committees throughout the country, are:

- Sandra Terewi QSM JP - Whanganui Waimarino Rangitikei Local Distribution Committee
- Sue King - Hauraki Local Distribution Committee
- Sumaria Beaton - Southland Local Distribution Committees
- Carl Pederson - Kahungunu Ki Heretaunga Local Distribution Committee
- Brent Maru - Nelson Bays Local Distribution Committee

Carl Pederson and Brent Maru are new to the committee while the others were re-elected.
