Transport Minister Steven Joyce is urging motorists to take care on the roads over the Easter break.

"A lot of people will be going away this weekend, and that means a lot of traffic on our roads. Drivers will need to be extra vigilant," he says.

"Most of the deaths on our roads come from excessive speed, drink driving and risky overtaking.

"We all have a responsibility for road safety. Please stay alert, drive to the conditions and don't take risks."

The official Easter holiday period runs from 4.00pm today (Thursday 9 April) until 6am on Tuesday 14 April.

Last Easter, 9 people died on New Zealand roads and 195 were injured.

"Please use commonsense on the road to make sure that this is a safe and happy Easter weekend," says Mr Joyce.

"We all need to remember that taking a little extra time to get where we are going is well worth it."

**The Official Easter holiday period for 2009 will begin at 1600 Thursday 9 April and end at 0600 hours Tuesday 14 April**

Over Easter weekend 2008 there were 6 fatal crashes and 135 reported injury crashes. These crashes resulted in 9 deaths, 35 serious injuries and 160 minor injuries. The 9 deaths included:
