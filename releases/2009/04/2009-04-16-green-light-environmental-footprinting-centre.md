Agriculture and Forestry Minister David Carter today announced New Zealand's first professorship in the carbon footprint and environmental impact of New Zealand's primary industries.

"This is a significant step in New Zealand's bid to lead international efforts in this area, and will help position us at the cutting edge of life cycle assessment practice," he says.

Life cycle analysis is the study of the environmental footprint of products across their entire life cycle, from the farm, orchard or forest through to processing, transportation, sale, consumption and disposal by the consumer.

The professorship in life cycle assessment and management will be based at Massey University, which won a competitive tender process to host it, but will work with key Crown Research Institutes.

"The New Zealand Life Cycle Assessment Centre will be the engine room of New Zealand's scientific work in environmental footprinting," says Mr Carter.

"Overseas consumers increasingly want to know the environmental impact of the products they buy. Our export markets need assurance that our reputation for efficient and clean production of goods is deserved.

"It is also critical for our primary producers to understand and identify opportunities for productivity gains across supply chains. Life cycle assessment and management can help achieve this."

Mr Carter says it is exciting to see the pooling of considerable expertise across Massey University, Plant & Food, Landcare, AgResearch and Scion, as well as primary industries and the work of other universities.

"The Centre will be responsible for training experts who can work with the primary sector to enhance their overseas reputations, improve their production processes, and help further promote New Zealand as a world leader in agriculture, horticulture and forestry."

#### Life cycle analysis and the New Zealand Life Cycle Assessment Centre

Life cycle analysis (LCA) is the study of the carbon footprints of products across their entire life cycle.

The New Zealand Life Cycle Assessment Centre will be based at Massey University's Palmerston North campus, but act as a virtual centre linking expertise across New Zealand.

The professorship will be 95 percent government-funded in 2010, reducing to 25 percent by 2015. From 2016, the initiative will be self-sufficient. This ensures that it will continue to meet the needs of industry and remain relevant and focused.

The cost is approximately $1.3 million over five years, and all government funding will come from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.

Massey University will also be funding three PhD scholarships to ensure that the newly appointed professor can establish a world-leading research programme.
