Measures introduced into Parliament today will reduce school compliance costs and improve efficiency in the education sector, says Education Minister Anne Tolley.

The Education Amendment Bill proposes changes to the police vetting of non-teaching staff and contractors, minimising compliance costs for schools while retaining the requirement to police-check people with unsupervised access to children.

“The sole criterion for police vetting contractors will be whether they have unsupervised access to children on the school or early childhood education service site during opening hours. Schools will be able to obtain police checks for non-teaching staff and contractors directly from the New Zealand Police rather than having to go through the Teachers Council,” says Mrs Tolley.

“An information-matching programme will allow the identification of teachers who should not be teaching because they do not have the appropriate authority to do so.

“Parents will be assured that people who have unsupervised contact with their children have been properly screened. Schools will be able to know at a glance that all their staff are registered and clear of any supervisory conditions.

“The government wants schools to be able to get on with education, to focus on teaching and learning, not bureaucracy. This Bill supports that focus while enhancing student safety.”

Other measures in the Bill include:

- allowing an entity such as a board of trustees from another school to be appointed as a limited statutory manager or a commissioner for a school, so under-performing schools can work directly with successful neighbouring schools.
- increasing flexibility around board elections and establishment boards.
