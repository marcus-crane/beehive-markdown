Agriculture Minster David Carter today announced the members of the Board of the New Zealand Walking Access Commission.

John Acland has been reappointed as Chair for a term of two years and the remaining Board members have been reappointed for terms ranging from one to three years.

The members were all made short-term appointees in October last year owing to the conventions relating to a pre-election period.

Confirming the Board line-up, Mr Carter said that collectively, the members have experience in farming, Maori interests, legal issues, local government, outdoor recreation and the environment.

The members are: John Acland (Chair), Brian Stephenson, Peter Brown, Barbara Stuart, Dr Kay Booth, John Aspinall, John Forbes and Maggie Bayfield.

"Land access is a widely debated issue in New Zealand and I welcome the leadership and range of skills the members bring to the Walking Access Commission," says Mr Carter.

"The core of the debate is public access to rural land and I am confident the Commission will build on the good relationship that now exists between landowners and those who enjoy our outdoor heritage."

The New Zealand Commission was established under the Walking Access Act 2008 and aims to develop a national strategy, negotiate and establish new walking access and to provide leadership on access issues.
