Prime Minister John Key today announced a $15 million grant for an upgrade of Christchurch’s AMI Stadium for the Rugby World Cup in 2011.

“The Rugby World Cup will be a massive event for New Zealand. It will attract many thousands of visitors.  Venues for games must be up to scratch,” says Mr Key.

Speaking at an event at AMI Stadium in Christchurch today, Mr Key confirmed that a grant of $15 million will be provided to go towards the venue’s $60 million redevelopment project.

“The Christchurch City Council has committed a significant amount of money to this project.  This ensures they are well placed to host Rugby World Cup games and it provides a long-lasting legacy for the people of Christchurch and the wider region.”

Mr Key noted the investment sits alongside the $15 million recently confirmed for development of a new stadium in Dunedin.  The Government grant to Dunedin is based on the expectation that the new stadium will be ready and available to host Rugby World Cup games in 2011.

“The Rugby World Cup has proven a timely catalyst for a number of infrastructure developments, including stadia.  With an estimated global TV audience of around 4 billion, the world’s spotlight will be on us, and we want to make the most of the opportunity,” says Mr Key.

“The Government's role as a partner in Rugby World Cup 2011 involves both helping put on a successful tournament and maximising the longer-term benefits for New Zealand.  Improving stadia achieves both.

“The redevelopment of Auckland’s Eden Park has received considerable government funding, and it is pleasing to be able to support the development of this important infrastructure in Christchurch and Dunedin as well.

“At this time of economic downturn, the Government sees investment in infrastructure as vital.  The development of events infrastructure creates jobs and opportunities for local businesses.

“Such development also builds our capability to host future major events, which bring their own economic, social and cultural benefits.”
