Drought-stricken farmers in Hawke's Bay are being offered help by the Government.

Despite rain falling in many parts of the country in recent days, the Hawke's Bay region is into its third successive autumn drought and a medium-level drought has been declared.

Agriculture Minister David Carter says relief measures similar to those offered to Gisborne and Wairoa farmers last week will be made available to Hawke's Bay farmers.

Government assistance includes the provision of tax assistance measures, funding for farm management advice and funding for Rural Support Trusts to provide help.

"Rural communities in the Hawke's Bay region are being hit by a third successive drought.  While December and February rains brought some relief, the region has received less than 60 percent of its normal rainfall since September," says Mr Carter.

"This has stunted pasture growth, forcing many farmers to start selling off capital stock.

"Government assistance and recovery measures will help farmers seek the right planning and farm management advice, and tax initiatives will help ease financial pressures.

"I urge farmers in Hawke's Bay to talk to their local Rural Support Trust and to seek advice if they are finding the conditions tough.  The Government is fully committed to helping rural communities through this," says Mr Carter.  

**Note:**  Rural Support Trusts provide farm management advice and assistance to rural communities.
