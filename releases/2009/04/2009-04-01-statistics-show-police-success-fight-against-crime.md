Police Minister Judith Collins today welcomed the release by police of crime statistics for the 2008 calendar year, saying they showed the police were going the extra mile to solve crime.

"I think it's a testament to our police that an extra 6654 offences were resolved in 2008 compared to the previous year and the national resolution rate for total crime is at its highest in a decade," Ms Collins says.

"I am immensely proud of the work done by the New Zealand Police to make New Zealand a better place to live. These statistics show the police really are going the extra mile to solve crime."

The police crime statistics showed a small increase in recorded crime for the 2008 calendar year, with the 1.2% increase mainly reflecting growth in population over the same period. Adjusted to take into account of the increase in population, recorded offences increased by just 0.2% per 10,000 people.

Six police districts recorded increases in recorded offences while six showed decreases. Overall, police recorded 431,381 offences during 2008.

Ms Collins says the government has taken prompt action to crack down on violent crime.

"Ensuring the safety of New Zealanders is my top priority. The government's law and order programme will give police the tools to make life very difficult for criminals," Ms Collins says.

The government plans to give police more power to remove gang fortifications, conduct surveillance on gang communications and remove the right of P dealers to electronic bail or home detention.

The Government will be putting an extra 300 frontline police into Counties-Manukau by the end of 2010 and working to a ratio of 1 officer to 500 people by the end of 2011.

"I expect the government's policies to have a significant impact on the front lines of crime," says Ms Collins
