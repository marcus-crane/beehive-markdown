A Bill to ensure personal data sent to New Zealand from overseas is subject to New Zealand's privacy protection received its first reading in Parliament today. 

"The Privacy (Cross-border Information) Amendment Bill will enable New Zealanders and New Zealand businesses to assure their trade partners that their privacy is protected by New Zealand law," Justice Minister Simon Power said.   

"The Government recognises that in an increasingly difficult economic environment we need to do everything possible to improve the international competitiveness of New Zealand businesses, Mr Power said.

"Currently, the Privacy Act 1993 is silent on cross-border enforcement of privacy laws, meaning New Zealand businesses that operate internationally have to develop and enter into special contractual arrangements to protect personal data.

"This increases transaction costs, as well as being a disincentive for overseas businesses thinking about doing business in New Zealand.

"The Privacy (Cross-border Information) Bill addresses these concerns.  The changes it introduces will enable us to assure our international business partners that their customers' personal information will be protected. 

"The Bill will enable the Privacy Commissioner to prohibit data received from overseas being transferred outside New Zealand to a jurisdiction without adequate privacy protection.  The Privacy Commissioner will also be able to cooperate with overseas privacy enforcement authorities in consulting on, and transferring complaints. 

"This Government is committed to reducing costs and doing everything we can to increase the international competitiveness for New Zealand businesses.  The Privacy (Cross-border Information) Amendment Bill is evidence of those commitments," Mr Power said.
