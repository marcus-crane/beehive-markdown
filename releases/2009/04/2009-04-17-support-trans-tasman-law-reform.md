New Zealand Justice Minister Simon Power and Australian Attorney-General Robert McClelland today welcomed Australian State and Territory Ministers' support for the implementation of the Trans-Tasman Court Proceedings and Regulatory Enforcement Treaty. 

Implementation of the treaty will enable trans-Tasman legal disputes to be resolved in a cheaper, more efficient and less complicated manner.

It will simplify the process for trans-Tasman litigation by streamlining the service of civil court proceedings and the process of enforcing judgments.

The Treaty will also allow certain fines imposed in one country to be enforced in the other.

At today's meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in Canberra, Mr McClelland and Mr Power informed Australian State and Territory Ministers that both countries intend to introduce legislation to implement the Treaty by the end of 2009.

These reforms will move civil justice co-operation between Australia and New Zealand to a new level. 

"In the current economic climate, measures that simplify and improve the processes for resolving legal disputes have become even more critical," Mr Power said.

"This project has the full support of all Australian States and Territories and we are committed to ensuring that the benefits of these reforms flow to the economies of both countries as soon as possible," Mr McClelland said.
