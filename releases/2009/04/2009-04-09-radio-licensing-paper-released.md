Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce has today welcomed the release of a discussion paper on spectrum management in the radio licensing regime.

"Radio spectrum managed under the radio licensing regime is a significant resource for New Zealand's ICT infrastructure and supports a wide range of public and private uses including public safety, emergency and defence services," says Mr Joyce.

The regime has not been subject to a comprehensive check-up since the Radiocommunications Act 1989 came into effect. However, various aspects of the regime have been examined as part of the review leading up to the 2000 amendment of the Radiocommunications Act, and in the 2005 Review of Radio Spectrum Policy.

"It is important for  the industry and the government to have confidence that spectrum allocation and management arrangements continue to meet changing user demands and maximise the value of spectrum to New Zealand society," says Mr Joyce.

"This discussion document provides an opportunity to focus on how well these objectives are being met in the radio licensing regime and I look forward to receiving feedback."

Evidence from a technical study commissioned by the Ministry of Economic Development (MED) and MED's own experience suggest that the regime as a whole is working well. The discussion paper considers a range of options that may help improve the regime in the future.

"No changes to the radio licensing regime are proposed at this stage.  MED will take into account the submissions on the discussion paper in recommending any further work in this area," says Mr Joyce.

Submissions close on 19 May.
