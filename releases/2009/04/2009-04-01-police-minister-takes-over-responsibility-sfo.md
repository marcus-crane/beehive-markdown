Police Minister Judith Collins has today taken over responsibility for the Serious Fraud Office (SFO).

Previously, the Attorney-General has been responsible for the SFO, a Government Department that detects, investigates and prosecutes cases of serious and complex fraud.

As Police Minister, Ms Collins already has responsibility for the Organised and Financial Crime Agency of New Zealand (OFCANZ) which targets, investigates and disrupts individuals and groups involved in organised crime.

Given the close operational relationship that is required between the SFO and OFCANZ, there are expected to be benefits in having a single Minister responsible for both.

"I am looking forward to working with the SFO and OFCANZ in the fight against fraud and organised crime," says Ms Collins.

"Both agencies already enjoy close co-operation and sharing of skills and information. I'm confident that my appointment will help strengthen that relationship."
