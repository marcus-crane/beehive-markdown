Local Government Minister Rodney Hide says his meeting with Auckland civic leaders today was very positive and has confirmed a way forward.

Mr Hide met with Mayors and CEOs of Auckland's councils to discuss the planned changes to Auckland governance.

He says the success of the meeting will ensure the region's leaders will be working with the government on the region's future.  

"What's clear from today is the commitment to going forward with one mayor, one city for Auckland, in a structure which ensures community representation through Local Boards. I am delighted the Mayors and CEOs have committed to working with me and the government to achieve that."

There will a further meeting between the Minister and the Mayors next week to discuss the transition process.
