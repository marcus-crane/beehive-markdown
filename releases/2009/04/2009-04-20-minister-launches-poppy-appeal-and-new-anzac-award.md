Veterans' Affairs Minister Hon Judith Collins today launched the 2009 Poppy Day Appeal and announced a new national award to honour the spirit of the Anzacs.

Ms Collins launched the 2009 Poppy Day Appeal at a ceremony at Wellington's National War Memorial.

"The Poppy Day Appeal enables the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association to do a lot of good in the community. Not only does it keep alive the memory of the brave men and women who served New Zealand, but it helps provide ongoing support for veterans and their families," Ms Collins says.

"I would urge all New Zealanders to support this good cause either by buying a poppy from a collector, or going online and downloading a virtual poppy to their mobile phone."

The Poppy Day street appeal takes place this Friday, April 24. For the first time, New Zealanders around the world will be able to make a donation and download a virtual poppy to their mobile phone from the website www.anzacpoppy.com. For every poppy downloaded, another is planted in the RNZRSA's online Field of Remembrance.

Ms Collins also announced an initiative by the RNZRSA to recognise a New Zealander or New Zealanders who best emulates the Anzac spirit. 

The annual ANZAC Award will be for a single act or for a lifetime of effort in service of New Zealanders or the international community.

Nominations may be made on behalf of any New Zealand citizen. The Award will be announced prior to Anzac Day each year. The first award will be presented on Anzac Day 2010.

This Anzac Day, Ms Collins will attend the Dawn Service and lay a wreath on behalf of the RNZRSA at the Anzac Commemorative Site on the Gallipoli Peninsula.

"It will be humbling to visit the place where many made the ultimate sacrifice and New Zealand came of age as a nation," Ms Collins says.
