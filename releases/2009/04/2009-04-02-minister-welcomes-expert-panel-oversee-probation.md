Corrections Minister Hon Judith Collins today welcomed the appointment of the chairperson and members of the expert panel to oversee improvements to the Department of Corrections' Community Probation and Psychological Service (CPPS).

"Establishment of the panel is an important step in rebuilding public confidence in the department, and in particular CPPS," Ms Collins says.

The panel was recommended by the State Services Commissioner after shortcomings were identified in the Auditor General's report into the department's management of parole.

The panel will be chaired by Paula Rebstock, who was most recently Chairperson of the Commerce Commission.

"Ms Rebstock brings with her a wealth of experience and expertise in both the commercial and public sectors," Ms Collins says.

The panel will include Peter Hughes, Chief Executive of the Ministry of Social Development, who has extensive experience in leading major service delivery departments, and Andrew Bridges, Chief Inspector of Probation with Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Probation for England and Wales, who led the inspectorate through several substantial changes which improved its performance. 

The panel will also include two department staff to provide field expertise.

"The calibre of the chairperson and other panel members gives me confidence that the department now has the support to make the improvements that are required," Ms Collins says.

"The panel will have its first meeting this month, and will be reporting to me regularly on progress. It will continue to operate until improvements are made that are sustainable and enduring."
