The appointments to the Commerce Commission of Dr Mark Berry as the new Chair and Anita Mazzoleni as a member have been confirmed, Commerce Minister Simon Power said today.

Mark Berry has been appointed as Chair for a term of 18 months, and Anita Mazzoleni has been appointed as a member for a term of five years, both from 1 April 2009.

"I am pleased that the Governor-General has appointed Mark Berry and Anita Mazzoleni to the commission," Mr Power said.

"Mark Berry returns to lead an extensive work programme implementing the new regulatory regimes following the passing of the Commerce Amendment Act late last year.

"The board of the Commerce Commission is further complemented by the appointment of Anita Mazzoleni, who was formally an associate member.  She brings strong legal, financial, and telecommunications expertise to the commission.

"I'd also like to thank outgoing Chair Paula Rebstock for her service as a member of the Commerce Commission for the past 11 years, the last five as chair."
