Trade Minister Tim Groser announced today that New Zealand and Japan are establishing a joint Officials Group to examine ways to further develop our bilateral trade and investment relationship.

"We are keen to see the new Officials Group advance our bilateral relationship with Japan. The group has a clear mandate to examine trade and investment issues, including from a free trade agreement (FTA) perspective," Mr Groser said.

"Japan is New Zealand's third largest export destination and fourth largest  trading partner. In the year to June 2008 two-way trade totalled NZ$7.4 billion."

"It is New Zealand's clear expectation that the Officials Group process will provide both governments with information they need to decide whether to move to FTA negotiations in the future.

"This development follows the completion of a report by a Joint Working Group which assessed the economic relationship between New Zealand and Japan.

"New Zealand and Japan are also working closely to promote economic integration in the Asia-Pacific region in APEC and the East Asia Summit."
