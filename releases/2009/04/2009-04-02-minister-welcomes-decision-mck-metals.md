Minister of Immigration, Dr Jonathan Coleman has welcomed Immigration New Zealand's decision to cancel the Variation of Conditions issued to six foreign workers at Taranaki firm, MCK Metals Pacific Ltd.

"Last week, I asked Immigration New Zealand to investigate the Variation of Conditions granted to foreign workers at MCK Metals Pacific Ltd," said Immigration Minister, Dr Jonathan Coleman.

"Immigration New Zealand has informed me that, had they known that MCK Metals Pacific Ltd was considering redundancies when the application was made, the Variation of Conditions would have been declined.

Immigration New Zealand will therefore cancel the Variation of Conditions meaning that the six foreign workers will only be able to work in accordance with the original conditions.

I would like to think that this decision sends a strong message to all employers. At a time of growing unemployment, immigration and labour authorities must be vigilant in ensuring that temporary work permits are only issued to address genuine skills shortages.

I accept that there are still situations where there is a shortage of certain skills and employers find themselves in a position where they must recruit from offshore. Those employers' needs will continue to be met."

Immigration New Zealand will be issuing short-term temporary work permits where there are no suitable New Zealanders who are available or can be readily trained.

"It is also important to realise that the rights of foreign workers are protected," said Dr Jonathan Coleman.
