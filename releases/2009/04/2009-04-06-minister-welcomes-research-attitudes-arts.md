Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson has launched a report about New Zealanders' attitudes towards and participation in the arts, and has welcomed its findings that more people are taking part in the arts.

"The Government supports the arts because of their intrinsic benefits to individuals and the community," Mr Finlayson said. "It is easy to focus on the delivery end - to think about spends and outputs. This report gives us a snapshot of the recipients' views."

Mr Finlayson launched the Creative New Zealand-commissioned report, New Zealanders and the Arts: Attitudes, attendance and participation in 2008, at the Beehive tonight.

It is the second comprehensive report funded by Creative New Zealand on New Zealanders' attitudes towards the arts, as well as substantive data on attendance and participation trends, following an initial investigation in 2005.

"This kind of detailed research informs and assists the Arts Council and other funding bodies in their decisions," he said. "It will also be useful feedback for arts providers and institutions about the public they serve."

Some points of particular interest in the report are:

- More New Zealanders think the arts are part of their everyday life, and support the role played by local and central government in making the arts happen in the community.
- Maori and Pacific communities have a higher-than-average attendance and participation in arts events. Along with Asian New Zealanders, they are also faster than the general population at using computers and the internet for arts purposes.
- Young New Zealanders are actively involved in the arts, and are taking up the opportunities presented by digital technology. Not surprisingly, the research indicates parents and schools play a vital role in developing a life-long interest in the arts.
