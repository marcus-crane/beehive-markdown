Veterans’ Affairs Minister Hon Judith Collins will launch the 2009 Poppy Day Appeal next week and announce a new ANZAC initiative by the Royal New Zealand Returned and Service’s Association.

The Minister will launch the appeal at the National War Memorial, Wellington, on Monday, 20 April. This year Poppy Day is Friday, 24 April.

“This is the time of year when we reflect and remember those who have served our country and who have given their lives in the name of peace and freedom,” Ms Collins says.

“Every year, tens of thousands of New Zealanders wear the poppy to honour these brave men and women, and to provide ongoing support for veterans and their families.”

More than 200 RSAs from Kaitaia to Bluff will take part in the appeal and are expected to raise more than $2 million.  The proceeds of the appeal help provide glasses, hearing aids and essential dental work, specialist medical appointments as well as surgery, hospital and home visits for veterans.

For the first time, New Zealanders around the world will be able to make a donation and download a virtual poppy to their mobile phone from the website [www.anzacpoppy.com](http://www.anzacpoppy.com/). For every poppy downloaded, another is planted in the RSA's online Field of Remembrance.

“The Poppy Day Appeal has enabled the RNZRSA to provide invaluable assistance for our veterans and their families. I would urge all New Zealanders to support their good work on Poppy Day,” Ms Collins says.

Ms Collins will also announce an initiative by the RNZRSA to recognise a New Zealander or New Zealanders who best emulates the ANZAC spirit of courage, comradeship, commitment and compassion.
