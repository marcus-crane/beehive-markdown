Child care and protection expert John Angus has been appointed Children's Commissioner for six months while a permanent appointment is sought, Social Development and Employment Minister Paula Bennett said today.

"I have decided to make an interim appointment to allow time to find the right permanent appointee for this important position," Ms Bennett said. "I am grateful that we have someone of Mr Angus' ability and standing available while we work to fill the role long-term."

John Angus is a former front-line social worker, and was later a senior public servant. More recently he worked on the review of the Children Young Persons and their Families Act 1989, and he led inter-departmental work on preventing child abuse and neglect for the Taskforce for Action on Violence Within Families.

"Mr Angus has high integrity and immense respect within the sector for the policy research and academic work he has done on child care and protection over many years," Ms Bennett said. "He is regarded as thoughtful, considered and a safe pair of hands."

Ms Bennett thanked outgoing commissioner Dr Cindy Kiro for her commitment to children and young people over more than five years in the position.

"Dr Kiro has been a strong advocate for the rights of children, and she has left a lasting impression. I congratulate her on her achievements," she said.

John Angus takes over as Children's Commissioner on 2 May.
