The Law Commission's recommendations on alcohol sales and consumption released today are "a useful contribution to an important debate", Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne said.

"They are not Government policy, but they are certainly useful feedback, and as I say, they are a contribution to an ongoing debate on these issues," Mr Dunne said.

The Minister said that as Law Commission president Sir Geoffrey Palmer himself had described some of the proposals as "launching a trial balloon".

"It's important, therefore, to keep them in perspective. No one should leap to any conclusions about the outcomes here," Mr Dunne said.
