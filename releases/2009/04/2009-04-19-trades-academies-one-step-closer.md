The government’s pre-election commitment to establish five new Trades Academies is one step closer.

Education Minister Anne Tolley is today calling for expressions of interest for the programme.

“I am delighted to be able to get the ball rolling on this very important initiative that will keep students motivated to learn and achieve.

“Trades Academies are about relevance – they will provide those students who prefer to opt for practical hands-on education experiences with exactly that, and provide them with more opportunities to gain the practical skills they need to enter the 21st century workforce.”

The selection of Trades Academies will be based on the following criteria:

- A commitment to partnership between local businesses and other training institutions and the supporting school/other schools.
- Local skill shortages (or clearly identified demand and relevance for the skills being taught).
- Evidence of sufficient demand within the supporting school (and other contributing schools) from students for the education or training a Trades Academy will provide.
- Capability of the supporting school and/or body to establish and govern a Trades Academy.
- A demonstrated ability to deliver successful vocational education.

“I am looking forward to receiving some of the innovative and exciting ideas the sector has shared with me over the past year,” says Mrs Tolley.

Expressions of Interest must be lodged with the Ministry of Education by 13 May 2009.
