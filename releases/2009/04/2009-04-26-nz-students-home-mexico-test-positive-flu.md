Ten positive influenza results from testing carried out on 13 Rangitoto College students who returned from Mexico yesterday morning have been confirmed by Health Minister Tony Ryall this evening.

"Ministry of Health officials advise me there is no guarantee these students have swine influenza but they consider it likely.

"All precautions are being taken to allow for this. However I am informed none of the affected patients are considered seriously ill," Mr Ryall said.

He said most were on the road to recovery.

Ten students have tested positive for Influenza A, Mr Ryall said.

These results will be sent to the World Health Organisation laboratory in Melbourne to ascertain whether it is the H1N1 swine influenza.

H1N1 influenza is a sub-set of Influenza A.
