Broadcasting Minister, Dr Jonathan Coleman, and Communications and Information Technology Minister, Steven Joyce, today announced that the previous government’s digital broadcasting regulatory review will not proceed further.

A key part of the review was an investigation of potential competition issues in the television broadcasting sector.  A departmental analysis of submissions made during the review process concluded that the current market appears workably competitive and that there are no compelling indications of future issues. It is also noted that there is currently no strong case for the introduction of specific new regulation for the broadcasting sector.

Both Ministers stressed that the government wishes to maintain a competitive and diversified broadcasting market, and will continue to monitor market developments.

Ministers noted that some useful information emerged from the research and submissions process, but have agreed that the review, as a whole, goes beyond the priorities set out in pre-election broadcasting commitments and the new Government’s subsequent policy announcements. 

“With the exception of policy development on post-digital switch-over spectrum allocation and regional television broadcasting; and on options for sensory disabled viewers, the remainder of the regulatory review’s work programme will not proceed,” they said.

The Minister of Broadcasting is preparing a new programme of action for broadcasting policy aligned with pre-election commitments. 

“Our broadcasting priorities include achieving a successful digital switch-over and supporting public broadcasting through contestable funding,” Dr Coleman said.
