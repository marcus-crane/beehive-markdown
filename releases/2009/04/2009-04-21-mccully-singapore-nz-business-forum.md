Foreign Minister Murray McCully leaves for Singapore today to give the keynote speech at a New Zealand Business Forum, and to meet with senior Singaporean Ministers.

“Singapore is an important bilateral and regional partner for New Zealand,” Mr McCully said.

“There are excellent opportunities for partnerships between New Zealand business innovation and Singaporean capital, and while Singapore has felt the effects of the financial crisis like everyone else, it has sound economic fundamentals, and is well positioned to quickly recover.

“The New Zealand Business Forum will showcase to regional business leaders seven of our leading companies working in biotechnology, the creative sector, and ‘green’ technologies, and it will do a lot to boost New Zealand’s business profile in one of our most important markets.”

After the Forum Mr McCully will meet Singapore Foreign Minister George Yeo, and Second Minister of Defence Ng Eng Heng.

“Singapore is this year’s APEC Chair. It is also a key player in South East Asian political, trade, and defence arrangements, so I look forward to sharing perspectives with Mr Yeo.

“The meeting with Dr Ng, who has just been appointed an honorary adviser to the Asia New Zealand Foundation, reflects the very close defence ties we have with Singapore,” Mr McCully said.
