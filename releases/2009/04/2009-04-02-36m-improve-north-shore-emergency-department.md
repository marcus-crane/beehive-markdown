The Ministers of Health and Finance have approved $36 million to improve North Shore Hospital's emergency department.

Health Minister Tony Ryall said, "This project will help resolve two issues the Waitemata District Health Board has been struggling with, by providing a significant increase in capacity in the Emergency Department, and extra inpatient beds."

The total cost of the project is $48 million.

Mr Ryall said "The public has made it clear that emergency department performance is of concern, and North Shore Hospital is no exception. The current service has not been able to keep up with population growth and demands for emergency care.

"More emergency care beds, a new assessment and diagnostic unit, and more inpatient beds should add up to improved service in the emergency department.

"This won't fix the problems overnight, but it is a major part of the solution," Mr Ryall said.

The proposal includes an extra 26 emergency department cubicles (currently 16), another 19 beds in the admissions planning unit (currently 37), and an extra 48 medical inpatient beds (currently 170).

The next step in the process is for the development of a preliminary design plan, and it is expected the extension will be completed in late 2011.
