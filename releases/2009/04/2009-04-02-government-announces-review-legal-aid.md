The Government is to undertake a fundamental review of the legal aid system, Justice Minister Simon Power announced tonight.

Dame Margaret Bazley will chair the review team, which will consist of a yet-to-be-appointed panel of experts from a variety of backgrounds.

Dame Margaret is a retired public service Chief Executive.  She headed the Commission of Inquiry into Police Conduct, was a member of the Royal Commission on Auckland Governance, and is Chair of the Fire Service.

Speaking to legal aid experts from around the world at the International Legal Aid Group meeting in Wellington, Mr Power pointed to rising concerns about access to justice, high costs, and impacts on the courts system.

"I don't need to tell you that in the current fiscal environment, legal aid systems are likely to face increasing challenges in achieving their objectives," he said.

"Legal aid has a defining role in upholding access to justice.  By funding legal aid services, governments give effect to the principles of equality before the law and natural justice.

"This upholds public confidence in the legitimacy and effectiveness of the justice system.  As Minister of Justice, I am committed to the goal of ensuring access to justice for all New Zealanders."

Mr Power said the review would consider all aspects of the legal aid system.

"The purpose is to consider how the system can best be structured so it delivers effective legal services to those who need them most, in a way that is cost-effective and sustainable.

"Quality will be an important focus, as will ensuring that any changes have a positive impact on the wider justice system, especially on the way the courts operate."

The review will also focus on developing alternative approaches to manage or reduce costs.

Public consultation will start soon and proposals will be announced early next year.
