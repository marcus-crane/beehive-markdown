A new food safety guide designed for marae cooks will be officially launched at Turangawaewae Marae in Ngaruawahia tomorrow.

The New Zealand Food Safety Authority guide, named Te Kai Manawa Ora, provides up-to-date advice on food safety.

“Sharing kai is a core element of Maori culture, and the marae is often the centre of this experience,” says Minister for Food Safety Kate Wilkinson.

“This guide aims to help maintain the mana and dignity of marae cooks by providing them with hints and tips for keeping food safe.”

Associate Minister of Maori Affairs Georgina te Heuheu will join Ms Wilkinson for the launch.

As well as covering topics such as how to buy, store, cook and serve food safely, Te Kai Manawa Ora also gives food safety tips for some traditional Maori food practices.

This includes gathering puha, watercress and kaimoana, making a hangi and serving recreationally caught meat.

The guide was developed by NZFSA, public health units and Maori health providers.

It was written in response to requests for more information from whanau, hapu and iwi following the release in 2004 of NZFSA’s *Hangi Guide*. 

Anyone can download the guide from NZFSA’s website [www.nzfsa.govt.nz](http://www.nzfsa.govt.nz/).
