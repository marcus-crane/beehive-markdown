The West Coast town Franz Josef Glacier must not be overlooked in any support for the country's ambulance services, Minister of Community and Voluntary Sector Tariana Turia said.

"I realise that a lot of services could do with extra help, but due to Franz Josef Glacier's geographic isolation, lack of cell phone coverage, large influx of visitors and risky recreational activities, their local service must be given more help."

"I'm surprised that their service has managed to survive this long and I'd hope to see some sort of benefit for them should the St John's hierarchy receive any significant funding from the Government in the near future," Mrs Turia said.

"It's great that giving is the norm at St John's Franz Josef Glacier and we must do all we can to support and help share their load."

St John's Franz Josef Glacier is fully reliant on voluntary effort and is one of the most isolated ambulance services in the country, being about three hours drive to the nearest hospital. Unlike a handful of other isolated towns that have volunteer ambulance services, Franz Josef Glacier is a popular tourism destination with about 2700 visitors a day during peak season.

The service currently has seven volunteers - all of whom juggle their 12 hour voluntary shifts with their paid work.

The Government is currently working on a plan to improve rural ambulance services - the majority of which are run by volunteers.
