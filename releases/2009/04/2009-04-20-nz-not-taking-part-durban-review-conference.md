New Zealand will not take part in the Durban Review Conference in Geneva, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"When the World Conference Against Racism was held in Durban, South Africa, seven years ago it was extremely contentious. It gave rise to expressions of anti-Israeli views which undermined its focus on genuine anti-racism initiatives," Mr McCully said.

"I was determined that New Zealand's participation in the Review Conference would be on the basis of a draft outcome document that did not endorse the 2001 Declaration, and which responsibly and productively addressed racism. 

"It would also need to avoid circumscribing freedom of expression, such as in the contentious area of ‘defamation of religion'.

"I am not satisfied that the wording emerging from preparatory discussions will prevent the Review Conference from descending into the same kind of rancorous and unproductive debate that took place in 2001.

"It is a pity that this should have been the case. Combating racism and related intolerance is an important cause, and one to which New Zealand attaches the highest importance.

"However the Review Conference in Geneva is not likely to advance the cause of race relations at the international level, and so New Zealand, like many other countries, will not be represented at it," Mr McCully said.
