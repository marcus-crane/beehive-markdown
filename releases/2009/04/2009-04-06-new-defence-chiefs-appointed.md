Defence Minister Wayne Mapp has announced the appointment of new Chiefs of Navy and Army.

Commodore Tony Parr has been appointed Chief of Navy and Major General Rhys Jones the Chief of Army, both effective 1 May.

Dr Mapp said that both officers are respected leaders who will make valuable contributions to their services and the Defence Force. 

"They will also provide new perspectives and insights for the Defence White Paper," said Dr Mapp.

Commodore Parr, who will be promoted to Rear Admiral, is currently the Maritime Component Commander at Headquarters Joint Forces New Zealand, and was Deputy Chief of Navy from April 2006-November 2007. He was the first Commanding Officer of the frigate HMNZS Te Mana and previously commanded HMNZS Waikato.

"Commodore Parr's achievements throughout his career are impressive. He takes command at a significant time for the Navy as the Protector fleet comes into service. Commodore Parr is ideally suited to lead the Navy through the next stages of its development," said Dr Mapp.

Major General Jones is currently the Commander Joint Forces New Zealand. He has held a variety of command appointments including as Commanding Officer of New Zealand's armoured regiment, Queen Alexandra's Mounted Rifles, and of the 3rd Land Force Group based at Burnham camp near Christchurch.

"Major General Jones has had a distinguished career in the Army. He is highly qualified and experienced in all facets of Defence Force operations. He will provide outstanding leadership in this new role," said Dr Mapp.

"I congratulate them both on their appointments and wish them successful terms of office."

The new chiefs succeed Rear Admiral David Ledson and Major General Lou Gardiner, who retire on 30 April.
