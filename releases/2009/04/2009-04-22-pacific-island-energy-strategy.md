Energy and Resources Minister, Gerry Brownlee, has arrived in Tonga for the Pacific Energy Ministers Meeting (PEMM).

The conference is being held at Nuku'alofa with 16 other energy ministers from around the Pacific attending. It is only the second time Pacific Island energy ministers have met.

"New Zealand is playing a leading role in developing a Pacific Plan and energy is a pillar of that plan for island states dealing with scare resources," said Mr Brownlee.

"While it's too early to pre-judge any outcome from this forum, there are certainly many areas of work. For example Pacific Island nations pay some of highest prices in the world for landed fuel exports, and are dependent on diesel supplies."

"Any progress towards regional co-operation on procurement and efficient supply will be important for the energy costs of small island nations. The potential of renewable generation will also be discussed," he said.

The meeting comes as New Zealand recently announced a new pilot programme in the international partnership for Energy Development in Island Nations (EDIN)

New Zealand scientists will be assessing the potential for geothermal electricity generation within a number of Pacific Island nations.

Geothermal resources have the potential to provide base load electricity at a fraction of the cost of diesel generation, which is the main source of electricity in many Pacific Island nations.

The research is being lead by scientists from GNS and sponsored by a range of New Zealand government agencies.

While in Tonga Mr Brownlee will also be attending ANZAC Day services in Nuku'alofa.
