Industry Training Organisations (ITOs) are be given more flexibility to help trainees find jobs, says Tertiary Education Minister Anne Tolley.

“Following the National Government’s Job Summit, it has been decided to extend the time frame for trainees to find work while still being eligible for government training subsidies.

“If industry trainees are made redundant, they will now remain ‘active’ for funding purposes for 12 weeks, double the previous six week limit.

“This will give ITOs and Modern Apprenticeship Co-ordinators a better opportunity to use industry networks and find trainees a new job.

“This is the start of our response to Prime Minister John Key’s desire to keep trainees in jobs as stated at the Job Summit.”

Mrs Tolley has today also released two Ministry of Education studies into industry training completion rates. The government will be analysing the results of these studies in the coming months to look at ways to improve completion rates.
