The Hon Heather Roy has welcomed the tabling of Ministerial delegations in Parliament in her capacities as Associate Minister of Education and Associate Minister of Defence.

"In Education, I have been delegated responsibility for all matters relating to Special Education and the Independent Schools sector.  Both are important facets of the Education portfolio and I look forward to tackling the issues present in these areas," Mrs Roy said.

"I have initiated a review of Special Education which will identify current difficulties and possible solutions. It will also consider funding issues and ways of allocating the extra resources promised by the National Party before the 2008 election.

"Independent Schools provide additional choice in the Education sector and I am very pleased to have been given delegated authority in this area.

"In Defence, I have been delegated  a wide range of responsibilities including: personnel, infrastructure and support services, defence industry and two special projects - the Air Combat Force Disposal Unit, and governance of the Joint Command and Control System project.

"The Defence personnel function addresses the core of our military capability - our people - and includes all recruitment, retention and training, Reserve Forces and the New Zealand Cadet Force.

"Defence infrastructure covers all land and buildings and, together with the domestic and export aspects of defence industry, offers significant opportunities for innovation in both Defence and broader economic terms. I intend to maintain focus in this area on current and future capability support requirements.

"I am pleased to be involved with the National and ACT Parties working positively together as part of our Confidence & Supply Agreement.  The delegated areas I have been given responsibility for in both portfolios highlight the good working relationship that we have developed.

"I look forward to working with Education Minister Anne Tolley, Defence Minister Wayne Mapp and their respective departments," Mrs Roy said.
