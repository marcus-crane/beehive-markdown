Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce is seeking feedback on Telecom's recent request for the government to consider a proposed variation of the company's Operational Separation Undertakings.

The proposed variation relates to Telecom's ability to facilitate more efficient delivery of services to its wholesale customers. It does not relate to the government's recent announcement of its ultra-fast broadband investment proposal.   

The Operational Separation Undertakings, which had the effect of splitting Telecom into three separate business units, came into effect on 31 March 2008. The need for a process to allow variation of the Undertakings was envisaged at the time they were developed.

"The proposed variation focuses on a technical issue relating to Telecom's wholesale service delivery," Mr Joyce said.  "I welcome public and industry views on whether the proposed variation meets the purposes set out in Part 2A of the Telecommunications Act 2001. Those views will be taken into account in considering Telecom's request."

The proposal is available at [http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/MultipageDocumentTOC\_\_\_\_40616.aspx](http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/MultipageDocumentTOC____40616.aspx).

Submissions close at 5pm on **1 May**. They should be sent to [brian.johns@med.govt.nz](mailto:reg.hammond@med.govt.nz).
