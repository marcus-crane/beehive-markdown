Almost a million superannuitants, veterans, beneficiaries and students will get increased payments of at least 3.38% from today under the Annual General Adjustment, Social Development and Employment Minister Paula Bennett said.

More than half a million New Zealanders receive increases of up to $13 a week in their NZ Super or Veteran’s Pension payments, she said.

“National promised the net married couple rates of NZ Super and Veteran’s Pension would be set at no less than 66% of the average after-tax wage. We’re delivering on that promise,” Ms Bennett said.

NZ Super or Veteran’s Pension payments for qualifying couples rise by up to $15.64 a week, to $478.38 a week, compared to 1 October last year. For a single person living alone, super and veteran’s payments go up by $13.16 a week to $310.95.

People receiving NZ Super at the single rate get a higher increase than the 3.38% Consumer Price Index rise applying to most payments. The single sharing rate increases by 4.07%, while the single living alone rate goes up by 4.42%. This restores the relationship between the net single rates and the net married couple rate, as required by law. This had been altered following the 1 October 2008 tax changes.

About 343,000 beneficiaries and 47,000 students get increased payments. A married couple on the unemployment benefit gets $10.38 a week, or $5.19 each. The allowance for a single student aged 18-23 living away from home goes up $5.20 a week to $158.65, and the amount he or she can earn increases by $6.28 to $192.01 a week before their allowance starts to reduce.

7747 families receiving Orphan’s and Unsupported Child Benefits will have their weekly payments increased to match the Foster Care Allowance weekly board rates. The new weekly rates range from $132.32 for a child aged under 5 years to $185.25 for a child aged 14 years and over.

“I’m really pleased to make this change, which recognises the vital role played by grandparents and other relatives who step in to raise children when their natural parents cannot or will not,” Ms Bennett said.
