An extensive programme of public consultation on the shape of National Standards for primary and intermediate schools will get underway next month.

“I am delighted to announce this first step in the implementation of one of this government’s flagship policies in education,” says Education Minister Anne Tolley.

“National Standards will set clear expectations about what students should be able to achieve in literacy and numeracy and by when. Students’ performance against these standards will be reported to parents in plain language.

“Parents want to know how well their children are doing and what they can expect when extra help is needed. This policy is about using existing assessment tools to provide feedback that supports student learning and teacher effectiveness. Consultation will establish who needs access to what information. Can I say again, there will be no single national test.”

The Ministry of Education is working with small teams of literacy, numeracy and assessment experts to develop draft standards. Ministry staff will consult with schools, parents and the community between 25 May and 3 July 2009.

“The Ministry is also meeting with a Standards Reference Group, featuring representatives from key sector organisations including the School Trustees Association (NZSTA), the Principals’ Federation (NZPF), the NZ Educational Institute (NZEI) and the Post Primary Teachers’ Association (PPTA).

“This a milestone development in our education system. I encourage parents, educators, students, employers and members of the community to have a say during the consultation, and to help the government decide the shape of the standards to be used in schools from 2010.”

**National Standards Frequently Asked Questions**

**What are National Standards?**

National Standards are statements of what a child should be able to achieve in literacy and numeracy (reading, writing, and mathematics) at each year of primary and intermediate school.

National Standards will be used by all English and Maori-medium primary and intermediate schools from 2010. Assessment will show where each child sits against the standard and what progress they have made.

**How will students be assessed?**

Final decisions will be made after consultation. Teachers and schools will use a mix of the assessment tools they are already using. These may include asTTle, PAT, STAR, portfolios and exemplars. For more information on assessment in schools see [www.tki.org.nz/r/assessment/index\_e.php](http://www.tki.org.nz/r/assessment/index_e.php).

**Why are National Standards being introduced?**

The government wants to see all students start secondary school with excellent numeracy and literacy skills; more students leaving school with higher qualifications; and parents, families and whānau having a clear picture of how their children are doing at school.

**Will the standards be used in all schools?**

Yes. All English and Maori-medium primary and intermediate schools will use the standards from 2010.

**What is the consultation for?**

To gather feedback from the education sector and to learn from parents, families, and whanau about what kind of reporting from schools works best for them.

**When will consultation start?**

Consultation will start on May 25 and finish on July 3.

Around 45 meetings will be held with parents throughout New Zealand, and will be organised with schools.

**What will the format of the consultation meetings be?**

Education sector workshops, for both English and Māori medium schools and settings, will present four draft standards and seek feedback on things such as whether the standards are set at the right level, and the way information is reported to parents. The workshops will last approximately half a day.

The meetings with parents will be organised with specially selected schools so that a good cross-section of parents, family and whānau members have the opportunity to provide their views. Each meeting will run for two hours.  Parents will have the opportunity to comment on examples of plain-language school reports on the National Standards and to provide information about how schools can help them to support their children’s learning.

The Ministry of Education is also meeting with a Standards Reference Group before and after consultation to discuss the draft proposals.

In addition Ministry staff are available to attend some other education sector meetings by request. 

All consultation material will also be on the Ministry website, [www.minedu.govt.nz](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/).

**Will there be other opportunities to give feedback?**

Ministry staff will be available to provide information about the standards at other meetings if requested. These should involve a reasonable number of people or be regionally based – for example a Regional Principals Association meeting; or a meeting of 30 – 40 parents.

If you would like a Ministry staff member to attend a meeting, please email [national.standards@minedu.govt.nz](mailto:national.standards@minedu.govt.nz).

**What is the Standards Reference Group?**

The Standards Reference Group consists of people from education sector groups like the School Trustees Association, New Zealand Principals Federation and the New Zealand Education Institute (the primary school teachers union). The Reference Group is meeting with the Ministry of Education to discuss the draft standards before and after the formal consultation.

**How can I make a submission?**

Submissions can be made online at [www.minedu.govt.nz](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/), in writing, or at meetings. Two submission forms will be provided – one on all aspects of the standards, and one for parents to provide feedback on the information they want to see in school reports and how they can support their children’s learning. General submissions will also be accepted.

Any individual or organisation can make a submission.

**How will Boards of Trustees be involved in consultation?**

Boards will be invited to the education sector workshops, and can make submissions. In addition the New Zealand School Trustees Association has a representative on the Standards Reference Group.

**Do National Standards mean there will be National Testing?**

No - there will not be a single test for all students on a single day. Teachers will be able to use a range of methods to assess students, and will use their professional judgement to choose which are best.

**How do the National Standards support the curriculum?**

Students need literacy and numeracy skills to learn in all areas of the curriculum. Standards will be linked to the content of the New Zealand Curriculum and Te Marautanga o Aotearoa.

**How will assessment information be used?**

Schools will be required to report to parents in plain language. This will give parents clear and honest reports on their children and alert them early if their child is having learning difficulties. Reports will outline the next steps for the teacher and child at school and any areas that need development or extra support. They will also suggest next steps parents can use to support their child’s learning at home.

Assessment information will also be used by schools to track progress and provide feedback that improves learning.
