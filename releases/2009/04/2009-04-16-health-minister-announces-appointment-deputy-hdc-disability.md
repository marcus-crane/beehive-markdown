Health Minister Tony Ryall has announced the appointment of Tania Thomas, as Deputy Health and Disability Commissioner - Disability.

Mr Ryall says, "Ms Thomas has already completed 5 years as deputy commissioner, responsible for education and corporate services, however her role has been changed to take greater responsibility for disability issues."

Ms Thomas is of Ngati Kahu descent and has extensive management and governance experience in the health and disability non-governmental sector and a keen interest in initiatives for Māori.

The National Party committed pre-election to ensuring that one of the Deputy Commissioners would have a disabilities focus.
