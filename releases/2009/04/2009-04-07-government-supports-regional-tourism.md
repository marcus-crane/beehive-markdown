Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman, Associate Minister for Tourism, is pleased to be able to announce a grant of $103 000 to Regional Tourism Organisations New Zealand (RTONZ), the group that collectively represents New Zealand’s 29 Regional Tourism Organisations.

The grant will be used by Regional Tourism Organisations to implement initiatives identified in the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015.

RTONZ propose to use the funding to achieve the following outcomes:

- Greater influence on council plans and activities related to tourism.
- Wider community and stakeholder engagement with the tourism industry, and support for visitor’s activities.
- Understanding changing distribution patterns, and identify the resources needed from RTOs.

“I know that this money will go to good use. The tourism industry is going to play a vital role in contributing to our economy throughout this recession and this government is determined to do what it can to support the tourism industry," says Associate Minister for Tourism, Dr Jonathan Coleman.

"The government recognises that because Regional Tourism Organisations are regionally based they are absolutely in-tune with tourism in their regions. They work with Tourism New Zealand and each other to promote their own distinctive regional offerings to Kiwis and international visitors. Regional Tourism Organisations are extremely valuable to the fabric of New Zealand tourism.”
