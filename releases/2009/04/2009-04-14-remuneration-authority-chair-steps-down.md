Remuneration Authority Chair David Oughton will step down when his term ends on July 31 this year, Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson announced today.

"Mr Oughton indicated in January that he did not want to be considered for reappointment when his term expires and I have accepted his resignation.

"He has achieved distinction in a long career as a dedicated public servant. His six years with the Remuneration Authority have included four as Chair. I wish him all the best in whatever he chooses to do," Ms Wilkinson says.

Mr Oughton's position as Chair is to be advertised by the Department of Labour, as is a position of an authority member, currently held by Angela Foulkes, whose term expired last year.

"Advertising the positions will give people who believe they have the skills and experience to fulfil these roles a chance to be considered for appointment," Ms Wilkinson says.

The Authority has three members, one of whom is appointed Chair. Members are appointed for terms of up to three years.

Among the Authority's responsibilities are determining salaries and allowances for members of Parliament, the Judiciary, other statutory positions and for the country's mayors and local authority representatives.

Advertisements will appear in the coming weeks with a closing date of 4 May.
