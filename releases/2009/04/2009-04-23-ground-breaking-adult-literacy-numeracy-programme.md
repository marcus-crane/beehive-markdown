Tertiary Education Minister Anne Tolley has today announced a multi-million dollar agreement for a professional development programme in the adult literacy and numeracy sector.

"This agreement will provide tertiary educators with new techniques to raise adult literacy and numeracy skills," says Mrs Tolley.

The three-year programme, led by the University of Waikato, includes sustained professional development with tutors working in many different tertiary settings to raise adult literacy and numeracy levels. The contract for the programme is worth between $3 million and $4million per year, and will be funded from current baselines.

"We know that adults learn best in a context that is relevant to them. Studies show that approximately 1.1 million adult New Zealanders need better literacy skills. This project will put both literacy and numeracy into new kinds of learning environments that connect with these New Zealanders."

Mrs Tolley says that training tutors and improving their skills, provides an affordable and long-lasting response to adult literacy and numeracy issues.

"Situating this programme within a university education faculty will provide sound academic leadership and links with research and teaching qualifications."

The agreement announced today ensures that the University of Waikato can establish a centre of expertise in teaching literacy and numeracy to adults.
