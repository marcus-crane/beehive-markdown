Courts Minister Georgina te Heuheu today officially welcomed the new Māori Land Court Chief Judge as he was sworn in at a ceremony at Tokomaru Bay.

Chief Judge Wilson Whare Isaac was sworn in at the Pakirikiri marae north of Gisborne. The ceremony was attended by the Minister of Māori Affairs Pita Sharples, Chief Justice Sian Elias, Chief District Court Judge Russell Johnson, Māori Land Court Judges, other members of the judiciary, whanau and friends.

Mrs te Heuheu said that Chief Judge Isaac was eminently suited to the role of Chief Judge of the Māori Land Court which, in her view, was no ordinary Court.

"It is a forum for the people," she said.

"Its task is to seek to ascertain and give effect to the wishes of the owners, to ensure fairness in dealing with Māori land, and to promote practical solutions to issues arising in the use and management of land."

Acknowledging the years he had already served on the Bench, Mrs te Heuheu said the Chief Judge's upbringing in remote communities and his previous experience working with Māori trusts and incorporations placed him in a strong position to successfully lead the Court in the 21st century as it met the rising expectations of the land owners.

"The Head of Bench of any Court has an important leadership role in promoting confidence in the Court as an institution, and providing collegial leadership across the Bench," she said.

Chief Judge Isaac had been acting in the role since last September when the former Chief Judge, now Justice Joe Williams, was appointed to the High Court.

He was appointed to the Māori Land Court bench in 1994, and then became the Deputy Chief Judge in 1999. During his time as a Judge he presided in the Tai Rawhiti and Takitimu Māori Land Court districts.
