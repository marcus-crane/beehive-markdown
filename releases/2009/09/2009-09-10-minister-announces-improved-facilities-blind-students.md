Associate Minister of Education Heather Roy today announced that the Government has approved $14.9 million to rebuild the Blind and Low Vision Education Network New Zealand (BLENNZ) Homai Campus in Auckland.

"Blind students from throughout New Zealand attend the Homai Campus, yet its current facilities are substandard and obsolete," Mrs Roy said.

"BLENNZ provides a true network of services nationally, with most blind or low vision children and young people able to attend their local school but also receive more intensive services at the Homai campus.

"Students, families, specialists and teachers will all benefit from the new development which will support BLENNZ to be a Centre of Excellence for the education of vision-impaired children and young people.

"The redevelopment of Homai Campus will provide students with a higher standard of accommodation and greatly improved facilities - modernising the school's national resource centre, assessment centre, teaching and learning centre, and early childhood services.

"This decision acknowledges the role that the BLENNZ Homai Campus plays in educating blind students at a local, regional and national level and in providing opportunities to enhance educational outcomes for these students.

"The re-development of the Homai Campus - scheduled to be completed in 2011 - reflects the Government's commitment to improving choices and resources available to students with special needs," Mrs Roy said.
