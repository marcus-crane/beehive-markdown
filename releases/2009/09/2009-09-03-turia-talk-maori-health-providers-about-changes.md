Tariana Turia has organised meetings throughout the country to talk directly with Maori health providers about the Government's plans to change the primary health care system.

"There are concerns among Maori in the health sector about what's going to happen, so it's only right that I meet with them face to face to explain what will be happening over the coming months, and how they will be affected," Mrs Turia, who is responsible for Maori health, said.

The Government wants to see significant improvements to deliver a more personalised primary health care system that provides services closer to home and makes people healthier, Mrs Turia said.

The first, of the four hui, starts in Taupo at Wairakei Resort tomorrow morning (Friday September 4). Other hui are also planned for Wellington on September 10, Auckland on September 17 and Christchurch on September 21.

Media are welcome to attend those hui.
