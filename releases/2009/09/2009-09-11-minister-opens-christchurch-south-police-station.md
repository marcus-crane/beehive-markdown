The Government's commitment to front-line policing was reinforced today, with Police Minister Judith Collins officially opening the new Christchurch South Police station.

The station is the seventh opened since Ms Collins became Minister.

Ms Collins said the Police's state-of-the-art, well-resourced facility was a boost for both local officers and the surrounding community.

"For many years, the officers here have operated out of a cramped converted Police house and a warehouse. I think it is fair to say on behalf of those officers that this station could not have come soon enough.

"This new building is the bricks and mortar foundation of the taxpayers' investment in Christchurch's southern suburbs. This is a fast-growing community and it deserves to have a fully-equipped Police force which can respond effectively to people's needs."

Ms Collins said the $7.5 million station would be the nerve centre for Police operations in the area.

"For the first time in more than a decade, uniform staff and CIB will be under one roof, allowing for a better flow of information and for more cohesive teams.

"A police station is more than a place for officers to work - it is a power for good in the community. The fact that this station is already seeing increased numbers of people walking through its doors to report crimes, or simply to talk to the officers, shows how positively communities respond to their local Police."

A feature of the Colombo St station is the community rooms, which Ms Collins said brought the public into the heart of the operation to talk , hold meetings and to build relationships with Police.

"Community policing is the cornerstone of the New Zealand force - this station is a testament to that. It's vital the Police build strong bonds with their communities and this new station gives the public and police a hub where they can work together.

"As far back as 1993, this modern facility was envisaged for Christchurch South. Now, 16 years on, I'm proud to announce that vision is a reality."
