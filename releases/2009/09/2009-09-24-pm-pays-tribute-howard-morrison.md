Prime Minister John Key says it is with great sadness that he has learned of the death of one of New Zealand's greatest and most loved entertainers.

Sir Howard Morrison died in Rotorua today, aged 74.

Mr Key, speaking from New York where he is at the United Nations, says Howard Morrison has been at the forefront of New Zealand music for more than 50 years and his contribution was immense.

"Sir Howard was a New Zealand success story. From humble beginnings he became an international success, first with the Howard Morrison Quartet, and then in an illustrious solo career.

"But more than that, Sir Howard was one of New Zealand's best loved entertainers, his appeal spanning every age group."

Howard Morrison was knighted in 1990 for services to entertainment.

"I pay tribute to a real gentleman. My thoughts are with his whanau at this time. Sir Howard Morrison will be greatly missed."
