Veterans Affairs Minister Judith Collins today joined world leaders at a ceremony in Poland to mark the 70th anniversary of the start of World War II.

The ceremony was held at Westerplatte on the Baltic coast, where the Germans fired the first shots against Poland at the start of their invasion on September 1, 1939.

Ms Collins placed a candle at the Monument of the Defenders of Westerplatte along with leaders such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.

"Today's ceremony honours the tens of millions from throughout the world who lost their lives during the conflict, and reminds us to heed the lessons of history as we build a free and peaceful future," Ms Collins said.

"From its beginnings here in Poland, World War II touched the lives of countless ordinary people throughout the world.

"Seventy years ago, New Zealand unhesitatingly accepted our international responsibilities to play our part in pushing back tyranny and aggression. It is a role we undertook willingly and proudly, with courage and conviction.

"Around 140,000 New Zealanders served overseas during World War II. Today, we honour their sacrifice, and remember the terrible human toll of war.

"We must never forget the loss in communities throughout New Zealand at news that beloved friends and family would not be coming home. We must never forget the immeasurable suffering of the people of Europe and across the globe.

"And as we honour the memory of all those lost in the Second World War, let us redouble our conviction and our efforts to ensure we never again allow the rise of hatred and the misery it brings to humankind."
