Over $75,000 has been awarded for community-based tourism initiatives, Associate Minister of Tourism Jonathan Coleman announced today.

Three grants have been awarded through the Tourism Facilities Grants Programme (TFGP) to assist with the provision of physical tourism facilities that cannot be made available on a commercial basis.

"I am delighted to be able to present grants to projects which will provide or improve a nationally significant tourism facility. Any project which adds value to our tourism product is important to the overall success of our tourism industry," says Dr Coleman.

The three successful recipients this year are:

- The Department of Conservation in Greymouth has been awarded $35, 000 for the production and installation of interpretation signs at the Brunner Mine Site.
- The Phar Lap Charitable Trust in Timaru has received $23,500 for the development and production of information panels and bronze plaques at the Phar Lap racecourse.
- The Wellington Tramway Museum on the Kapiti Coast has been given $16,900 to build an ‘all weather protected' access pathway between the museum barn and the visitor centre.

"These projects are designed to enhance the understanding and enjoyment of New Zealand by overseas visitors," says Dr Coleman.

A total of $300,000 was awarded in the October 2008 TFGP funding round. Applications for this year's funding round close 1 October 2009.
