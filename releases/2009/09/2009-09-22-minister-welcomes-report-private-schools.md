Associate Minister of Education Heather Roy today welcomed the tabling in Parliament of the New Zealand Law Commission report on 'Private Schools and the Law'.

"Most of the legislation affecting private schools dates back to the 1920s - while some remains unchanged since 1877," Mrs Roy said.

"The Commission has completed a systematic review of the legislation, gathering information and holding discussions with a wide range of individuals and agencies.  Many private schools made submissions on the issues paper released by the Commission earlier this year.

"The Law Commission has recommended modernising the legislation in the Education Act 1989.  It recommends implementing safeguards around students' safety and welfare, and dealing with serious problems in the sector should they arise.

"The Government has no issues with the way private schools operate in New Zealand.  They offer choice and competition in education so families have more freedom to select schooling options that best meet the individual needs of their children.

"Private schools enjoy considerable freedom from Government regulation but, as they receive some public funding, the Government does set minimum expectations on private schools through legislation.

"Freedom of choice in education is important, but that freedom must be supported by modern and easy-to-read legislation that is reviewed regularly and updated to ensure that it achieves what is intended.

"I acknowledge the thoughtful and comprehensive consideration that Professor Burrows and his team have given to the issues and look forward to reviewing his recommendations in more detail.

"The Government now has six months to consider the report before deciding whether to act on these recommendations.  In that time we will consult with private schools on the report," Mrs Roy said.
