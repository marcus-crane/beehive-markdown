Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced that Te Hauke School in Hawkes Bay is to close on October 9.

The school had no students for the first term of this year, and now has just six students enrolled, who travel from Flaxmere.

"After considering feedback from consultation, I don't believe Te Hauke School has a viable future," said Mrs Tolley.

"There is no prospect of population growth and the current students have access to their local schools where they will receive a much better education. 

"Students are currently being taught by a relief teacher. It is not in anyone's interests to have this situation continue."

The school's commissioner agrees that closure is the best option.

Local students generally enrol at neighbouring Poukawa and Pukehou Schools and the neighbouring schools have no objections to Te Hauke closing. Nearby Pakipaki School, 13 kilometres away, provides Māori immersion learning.

"It is always a difficult decision to close a school, and I have written to the commissioner to show my appreciation for the service staff and former trustees have given to Te Hauke School and its community over the years," said Mrs Tolley.

The school site and buildings will now be disposed of in accordance with all statutory, regulatory and government policy requirements.
