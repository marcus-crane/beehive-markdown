The Minister of Energy and Resources says a high level of renewable electricity generation has been recorded in the latest New Zealand Energy Quarterly release this afternoon.

The data collected by the Ministry of Economic Development shows that in the June quarter 70 percent of electricity came from renewable sources.

This was the third consecutive quarter where generation from renewable sources was 70 percent or more.  Renewable generation is on track to be over 70 percent for the calendar year for the first time since 2004. 

The Minister for Energy and Resources, Gerry Brownlee, says favourable hydro-lake flows this year meant higher use of hydro generation compared with the same time last year.

"This also meant less need to use thermal power stations, in fact generation from fossil fuels was collectively down by 32% compared with the June quarter last year," said Mr Brownlee.

Total emissions from greenhouse gases has increased over the June quarter in line with the normal seasonal variation from higher winter demand being  largely met from fossil fuels, particularly coal.  However, total greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation this quarter were 23% lower.

Other key findings:

Diesel consumption was down seven percent.  The new fuel consumption statistics for the June quarter showed the global recession dented local demand for liquid fuels.  Significant reductions in demand across all fuels and economic sectors occurred this quarter. 

And this quarter the total amount of gas flaring was higher than in the preceding two quarters due to the arrival of the Maari field where all gas is flared.

Details about the data can be found on the MED website.
