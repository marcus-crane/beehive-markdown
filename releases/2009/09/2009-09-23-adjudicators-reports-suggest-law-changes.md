Minister of Consumer Affairs Heather Roy today released the annual reports from Motor Vehicle Disputes Tribunal (MVDT) adjudicators Chris Cornwell (upper North Island) and Nicola Wills (lower North Island and South Island) for the period July 1 2008-June 30 2009.

"The MVDT provides a low-cost option through which consumers can have motor vehicle disputes addressed, and these reports summarise applications the Tribunal dealt with during the year," Mrs Roy said.

"The adjudicators also make recommendations in their reports for amendments to legislation based on the experience of the Tribunal.  The adjudicators have again recommended that the Consumer Guarantees Act be amended to cover vehicles sales through competitive tender and auction.

"This issue will be considered as part of the 'One Law - One Door' review of consumer legislation that I have asked the Ministry of Consumer Affairs to undertake.

"'One Law' refers to a goal of a single principle-based piece of consumer-supplier legislation, similar to the approach found in the Privacy Act, to replace the raft of laws dealing with a variety of transaction types and which - in most cases - have been overtaken by marketplace and technological changes.

"The aim of the review is to achieve rationalisation and simplification of consumer law, and ensure the legislation is up-to-date and relevant," Mrs Roy said.

***The annual reports are released as required by section 87 of the Motor Vehicles Sale Act 2003, and are available on the Consumer Affairs Ministry website*** [***www.consumeraffairs.govt.nz***](http://www.consumeraffairs.govt.nz)***.***
