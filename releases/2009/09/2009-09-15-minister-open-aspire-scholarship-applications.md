Associate Minister of Education Heather Roy invites all media to attend a special press conference tomorrow at which she will open applications for the Government's new Aspire Scholarships for Year 9, 10 and 11 students for the 2010 academic year.

Mrs Roy will outline eligibility criteria for the scholarships and will be joined by Hurricanes player Victor Vito, who will speak about his experiences as a scholarship student at secondary school.

"The Aspire Scholarships are designed to make independent schooling more accessible to students from low-income families, increasing the range of education choices available to New Zealand families," Mrs Roy said.
