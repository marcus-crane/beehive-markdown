New Zealanders will be urged to ‘Give it 100%’ during Rugby World Cup 2011 to ensure visiting teams and supporters have an unforgettable experience, Rugby World Cup Minister Murray McCully said today.

Mr McCully launched the Government’s leverage and legacy plans at a Parliamentary function today attended by Prime Minister John Key, and International Rugby Board Chairman Bernard Lapasset and Chief Executive Mike Miller.

“RWC 2011 is an unprecedented opportunity for New Zealand.  It will be the biggest event ever held in this country, and we plan to make the most of it,” Mr McCully said.

“The Cup will inject over $500 million into the economy, with around half of that going into Auckland. It will also attract over 60,000 international visitors and a global television audience of over four billion.

“New Zealand will be in the international spotlight like never before, and we will be ready.”

Mr McCully said the Government had been developing three main work streams as part of its “New Zealand 2011” strategy:

- A **host** strategy – encouraging New Zealanders to be a “nation of 4 million hosts” to make the tournament an unforgettable experience for players and  supporters

<!--THE END-->

- A **festival** programme – offering a calendar of events that will allow visitors and New Zealanders to experience the best of our sporting and cultural life

<!--THE END-->

- A **showcase** programme – to show the world the very best of everything that New Zealand, as a small trading nation, has to offer

“We are putting in place all the necessary machinery to ensure success. That includes establishing a New Zealand 2011 Office to coordinate the national festival, develop the host and volunteer programmes, and implement a business leveraging programme.

“We have also put in place a steering group of prominent New Zealanders – called the 2011 Group – to provide advice and help drive this work.”

The ‘Give it 100%’ strapline has been selected to spearhead the hosting programme because of its consistency with the ‘100% Pure New Zealand’ campaign used to promote New Zealand as a tourism destination. 

“We want to stay close to New Zealand’s existing branding and not run messages that conflict with the ten-year “100%” theme.

“RWC 2011 is an unprecedented opportunity to raise our international profile, boost our economy and make lasting gains in trade and tourism.

“Our New Zealand 2011 programme is designed to ensure we make the most of that opportunity,” Mr McCully said.
