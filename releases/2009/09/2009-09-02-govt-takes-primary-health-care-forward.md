The Government is moving to achieve the unrealised goals of the Primary Health Care Strategy, announced Health Minister Tony Ryall.

"We are calling for Expressions of Interest (EOI) from primary health care organisations which are capable of delivering larger scale and a wider range of health care to their communities".

"The Primary Healthcare Strategy 2001 sought to revolutionise primary health care services. Yet report after report, including four released yesterday by Victoria University, note that while growth in GP fees has been restrained and PHOs established, very little progress has been made in other, more quality focussed goals."

"Previous Ministers have noted slow progress in getting primary and secondary services working together. They have also stated that the strategy is failing to deliver the quality improvements offered by co-located multi-disciplinary teams, a wider range of services in primary settings, and a strong and expanded role for nursing."

"DHBs were told in the letter of expectations that this year's focus in health would be on areas of urgent public concern in hospitals: elective surgery, emergency departments and cancer waiting times. The focus in 2010/11 is improving primary care."

"Initiatives we may see developed through this process include more walk in access and extended hours for primary care, reducing the number of people showing up at hospital emergency departments, and shifting some hospital services to primary care settings."

"Ultimately, the initiatives will lead to people getting better access to a wider range of health services closer to home.

"And we recognise that the clinicians and health professionals are in the best position to tell us how to make this work for patients."

The EOI process is being managed by the Ministry of Health and documentation is available from today on the Government Electronic Tenders (GETS) website.

An expert panel will assess the expressions of interest in late 2009, and advise the Director General of Health who will decide which responses to progress. Successful respondents will then be invited to develop business cases in early 2010 and will receive financial support to do so.

Implementation should begin in 2010-11.
