Associate Minister for Climate Change Issues Tim Groser leaves for New York today to attend a series of climate change meetings.

Mr Groser will attend the informal Greenland Dialogue with a core group of climate change Ministers and an OECD Sustainable Development meeting comparing mitigation effort, chaired by former Environment Minister Simon Upton.

"These meetings need to build common ground on what the key political issues are and how to resolve them. We have the opportunity in New York for leaders and ministers to get beyond political rhetoric and focus on real concerns.   

"Time is running out before the UN's December climate change conference in Copenhagen, where New Zealand will be urging for a new climate change agreement that all countries can sign on to. 

"New Zealanders will want to know that the deal is fair and the efforts they are called upon to make will lead to a safer future.

"By any measure, New Zealand is in good shape to play a useful role in international climate change negotiations. We have a credible and realistic offer on the table - a 10 to 20 per cent reduction on our 1990 emissions, which is not far behind the most ambitious offer on the table from any developed country.

"With details of a comprehensive Emissions Trading Scheme now finalised, the Government is confident this legislation will pass through Parliament before Copenhagen. Both internationally and domestically, New Zealand is well positioned to make a contribution to global efforts to address the challenge of climate change," Mr Groser said. 

Mr Groser will then join Prime Minister John Key at the UN Secretary General's Summit on Climate Change.

The Summit includes a luncheon with other leaders, corporate CEOs and civil society leaders, where the Prime Minister and Minister Groser will participate in a roundtable on food security.

"Food security and climate change present twin challenges. The world needs to grow more food but must do so without growing emissions.

"While in New York, I will also discuss with other countries New Zealand's proposal to establish a global research alliance on agricultural greenhouse gas mitigation. 

"We see potential for such an alliance to deliver a much-needed increase in international effort and investment in this area, and to better coordinate existing work," Mr Groser said.
