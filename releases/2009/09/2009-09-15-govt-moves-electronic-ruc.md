The government confirmed today that it will allow electronic distance recording and electronic display of road user charges (RUC) licences as it moves towards a simplified, more modern RUC system.

Regulation enabling trucking companies to use electronic distance recording devices to measure road use will soon be developed and is expected to be in place by early next year.

Transport Minister Steven Joyce says this move will go a long way towards reducing compliance costs and the risk of RUC evasion for those who choose to adopt the new technology.

"Many trucking companies already use electronic devices and data collection systems to manage their businesses. Provided they meet performance criteria, they will now be able to use the same technology to manage their RUC.

"This will give transport operators the opportunity to choose reliable electronic devices as an alternative to mechanical hubodometers and paper licences."

"Electronic distance recording is more efficient than existing mechanical methods and can make the operation of RUC easier for heavy vehicle operators."

These decisions follow recommendations from an independent review of the RUC system. The Review saw the progressive and voluntary introduction of modern electronic technology as key to updating and enhancing the RUC system.
