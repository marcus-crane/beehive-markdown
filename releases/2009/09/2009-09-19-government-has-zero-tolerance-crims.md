The National-led government is clamping down on criminals with a raft of new legislation, Police and Corrections Minister Judith Collins told the Sensible Sentencing Trust's Victims' Rights Conference today.

Ms Collins, addressing the Trust in Taupo, says the government is acting on the concerns of New Zealanders who have had enough of gangs, drugs and illegal, dangerous behaviour.

"People expect safe communities. People expect their families to be safe in their homes. This isn't too much to ask. But many people feel they don't have that security in the 21st century.

"Law-abiding New Zealanders are sick and tired of seeing their rights eroded and, in many cases, ignored in favour of the rights of criminals. This government is not standing for that. We're increasing the powers of the Police and the justice system to send a clear message to offenders - your law-breaking is not going unpunished."

Ms Collins says the Vehicle Confiscation and Seizure Bill will add an extra layer of authority to current legislation, meaning all vehicles used in illegal street racing - even those owned by a third party - could come under the crusher.

"Ordinary citizens, particularly those in Christchurch, have borne the brunt of hooligans running riot in their vehicles. It puts everyone in danger - including the dangerous drivers themselves.

"Labour has acted in bad faith on this Bill.

"Labour, by its own admission, didn't make the law tough enough - so we're aiming to fix it in order to rid the streets of anti-social behaviour.

"We are still negotiating with other parties to secure this legislation for law abiding New Zealanders."

Ms Collins told the Trust that for too long, there had been a sector of society continually making excuses for criminals.

"This government is putting the brakes on that hand-wringing industry.

Among the new powers for Police is the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act 2009, which will make it easier for Police to seize the assets and profits of gangs. The law will also be an effective tool in the fight against illegal drugs, particularly P."

The new law comes into force on 1 December.

Other powers for Police either in the legislative process or about to come into effect include the Gangs and Organised Crime Bill 2009, the Domestic Violence (Enhancing Safety) Bill and the Anti Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Bill.

"Criminals are warned: your drug dealing, your extortion, your theft, your violence, your dangerous, life-threatening driving - none of it is tolerated by the government, by the Police, or by New Zealand."
