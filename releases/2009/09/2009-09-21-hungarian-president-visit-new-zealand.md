Prime Minister John Key says the President of Hungary will visit New Zealand later this week.

His Excellency Mr László Sólyom will be in New Zealand 24-27 Sept.

"New Zealand's links with Hungary are steadily strengthening, with a strong base of people-to-people links that date back to the 1950s," says Mr Key. 

"President Sólyom's visit provides an important opportunity to build on our cooperation across education, science, investment, environment, and cultural development.

"We are keen to work more closely with Hungary, particularly in research, science and technology. 

"As an EU member sharing similar values to New Zealand, Hungary is a valued partner in New Zealand's efforts to develop even closer relations with the European Union, our second largest trading partner."

President Sólyom will be received in an official welcome by the Governor General and, in the absence of Prime Minister John Key who will be at the United Nations in New York, will meet Acting Prime Minister Bill English.

His New Zealand programme will focus on education, scientific and cultural links, and include meeting the significant Hungarian community in New Zealand. 

He will also give an environmental lecture on Friday at Auckland University.
