Education Minister Anne Tolley today announced capital funding of almost $800,000 to establish a new teen parent facility attached to Invercargill's James Hargest College.

"This unit is the first of its kind in Invercargill and will eventually cater for up to 30 parents and their children," said Mrs Tolley.

"The Invercargill unit will ensure that teenage parents can continue with their education while their children can access quality early childhood education.

"Lifting the educational success of teenage parents can have a great impact on the future success of their children. One of the goals of Teen Parent Units is to provide strong early learning foundations."

The unit and attached Early Childhood Education centre will be located on the site of the former Surrey Park Primary School and is scheduled to open next year.

"This will be New Zealand's 19th Teen Parent Unit and the third in the South Island. Its establishment will complement and support the excellent work already being done by the existing schools and early childhood services."
