Māori are positioning themselves as a major contributor to the Auckland economy, according to a new report updating the economic contribution of Māori to the Auckland region and to the New Zealand economy.

Associate Minister of Māori Affairs Georgina te Heuheu told a function organised by Auckland Plus, Te Puni Kōkiri and the Auckland Chamber of Commerce in Auckland today that between 2003 and 2006, the Māori contribution to New Zealand's GDP rose from 1.96 percent to  5.35 percent.

"The Māori entrepreneurial spirit is also very much alive and well in Auckland. This is very important because it is one of the key areas where Māori will grow prosperity even further," she said.

Previous   research had identified five key intervention points to foster greater Māori participation in the future economy by:

- Leveraging Māori businesses into growth and strategic industries
- Increasing export growth participation
- Improving the qualification base for Māori
- Promoting higher levels of entrepreneurship
- Nurturing innovation

Te Puni Kōkiri's  Auckland Futures Report (AFR) applied a similar research methodology to the Auckland region where 1 in 4 of all Māori in New Zealand live.

"Auckland is important because it has nearly one third of New Zealand's  total population and its share of New Zealand's GDP for the year ended March 2003 was 36 per cent," Mrs te Heuheu said.

"AFR reveals that Māori are positioning themselves to make their future as a major contributor to the Auckland economy.

"This is doubly pleasing as Māori are relatively more youthful than non-Māori. It is on this youthfulness that future growth is predicted," she said.

The AFR is an electronic toolkit, made up of a number of evidence based reports by Te Puni Kōkiri, Business Economic Research Ltd, the NZ Institute of Economic Research, the Auckland Regional Council, Statistics NZ and Treasury.  It is available at [www.tpk.govt.nz](http://www.tpk.govt.nz/)
