Associate Minister of Education Heather Roy today announced that applications are now open for the Government's Aspire Scholarships, which will enable students from low-income families to attend a private secondary school.

"Budget 2009 allocated $2.6 million to these scholarships.  ACT and National in Government are committed to widening the education choices available for students and their families - the Aspire Scholarships are an important step toward achieving that goal," Mrs Roy said.

"Parents are best placed to decide the education model that suits their children's needs but, for many, a private schooling is out of reach.  These scholarships will place choice in their hands and assist with the costs associated with attending a private school of their choice - providing up to $15,000 for school fees per year, and up to $1,500 annually for course-related costs.

"Aspire Scholarships are aimed at families earning an annual income of $65,000 or less, and who have a net worth of $150,000 or less.  To qualify, students applying for a scholarship will have to be a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident.

"Applications must be submitted to the Education Ministry by October 14 2009 and must include contact details for the applicant's current principal and a chosen referee - such as a family friend or church member.  Eligible applications will be entered into a randomly selected ballot, to be drawn after the closing dates, and successful applicants will be required to enrol in a school independently.  For students that miss out on the October 14 ballot, a second ballot will held at the end of October, which will also enable eligible families to make late enrolments.  
   
"In total, 150 scholarships will be awarded for the 2010 school year - 50 each in Years 9, 10 or 11.  The total number will increase to 200 in 2011 and 250 in 2012," Mrs Roy said.

If you are a successful applicant, it is up to you to find a suitable private school within eight weeks.

The scholarship will cover your private day school fees, up to the amount of $15,000 per year, for each year that you attend your chosen private school.

*What if my parents and I move out of the area and I have to leave the school?*  
If you leave the private school you originally enrol at with the Aspire Scholarship, there is no guarantee you will be able to re-enrol at a new private school using the same scholarship.  If you encounter this situation, you should contact the Aspire Scholarship administrator (aspire.scholarship@minedu.govt.nz or 04 463 8262) or your Ministry of Education local office, to discuss your options.
