Fourteen schools are set to receive major upgrades to their ICT infrastructure, in the first stage of the government's $34 million boost for broadband in schools.

The schools will receive internal network upgrades of around $5 million of the $34 million allocated, providing opportunities for teachers and students to make greater use of digital learning technologies and improving access to online learning tools.

Education Minister Anne Tolley and Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce say this investment is critical for New Zealand's future.

"Ultra-fast broadband has the potential to enhance the teaching and learning experience for students in every New Zealand school. It will allow schools to access a wider range of online resources and tools, and deliver programmes that are relevant and engaging for students," says Mrs Tolley.

The schools that will benefit from this investment are from rural and urban areas and include secondary and area schools with active ICT programmes.

They are:

Wanganui Girls' College  
Tararua College  
Wanganui City College  
Taradale High School  
Palmerston North Girls' High  
Wanganui High School  
Rangitoto College  
Maniototo Area School  
Oxford Area School  
The Catlins Area School  
Christchurch Boys' High  
Tangaroa College  
James Cook High School  
Edmund Hillary School

Further schools will be announced in the New Year.

Mr Joyce says broadband in schools is a key part of the government's commitment to roll out ultra-fast broadband to New Zealanders where they live, work and study.

"We believe ultra-fast broadband will deliver a social and economic step change in New Zealand - schools are one of our first priorities as the benefits of greater broadband capacity will be felt very quickly."
