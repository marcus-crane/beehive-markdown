Associate Minister of Defence Heather Roy has concluded her three-day visit to New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) troops on deployment as part of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI).

"This visit has provided me with a valuable insight into the way in which Solomon Islands Government is supported by RAMSI," Mrs Roy said.

"While in Honiara I saw first-hand some of the ways our troops support the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force and the Participating Police Force.  I have joined NZDF troops on a routine patrol, and met other RAMSI participants and staff at the New Zealand High Commission.

"It is also very encouraging to see the excellent progress being made in terms of New Zealand's partnership with Solomon Islands Government, especially in education and police housing - both of which are supported by NZAID funding.

"I have also had an opportunity to meet with two representatives of Solomon Islands Government: Minister of Foreign Affairs and External Trade Hon William Haomae, and Minister of Police and National Security Hon James Tora.

"These meetings have reinforced my view that our servicemen and women and police are professional, courteous and friendly, and respected by the local population.  They are fine ambassadors for New Zealand, working hard to support Solomon Islands Government as it progresses towards providing the country with political stability and security.

"Solomon Islands has a long history with New Zealand, and this is a relationship we value.  I am confident in New Zealand troops' ability to facilitate this, and look forward to welcoming them home at the end of the year," Mrs Roy said.
