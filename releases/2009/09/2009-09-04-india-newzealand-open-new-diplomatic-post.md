New Zealand will open a Consulate-General in Mumbai (formerly Bombay) later this year, Trade Minister Tim Groser announced today.

Mr Groser is currently in India, attending a World Trade Organisation meeting in New Delhi.

"India is a market that has the potential to be of huge long term importance for New Zealand - it is expected to be one of the world's three largest economies by 2050.

"Having an official presence in one of India's largest cities will be hugely beneficial to our ability to make the most of the significant trade and business opportunities for New Zealand," Mr Groser said.

The Consulate-General in Mumbai will be headed by a Consul-General, appointed by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise. This role will have primary responsibility for furthering trade and investment linkages between New Zealand, and the Mumbai area. Mumbai is India's major financial capital and the location of the "Bollywood" film industry.

"The new Consulate-General will also allow us to increase our visa processing capacity in India. In the long term, this has the potential to improve decision times for the important student and visitor markets." 

Last year there were more than 6000 Indian students studying in New Zealand and over 22,000 Indian tourists visiting here. Both sectors are showing positive growth, despite the downturn.

In February, New Zealand and India agreed in principle to begin negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement, subject to approval processes on both sides.

"We hope that formal negotiations can start before the end of the year," Mr Groser said.
