Guidelines and a new multi-media resource for the teaching and learning of Samoan were launched by the Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Georgina te Heuheu in Auckland today.

*Ta‘iala mo le Gagana Sāmoa*: *The* *Gagana Sāmoa Guidelines* provide a framework for an additional language in early childhood services, primary and secondary schools.

*Mua Ō! An Introduction to Gagana Sāmoa* is aimed at students in years 7-10 and it provides a range of entry-level resources for teachers and students new to languages.

Mrs te Heuheu said the promotion of language, culture and identity are central to the goals of the *Pasifika Education Plan.* Learning languages is one of the eight essential learning areas of *The New Zealand Curriculum*. Guidelines have been produced to support the teaching and learning of Tongan, Niue, Tokelau, Cook Islands Māori and now Samoan.

The guidelines and resources will be used by schools in New Zealand to design and shape a language programme to include gagana Samoa and acknowledge its value.

About 150 people attended the launch at Tangaroa College in Otara. About 50% of students at Tangaroa are Samoan.

More than 130,000 people in New Zealand identify as Samoan and Samoan is the third most spoken language in New Zealand.

The National Government recognises the value of language and culture to the cohesion and well being of Samoan communities, Mrs te Heuheu said.

"And in relation to Samoan young people, language and culture are essential to their educational achievement and identity."
