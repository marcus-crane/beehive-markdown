The future of Wakatipu's schools has been confirmed following consultation, Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced.

With more than 1,000 additional students expected in the Queenstown Lakes District by 2026, current schools will be unable to cope with population growth and a new school is required.

"The government has decided, in principle, to build a new primary school between Queenstown and Arrowtown, to open around 2021," said Mrs Tolley.

"We are making some immediate changes to Queenstown Primary School and Wakatipu High School to manage roll growth in the interim. These changes are also necessary to manage the impact of the new Remarkables Primary School, which is on track to open next year."

From 2010, Year 7 students will be able to enrol at Queenstown Primary School, with Year 8 students able to enrol from 2011. This will also result in all of the area's primary schools having similar year groupings. 

"To manage the expected population growth at Wakatipu High School, the Year 7 and 8 classes will be phased out over the next two years. From 2010, Wakatipu High School will provide Years 8-13 schooling and then Years 9-13 from 2011 onwards. This will free up space at the area's only secondary school.

"Wakatipu High may also move to a new site in the future. These changes will ensure there is sufficient space at the school for at least 10 more years, by which time all of the necessary planning will have been done to relocate the school onto its new site.

"I am grateful to the many organisations, school boards of trustees and individuals who took part in the consultation and contributed to the development of the strategy. I am encouraged by the high level of interest in the Wakatipu Basin education network. "
