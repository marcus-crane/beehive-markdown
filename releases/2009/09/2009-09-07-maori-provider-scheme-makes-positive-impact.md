A recent evaluation shows the $8.8 million fund to help Maori health groups strengthen themselves is working, Tariana Turia says.

The evaluation showed that the Maori Provider Development Scheme had been effective in building capacity and capability of Maori health providers.

"The Government has to be very diligent on what it spends money," Mrs Turia said.

"Building strong organisations is a key driver to building strong services for Maori that will ultimately result in better health outcomes.

"There's a phrase used by Maori which says ‘ka tika a muri, ka tika a mua.' In essence, it means that that ‘if all goes well out the back, then all will go well out front,' and it's very befitting of the aim of this scheme."

The report on the scheme, administered by the Ministry of Health, will be available online from Tuesday September 8 at [www.maorihealth.govt.nz](http://www.maorihealth.govt.nz/)
