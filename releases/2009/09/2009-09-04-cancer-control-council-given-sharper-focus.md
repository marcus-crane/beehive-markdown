Health Minister Tony Ryall has announced new members and new Terms of Reference for the Cancer Control Council.

"The changes are to give the Council a sharper focus on improving cancer services and patient outcomes in New Zealand," Mr Ryall said.

"One of the Government's six health targets is improved waiting times for cancer services. The Council's membership has a strong clinical leadership, and this will ensure expert advice to improve District Health Board performance."

The Cancer Control Council provides expert advice to the Minister of Health and reports on New Zealand's performance in providing cancer care, including initiatives to reduce mortality and the impact of cancer, improving  access to cancer services, and assessing the effectiveness of new initiatives.

Members of the Cancer Control Council will take up their positions immediately. The council members are:

- Dr Chris Atkinson, Chair, Medical Director Cancer Society and cancer specialist
- Ms Shelley Campbell, Former Chief Executive Waikato PHO
- Professor Brett Delahunt, HoD Wellington School of Medicine & Health Sciences - Dept of  Pathology and Molecular Medicine
- Professor Mike Findlay, Professor of Oncology and Director of Cancer Trials New Zealand
- Professor Frank Frizelle, HoD Academic Dept of Surgery and Professor University of Canterbury, Colorectal Surgeon Canterbury DHB
- Dr Kate Grundy, Palliative Medicine Physician and Clinical Director Christchurch Hospital

- Professor David Lamb, Consultant Radiation Oncologist
- Dr Scott McFarlane, Auckland DHB Starship Children's Hospital
- Mrs Catherine Smith, Clinical Nurse Specialist Canterbury DHB
- Dr John Waldon, Researcher Massey University School of Maori Studies

Mr Ryall says, "The membership reflects the Government's desire to include senior practitioners with leadership roles in core cancer disciplines on the Council, as well as non-government organisation representation."

"I would like to thank the previous Council members and former Chair Dame Catherine Tizard for their work on the Council to date. We appreciate their strong personal commitment to improving cancer services for New Zealanders."

"I am looking forward to the new Council working with health professionals and the sector to help improve the quality of cancer care in New Zealand."
