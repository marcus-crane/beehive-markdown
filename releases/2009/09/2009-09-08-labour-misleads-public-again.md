Communities concerned about the future of their local Police services should rest easy - Labour's just mangled the truth again, says Police Minister Judith Collins.

"I expect the departments I oversee to be fiscally responsible. How the Police makes savings is up to them.

"Let me make it clear: I have not told the Police to shave over $20 million off its budget. As the Police stated publicly today, savings being considered by Police are internal measures to ensure Police stay within their baseline.

"Once again, Labour's hysteria has resulted in their getting the wrong end of the stick and stirring it irresponsibly. They need to look to their own record.

"Under Labour, in 2001, 2006 and twice in 2007, the Police property portfolio was reviewed. And they did more than simply look at it - they sold off 37 properties during their watch. Many of those properties were houses in rural areas, like Inglewood, Gore and Hawera.

Ms Collins said she had opened five Police stations during her time as Police Minister, and would be opening the sixth this Friday in Christchurch South.

"This Government opens Police stations - it does not close them. This Government's top priority is to increase the number of Police officers directly delivering services to the public, and we are honouring that.

"Budget 2009 provided $182.5million of funding over four years to fund the Government's commitment to extra Police. This included $20 million of capital funding for accommodation and vehicles for extra Police with funding for 43 cars.

"The public can rest assured I won't be compromising their right to a well-governed, effectively-policed country."
