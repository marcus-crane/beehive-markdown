Following on from the success of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs-led Financial Summit in 2007, Minister of Consumer Affairs Heather Roy will this week host Financial Summit 2009 at the Otara Music and Arts Centre in Auckland.

"The events that have occurred over the past 12 months have been a salient reminder that the availability of credit - both for consumers and businesses - is fundamental to the sound operation of the national economy," Mrs Roy said.

"Financial Summit 2009 will bring together representatives of the financial sector, and of community and voluntary agencies that work with people with problem debt and associated difficulties.

"Today's release of the 'Review of the Operation of the Credit Contracts and Consumers Finance Act 2003' discussion document is timely for discussion at the Summit.  The document reviews consumer credit law and outlines proposals to amend the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act to improve its operation.  It also looks at other legislative initiatives that have been, or are being, introduced that are likely to affect the operation of the consumer credit market.

"Discussions at the Financial Summit will be around credit issues and, in particular, the review of consumer credit law," Mrs Roy said.
