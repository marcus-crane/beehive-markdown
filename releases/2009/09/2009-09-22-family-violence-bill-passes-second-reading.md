A bill aimed at further protecting victims of family violence passed its second reading in Parliament today.

Justice Minister Simon Power said the Domestic Violence (Enhancing Safety) Bill will amend the Domestic Violence Act 1995, the Sentencing Act 2002, and the Bail Act 2000 to strengthen the responsiveness of criminal justice agencies to victims of domestic violence. 

"I'm delighted the bill received broad support from submitters and the select committee, in particular proposals amending the Domestic Violence Act.

"The most significant change to that Act is the introduction of police safety orders.

"Police will be able to issue orders on the spot to ensure the immediate safety of victims by removing the alleged violent person from the home for a period of up to five days. 

"This will provide a period of safety in which victims can consider their options.

"I was particularly pleased the committee endorsed the Government's policy that an order could be issued for up to five days, which will be critical if issued over long weekends or in other situations where access to the courts may be limited."

The bill also:

- Enables police to arrest without warrant anyone leaving the scene while a safety order is being prepared.
- Enables the court to issue an arrest warrant when the person subject to an order does not comply with the order or does not attend court, and enables police to enter any premises by force under the warrant.
- Removes from the Domestic Violence Act the two-tiered penalty structure for breaches of protection orders, leaving only the maximum penalty of up to two years' imprisonment.
- Provides a penalty of up to six months' imprisonment for failing to attend a court-ordered programme.
- Requires the person subject to the order to surrender their firearms licence.

"Another important feature is a proposal to amend the Sentencing Act 2002 to enable criminal courts to issue a protection order on behalf of the victim in cases where an offender is sentenced for a domestic violence offence, even if the victim has also applied to the Family Court.

"Submissions were very supportive of this proposal.

"This bill will give police and the criminal courts enhanced tools to give victims of domestic violence immediate protection and to help keep them safe from further violence.

"It, along with the Child and Family Protection Bill that I recently introduced and which focuses on keeping children safe where there have been instances of family violence in the home, is part of the Government's on-going commitment to dealing with family violence".
