Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced initial funding for the new tertiary high school at Manukau Institute of Technology (MIT), the first programme of its kind in New Zealand.

"Funding of just over $1 million has been confirmed for this exciting initiative, which will cover the school's operating costs in 2010," said Mrs Tolley.

"Too many young people are leaving school early without good qualifications. The tertiary high school provides a positive alternative for young people who are motivated to succeed, but for whom school isn't necessarily the best fit.

"It's planned that students will be dual enrolled at their school and at MIT, meaning they'll maintain strong links to their school and to school activities while studying towards a work-related qualification.

"Along with other Government initiatives such as Trades Academies and the Youth Guarantee, the tertiary high school aims to lift achievement and support young people to get worthwhile qualifications."

Eighty Year 11 students will enter the tertiary high school in February next year. The four-year programme will enable students to achieve NCEA and also get credits toward a tertiary-level qualification offered by MIT.

A further eighty Year 11 students will be enrolled each year for the following three years. By 2013, it's expected the school will have reached its full roll of 320.
