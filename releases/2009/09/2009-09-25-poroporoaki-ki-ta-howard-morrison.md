Sir Howard Morrison's beautiful voice, his dazzling showmanship and his uniquely Maori sense of humour have made a huge contribution to our national identity, and he will be sadly missed, said Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples.

"Sir Howard's death is a time for Aotearoa to pause and reflect on the huge changes in our society and culture, and the role played by Sir Howard, his family, and his colleagues," said Dr Sharples.

"Sir Howard raised our spirits and made us proud. He personified the many Maori showbands who gave New Zealand a good name all over the world.

"His music and humour united the nation, which was undergoing huge changes with a mass migration of Maori to the cities. He reminded us all what it meant to be a New Zealander, the equal of anyone in the world," he said.

"Behind the scenes, Sir Howard was a strong advocate for Maori development. He used his public profile to promote the Tu Tangata philosophy, of Maori standing tall on their own two feet. He supported youth programmes in particular, and rode his great white steed from one end of the country to the other to raise money for drug and alcohol education.

"He also drew on his personal contacts to establish private education trusts offering scholarships to support young leaders into tertiary education.

"He was a diplomat, but he was also a straight talker, and in his later years he made strong stands on issues affecting his people of Te Arawa," said Dr Sharples.

"Knowing how many people Sir Howard touched, who will want to pay their respects, this tangihanga is of national significance, so I requested the Army's help with practical arrangements like catering.

"No reira Ta Howard, e hoki ki to ukaipo. E te whanau pani, ka nui te tangi ki to koutou rangatira e tiraha mai ra.
