The role of the Maori Land Courts in maintaining whakapapa and relationships was emphasised today by the Minister of Maori Affairs, at the swearing-in of the new Chief Judge of the Maori Land Court.

The ceremony was held at Pakirikiri Marae, Tokomaru Bay, where Chief Judge Wilson Whare Isaac comes from.

Speaking on the marae, Dr Sharples noted how the marae and its leaders had interwoven networks with other iwi across Aotearoa and the Pacific Ocean.

"We cannot gather here, without cherishing the legacy of the late Te Kumeroa Ngoingoi Pewhairangi and her incredible contribution to our world," he said. 

"We think about the history of Te Hokowhitu-a-Tu concert party; the influence of Tuini Ngawai; the establishment of the Tu Tangata programme to connect young Maori to their iwi; the emergence of the first kohanga reo; the development of Te Ataarangi.

"And so today, as we pay tribute to Chief Judge Isaac, we pay tribute also to the whanau Isaac from Ruakituri and Waikaremoana; the whanau Riddell from Te Puia Springs and Scotland; and to the peoples of Ngati Porou, Tuhoe and Ngati Kahungunu.

"I have taken the time to make our connections explicit, because this is, in fact, the very essence of the role of the Judge of the Maori Land Court," he said.

Dr Sharples said Chief Judge Isaac had proven his ability when he presided over three major Waitangi Tribunal claims.

"In each of these situations, Chief Judge Isaac gained the respect and trust of each iwi respectively - acquiring a reputation for fairness and compassion that we know will be exercised to a great extent in the Maori Land Court," said Dr Sharples.

He said Chief Judge Isaac's leadership of the Maori Land Court is not just a matter of knowledge, skills and managing a heavy workload.

"The leadership is also about the way in which Chief Judge Isaac has been able to negotiate differences, and ... bring together different strands to achieve a workable solution - indeed a work of art," he said.

"And I have no doubt also that Chief Judge Isaac's experience in family law, and his decade of his experience as Counsel for the Child, have provided a solid basis for the future he will have in the skills and strategies required for the complex role of reconciliation.

Dr Sharples said the Maori Land Court would play an increasingly important role in connecting Maori owners with the land and people who were often far away from where they lived.

"The Māori Land Court plays a central role in enabling Māori to realise and strengthen their identity. We can be truly proud of this Court and its incredible database - the largest indigenous land titles record system in the world.

"I have every confidence that Chief Judge Isaac will meet every challenge with distinction, with compassion and with the wisdom borne of experience. May you go well, and I know you will do all of your tipuna proud," said Dr Sharples.
