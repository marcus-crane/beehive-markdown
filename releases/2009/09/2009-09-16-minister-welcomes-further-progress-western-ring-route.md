Transport Minister Steven Joyce has today welcomed further progress towards the completion of Auckland's Western Ring Route - which was earlier this year identified as a Road of National Significance.

The NZ Transport Agency has today confirmed plans to widen Auckland's Northwestern Motorway.

This work complements the building of the Waterview Connection and, when it's finished, will complete a major section of the Western Ring Route, and upgrade West Auckland's access to the central city.

Mr Joyce says the completion of the route is essential to the continued growth and economic development in the Auckland region.

"These are projects that have been talked about for decades.  It's good to finally be in a position to provide certainty for communities along the route and get construction underway.

"The projects planned will alleviate a number of choke points on the Northwestern Motorway and when complete, the Western Ring route will contribute to better links for business and freight between key industrial hubs in the cities of Manukau, Auckland, Waitakere and North Shore."
