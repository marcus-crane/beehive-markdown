The Department of Corrections' Value for Money Review has delivered positive initiatives to position the organisation as a world leader in public safety, Corrections Minister Judith Collins announced today.

"When I became Minister I made it clear Corrections had to lift its game and I'm confident the initiatives outlined in this review will help the department do just that," says Ms Collins.

Outcomes from the review will start rolling out in December for a three-year period.

Among the changes is an overhaul of the way prisoners are re-integrated back into society. Rehabilitation and Reintegration Services will be established, changing the way prisoners' path back to society is managed. The new service will incorporate a new model of care aimed at cracking down on re-offending, with added emphasis on improving services for Maori.

"Clearly, the establishment of this new group will enable staff to focus more clearly on deterring would-be recidivist offenders. We all need to do more to break the cycle of re-offending, which is feeding the increasing demand for Corrections' services", say Ms Collins.

Rehabilitation and Reintegration Services will comprise a wide spectrum of offender-focused initiatives, including psychological services; specialist treatment programmes; and employment and education activities.

"I want to see a reduction in the demand for the department's services," says Ms Collins.

"This is the Department of Corrections and I expect it to do exactly that - change the behaviour of those people who have broken the rules governing our society."

Other changes within the department include the management of sentences; operational policies and procedures; and the streamlining of support functions.

"These changes will place the department in a position to best meet the Government's expectations in improving public safety," says Ms Collins.
