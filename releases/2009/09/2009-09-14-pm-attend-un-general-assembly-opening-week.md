Prime Minister John Key leaves next Monday for New York to join other world leaders attending the United Nations General Assembly opening.

Mr Key will deliver an address to the General Assembly on 26 September (*NZ time*).

He will also attend the opening of the UN Secretary General’s Climate Change Summit and the UN General Assembly Debate, as well as hold bilateral meetings with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and other world leaders.

Mr Key will also meet UN Development Programme Administrator and former Prime Minister Helen Clark.  Other events will include attendance at the Clinton Global Initiative with leaders, business people and civil society groups to discuss global challenges such as health, poverty and climate change.

He will also visit the New York Stock Exchange and speak to the Kiwi Expatriates Association (KEA).

“This is an important visit,” says Mr Key. “New Zealand shares the desire of other countries, such as the United States, to see a strong and effective United Nations.

“Speaking at the General Assembly is an opportunity to formally confirm New Zealand’s commitment to the UN and its ideals.”

“New Zealand has long been a strong advocate of the multilateral approach to world affairs. 

“The opening week of the UNGA provides a significant opportunity to connect with world leaders, discuss issues of importance to New Zealand, and promote this country’s interests.”

Mr Key will be accompanied on the visit by Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully and Trade & Associate Climate Change Issues Minister Tim Groser.
