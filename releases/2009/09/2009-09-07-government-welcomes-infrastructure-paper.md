Infrastructure Minister Bill English today welcomed the National Infrastructure Unit's release of a discussion paper on the state of New Zealand's infrastructure.

The paper, which includes a stock take of key infrastructure issues and challenges, will be used for targeted consultation. Feedback will be incorporated into the first National Infrastructure Plan, early next year.

"This Government is serious about getting New Zealand's infrastructure right – that means improving the quality of our roads, ensuring our electricity grid is up to scratch and upping our broadband speeds," Mr English says.

"To achieve this we are investing almost twice as much over the next few years than was planned by the previous Government. This amounts to $7.5 billion over the next five years, which will support thousands of jobs.

"We are also focused on better planning and executing of projects. The National Infrastructure Plan is part of that and this discussion paper is an important first step."

The paper covers the state of network infrastructure like roads, electricity and telecommunications, as well as social infrastructure like hospitals, schools and prisons.

"This document represents a starting point. It outlines what we know and describes the principles and likely direction of future investment.

"However, the National Infrastructure Plan will need input from more than just the government sector and we want groups with deep sector knowledge to contribute,” Mr English says.

"By early next year, we want a plan that identifies emerging bottlenecks and investment gaps and allows planners to set clearer priorities. That will help improve services to the public and give the industry greater certainty."
