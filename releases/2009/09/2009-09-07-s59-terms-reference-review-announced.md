Prime Minister John Key today released Terms of Reference for a review of policies and procedures used by the New Zealand Police and Child, Youth and Family around the issue of smacking.

The review stems from Cabinet decisions a fortnight ago introducing safeguards to give parents comfort they will not be criminalised for lightly smacking their children.

"This review will look at the policies and procedures of the Police and CYF, including the referral process between the two agencies, to identify any changes needed to ensure good parents are treated as Parliament intended," Mr Key says.

"The Government does not want to see good parents criminalised for a light smack and the recent referendum reinforces that New Zealanders don't either.

"I believe the law is working as intended but I can assure parents the National-led Government will continue to monitor the way the law is being implemented."

The review will be conducted by the Chief Executive of the Ministry of Social Development, Peter Hughes, the Commissioner of Police Howard Broad, and well known clinical psychologist Nigel Latta.

Mr Latta has significant experience working with young people and their families and Mr Key says his independent perspective will be useful.

"I am pleased that Nigel has agreed to take part in the review and I'm sure he will bring a direct and honest approach to the table," Mr Key says.

"The reviewers will be able to make recommendations and consider any other matters they think will help to ensure that parents are treated as Parliament intended."

The review team will report to the Prime Minister, Minister of Police and Minister of Social Development by December 1.
