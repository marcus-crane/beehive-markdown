Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce today announced the process he will be following in making his decision on the Commerce Commission's recommendations on mobile termination access services, which he expects to receive in the Commission's Final Report in or around December.

Under the Telecommunications Act, the Minister may accept, reject, or require the Commerce Commission to reconsider the recommendations.

Before making his decision on the Commission's recommendations, the Minister will release the Final Report and invite written submissions that:

- make submissions in relation to the MTAS Report; and
- update comments already made in submissions to the Commission prior to the completion of the MTAS Report.

Mr Joyce added that he does not want to receive commercial offers that could be implemented in lieu of regulation. 

"Parties have ample opportunity to provide undertakings to the Commission during the Commission's investigation under the process set out in the Telecommunications Act."
