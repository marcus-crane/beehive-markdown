Nearly $9 million dollars has been given to critical social services groups under severe financial pressure, says the Minister for Social Development and Employment Paula Bennett.

164 critical social services groups have been granted funding after the first round of the Community Response Fund.

The new Fund was set up in May to assist those groups providing vital social services during the recession, which are under severe financial strain or experiencing increased demand. Up to $104 million is being made available over two years.

Paula Bennett says the main reason cited by groups applying to the Fund was a reduction in their income from investments or philanthropic organisations.

“We know many Kiwi families are under stress, and the financial pressure on those critical organisations, is really starting to bite. This first funding round will start to ease that pressure.

The average amount granted in this funding round was $40, 995. Four national organisations successfully applied, including Women’s Refuge which received nearly one million dollars.

Paula Bennett says organisations which missed out in this round are being encouraged to apply again.

“This has always been a highly targeted fund, and we make no apologies for that. We will however, be holding regional briefings to help organisations better understand the criteria they need to meet. Providers will also be able to apply online.

“We want to make sure those groups delivering vital services to our most at risk families are getting the support they need and deserve.

“It’s anticipated there’ll be more applications in round two and three this financial year, as the effects of the recession are felt by more families,” Paula Bennett says.

Applications for the second round of the Community Response Fund will close on the 25th of September 2009.   More information is available at
