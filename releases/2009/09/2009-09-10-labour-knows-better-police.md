The constant stream of misinformation flowing from Labour regarding the conduct of the Police undermines the good work done by New Zealand's law enforcement, Police Minister Judith Collins said today.

"Over the past week Labour has poured invective on Police, has criticised their work and even had the gall to claim to know more about Police operational matters than the Police themselves. This level of interference undermines the professionalism of the Police and puts Labour off-side with law-abiding New Zealanders."

Ms Collins said Labour had gone so far as to presume to know better than the Police Commissioner, Howard Broad; Assistant Commissioner (Operations) Viv Rickard; and Police General Manager of Finance, Bruce Simpson on operational matters

"Police have said repeatedly that they are making better use of their cars, that their stations and houses are not for sale, that their firearms training review is not a cost-cutting measure and that they have emphatically not been ordered to cut over $20 million from their budget.

"Despite this, Labour has continued to attempt to shout-down the Police's highest-ranking officers and management, claiming these leaders do not, in fact, know the ins and outs of their own operations.

"Labour obviously has no plans work constructively with Police at any time in the future."

Ms Collins said the ill-informed comments made by Labour had caused unnecessary upset and worry among communities throughout New Zealand.

"I can assure the public - the Police will not be closing down their stations. When it comes to cars, the Police are using the fleet more effectively.

"The Police's firearm review was initiated in May 2007, on Labour's watch. Any claims that this review is a cost-cutting measure is absolute nonsense. Finally, the Police have said themselves that they are, like any prudent organisation, reviewing their finances and identifying savings on their own accord.

"Any claims to the contrary are simply poorly-formed hysterics."
