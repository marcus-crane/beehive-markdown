Wellington Coroner Garry Evans has been appointed acting Chief Coroner, Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson announced today.

Mr Evans, who has been a relief coroner since 2007, was appointed Coroner effective from Monday 14 September, Mr Finlayson added. Mr Evans is also acting Chief Coroner from 15 September 2009 to 16 November 2009, while Chief Coroner Judge Neil MacLean is overseas.

"Mr Evans is held in high public regard for his dedicated service as a Coroner.  I am delighted that a man of his skills and experience has agreed to take the reins during Judge MacLean's absence," Mr Finlayson said.

Mr Evans was appointed as the Wellington District Coroner in 1997 and served until 2006 when the Coroners Act 2006 restructured the coronial regime.  He was subsequently appointed as a relief coroner in 2007.

At the same time Mr Evans retired as a senior partner in a private legal practice, where he worked in a range of areas but had special interest in coronial jurisprudence and the professional development of coroners.  Mr Evans has a particular interest in the medical aspects of coronial inquiries, sudden infant deaths and mental health inquests.
