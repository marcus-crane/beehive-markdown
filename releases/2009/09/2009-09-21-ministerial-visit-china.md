The Minister of Defence and of Research, Science and Technology, Dr Wayne Mapp, leaves for Beijing tonight for a formal visit to China on defence and science issues.

"China's influence in Asia, particularly in the Pacific region, is of growing importance," Dr Mapp said. "China is central to our economic future. It also has an essential role in the stability and security of the Asia-Pacific region."

While in Beijing, Dr Mapp will have talks with the Chinese Minister of Defence, General Liang Guanglie, and the Vice-Minister of Science and Technology, Dr Cao Jianlin.

Dr Mapp said the Research, Science and Technology relationship with China, now the world's second-largest investor in research and development, is one of New Zealand's most important and enduring relationships in Asia.

"The opportunities for working with China will continue to grow as they take a position of global leadership in targeted areas of science and technology."

The Minister returns to New Zealand on Friday.
