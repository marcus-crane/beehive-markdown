Claims by Auckland Regional Council chairman Mike Lee that Auckland's water supply and parks are under threat by the proposed boundaries for the new Auckland Council are completely wrong, Local Government Minister Rodney Hide said today.

"There is no truth whatsoever in Mr Lee's assertion that Auckland is going to lose critical water supplies and three major regional parks," Mr Hide said.  "He has seen the proposals and I have discussed them with him, so I have no idea why he continues to make these claims.

"The Government's legislation for the future governance of Auckland will not change the ownership of Auckland's major dams or parks and it will not in any way prevent Aucklanders from access to them.  The public can be absolutely assured that they will continue to enjoy the same access they have now."
