Labour's recall of recent events seems to have been muddled during its time in opposition, judging from the confused response around the Police's firearms review, Police Minister Judith Collins said today.

"The Police's firearms review was initiated over 12 months ago - under the previous Labour government. They should be able to remember why the review was started - although the fact the review began on their watch seems to have escaped them.

"Police have advised me the review is about looking at the best ways to train New Zealand's Police officers. It is not a cost-cutting exercise.

"Clearly Labour has no understanding of Police's role as the expert when it comes to organising and training their own officers. It's just another example of a dishonest and incompetent disregard for the truth.

"They also seem to completely miss the point: the Police are aiming to increase firearms training for 40 per cent of officers. That 40 percent will comprise all rural officers, half of all provincial officers and 30 per cent of all metropolitan officers.

"It stands to reason a rural officer would have more need for arms than a police prosecutor, who spends most of their time in their office or the court room. 

"Labour's hysterical reaction to a review, started under their Government, ignores the fact that New Zealand Police officers are not routinely armed. Is Labour now stating that they will arm all officers?

"Police make their own decisions on their operations. National Ministers of Police don't tell Police how to run their operations. What I do ask of them is to ensure the safety and stability of New Zealanders while constantly looking to improve service delivery with valuable taxpayer funding. 

"Labour's call for me to tell the Police how to conduct firearms training indicates just how comfortable they were with trying to politicise New Zealand Police."
