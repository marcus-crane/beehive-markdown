The first piece of legislation aimed at changing the way New Zealand operates its borders passed its first reading in Parliament last night with unanimous support.

The Biosecurity Amendment Bill was introduced as part of the Government's moves to streamline trans-Tasman travel, while improving biosecurity protection.

The bill raises the instant biosecurity fine from $200 to $400. It also increases the maximum penalty for conviction in Court for the same offence from $400 to $800.

"This bill marks an important step in improving biosecurity processing for international travellers into New Zealand," Biosecurity Minister David Carter said in introducing the bill.

"It is pleasing to have legislation before Parliament that has support right across the political spectrum," said Mr Carter.

The bill was referred to the Primary Production Select Committee for report back by 12 October.

"This will enable the legislation to be passed in time for changes to biosecurity screening to be in place at our airports by March next year," Mr Carter said.
