Tariana Turia today farewelled Tuhoe elder and a leader of Maori rongoa Tikirau Stevens who passed away today.

"Tikirau retained the knowledge of his ancestors - he was an authority on Māori traditional health and healing and extremely passionate about the protection and promotion of it," Mrs Turia said.

"Rongoa Maori is moving forward today, and Tikirau was very instrumental in helping to achieve this."

Tikirau was a member of Nga Ringa Whakahaere Trust (National Board for Traditional Māori Health & Healing). He also served in the army for 20 years and he was also a Crown adviser (including on land claims) for nine years.

"Tikirau was a very keen supporter of the Treaty as being the key driver behind rongoa Maori and Maori health development. He will be deeply missed by all of us."

Tikirau's body is expected to lay at Waimako Marae in Waikaremoana.
