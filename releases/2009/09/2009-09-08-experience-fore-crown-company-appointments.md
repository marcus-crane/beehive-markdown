New appointees to the boards of five Crown companies announced today bring a wealth of experience to their roles, Minister of Research, Science and Technology Dr Wayne Mapp said.

Nine new appointments have been announced, including the promotion of two current directors to deputy chair positions. The appointments include new chairs for Crown Research Institute Industrial Research Ltd (IRL) and the Research and Education Advanced Network New Zealand Ltd (REANNZ).

The new chair of IRL is Keith McConnell, an Auckland-based professional company director. Mr McConnell has a strong and diverse commercial background. He has served as chief executive officer of a number of businesses, most recently Fruehauf Pacific Ltd. He also has significant governance experience in the wind energy sector, and is currently chair of Wind Gears Ltd and a director of Wind Blades Ltd and Windflow Technology.

“His experience covers a range of sectors relevant to IRL,” said Dr Mapp.

At REANNZ, the company that owns and operates the high-speed KAREN network, Professor John Raine, regional chief executive at Massey University’s Albany Campus, joins the board as chair.

“Professor Raine has vast experience in engineering, a close understanding of the operations of the main users of KAREN, and a strong commercial background. This will ensure the continued success of REANNZ.

“I would like to acknowledge the contribution of the former chairs, Dr Brian Rhoades (IRL), and Dr Jim Watson (REANNZ), and thank the new chairs and directors for agreeing to serve on these boards,” Dr Mapp said.
