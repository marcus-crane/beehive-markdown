Career diplomat Darryl Dunn will be New Zealand's new Ambassador to Argentina, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"New Zealand and Argentina have shared interests and common values across a number of issues, including agricultural liberalisation, fisheries management, climate change, and whaling," Mr McCully said.

"There is now substantial New Zealand investment in Argentina, particularly in food and beverage, agritechnology, and biotechnology.

"Cooperation between our countries has a number of valuable strands, including a Working Holiday Scheme, agricultural research cooperation, and governance exchanges. 

"Since New Zealand opened its Embassy in Buenos Aires in 1998, the relationship between our countries has grown in strength, and there is good scope for greater engagement with Argentina and our other partners in Latin America," Mr McCully said.

Mr Dunn has previously been New Zealand's Consul General in Los Angeles, and High Commissioner to the Cook Islands. He has also had postings to Baghdad and Paris.

Mr Dunn will also be cross-accredited as Ambassador to Uruguay and Paraguay. He takes up his appointment next year, replacing Lucy Duncan, who returns to Wellington.
