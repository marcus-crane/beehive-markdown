Agriculture Minister David Carter has today announced a review of the National Pest Management Strategy for bovine tuberculosis.

"The Tb Strategy is a significant pest management programme with an annual budget of $82 million per year. The programme is crucial for our beef, dairy and deer industries and their ability to compete in global markets", says Mr Carter.

"The review, which will focus on a proposal prepared by the Animal Health Board in consultation with those who fund the Strategy, will set the direction of the Tb Strategy for the next 15 years."

Mr Carter says the proposal suggests some significant changes to the Strategy for the period out to 2025, including new targets to reduce the size of the areas where Tb is found in wild animal populations, and assessing the feasibility of completely eradicating the disease from wild animals.

"I look forward to receiving feedback on the proposed changes and I will be making a final decision on any changes at the end of the review process."

**Note:**  
Copies of the proposal are available from the Animal Health Board and submissions close on 30 November 2009.

The Tb Strategy is set up under the Biosecurity Act 1993, and is the legal basis for controlling the disease in cattle and deer herds, and also in populations of wild animals that can spread the disease, such as possums. The Tb Strategy is implemented by the Animal Health Board.

The Biosecurity Act requires pest management strategies to be reviewed every five years.
