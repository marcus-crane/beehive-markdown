A range of measures to boost biosecurity readiness and strengthen partnerships with industry has been announced by Biosecurity Minister David Carter today.

"This package delivers on the Government's election commitment to provide a more efficient post-border biosecurity system and significantly lift New Zealand's ability to deal with introduced pests and diseases.

"At the same time, the introduction of some cost-sharing arrangements will enable primary industries to have a better say in biosecurity readiness and response activities," says Mr Carter.

The package of measures includes:

• Agreement in-principle to continue Crown funding of $30 million a year for managing bovine tuberculosis, to 2015;

• A move towards implementing joint decision-making and cost-sharing agreements with primary industries for biosecurity preparedness and response activities;

• A $25 million, 10-year deal between MAF Biosecurity New Zealand and AsureQuality to build and deliver biosecurity response field operations;

• The go-ahead for a biosecurity surveillance strategy that will encourage collaboration with industry which will result in swifter response capabilities.

"Keeping funding for bovine Tb at existing levels, despite the challenging economic conditions, is crucial for our beef, dairy and deer industries and their ability to compete in global markets," says Mr Carter.

"However, the future success of the Tb Pest Management Strategy will depend on industry and local government showing a commitment to ongoing funding now that the Government has signalled its contribution."

Mr Carter says a move towards a cost-sharing agreement with primary industries will increase incentives to invest in biosecurity readiness, resulting in faster and less costly responses.

"This agreement will guarantee industry an equal say in future priorities and give certainty around when and how emergency actions are taken.

"We will always respond to pests and diseases with major economic impacts, such as Foot and Mouth Disease. The new agreement will encourage primary industries to consider other priorities they have for improved readiness and response."

Mr Carter says that in order for the primary industries to fully recognise the implications and benefits of the initiative, the introduction of cost-sharing will be phased in gradually, with it only applying to readiness measures over the first three years of the agreement.
