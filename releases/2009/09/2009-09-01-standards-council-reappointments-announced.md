Richard Westlake and Dr Sharon Kletchko have been reappointed to the Standards Council, Commerce Minister Simon Power announced today.

"I am pleased to reappoint Richard Westlake as the Chair and Dr Sharon Kletchko as the new deputy Chair of the Standards Council," Mr Power said.

"Mr Westlake has served as the council chair since 2003 and Dr Kletchko has been a member since 2006. Their reappointments will ensure continuity in leadership of the council as it transitions to a new and smaller board when the proposed Standards and Accreditation Bill comes into force next year.

"The bill will simplify the governance structure of the Standards Council to ensure it is well-placed to meet current and future challenges."
