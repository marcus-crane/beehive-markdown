The education sector is being consulted on the requirement that an international student aged 13 and under must live with their parent or legal guardian while studying in New Zealand, says Education Minister Anne Tolley. 

The consultation is looking at options for making this requirement more flexible, or whether the policy should remain the same. Greater flexibility could potentially allow more international students to be enrolled in New Zealand primary schools.

"This process is being carried out following calls from the sector, and no decisions have yet been made," says Mrs Tolley.

"If this requirement is made more flexible, I would want clear and specific advice from the sector on how they would ensure the safety of any young international students being educated in New Zealand without their parents."

Consultation, which ends on 28 September, is being run through education sector representative bodies.
