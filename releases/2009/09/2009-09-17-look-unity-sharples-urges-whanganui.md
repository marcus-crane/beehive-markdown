The Minister of Maori Affairs, Dr Pita Sharples, has welcomed the NZ Geographic Board's recommendation that the ‘h' be restored to the name of Whanganui city.

"I can understand the feelings of generations of citizens who have adopted the name Wanganui and identify with it," said Dr Sharples. "I would like to invite people of good will to look again, to see the actions of tangata whenua as a gift, not an imposition. This is an offer to share their heritage, culture and history with all the people of the city.

"Correcting the name, and the implicit recognition of that gift, could be a powerful unifying force in the life and future of the city," he said.

"Look at the Maori language itself. Only a generation ago, Maori Language Week was widely criticised as highly divisive, a backward move for the country, forcing the language down the throats of unwilling New Zealanders. In thirty years, te reo Maori has become a vital part of our nation's culture, a source of pride for Maori, a badge of honour for Kiwis overseas, and a symbol of our collective identity.

"The name Whanganui has a whakapapa, a history. It carries meaning and significance. The name must be spelt properly, otherwise it loses integrity," said Dr Sharples.

"Is it really appropriate to identify a major city by a name that has been misappropriated from tangata whenua, that tries to deny its whakapapa, that is a parallel import, a cultural fake?  

"I call upon the citizens of Whanganui to take a golden opportunity, to show pride in Maori history and embrace Maori language, treasures which make us unique on the global scene," said Dr Sharples.
