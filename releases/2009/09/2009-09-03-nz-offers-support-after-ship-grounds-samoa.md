A team of New Zealand marine pollution experts has been sent to Samoa following the grounding of a container ship at the entrance to Apia harbour, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.

"Five experts from Maritime New Zealand along with specialised equipment to help contain any oil spill that may result from the grounding were flown to Samoa today on an Air Force Hercules," Mr McCully said.

"The Maritime New Zealand personnel consist of three pollution response advisors, a nautical expert, and an environmental specialist, while the equipment includes floating booms, pumps, liquid waste holding tanks, and absorbent booms and pads.

"Our response follows a request from the Samoan Government to support it and the Samoan Ministry of Works, Transport and Infrastructure, which is leading the recovery efforts.

"The New Zealand deployment is a prudent response to assist against the possibility of an oil spill," Mr McCully said.

The Forum Samoa II, a 126 metre container ship, which has intermediate fuel oil on board, was holed after it ran aground on a coral reef at Apia Harbour.
