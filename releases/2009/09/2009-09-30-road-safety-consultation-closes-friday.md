Transport Minister Steven Joyce is urging road users to have their say on what actions should be taken to make New Zealand's roads safer.

The government is currently consulting with road users as part of the development of a 10-year road safety strategy.  Consultation closes on Friday.

So far more than 500 submissions on the Safer Journeys discussion document have been received. A further 974 people have ranked the actions they think would best improve safety.

Mr Joyce says it's important that everyone with an interest has their say.

"Recent statistics show that our number of road deaths per head of population is significantly higher than in many OECD countries.  New Zealanders deserve better and this strategy will be central to our efforts to help improve our road safety.

"The discussion document outlines more than 60 possible actions.  We will not be introducing anywhere near that many changes but we want to hear New Zealanders' views about the initiatives they think are the most likely to make an impact and the most necessary to adopt," says Mr Joyce.

Following the close of submissions, Ministry of Transport officials will summarise feedback for use in the development of a final strategy to be released in December. Initial actions will be implemented over the next year or so.

A full copy of the discussion document, as well as a summary guide and submission form are available on [www.saferjourneys.govt.nz](http://www.saferjourneys.govt.nz/).
