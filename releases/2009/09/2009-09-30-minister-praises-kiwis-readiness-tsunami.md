Civil Defence Minister John Carter has congratulated regional civil defence operations and coastal communities for their organisation and response to the tsunami warning issued for New Zealand this morning.

An earthquake measuring 8.3 on the Richter scale caused widespread damage in Samoa this morning, and triggered a tsunami which reports suggest has wiped out buildings and claimed lives.

Warnings of a tsunami of up to 1 metre in height were subsequently issued for the East Coast of New Zealand, with suggestions that other coastal areas would be affected as the wave moved down the country.

"While the initial tsunami hasn't caused damage in New Zealand, our preparedness for such events is vital. Civil Defence remains on alert following reports of second wave near Raoul Island, and for any waves caused by aftershocks.

"But I can't emphasise enough the need to act on Civil Defence warnings. Areas throughout the country swung into action quickly today - and I congratulate local civil defence controllers for their considered and prompt responses.

"Reports suggest the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Samoa is significant. I know this must be a particularly worrying time for all those with family and friends there."

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade is co-ordinating New Zealand's response to the situation in Samoa, and has issued emergency telephone numbers for those who require more information about family and/or friends in Samoa.  It is expected further information will be released by MFAT later today.

Mr Carter says as soon as the Wellington-based Civil Defence National Crisis Management Team received alerts, regional Civil Defence, Police, emergency services and other core groups were warned about the possibility of a tsunami.

"Each region acted immediately to put into place the plan for their area, depending on the anticipated severity of the tsunami. In Gisborne, for example, Civil Defence volunteers drove to low-lying beach areas to alert residents.

"It's that kind of attention to detail which helps New Zealand's emergency planning save lives, property and communities."

Mr Carter said it was important New Zealanders paid attention to official reports in such situations.

"In order to avoid panic and unnecessary worry, New Zealanders should heed only those reports from Civil Defence national headquarters and their local council's Civil Defence team."

Residents in coastal areas are still being urged to be mindful of sudden tidal surges and currents in the wake of the tsunami.
