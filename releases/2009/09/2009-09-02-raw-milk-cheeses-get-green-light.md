Cheesemakers will be allowed to craft a range of raw or unpasteurised milk products for sale in domestic and international markets under new standards to be introduced in October, says Minister for Food Safety Kate Wilkinson.

Previously, only a small range of raw milk cheeses have been allowed to be imported into New Zealand, but could not be made here.

"This is about levelling the playing field and recognising we have some incredibly passionate cheesemakers in New Zealand who could produce raw milk cheeses to rival the best in Europe," Ms Wilkinson says.

"The changes mean a greater variety of cheeses will be available for food lovers here, while also opening up business opportunities for the dairy industry. 

"It makes sense that our own industry should be able to make the products that we allow to be imported.

"All raw milk products, made here or brought in, will need to meet the required food safety standards before they can be sold to the public."

The level of bacteria in cheeses made from raw milk means they are not suitable for at-risk people such as pregnant women, young children and the elderly.
