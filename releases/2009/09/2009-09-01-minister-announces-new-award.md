Associate Minister of Defence Heather Roy last night announced that the New Zealand Defence Force is working toward the establishment of a new 'Reservist of the Year' award.

"This initiative is similar to awards and recognitions bestowed on personnel by our allied countries already," Mrs Roy said.

"The detail for the 'Reservist of the Year' award is currently being worked up by Chief of Defence Force Lieutenant General Jerry Mateparae and Brigadier Sean Trengrove, with the intent being that the first award will be presented near the end of this year.

"More detail will be released in the near future," Mrs Roy said.
