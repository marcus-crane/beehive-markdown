Local Government Minister Rodney Hide and Associate Minister John Carter are welcoming and endorsing the report of the Auckland Governance Legislation Committee. John Carter is also the former chair of the Select Committee.

The Bill as reported from the Select Committee gives local boards decision-making powers, with the Auckland mayor and councillors concentrating on regional matters.

The 20 to 30 local boards will have control of funding for community initiatives, local decision-making power over local services and facilities, and the power to propose by-laws.

“We said we would listen on the issue of the powers of local boards, and we have,” said the Ministers. “We believe the Select Committee’s plan for local boards is a good one that will protect and enhance democracy.  We thank Aucklanders for their constructive contributions.

“The Government was also persuaded by submissions to have all councillors elected from wards.  This creates real local authority.  We trust Aucklanders to elect local candidates who also have the interests of the whole region at heart.

“Importantly, the Select Committee report demonstrates the substantial agreement on the main points: one council, one mayor, one plan, strong local boards and elections from wards. 

“We will achieve real local authority and strong regional government for Auckland."

The Select Committee’s report is available at [www.parliament.nz](http://www.parliament.nz/) under Select Committees and at [www.auckland.govt.nz](http://www.auckland.govt.nz/).
