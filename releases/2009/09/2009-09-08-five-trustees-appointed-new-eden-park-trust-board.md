The Government has appointed five trustees to the new Eden Park Trust Board, Rugby World Cup Minister Murray McCully announced today.

John Waller, Hugh Burrett, Michelle Boag, Morris Pita, and Derek Dallow have been appointed to the new Board, which was created under the recently-passed Eden Park Trust Board Amendment Act.

“A significant upgrade of Eden Park was one of the requirements of New Zealand’s bid to host the Rugby World Cup in 2011, and the Crown contributed a significant amount of taxpayer funds to the redevelopment project,” Mr McCully said.

“In return for that investment, it was agreed that a new governance structure would be created for Eden Park to reflect the public ownership and interest in the facility.

“The new Eden Park Trust Board comes together at an important stage for the Park.  The redevelopment is progressing well, and the Board now needs to steer that project to completion and ensure we maximise the opportunities this world-class facility presents for Auckland and the country,” Mr McCully said.

The five Crown-appointed trustees join four other trustees: Warwick Nicoll and Rob Fisher from the current Eden Park Trust Board; Greg Muir, nominated by the Auckland Rugby Union, and Rex Smith, nominated by the Auckland Cricket Association.  

“I congratulate the new trustees on their appointments, and wish them well with this important project,” Mr McCully said.

“I also want to thank the current Trustees of the Eden Park Trust Board and members of both Auckland Cricket and Auckland Rugby for the time and energy they have given to the development of the Park.  Through their endeavours and commitment, Eden Park will be a key asset for Auckland and the country for years to come.”
