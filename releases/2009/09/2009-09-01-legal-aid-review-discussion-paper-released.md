Justice Minister Simon Power today announced the release of the discussion paper on improving the legal aid system.

The paper is the first stage of work on a fundamental review of the legal aid system by Dame Margaret Bazley. 

“This review is an important part of the Government’s work programme,” Mr Power said. 

“Legal aid is a cornerstone of an accessible, trusted, and effective justice system. It plays a defining role in upholding access to justice. 

"By funding legal aid services, governments give effect to the principles of equality before the law and natural justice.

"However, legal aid is facing real challenges, both in terms of demand for publicly funded legal services, the quality of these services, and, particularly in the current fiscal environment, the cost of these services. 

"The purpose of the review is to consider how the system can best be structured so it delivers effective services to those who need them most, in a way that is cost-effective and sustainable."

The release of the paper follows an initial phase of research and consultation with people and organisations up and down the country.  It canvasses some of the pressing issues the legal aid system is facing and seeks views on the way forward.

“This review has the potential to improve the lives of the people who come into contact with the justice system, and give taxpayers real confidence that they're getting good value for money from legal aid expenditure,” Mr Power says.

“Dame Margaret’s discussion paper is the first step in this process and I am grateful for her insights into the state of the system.

“I encourage members of the public to read it and consider making a submission.”

Submissions are open until October 9. Dame Margaret is expected to make her final report to Mr Power in November. 

The legal aid review is part of the Government’s package of reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the justice system.  Changes will also be made to simplify criminal procedure and use new technology to allow people to participate remotely in court proceedings.
