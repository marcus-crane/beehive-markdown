New Zealand Police's pioneering DNA database has been updated with its 100,000th profile, creating a milestone in the development of a unique crime-fighting tool, Police Minister Judith Collins announced today.

When it was launched in 1996, the Police's DNA Profile Databank was just one of only two in existence, and the use of DNA in detective work was in its infancy.

"Now, 13 years on, this remarkable tool is a real weapon in solving serious cases - and not just crimes occurring today, but crimes which have remained unsolved for decades," says Ms Collins.

The DNA database has been instrumental in solving some of the country's most high-profile and serious cases.

The murders of Maureen McKinnell in Arrowtown and Teresa Cormack in Napier were both solved by analysing genetic material stored in the database.

"For many years, Police waited for technology to develop in order to make the best use of the vital material they painstakingly collected. It's heartening to see their diligence paying off.

"Many criminals who thought they had committed the perfect crime are now behind bars - because Police had the foresight to collect genetic evidence," Ms Collins says.

Other serious cases solved through analysis of the database include rape, abduction, sexual assault, home invasion, arson and burglary.

"Police have done a fantastic job of using this database to solve crime - the combination of cutting-edge science and excellent detecting has achieved positive results," says Ms Collins.

Police add around 1000 profiles each month to the database, with about 80 per cent of samples given voluntarily. Environmental Science and Research maintains the database.
