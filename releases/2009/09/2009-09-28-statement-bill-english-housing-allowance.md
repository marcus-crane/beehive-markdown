Prime Minister John Key today said he fully supports the personal decision reached by Finance Minister Bill English regarding his ministerial housing allowance.

"Mr English has been doing an outstanding job as Finance Minister during very difficult economic times, and he is firmly committed to steering New Zealand into a more prosperous period," Mr Key said.

"It is important that Mr English is focused on the critical decisions he needs to make for New Zealanders, and this issue had become an unfortunate distraction."

"While understanding Mr English's decision to make this move today, I must reiterate that he has chosen not to accept a payment that has been made available to him," Mr Key said.
