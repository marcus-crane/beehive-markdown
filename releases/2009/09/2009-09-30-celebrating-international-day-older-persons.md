The International Day of Older Persons is a great opportunity to honour, respect and acknowledge older New Zealanders, says Senior Citizens Minister John Carter.

The Day is celebrated on 1 October each year. This year's theme is "Towards a Society for all Ages". 

"The Day is an opportunity to say thank you for the huge contribution that older people make to society in every walk of life, as grandparents, friends, colleagues, and as mentors to the younger generations," said Mr Carter.

"We all know that we have an ageing population, and the effects this will have on society in the future.  One in eight New Zealanders is currently aged over 65, and this is projected to increase to more than one in four by 2050. These demographic changes will provide both challenges and many opportunities.

"The Government is working to enhance opportunities for older people to contribute in the ways that they choose. Older people are valued as important members of our communities, and our ability to tap into their skills, knowledge and experiences will be critical for ensuring social and economic development.

"I will be marking the Day by attending an event in Christchurch, and there are events all over the country to mark the occasion. I urge all New Zealanders to take part," said Mr Carter.
