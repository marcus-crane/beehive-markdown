The Government’s home insulation scheme has resulted in more than 7000 New Zealand homes being insulated or fitted with clean heat in the eight weeks since the scheme started.

Prime Minister John Key, Energy & Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee and Green Party co-leader Russel Norman today visited the Mangere home of Gaznafar and Shabina Buksh, and their three children, to mark the two month milestone of the *Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart* scheme.

The Buksh family are having ceiling and underfloor insulation put in, as well as a cylinder wrap and moisture barrier, and heat pump.  The installation is being done by Eco Insulation, a North Island company that has employed 50 new staff to deal with increased demand since the scheme’s launch on 1 July.

As well as the subsidy from the scheme, the family are getting funding under the ASB Community Trust’s Snug Homes programme.

“It’s very pleasing to see so many New Zealand families taking up the home insulation scheme.  It’s tracking well ahead of target, which is good news,” says Mr Key.

“Warmer, drier homes means energy savings, lower power bills and better health outcomes.  The sooner the insulation goes in, the sooner those benefits start mounting up for people.

“It is pleasing that this project is also creating jobs around the country.  Most providers registered under the scheme have already hired new staff to cope with the demand, while insulation manufacturers have increased production, creating more employment.”

Mr Brownlee says a new network of providers will be signed up to install the insulation from 1 October, and an announcement will be made soon on which companies have been selected as long-term providers under *Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart*.

“This will mean even more suppliers on the ground to deliver the scheme, which will mean more jobs, as well as more homes insulated.  Some homeowners have had to wait for a provider.

“I am asking people to be patient while the scheme is still gearing up, but the numbers show that even before we’ve reached full capacity many thousands of families are already benefiting.

“Bringing in more companies will mean people can get their homes attended to faster, and start reaping the benefits earlier.”
