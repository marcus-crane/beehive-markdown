Transport Minister Steven Joyce has asked the New Zealand Transport Agency to add a third option in its consultation for the State highway One alignment through the Kapiti Coast.

The request follows three public meetings Mr Joyce attended on the Kapiti Coast on Wednesday evening which were attended by more than a thousand people in total.

"A significant number of those who spoke at the meetings argued strongly for the four-lane state highway expressway to proceed along the length of the proposed Western Link Road - the so-called third option" says Mr Joyce.

"Towards the end of the third meeting, I undertook to request that the Transport Agency consult on the third option as well as the two that are currently on the table - and extend the consultation period if necessary to give everybody the opportunity to express their views."

The third option would see the State Highway expressway built along the designated western arterial route, with the current state highway becoming a local road through the district.  It could be built for between $380 and $500 million, and would directly affect a much smaller number of properties (20 - 50).

"The agency is currently considering how best to respond to my request, and I am expecting an announcement from them soon." says Mr Joyce
