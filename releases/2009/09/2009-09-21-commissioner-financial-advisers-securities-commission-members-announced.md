David Mayhew has been appointed the new Commissioner for Financial Advisers, and Simon Botherway and Mark Verbeist have been appointed as new members of the Securities Commission, Commerce Minister Simon Power said today.

"David Mayhew is a returning New Zealander who is recognised internationally as a leading practitioner in contentious financial services regulatory work.  I'm pleased he'll be bringing this expertise back to New Zealand."

He will formally assume the role on January 25 from Annabel Cotton, who was appointed on a temporary basis. 

The role of Commissioner for Financial Advisers was created under the Financial Advisers Act 2008.  The commissioner will oversee the drafting, approval and implementation of a professional Code of Conduct for authorised financial advisers.  The code will set the minimum standards of competence, knowledge and skills, ethical behaviour, client care, and professional training requirements that authorised financial advisers must comply with.

Once the code is implemented, the commissioner will chair the Disciplinary Committee, which will hear complaints against authorised financial advisers.  The committee will also conduct disciplinary court proceedings and, when necessary, impose penalties arising from disciplinary proceedings.

"I would like to thank Ms Cotton for taking up the role in April this year and for establishing the committee that is working on the Code of Conduct," Mr Power said.

Ms Cotton will remain a member of the Securities Commission. Mr Mayhew will automatically be a member of the commission.

Mr Power said Simon Botherway and Mark Verbiest would bring their vast experience of commercial and securities markets to the commission.

Mr Verbiest will step into Mai Chen's role from October 1 this year, while Mr Botherway will succeed Colin Beyer when he retires in February.

"I acknowledge the services of Colin Beyer and Mai Chen, who have been in the commission since 2001 and 2003 respectively," Mr Power said.
