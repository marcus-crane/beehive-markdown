The Government's Youth Opportunities Package has reached a significant milestone, with more than 1000 Job Ops already created for young people.

Minister for Social Development and Employment Paula Bennett has welcomed the speed with which employers have embraced the scheme.

"Job Ops will be making a real difference to the lives of so many young people. Of the 1000 opportunities that have been created, 454 have been filled. That's 454 young people who are now working, and gaining valuable experience, thanks to this scheme.

"Given we only announced the Job Ops scheme 6 weeks ago, that result is impressive.

"Job Ops is doing what it was set up to do. It's drawing out work opportunities for low-skilled young people - giving them experience in the workplace and boosting their confidence. It's helping them find their footing in a very uneven labour market.

"Everyday we're getting more employers signing up and offering job opportunities, and I think it's great the business community has stepped up to the challenge," Paula Bennett says.

The vacancies are evenly spread across the country, and cover a range of industries. The bulk of the jobs are in construction, retail and hospitality.

The 1000th Job Ops position is for retail assistant in a small Taranaki general store. A young person has been referred for the job which will develop skills in customer service, cash handling and general retail experience.

"This Government is committed to creating jobs for young people and giving them some real experience in the job market. We know young people have been among those hit hardest by the recession, but Job Ops is providing some relief.

"At this rate, we're on track to have all 4000 places filled by mid-January, but it's important to remember it's not the only scheme creating jobs for young people. Community Max has already generated a lot of interest, and created more than 80 positions.

"We want more organisations to come forward with projects for young people that will give them some work experience, as well as help benefit the community as a whole," Paula Bennett says.
