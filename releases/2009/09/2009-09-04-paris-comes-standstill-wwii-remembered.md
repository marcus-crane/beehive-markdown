Traffic in Paris was brought to a standstill today as Veterans' Affairs Minister Judith Collins and the French Secretary of Defence, Hubert Falco, led a special ceremony to remember the war-time alliance between France and New Zealand.

Thousands of Parisians, veterans, soldiers and school children joined the ministers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Arc de Triomphe to mark the 70th anniversary of the start of World War II.

"The atmosphere this evening has been incredible," said Ms Collins.

"Parisians - and a sprinkling of Kiwis, I'm pleased to say - have turned out in force to remember the special relationship between France and New Zealand.

"Seventy years on, it is vital we remember and honour the sacrifices made by those who gave up their lives to fight for the freedom of both France and New Zealand. The French fought to defend their country; New Zealanders joined that battle to defend their allies and to push back a tide of tyranny."

Traffic around the Arc de Triomphe - one the largest and most recognisable roundabouts in the world - was halted at 6.30pm Paris time for the ceremony.

Ms Collins and M Falco jointly rekindled the eternal flame on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, which has burned in memory of the dead of both world wars for 70 years.

The eternal flame, which is the first eternal flame to be lit in Europe in modern times, is rekindled each day at 6.30pm.

Both ministers also laid wreaths on behalf of their country's war dead.

"To be standing in Paris today, a city held hostage by the Axis in World War II and which is today a liberated and beautiful place, is indeed moving," said Ms Collins.

"I'm proud to be representing New Zealand here and hope all New Zealanders are remembering this day and the people whose lives were changed utterly 70 years ago."

Ms Collins will be travelling on to Le Quesnoy on Friday (Paris time), where she will be meeting local dignitaries for further World War II commemorations.
