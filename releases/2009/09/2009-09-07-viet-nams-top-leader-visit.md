Prime Minister John Key says the General Secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party, Nong Duc Manh, will visit New Zealand later this week.

"The General Secretary is the senior leader in the Vietnamese system, so this is a very significant visit."

He will be bringing with him a large delegation including the Deputy Prime Minister - who is also the Minister of Foreign Affairs - as well as Ministers with responsibility for trade, investment and education.

"Viet Nam is one of the most impressive economic performers in South East Asia and it has staved off the effects of the global downturn better than most," Mr Key says.

"Viet Nam's GDP growth figures over the past decade have been stellar and it is becoming an increasingly important trading partner for New Zealand.

"Viet Nam is keen to work more closely with New Zealand in a host of areas, including education, and science and technology. We welcome these growing links and see the relationship between our two countries offering great potential to both sides."

Mr Manh will receive an official welcome in Wellington on Thursday, and he and his Ministers will hold policy talks with their counterparts later that day.
