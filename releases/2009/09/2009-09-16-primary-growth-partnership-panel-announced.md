The appointment of a six member advisory panel to steer the Primary Growth Partnership signals a new era for primary sector innovation, says Agriculture Minister David Carter.

Mr Carter told an audience at Parliament this evening that he was pleased with the calibre of the new panel members.

"The Primary Growth Partnership is one of the most ambitious research and innovation schemes ever seen in New Zealand, and it is in very good hands."

The members of the investment advisory panel are: John Brakenridge, Dr Kevin Marshall, Colin McKenzie, Joanna Perry and Jamie Tuuta.  It will be chaired by Bill Falconer.

"The Primary Growth Partnership is an ambitious scheme which will see New Zealand investing up to $140 million a year in primary sector growth and innovation," said Mr Carter.

"With the advisory panel now in place and the criteria established for the submissions process, the PGP is now open for business.

"This initiative is a clear demonstration of the Government's bid to boost productivity across all primary industries and deliver economic growth and sustainability.

"The investment advisory panel will have the crucial role of assessing the merits and potential of industry submissions and making funding recommendations.

"The wealth of experience on this panel will be a key contributor to the success of this scheme."
