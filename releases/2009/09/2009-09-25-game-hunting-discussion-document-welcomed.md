Associate Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson has welcomed the release today of a discussion paper outlining plans to establish a Big Game Hunting Council.

The creation of the Council was recommended in 2007 and is a feature of the National-led Government's Confidence and Supply Agreement with United Future, who are working closely with the Minister on hunting issues.

"The new Council aims to represent all game animal managers and hunters, and will manage the game animal resource," Ms Wilkinson says.

"I would encourage anyone and everyone with an interest in this area to take the opportunity to have their say on the make-up of the Council and the role they want it to play."

The Establishment Committee, set up to give the Government advice on the Council's formation, released the discussion paper. It can be found at [www.gameanimalcouncil.org.nz](http://www.gameanimalcouncil.org.nz/).

A series of public meetings with stakeholders will be held during October, with submissions closing on November 23.
