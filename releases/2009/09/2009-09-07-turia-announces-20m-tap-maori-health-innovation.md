Maori health groups with innovative ideas to help improve Maori health will be allocated $20 million over the next four years, Tariana Turia announced today.

"A lot of Maori providers have already adopted innovative ways to tailor their services beyond what they are paid to do," Mrs Turia said.

"This fund will help them get the resources they need to grow those innovative services or develop new ones that have a whanau ora approach and that will help improve Maori health outcomes," Mrs Turia said.

"In essence, the fund acknowledges the spirit of innovation among Maori in health and I look forward to seeing it help turn the tide on the health of our people."

$5 million a year will be made available under Te Ao Auahatanga Hauora Maori (Maori Health Innovation Fund) for Maori health providers wanting to develop and implement a pilot or new service, share and spread innovative information.

The fund will be launched in Parliament today at an event expected to be attended by more than 100 Maori providers throughout the country.

Maori providers can submit registrations of interest by October 16 for one of the three funding categories under the fund. Further information and forms are available at [www.moh.govt.nz](http://www.moh.govt.nz/)
