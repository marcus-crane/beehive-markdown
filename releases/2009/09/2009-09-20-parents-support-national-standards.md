Consultation feedback  
shows strong support from parents for National Standards, Education Minister  
Anne Tolley has announced.

The Ministry of  
Education consulted widely between May and July on the Standards, which aim to  
lift the levels of achievement in literacy and numeracy for New Zealand children  
in primary and intermediate schools.

More than 11,000  
people attended sector and parent meetings or gave written  
submissions.

"Parents want to  
easily understand how their children are progressing at school, and said they  
support the plain language reporting which National Standards will deliver from  
next year," said Mrs Tolley.

"Over 2,000 parents  
and family members were involved in face-to-face discussions, with 3,000 making  
submissions. They want to know more about what is going on in schools so they  
can support their children's learning. They would also like practical assistance  
and support from schools.

"Teachers and  
principals also emphasised the usefulness of parents having clear, timely,  
honest and accurate information."

National Standards  
will be published and distributed to schools in October this year, with schools  
required to assess students against the Standards and report in plain language  
to parents about their child's progress and achievement from  
2010\.

"Having listened to  
the sector's concerns during consultation, schools won't have to begin  
submitting data to the Ministry of Education until 2012, against targets set for  
National Standards achievement in their 2011 charters," said Mrs  
Tolley.

"Sector feedback was  
also taken into consideration in finalising the Standards, such as aligning them  
more closely to the New Zealand Curriculum. The Ministry is currently working on  
this, as well as preparing materials to support teachers to use the Standards."

analysis of feedback, and NZCER and Ministry reports on the consultation, are
