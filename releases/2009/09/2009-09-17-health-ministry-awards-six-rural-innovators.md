Health Minister Tony Ryall has announced the six successful applicants of the Health Ministry's 2009/2010 Rural Innovation Fund.

The fund is a one-off grant of up to $50,000 for each successful applicant for a 12 month project.

Mr Ryall says the government wants better, sooner, more convenient care in rural areas and the six innovators include projects on teleradiology, medication counselling and treatment monitoring for depression and a flying doctor service.

The successful projects are:

- A teleradiology project for Fiordland Medical Practice
- Otaki PHO's GP led clinics targeting Kohanga Reo and Kindergartens
- Waiuku Medical Centre's  Mauri Ora
- Tararua PHO's Mobile Service Delivery
- Waikato Community Pharmacy Group's Counselling and Medication project for patients with mild to moderate depression
- Western Bay of Plenty PHO's  Flying Doctor Service

The Health Minister says the Rural Innovation Fund ultimately aims to encourage the uptake and spread of innovative initiatives that fit in with the Primary Health Care Strategy and the Government's Health Targets. All applicants have to supply information about how their project will be evaluated and how the projects' outcomes will be shared with others.

Projects must also have the support of their local District Health Board and Primary Health Organisations.

There were 22 applications for the annual fund of $300,000.
