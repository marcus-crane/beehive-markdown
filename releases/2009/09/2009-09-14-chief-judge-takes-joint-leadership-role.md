Courts Minister Georgina te Heuheu today congratulated Chief Judge Wilson Whare Isaac of the Māori Land Court on his appointment as Chairperson of the Waitangi Tribunal.

This follows the Chief Judge's recent appointment as Chief Judge of the Māori Land Court and continues the tradition whereby both roles are held by the same person.

"Chief Judge Isaac has already served the people of New Zealand well and I am confident he will go on to perform this joint leadership role with distinction," she said. 

In his role as a Judge of the Māori Land Court he has already served as a panel member on high profile Waitangi Tribunal district inquiries and shown he can maintain the confidence of key groups through this process.

Mrs te Heuheu said Chief Judge Isaac's knowledge of communities together with demonstrated leadership, judicial and administrative experience has equipped him well for this additional appointment.

"Like the Māori Land Court, the Waitangi Tribunal is no ordinary Court.

"In measuring the actions of the Crown against the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi, the Tribunal plays an important role in reconciling the interests of Māori and all other New Zealanders," Mrs te Heuheu said.

"I am confident that Chief Judge Isaac has the background, the experience and the necessary good judgement to deal with matters before the Tribunal of significant importance both to Māori and the nation.

"I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well."
