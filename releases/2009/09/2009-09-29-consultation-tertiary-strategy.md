Tertiary Education Minister Anne Tolley has today released the Government's draft Tertiary Education Strategy 2010-2015 for consultation.

"We need the tertiary system to deliver for our young people, to improve education outcomes and achievement and to build a skilled and innovative workforce," said Mrs Tolley.

"The draft strategy sets out the direction the Government wants tertiary education to take in the next five years. With a growth in demand we need to ensure the best return on the public's investment.

"It also sets out the improvements Government is seeking in the performance of the system. In particular, providers need to be more responsive to students and industry and make better use of resources."

The Government priorities for tertiary education are to:

- increase the number of young people (aged under 25) achieving at Levels Four and above, in particular completing degree-level qualifications
- assist Māori and Pasifika students to achieve at higher levels
- increase the number of young people moving successfully from school into tertiary education
- continue to assist adult learners to gain literacy, language, and numeracy skills that lead to higher level study or skilled employment
- improve the educational and financial performance of providers
- strengthen research outcomes.

"We are seeking feedback on how we can achieve our priorities," said Mrs Tolley.

"We want to hear from tertiary providers, students, employers and communities on how the tertiary education system can boost New Zealand's economic prosperity and build a strong society for the future."

Submissions close on 6 November 2009. The draft strategy is available at:

 **Questions and Answers**

## What is the Tertiary Education Strategy?

- The document that sets outs the Government's long-term direction and medium-term priorities for tertiary education
- The Education Act 1989 requires the Minister responsible for Tertiary Education to release a tertiary education strategy
- The Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) is required to give effect to the strategy through its funding decisions
- The final strategy will go to Cabinet for approval by the end of 2009.

**Why release a new strategy now?**

This Government is committed to:

- simplifying the tertiary education funding system
- reducing central bureaucracy
- strengthening quality and requiring accountability
- supporting and encouraging students
- improving the interface between schools and tertiary education institutions

The current funding agreements that organisations have with the TEC expire at the end of next year. The new strategy will guide the TEC's decisions about what tertiary education programmes to fund between 2011 and 2014.

**How does the approach to this new draft strategy differ from the last strategy?**

The new draft is shorter and sharper than the previous strategy. It focuses on the changes that need to take place so that tertiary education is relevant and efficient and meets student and labour market needs.

The economic situation now is very different than in 2006 when the last strategy was released. The Government is facing significant deficits. The priorities in this strategy will help us make hard decisions about how to fund tertiary education over the next five years.

**Who is the strategy aimed at?**

The strategy is aimed at anyone involved in tertiary education. It is directly relevant to tertiary providers, students and staff, but also to prospective students, their families and the people who benefit from tertiary education such as employers.

**What is the process for the consultation?**

The Ministry of Education will meet organisations with a direct stake in tertiary education to discuss the draft strategy. The draft strategy is on the Ministry of Education's website. Submissions can be made online or by mail until 6 November 2009.

The Ministry will consider the submissions it receives and revise the strategy for Cabinet's approval at the end of 2009.

**What will happen once the final strategy is released?**

The TEC will prepare its investment guidance based on the Government's priorities in the strategy. The investment guidance helps tertiary education organisations prepare their three-year plans. The plans will be finalised and approved during 2010 and will take effect in January 2011.
