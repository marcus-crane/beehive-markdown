A series of public meetings on Defence Review 09 starting in Auckland on Saturday will give people a chance for face-to-face engagement with the Government on the direction of the Defence Force in the coming decades.

The meetings are part of the public consultation process on the Review which began in June. There will be 14 meetings in 12 locations between this Saturday and Tuesday 29 September. (The full schedule is available through the "Related Documents" link below.)

Each meeting will be attended either by Defence Minister Wayne Mapp or Associate Defence Minister Heather Roy, or by another Government MP.

Dr Mapp said that the Review will establish the Defence Force's path for the future. "Big decisions on capabilities face Defence over the next decade. That is why we need public input into New Zealand defence," he said.

Mrs Roy said that in addition to the main Review, there are three companion studies. "They are considering the defence industry, the role of the New Zealand Defence Force in youth programmes and the concept of voluntary national service.  People are also welcome to offer their views on these subjects as part of the public meetings programme," she said.

The final outcome of the Defence Review will be a White Paper early next year setting out the direction and purpose for the Defence Force out to 2035.
