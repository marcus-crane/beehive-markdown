Another step toward a new electoral finance regime was taken today with the release of a proposal document by Justice Minister Simon Power.

"The proposal document gives the public an opportunity to express their views on the Government's proposed electoral finance regime," Mr Power said.

"The aim at this stage is to gain broad consensus on the core elements of electoral finance law.

"We've put the finer details of the regime to one side until the public's submissions on these core elements have been assessed.

"I'm confident the Government's proposals set the foundation for a fair, enduring and workable legislative framework for electoral finance.

"We must return democracy to our electoral finance laws."

The review of electoral finance is being carried out in three stages.  Each stage provides an opportunity for the public to have a say.

The first stage was an issues paper which was released in May. Views received on that paper informed the development of the proposal document.

This proposal document is the second stage of the review, and comments are now sought from the public.

The final stage will be the parliamentary process, where a bill will be drafted and introduced to Parliament. The public will have a further opportunity to have a say at the select committee phase.

Consultation on the proposal document closes on October 30.

The document and further information about the consultation process and how to make a submission can be found at [www.justice.govt.nz/electoralfinancereform](http://www.justice.govt.nz/electoralfinancereform).
