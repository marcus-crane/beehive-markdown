All New Zealanders owe a debt of gratitude to police officers who lost their lives making New Zealand a better and safer place, Police Minister Judith Collins said today.

Ms Collins joined senior police, religious leaders and families of fallen officers at the Royal New Zealand Police College at Porirua today to mark Police Remembrance Day.

Since 1890, 29 police officers and traffic officers have been slain in the line of duty in New Zealand. Police Remembrance Day is held annually to honour the fallen.

"It takes a special type of person to be a police officer. The role embodies much of what is fundamentally decent in our society - respect, protecting our fellow New Zealanders and upholding the rule of law," Ms Collins said.

"Yet it is a role with considerable risk. Putting their personal safety or even their lives on the line to protect the public is all in a day's work for the brave men and women in our police.

"Quite possibly, the people we are remembering today did not consider themselves to be extraordinary. 

"But the rest of us recognise that serving and protecting the public is a noble calling, and that their actions and their sacrifice set them apart as guardians, role models and heroes to our community. We all owe them a debt of gratitude."

Ms Collins said her thoughts were with the families and colleagues of Senior Constable Len Snee who was fatally wounded on 7 May in Napier,  Sergeant Don Wilkinson, killed at Mangere on 11 September 2008, and Sergeant Derek Wootton, killed at Titahi Bay on 11 July 2008.

The Minister also thanked and paid tribute to the families of police.

"Those of you here today have nurtured and supported some this country's finest people. Thank you for giving your loved ones the chance to serve their country and work for the public good."
