New Zealand companies aiming to grow in the competitive Japanese market now have access to high-level advice through a network of experienced business people based in Japan, as part of an expansion to New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE)'s Beachheads programme, Trade Minister Tim Groser announced today.

"Japan is our third-largest export market. However earlier excellent growth in New Zealand exports has plateaued in more recent years. I am certain we can make more of our opportunities in Japan. It is crucial that our businesses understand those opportunities and what it takes to be successful there.

"The new Japan Beachhead Advisory Board members will provide valuable knowledge and contacts to New Zealand companies accepted into the programme," Mr Groser said.

NZTE's Beachheads programme was launched in 2002 to accelerate companies' growth in international markets. It is delivered by NZTE in partnership with the private sector and aimed at high-growth New Zealand businesses looking to grow internationally.

"The Japan Beachhead Advisory Board is the ninth to be established by NZTE. It will be chaired by Mr Meishi Sonobe, an experienced senior executive who serves as a director and an advisor to various companies in Japan and New Zealand. Mr Sonobe is currently in New Zealand to meet companies that are working with NZTE and could benefit from participating in the Beachheads programme."

Mr Sonobe chairs a board of six business advisors who have experience across a range of industries, from marketing and food, through to construction and entertainment. Two advisors are expatriate New Zealanders and the others are experienced Japanese business people.

"New Zealand businesses are a long way from the rest of the world. NZTE's Beachheads programme plays an important role in connecting them to international business networks and improving their chances of success.

"I'm sure businesses will be keen to access the knowledge and contacts that are now available to them in Japan," Mr Groser said.
