Tertiary Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced how the 2000 student places created by the jump-start to the Youth Guarantee are to be allocated across New Zealand in 2010.

Twenty-eight providers have been approved for the delivery of Youth Guarantee programmes next year, as part of the Government's $52.7 million funding over two years. 2000 places will also be available in 2011.

"We are delivering on our promise to help 16 and 17 year olds who are at risk of disengaging from education or training," said Mrs Tolley.

"I'm delighted to see so much interest in this programme. The Youth Guarantee will give students who are more motivated in non-school settings an opportunity to re-engage with learning and gain skills for future employment.

"The jump-start to the Youth Guarantee was a key part of the Prime Minister's Jobs Summit earlier this year. It's aimed at young people who are ready to move beyond school, but who still want to study and learn practical skills. It will provide them with an opportunity to participate in a range of vocational programmes, free of charge, at selected private training establishments, institutes of technology and polytechnics."

A range of Youth Guarantee programmes will be available in 2010 including courses in tourism and travel, agriculture, building, plumbing, hospitality and catering.

Youth Guarantee places were allocated to regions of high need, based on the number of unemployed young people in the population and high quality proposals.
