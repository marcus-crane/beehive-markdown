The Government has passed changes to improve the Resource Management Act that will untangle unnecessary red tape for New Zealanders and enable essential infrastructure to be built in a more timely way.

The Resource Management (Simplifying & Streamlining) Amendment Bill passed its third reading in Parliament this evening and will enter into law from 1 October 2009.

“These changes to the RMA improve the Act by removing costs, uncertainties and delays that have frustrated New Zealand homeowners, small businesses and farmers for years,” Environment Minister Nick Smith says.

Key changes to the Act include:

- Removing frivolous, vexatious and anti-competitive objections that can add tens of thousands of dollars to consent applicants
- Streamlining processes for projects of national significance
- Creating an Environmental Protection Authority
- Improving plan development and plan change processes
- Improved resource consent processes
- Streamlined decision making
- Strengthening compliance by increasing penalties and proving for a wider range of enforcement
- Improvements to national instruments

“Aucklanders will welcome from 1 October not having to apply for a resource consent to trim a tree on their property. This will save more than 3000 resource consents per year.

“Councils that have previously relied on blanket tree protection rules will need to get on with identifying in their plans trees that do justify the protection of the Resource Management Act. I will be monitoring to ensure they do this as the Government’s intent is not to see significant and valued trees lose their protection. 

“This first phase of changes will make a positive difference but are only part of a wider reform of the RMA by the Government. The second phase is far more complex with 10 related work streams, including aquaculture, the structure of the Environmental Protection Authority, fresh water management, infrastructure, and better aligning the RMA with the Forestry, Building, and Conservation Acts.

“The passage of these significant changes to the RMA is about National delivering on its pre-election promises and reshaping the law to make it less costly and more effective.”
