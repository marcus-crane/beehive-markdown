Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce is seeking feedback on Telecom's recent request for the government to consider a further proposed variation of the company's Operational Separation Undertakings. 

The proposed variation relates to the requirement on Telecom to implement logical separation of shared information systems containing customer confidential information by 31 December 2009.

Comment is also sought on a draft Peer Review report on Telecom's proposed variation.

The Operational Separation Undertakings, which had the effect of splitting Telecom into three separate business units, came into effect on 31 March 2008. The need for a process to allow variation of the Undertakings was envisaged at the time they were developed.

"The proposed variation has been requested by Telecom because it has established that it is not able to support the level of IT system business process change, system change solutions and integration testing required to concurrently deliver six major Undertakings milestones by 31 December 2009," says Mr Joyce.

"I welcome public and industry views on whether the proposed variation meets the purposes set out in Part 2A of the Telecommunications Act 2001. Those views will be taken into account in considering Telecom's request."

Submissions close at 5.00pm on 18 September 2009. They should be sent to [opsepsubmissions@med.govt.nz](mailto:opsepsubmissions@med.govt.nz).
