Finding a health professional or health facility's website and email addresses will become easier with the ".health.nz" domain launched by Health Minister Tony Ryall today.

Health providers can now use the suffix .health.nz for health websites and email addresses, for example www.abcmedicalcentre.health.nz or drb@abcmedicalcentre.health.nz

The Ministry of Health with ACC, on behalf of the health sector, successfully applied for the exclusive use of the suffix and are now rolling out registrations to eligible organisations.

Only organisations with registered health practitioners, ambulances, selected Government agencies, and approved health sector support organisations will be able to use the domain.

Mr Ryall says, "The .health.nz domain will improve confidence in the credibility of web-based health information and will enable members of the sector to be easily identified in online communications."

Globally, the World Health Organization has campaigned for the creation of a .health domain to signal to users that certain sites meet standards of safety and accuracy, and to enable users to narrow their searches.

The application process and .health.nz domain will be managed by the Health Domain Moderator's Office, sitting within the Ministry of Health. There is currently no charge for registering for a .health.nz domain name.

Information on how to apply for a health domain and further details about eligibility criteria are available at [www.moh.govt.nz/healthdomain](http://www.moh.govt.nz/healthdomain).
