Former State Services Commissioner Michael Wintringham has been appointed as Chair of the Remuneration Authority, Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson announced today.

The Remuneration Authority is the body that sets pay rates for Ministers of the Crown, MPs, Judges and Local Authority Members.

Mr Wintringham has been a member of the Authority since 2005. Prior to that he served as State Services Commissioner from 1997 to 2004.

Ms Wilkinson says Mr Wintringham's extensive public sector experience makes him well qualified to lead the Authority. He takes over from David Oughton, whose term expired this year.

Current authority member Angela Foulkes has been reappointed until 30 June 2011, while John Errington has been appointed as the third member with his term expiring on 30 June 2012.

Mr Errington was a partner and actuarial practice leader at PriceWaterhouseCoopers until his retirement  in June 2008. He now works as a self-employed acturarial consultant.

"Members of the Remuneration Authority have demanding responsibilities and I wish Mr Wintringham and his team all the best with their work," Ms Wilkinson says.
