New Zealand is fully supportive of a United States-led initiative to ensure developing countries can fight an influenza pandemic, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.

President Barack Obama has announced that the US will give 10 per cent of the H1N1 vaccines it produces to developing countries, via the World Health Organisation (WHO).

The American scheme, which is in concert with efforts by New Zealand, Australia, Brazil, France, Italy, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, comes as the WHO predicts that around $US1.5 billion would be needed to lift pandemic preparedness in developing countries as the northern hemisphere winter approaches.

"Pandemics such as the H1N1 flu virus require a global response because they know no borders, so the initiative announced by President Obama today is very welcome," Mr McCully said.

"New Zealand has allocated $7.1 million to help Pacific island nations prepare for a possible pandemic. We have been working closely with Australia, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, and the WHO to provide medical supplies and assist with pandemic preparedness planning, and we remain open to providing further assistance if needed.

"The Government has yet to decide whether to proceed with a pandemic immunisation campaign for New Zealanders. If such a programme goes ahead, current planning allows for vaccines to be supplied to the Cook Islands, Tokelau and Niue on a population pro rata basis," Mr McCully said.
