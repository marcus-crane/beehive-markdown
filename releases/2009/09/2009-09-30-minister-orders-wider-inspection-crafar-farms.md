Agriculture Minister David Carter says animal welfare inspectors will now begin inspecting all properties owned by the Crafar farming family to ensure there are no cases of animal neglect.

Mr Carter has already called for a full report into an incident of alleged mistreatment of bobby calves on a Benneydale dairy farm owned by Crafar Farms. An investigation by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is still underway.

"I have today instructed MAF to inspect, as an urgent priority, all further properties owned by, or associated with, the Crafar farming operation to ensure there are no immediate and ongoing animal welfare concerns," says Mr Carter.

"I have spoken to Allan Crafar today and he is willing to co-operate fully with MAF inspectors visiting the properties.

"The Crafar operation is clearly facing some serious issues and it must face up to its obligations as responsible farmers. No farmer can shirk from these obligations."

Mr Carter says MAF is currently talking with various farming industry representatives who are offering to assist the Crafar farming operation address these issues.

"The immediate concern, however, is to ensure there is no further animal neglect."
