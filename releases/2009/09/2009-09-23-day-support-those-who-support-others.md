Today - National Social Workers' Day -  is an opportunity to reflect on the crucial role played by social workers in the lives of so many Kiwi families, says Social Development and Employment Minister Paula Bennett.

"Quite simply, a single day isn't enough to truly appreciate the work social workers do across a number of government agencies and within the community sector.

"They're called upon 24 hours a day, every day of the year.

"That work - listening, understanding, guiding, empowering and protecting - has helped support countless New Zealanders and their families," Paula Bennett says.

"I know the recession hasn't made that job any easier - with more families feeling increased financial and social pressures. Often it's the children in those families who bear the brunt of the stress mum and dad are under."

Child, Youth and Family is the single biggest employer of social workers in New Zealand, with almost 1,400 social workers in a variety of specialist roles, including care and protection, youth justice, adoptions and residences.

"These social workers work in the most challenging - and most rewarding - social work jobs in the profession.

"They are staunch advocates for our most vulnerable children, young people and their families, and it's their job to stand up for them when many others have walked away," says Paula Bennett.

"It's not an easy job - it takes stamina and grit. Often it's only the social worker and the people they're working with who will ever really know the difference that's been made.

"I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all social workers for the invaluable work that they do," Paula Bennett says.
