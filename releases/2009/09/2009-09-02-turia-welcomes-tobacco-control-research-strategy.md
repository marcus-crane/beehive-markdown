Tariana Turia has welcomed a new strategy for tobacco control research.

"This strategy enables us all to take a long-term perspective on what will be the most effective investment of health funding to reduce tobacco related illnesses."

Agencies in New Zealand who undertake study related to tobacco control had worked together to develop proposals for a co-ordinated approach to their research. 

"I commend the researchers for working together and I Iook forward to reading the report and considering its recommendations," Mrs Turia said.

"Sound research is essential to making sure we do the right things and invest in the right people, programmes, products and processes to successfully support our people to quit the deadly habit of smoking."

Smoking kills about 5000 people every year in New Zealand and is the leading cause of preventable death.

Last week the Government announced an increased subsidy for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).  From 1 September NRT is available on prescription as well as with a Quit Card, for $3 from a pharmacy. 

"We made that decision because the research clearly shows that NRT can help double a person's chances of quitting.

"I am very clear about my commitment to supporting people to quit smoking and I look to quality research to show me the best ways to invest in tobacco control," Mrs Turia said.
