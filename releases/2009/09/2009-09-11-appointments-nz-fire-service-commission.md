The Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy today announced the reappointment of Dame Margaret Bazley as Chair of the New Zealand Fire Service Commission and the appointment of Rt Hon Wyatt Creech as Deputy Chair.

Mr Guy also announced the reappointment of Bob Francis and the appointment of David McFarlane to the Commission.

The Fire Commission is a Crown entity that controls the New Zealand Fire Service and protects life and property from fire. It is responsible for an annual budget of over $300 million. The Commission also acts as the National Rural Fire Authority. 

Mr Guy said he was very pleased to reappoint Dame Margaret to the role. "She has chaired the Commission since 1999 and has an established record of successful leadership and governance.

"I am also pleased to appoint Mr Creech as Deputy Chair of the Commission. He brings significant experience in economic management, business and finance which he has gained in high profile national leadership roles."

Mr Creech has been a Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand and was a Minister of the Crown for nine years holding a range of portfolios. He is also an experienced corporate director and a former accountant.

The other new appointee, Mr McFarlane, has extensive operational firefighting experience and currently serves as the Chief Fire Officer of the Renwick District. He has been a volunteer firefighter for over 35 years and is a former President of the United Fire Brigades Association. He has been honoured for his strong contribution to the voluntary sector and community.

Mr Francis, who was reappointed, has been a member of the Commission since 2006. He has had a distinguished career in local government including 20 years as the Mayor of Masterton.

The appointments are effective from 1 October 2009. The other member of the five-person Commission is Angela Foulkes.
