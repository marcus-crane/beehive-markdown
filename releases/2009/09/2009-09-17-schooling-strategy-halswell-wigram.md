Future directions for schooling provision in the Halswell-Wigram area of south-west Christchurch have been confirmed following an extensive community consultation process, Education Minister Anne Tolley announced today.

"Roll growth has been a feature of the area and so we needed to plan how best to provide for the increasing numbers of students that will live in Halswell-Wigram," said Mrs Tolley.

"It should be noted, however, that growth in this area has slowed recently so the actual student numbers will continue to be monitored."

As part of the strategy:

- The capacity of local schools will be increased to cater for roll growth in the immediate future.Sockburn School, Branston Intermediate, Manning Intermediate, Hillmorton High School and Hornby High School will be monitored and provided with roll growth classrooms if needed
- Maximum roll increases will be considered for integrated schools that provide for students from the Halswell-Wigram area, where there is demand for the education with a special character that they offer
- Consideration will be given to establishing a new Year 1-8 primary school on Ministry owned land at Milns Road, Halswell
- To provide for the population growth, consideration will be given to the purchase and designation of land for a school on the planned Wigram residential development when this development is of sufficient size to need a school, or growing Sockburn School on its current site

"I am grateful to the many organisations, school boards of trustees and individuals who took part in the consultation and contributed to the development of the strategy," said Mrs Tolley.

"Rather than establishing a new secondary school in the Halswell area, population growth will be managed through the present facilities at Hillmorton and Hornby High Schools and, where required, they will be provided with additional classrooms.

"I have asked the Ministry of Education to monitor and review the implementation of the strategy, including aspects that need further development such as specific initiatives related to education and learning for Māori and Pasifika students."
