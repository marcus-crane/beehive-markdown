The Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park's newly refurbished and extended visitor centre is officially open, Associate Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson announced today.

"Aoraki/Mt Cook is a huge tourist destination and the establishment of this world class visitor centre only enhances its appeal.

"Over 230,000 people visited the old centre each year and I have no doubt that we will see greater numbers turning up now.

"The redevelopment has included a complete refit of the displays and archive area and the construction of a new 24-hour information kiosk and memorial room.

"There is a real sense of history and pride in this place and the centrepiece view of the mountain says it all really - it's just inspiring."

The $6m upgrade began in February 2008, with construction on the new centre, roading, car park and walkway completed in October.

The interior was finished in December with all additions to the displays now made.
