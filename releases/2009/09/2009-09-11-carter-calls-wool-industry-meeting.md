The future direction of the wool industry will be the focus of a meeting called by Agriculture Minister David Carter.

Leading wool sector representatives will meet with the Minister in Wellington on 1 October to discuss concerns about the state of the industry.

Mr Carter said that the dumping of the wool levy in the recent Meat & Wool New Zealand referendum has left the sector in a vulnerable position.

"This meeting is not about re-litigating past differences. It is an opportunity for the invited representatives to work together constructively on the future role of their industry. 

"The implications of not having a national industry-good body acting for them from April next year are serious and need to be urgently dealt with," Mr Carter said.

"The continual decline in export earnings from wool has to be addressed.

"For too long the great potential of this sector has been held back by farmer apathy, politicking and patch protection.

"This meeting is a first step towards getting our wool industry back on track and delivering its true economic potential to New Zealand," said Mr Carter.
