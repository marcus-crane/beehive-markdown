"The determination of the New Zealand Geographic Board to accept a proposal by Te Rūnanga o Tupoho that Wanganui city be spelt 'Whanganui' will be referred to me as the Minister for Land Information for final decision.

The Board will provide me with its recommendation in the next two to three weeks.

It will report to me the reasons for its recommendation, as well as other options it considered.

The report will include a summary of the submissions supporting and opposing the name change.

As Minister I may confirm, modify or reject the Board's decision.

I will be carefully considering the Board's report and the submissions, after which I will make a decision. "Until then I will not be making any further comment." said Mr Williamson.
