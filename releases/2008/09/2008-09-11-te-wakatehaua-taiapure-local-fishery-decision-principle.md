Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton has agreed in principle to a proposed taiapure-local fishery in the waters surrounding Te Wakatehaua Island (the Bluff), Ninety Mile Beach. The proposal was submitted on behalf of Te Aupouri, tangata whenua of the area. 

Taiapure-local fisheries can be established in areas of special significance to an iwi or hapu as a source of food or for spiritual or cultural reasons. They allow tangata whenua to become involved in the management of commercial and non-commercial fishing in the taiapure-local fishery.

Jim Anderton said this decision-in-principle did not establish the taiapure-local fishery.

“The next stage of the statutory process involves a two month consultation period and a public inquiry into all submissions by a Maori Land Court tribunal.

“The waters surrounding Te Wakatehaua Island are of special significance to Te Aupouri. I am also aware that this area is important to recreational and commercial fishers.

“All stakeholders will now have an opportunity to make a submission on the proposal. A tribunal presided over by a Maori Land Court Judge will then issue me a report and recommendations on the proposal after it has completed its inquiry.”

Jim Anderton said that it was important for all interested persons to put in a submission so that their views could be considered.

Should the taiapure-local fishery be established, existing fishing rules within the area would remain unchanged.

A taiapure-local fishery management committee (which can comprise any person) must be appointed and could recommend new regulations be made for the area. Any recommendations to change existing rules would require further public consultation and approval by Cabinet.

Copies of the proposal and a map of the proposed taiapure-local fishery are available on the Ministry of Fisheries website at www.fish.govt.nz

Submissions on the proposal should be made to the Registrar, Whangarei Maori Land Court, Level 2 Manaia House, Rathbone Street, PO Box 1764, Whangarei. The closing date for submissions is 11 November 2008.
