Prime Minister Helen Clark said that the proceedings of Parliament’s Privileges Committee last night provide no basis for her to remove Mr Peters’ [ministerial warrant](http://www.cabinetmanual.cabinetoffice.govt.nz/2.15) today.

"I have discussed the proceedings with senior colleagues who participated in the hearing. They advise that the issues before the Privileges Committee lie unresolved in the face of the conflicting evidence presented to it.

"The National Party declared Mr Peters guilty before any evidence was heard. That is an improper process and not one I have been prepared to follow.

"Mr Peters’ often belligerent behaviour throughout this whole affair makes him a difficult person to insist on due process for.

"Yet any reasonable person, putting aside any bias they may have towards Mr Peters, would agree that it was fair to do so.

"Accordingly, I have no further statement to make about this matter today.

"Like all other observers, I await further developments", Helen Clark said.
