Prime Minister Helen Clark has paid tribute to the Hon Brian Donnelly QSO who passed away today.

"I was deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Brian Donnelly. He was a greatly respected MP, who was well-liked by all.

"Brian had a long career as a school teacher before entering Parliament, and he used that experience as both Minister of Education and as education spokesperson.

"Brian served his community and our country well. Most recently, he was New Zealand's High Commissioner to the Cook Islands, another role to which he brought his professionalism and personal warmth.

"I was pleased that he was able to attend his investiture ceremony at Government House recently.

"My thoughts and the thoughts of all Labour MPs are with Brian's wife, family, friends, and all his New Zealand First Parliamentary colleagues," Helen Clark said.
