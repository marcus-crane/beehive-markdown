“The initialling of the Ngati Apa Deed of Settlement today signifies the strong desire for the Crown and Ngati Apa to develop a working treaty partnership and lay to rest all historical grievances of the past and move into the future” said Associate Minister of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Mita Ririnui.

The Ngati Apa negotiating team were present in Parliament Buildings today for the initialling of the Deed of Settlement for their historical Treaty claim with the Crown.

 “As well as the commercial and financial redress package of more than $16 million, the Ngati Apa cultural redress package will include a mixture of standard and unique redress to focus on the cultural revitalisation and reconnection to their lands that had been lost as a result of Crown acts and omissions.”

“A unique feature of this particular Deed of Settlement is the gifting of 5 papakainga properties to Ngati Apa. This has never been done before in a treaty settlement and Ngati Apa should be commended for the foresight in their request.”

As with all recent settlements, the Ngati Apa Deed of Settlement is made up of three key components: the historical account and Crown acknowledgements and apology; cultural redress and financial and commercial redress.

The initialled Deed of Settlement will now be taken back to iwi members of Ngati Apa for ratification.
