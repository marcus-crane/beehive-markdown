New fishing rules to protect New Zealand's threatened Hector's and Maui's dolphins will come into force for recreational and commercial fishers tomorrow (Wednesday 1 October 2008), Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton said today.

The new rules are a variety of regional bans and other restrictions on set netting, trawling and drift netting in coastal waters.

Set netting will now be banned around much of the South Island's coast, with new trawl restrictions close to shore on the east and south coasts. On the upper North Island's west coast existing set net bans will be extended, and there will be new trawling and drift netting bans.

Fishers should check the rules for the place where they fish-before they go fishing, by calling their nearest Ministry of Fisheries office or visiting www.fish.govt.nz

Jim Anderton said Hector's and Maui's dolphins were among the world's rarest, they are found only in New Zealand waters and their survival was up to us.

It's estimated that there are fewer than 8,000 of the Hector's dolphin species left, mostly around the South Island. The North Island Maui's dolphin sub-species is estimated to number only around 111 dolphins, and is classified as "nationally critical" by the Department of Conservation.

"I understand the concerns of those whose livelihoods and recreation will be affected, but these rules were not the most severe of the options proposed and they strike the best achievable balance between fishing activity and the protection of an iconic species."

The Ministry of Fisheries budget has been increased by $6 million over the next three years to place observers on commercial fishing vessels, including those in the areas where the dolphins live. These costs will be recovered from the industry through levies.

The variety of new regional bans and other restrictions on set netting, drift netting and trawling apply on the:  
• North Island west coast-from Maunganui Bluff north of Kaipara Harbour to Pariokariwa Point north of New Plymouth  
• South Island east coast-from Cape Jackson in the Marlborough Sounds to Slope Point in the Catlins  
• South Island south coast-from Slope Point in the Catlins to Sand Hill Point east of Fiordland  
• South Island west coast-from Farewell Spit Lighthouse in the north to Awarua Point north of Fiordland.

On 26 September the Wellington High Court ruled that some of the measures for commercial fishing cannot go ahead on 1 October as scheduled. This ruling applies to some areas on the North Island's west coast, the east coast of Marlborough and around Te Waiwai Bay on the South Island's south coast.

Jim Anderton said that while some bans could not be implemented in some areas, most bans would come into force as scheduled, including all measures for recreational fishing.

"Fishers must check the rules before they go fishing."

The Ministry of Fisheries will treat any breach of the new regulations on a case-by-case basis. Penalties range from a verbal warning to a fine of up to $20,000 for recreational fishers or up to $100,000 for commercial fishers, and forfeiture of vessels and fishing gear used in the offence.

The new fishing rules will sit alongside four new marine mammal sanctuaries announced by Conservation Minister Steve Chadwick.

For more detail on the prohibitions and new rules as well as those areas that will not go ahead at this time due to court action, please visit the Ministry of Fisheries website www.fish.govt.nz.
