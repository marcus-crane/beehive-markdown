The government is already committed to the priorities outlined in a document released by the tourism industry today, said Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor.

The [Tourism Industry Election Manifesto](https://secure.tianz.org.nz/manifesto/index.html "Link to manifesto text on TIANZ website"), was presented to the Minister this morning at Parliament by Tourism Industry Association Chief Executive Tim Cossar. It outlines tourism’s top six priorities for an incoming government in the next three years.

Mr O’Connor said the document highlights a lot of what the government is already doing or has already committed to doing.

“The government absolutely **recognises tourism** as a bedrock of New Zealand’s economy and we know we need to continue to promote New Zealand overseas. This is why we have boosted Tourism New Zealand funding significantly since 1999 and poured funding into various targeted campaigns offshore,” said Mr O’Connor.

“It is essential we continue to deliver on our [100% Pure New Zealand](http://www.tourismnewzealand.com/tourism_info/about-us/100-pure-campaign/100-pure-campaign_home.cfm) brand and the government has committed significant money in doing so. I recognise that it is a more challenging market at present and to keep up with our competitors we must continue to offer an authentic, world-class product and deliver on our world famous brand.”

“The government also recognises that **investing in vital infrastructure** is a high priority, not only for the benefit of the tourism industry, but for New Zealand as a whole. Over the next 10 years the government is forecast to invest about $30 billion in land transport infrastructure.

“We also recognise that in order to compete with other markets we must improve on our **environmental performance** to deliver on our world famous 100% Pure New Zealand brand. That’s why we are funding various environmental initiatives such as the promotion of the new Qualmark Green criteria to international and domestic visitors, and investing in new recycling bins at tourism hotspots around New Zealand.

“Investing in **training and work skills** initiatives is a must if the tourism sector is to keep up with competing markets worldwide. We must be a step ahead. That’s why government recently committed an extra $2.83 million over the next year for the implementation of the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015. The money will help contribute to a number of tourism workforce initiatives to boost the skills of staff within the industry to ensure we are providing visitors with the high quality experience they expect.

“Ensuring we maximise the return from **major events** in New Zealand such as the Rugby World Cup 2011 is also a top priority for the government. New Zealand has been host to a number of major events already which we can learn from, such as the Lions' rugby tour which brought well over 20,000 extra visitors to New Zealand, spending an estimated $130 million during their time here.

“**Extra funding** for the tourism industry will be inevitable in the future to ensure New Zealand tourism continues to prosper and we continue to deliver on our 100% Pure brand. The government has committed substantial funding into the industry thus far and will continue to do so.

“I welcome this forward thinking, positive outlook from the tourism industry and can assure them that industry policy objectives are shared by the Labour-led government,” said Mr O’Connor.
