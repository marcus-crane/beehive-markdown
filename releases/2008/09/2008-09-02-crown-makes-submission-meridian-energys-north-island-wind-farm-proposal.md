The Crown has made a submission on Meridian Energy’s wind farm proposal in the Central North Island, Environment Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

Since changes were made to the Resource Management Act in 2005, the Crown has been able to make a submission on an application for a resource consent that the minister considers to be of national significance. This allows the government to have input into local decision-making processes, while leaving the decision and hearings to be made locally.

"It is important that those making decisions under the Resource Management Act on renewable energy projects such as [Meridian Energy’s ‘Central Wind’](http://www.meridianenergy.co.nz/OurProjects/Project+Central+Wind/) have information on the national energy implications and effects of the proposal," Trevor Mallard said.

"The submission recognises the importance of renewable, low-carbon, energy generation and security of supply, and covers wind energy potential.

"It also recognises the contribution of the proposal to the government’s energy and climate change policy objectives.

"Additionally, the submission includes conditions that the Crown considers necessary to address the local environmental effects of the proposal on Crown conservation land," Trevor Mallard said.

This is the third time the Crown has made a submission on an application for resource consent since the 2005 amendments. The other submissions were on [Meridian’s Project Hayes](http://www.meridianenergy.co.nz/OurProjects/ProjectHayes/default.htm) and Trustpower’s [Mahinerangi wind farm](http://www.trustpower.co.nz/Content/Generation/WindFarms/Mahinerangi.aspx)s in Central Otago.

"I have every faith that ordinary Resource Management Act processes and local decision makers can deal with the environmental effects and any community concerns raised by the ‘Central Wind’ proposal," Trevor Mallard said.
