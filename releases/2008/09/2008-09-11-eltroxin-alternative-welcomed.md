The Minister of Health, David Cunliffe today welcomed the decision taken by Pharmac and Medsafe to fast track any alternatives to the thyroid medicine Eltroxin.

"I am pleased that this proactive response by two government agencies could deliver this funded alternative to Eltroxin by late October".

"It is encouraging that these agencies have take on board the growing concern that I had about the level of the adverse reactions after a new formulation of Eltroxin was introduced on to the New Zealand market last July," said Mr Cunliffe.

The Minister noted that 99 per cent of Eltroxin users in New Zealand still are not reporting any side effect but he said even a one percent adverse reaction rate was a worry.

"I am pleased that we now have a way forward and that Thyroid patients have an answer to their concerns."
