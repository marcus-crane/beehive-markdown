The Te Roroa Claims Settlement Bill was enacted by Parliament today. 

Representatives of Te Roroa were in Parliament to witness the passage of the legislation.

The Act is the final stage in the settlement of Te Roroa’s historical Treaty of Waitangi claims. It enables the transfer of settlement redress agreed in the 2005 Deed of Settlement.

The settlement package contains a formal Crown apology, cultural and commercial redress, and a financial package of $9.5 million.

The Act strengthens the relationship between the Crown and Te Roroa and it also enables Te Roroa to have increased input into the protection of the Waipoua Forest – home to Tane Mahuta, New Zealand’s largest living kauri tree.

Minister in Charge of Treaty Negotiations Minister Hon Dr Michael Cullen welcomed the passing into law of the Act.

"This is an important milestone in addressing historical Treaty grievances in the Northland area and represents closure on one of the longest Treaty negotiations," he said.

"Today's milestone is part of a growing momentum to address historic Treaty grievances, which should be welcomed by all New Zealanders."

“While the Crown could not possibly fully compensate Te Roroa for all they have lost, I believe this settlement will contribute significantly towards a sustainable future for Te Roroa,” Dr Cullen said.
