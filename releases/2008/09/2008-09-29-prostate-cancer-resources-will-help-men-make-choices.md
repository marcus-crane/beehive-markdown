New resources going out to GPs and medical practices will provide better information to help men decide if they want to be tested for prostate cancer, said Associate Minister of Health Damien O'Connor.

Mr O'Connor said the resources - an information pamphlet for men and their families and resource cards for doctors to show their patients, will allow men to make informed decisions about their health.

"Prostate cancer is an important, complex health issue for men. Men and their families deserve to get the best possible advice to make choices about whether to be tested for prostate cancer. These resources will help men do just that.

"Men need to be able to have access to clear, concise and relevant information to be able to make decisions on testing," said Mr O'Connor.

The resource card for health professionals highlights those potentially at risk, provides information on the benefits and harms of prostate testing and facts on the Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test.

The pamphlet for men and their families includes similar information as well as providing contact numbers and links to useful websites if men want to find out more or speak to someone about prostate testing.

Mr O'Connor said the Labour-led government is committed to men's health and the new prostate cancer guidelines were part of a $3 million package over the next year for men's health initiatives.

"We have also announced that we are fast-tracking a bowel cancer screening programme, in an effort to better diagnose and treat New Zealand's second-biggest cancer killer. This is important for men as they have a substantially higher mortality rate for colorectal cancer than women," said Mr O'Connor.
