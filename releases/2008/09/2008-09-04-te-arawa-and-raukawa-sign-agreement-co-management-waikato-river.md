“I am pleased to see that the Crown has finally reached a co-management agreement with three iwi who have interests in the Waikato River” said Associate Minister of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Mita Ririnui at the signing between the Crown, Te Arawa and Raukawa.

The signing held today in Parliament buildings is an agreement between Te Arawa and Raukawa to participate in the co-management of the Waikato River.

“This agreement focuses on the health and well-being of Waikato River and is instrumental in ensuring its restoration to the pristine quality it deserves.”

Waikato-Tainui iwi signed their Deed of Settlement of their Waikato River Claim a fortnight ago to establish a co-management strategy with the Crown, Environment Waikato and the Waikato District Council to improve the river’s water quality and health.

Te Arawa and Raukawa have now agreed to participate in the co-management of the Waikato River in acknowledgement of their interests in the river.

“All three iwi have displayed their kaitiakitanga over the river in their agreement to co-manage and should be commended for their unselfish attitude towards their interests.”

“We are witnessing more and more often the participation and co-operation between iwi throughout the country who are willing to set aside their own interests for the benefit of Te Ao Maori.”
