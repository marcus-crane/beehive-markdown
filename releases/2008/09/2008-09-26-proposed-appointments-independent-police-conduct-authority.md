A majority in the House of Representatives today voted to recommend that the Governor-General appoint Allan Galbraith, and Mel Smith, to the Independent Police Conduct Authority. 

"New appointments will mark the completion of another recommendation of the 2007 report of the Commission of Inquiry into Police Conduct," said Associate Justice Minister Rick Barker.

"The Commission recommended that membership of the Independent Police Conduct Authority be increased from three to five persons.

"The Commission's report noted that a five-person Authority would enable a broader range of representation from outside the legal profession, and strengthen public confidence in the independence of the Authority."

Mr Galbraith is currently the Investigations Manager of the Independent Police Conduct Authority and prior to this was a member of the New Zealand Police for 37 years.

Mr Smith has held various senior state sector positions, and was an Ombudsman from 2001 to 2005.  In late 2007 Mr Smith completed a further 6 month term as an in which he delivered his report into his investigation of the criminal justice sector.

"Mr Galbraith and Mr Smith will bring with them a wide range of skills and a wealth of experience in the public and justice sectors, and the public can have every confidence that the Authority is well-placed to continue with its implementation of the Commission of Inquiry's recommendations," Mr Barker said.
