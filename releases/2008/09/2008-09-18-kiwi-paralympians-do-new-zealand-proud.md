Sport and Recreation Minister Clayton Cosgrove has congratulated the New Zealand team for an outstanding effort at the Beijing 2008 Paralympic Games.

The New Zealand team has finished a highly successful campaign winning 12 medals overall; five gold, three silver and four bronze medals. There were 27 top- eight placings across six sports, and kiwis also set three new world records among their gold medal finishes. 

“I am immensely proud of the performances put up by our athletes.  The high medal tally and three world records is a superb effort.

“In addition to those who gained medals, the entire New Zealand team performed with guts and determination and we can be proud as a nation of all their efforts,” Mr Cosgrove said.

Mr Cosgrove said while it was a truly team performance with athletes and support staff contributing, he felt compelled to single out two individuals.

“Christchurch 15-year-old swimmer Sophie Pascoe who won three golds and a silver medal, and Wellington cyclist Paula Tesoriero who claimed a gold and two bronzes were magnificent.  Their achievements rank along with other great results in what has been a stellar year for New Zealand sport to date,” Mr Cosgrove said.

Mr Cosgrove also congratulated Paralympics New Zealand for the comprehensive planning and support provided to the athletes.  Paralympics New Zealand is the national sport organisation that, in addition to supporting the team athletes and officials, encourages opportunities for people with disabilities to participate in sports.

The government invested $4.5 million in [Paralympics New Zealand](http://www.paralympics.org.nz/) in the four years leading up to this year’s competition in Beijing.
