This year's New Zealand Community Safety and Injury Prevention Award winners are a great example of the difference we can all make to reduce injury and fatality rates, says ACC Minister Maryan Street.

The awards were held in Wellington this evening and were attended by the 20 awards finalists along with Maryan Street, ACC's chief executive, Dr Jan White, and Dr Carolyn Coggan, the awards' chief judge and director of the Safe Communities Foundation NZ.

"This is the fourth year the awards have run. They recognise, highlight and congratulate the extraordinary work that's going on around New Zealand to make our communities safer and better places to live, work and play," Maryan Street said.

"Too often safety and injury prevention initiatives in the community don't get the recognition they deserve. So it's great to have the opportunity to celebrate the multitude of successes and sing the praises of the people who carry out the hard work usually on not much more than passion," the minister said.

"I am extremely impressed with the number and calibre of entries this year. Attracting 51 entries from across the country is fantastic and sets a new record for the awards," said Dr Carolyn Coggan.

"Once again it shows the depth of energy and passion New Zealanders have for improving the safety of their communities and the people who live within them," she said.

The winners of this year's New Zealand Community Safety and Injury Prevention Awards are:

Category One: Emerging community safety and/or injury prevention initiative or programme.

Winner: 'Blow the Whistle on Violence' campaign, Tauranga Safe City and partners. The campaign ran during the Rugby World Cup targeting the link between major sports events and domestic violence.

Highly Commended: The Stratford TET Home Safety Project, Central Taranaki Victim Support Group and partners.

Category Three: Outstanding example of the New Zealand Injury Prevention Strategy framework guiding the development of a community safety and/or injury prevention initiative or programme.

Category Four: Outstanding business or organisation that is contributing to the greater well-being of its own workforce and the community in general.

This includes being part of the group that won Tauranga's WHO Safe Community designation

This year the judging panel also highly commended two individuals whose work, passion and commitment has made an enormous contribution to the safety of their communities.

George Stephens, Counties Manukau Fire Safety Officer. A New Zealand Fire Service Veteran of 36 years, George Stephens has spent the past 13 years educating his South Auckland community about how to avoid house fires, and how to survive them.

Kim Anderson, for the Safety and Beautification of Smeaton Drive. When Kim Anderson moved to Whangarei's Smeaton Drive, the area was crime and graffiti-ridden, run-down. But with grit and determination - and several pots of paint - she has united her community, got children off the streets, wiped out graffiti and reinvigorated this forgotten suburb.
