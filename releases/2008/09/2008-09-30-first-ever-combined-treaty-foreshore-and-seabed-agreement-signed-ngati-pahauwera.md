Attorney-General and Treaty Negotiations Minister Michael Cullen has welcomed the signing of a unique Agreement in Principle between the Crown and Ngāti Pahauwera earlier today.

The Ngāti Pahauwera Agreement in Principle is the first ever Agreement in Principle to deal with both historical Treaty claims and foreshore and seabed recognition.

Ngāti Pahauwera is a confederation of hapū centred on the Mōhaka River in the northern Hawkes Bay.

Dr Cullen and Minister of Māori Affairs Parekura Horomia signed the Agreement in Principle on behalf of the Crown with Trustees of the newly established Ngāti Pahauwera governance entity in Wellington this afternoon.

"This Agreement in Principle sets out the framework for a comprehensive settlement that the Crown and Ngāti Pahauwera can be proud of. Furthermore these negotiations have enabled the Crown and Ngāti Pahauwera to enhance the relationship formalised when the Terms of Negotiation were signed in May," said Dr Cullen.

The Crown and Ngāti Pahauwera are now looking forward to the next milestone, which is agreeing and ratifying a Deed of Settlement.
