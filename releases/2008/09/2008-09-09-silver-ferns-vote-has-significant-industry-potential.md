The vote by Silver Fern farmers to form a partnership with PGG Wrightsons has the potential to lead to increased sustainable returns throughout the value chain, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said today. 

Jim Anderton said it was clear from the amount of public discussion surrounding this proposal that farmers had put a lot of thought into the proposed benefits of this partnership.

“The high turnout for the vote (83.3 percent of eligible voters) also shows the importance that farmers have placed on this proposal.

“Ultimately, Silver Ferns Farms’ farmers have judged the proposal to be in their commercial interests and in the interests of the New Zealand meat industry, with over 75 percent voting in favour.

Jim Anderton said the proposal was premised on creating more value throughout the supply chain. This would be done by creating an integrated supply chain - “from pasture to plate”.

The proposal will also provide additional capital to invest into processing, technology and market development.

“More generally, whatever the structural form and commercial strategies that the New Zealand meat industry pursues, the industry needs to work towards growing the pie and increasing the returns from the great product that they produce.”
