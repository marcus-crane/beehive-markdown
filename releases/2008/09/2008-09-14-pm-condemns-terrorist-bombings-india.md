Prime Minister Helen Clark today condemns the series of bombings which has killed twenty people and injured more than ninety in central India’s capital city, New Delhi.

Five bombs exploded in three market areas and a further two were defused. An extremist group, Indian Mujahideen, has claimed responsibility for the blasts. The group is also believed to be behind the series of bomb blasts in Ahmedabad in July and in Jaipur in May this year.

"The actions of these extremists are all the more cowardly, coming in a busy week ahead of both Hindu and Muslim festivals," Helen Clark said today.

“I will be writing to India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to express New Zealand's great sadness at these events.

“New Zealand’s Governor-General Hon Anand Satyanand and Mrs Satyanand are currently in India, on the last day of a six day state [visit](http://www.gg.govt.nz/media/news.asp?type=current&ID=233). This has been the first such visit by a New Zealand Governor-General to India.

“I have asked the Governor-General to convey the condolences of the Government and people of New Zealand.

"Our Governor-General's visit has underlined the strong bonds between India and New Zealand. We extend our sympathy to India at this sad time.

“The New Zealand High Commission in New Delhi is liaising with Indian authorities. At this stage it is not believed that any New Zealanders were injured in the bombings,” Helen Clark said.

Current advice in the [travel advisory](http://www.safetravel.govt.nz/destinations/india.shtml) tells New Zealanders in India to maintain a high level of vigilance in respect of their personal security.
