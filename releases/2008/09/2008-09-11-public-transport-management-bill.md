Transport Minister Annette King says the passage of the Public Transport Management Bill will enable Regional Councils to improve New Zealand’s public transport system. The Bill passed its third reading in Parliament today.

Ms King says the Bill empowers regional councils to impose greater controls over commercial public transport services, and also enables regional councils to require that any or all public transport services must be provided under contract.

“If we want New Zealanders to move towards more sustainable transport, we must create a public transport system that is a realistic alternative to private car use. It is therefore essential that New Zealand’s public transport services are affordable, integrated and accessible, safe, responsive to change and – above all – economically, socially and environmentally sustainable.” Ms King said.

“This Bill does not tell regional councils how to run their public transport systems; it simply gives them the tools to run them as effectively as possible, and better plan for and manage future public transport demands.

“The framework is now in place to enable travel on public transport to become much simpler, and passengers can expect a more consistent level of service.”

Regional councils will be able to set longer notice periods for commercial public transport providers in commencing, varying and withdrawing services, she said. Councils will also have greater access to information, like detailed patronage statistics, to enable more effective planning of public transport and development of regional public transport plans.

“Regional councils will be able to set quality and performance standards, enable the integration of services, ticketing and fares, and where justified, require bundling of services.

“I’m delighted to have this Bill pass its third reading and I look forward to ongoing improvement of public transport services in New Zealand.”
