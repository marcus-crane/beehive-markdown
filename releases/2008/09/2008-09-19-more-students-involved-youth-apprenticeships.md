Minister of Education Chris Carter today announced that another 56 schools will be offering students the *Youth Apprenticeships Scheme* next year.

Extending the apprenticeship scheme to all schools by 2011 is a key component of [*Schools Plus* programme that the Prime Minister outlined today](/release/investing+young+people+boost+achievement).

Today the government also released the *Schools Plus* key findings, which summarise the feedback received during two months of discussion in April and May.

Mr Carter said the government received from submitters clear messages about how best to lift participation in education and improve outcomes for all students. 

“Young people told us they want better and more in-depth careers education, increased flexibility in how they learn, a wider choice of subjects and experience, and more practical learning.

“Other contributors mentioned the need for more parental involvement in education, closer partnerships between secondary and tertiary educators, and improved work readiness for school leavers.

Mr Carter said the [*Youth Apprenticeships Scheme*](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/educationSectors/Schools/SchoolOperations/Resourcing/OtherFundingProgrammes/YouthApprenticeships.aspx) is an effective way to bring the worlds of work and school closer by building clear industry-related pathways so that students can move through school to a career in industry.

“Offering students a course of study directly relevant to their career aspirations is seen as key to keeping young people engaged in learning.”

The *Youth Apprenticeships Scheme* started as a pilot in 10 schools and has been very successful.  Next year 120 schools will offer the scheme with a further 100 schools taking part in 2010. By 2011 *Youth Apprenticeships* will be available to all secondary schools across New Zealand.

“Schools involved in the scheme to date say it is resulting in greater student participation and motivation.

 “These are excellent outcomes for young people and for the country as a whole,” said Chris Carter.
