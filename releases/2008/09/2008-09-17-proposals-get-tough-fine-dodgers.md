Getting tough on people who don’t pay their fines is the message from a package of proposals announced today. These measures are in addition to the [collection of fines at airports](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/record+year+collection+fines+airports), and the [pay or stay](http://www.payorstay.govt.nz/) campaigns run by the Ministry of Justice.

"Proposals will be progressively introduced that will make it more difficult to avoid payment" said Courts Minister Rick Barker.

New measures proposed include suspending drivers’ licences for those with overdue vehicle-related fines, and allowing the Court to seize vehicles that are heavily financed or are of low value.

"Vehicle owners will be made responsible for fines incurred in their vehicle regardless of who was driving," said Mr Barker.

People will be automatically referred back to the courts when fines get to a certain threshold. This will allow a judge to take action to ensure offenders are penalised appropriately and fines do not get to unaffordable levels.

"Currently people seem to think that fines are ‘soft credit’ and they put other priorities ahead of getting them resolved. This is what we intend to change," said Mr Barker.

This proposal has been agreed in principle to allow the release of information about overdue fines and reparation to credit agencies.

The Ministry of Justice will work closely with the Privacy Commissioner to determine the best way to progress these proposals.

Under these proposals priority will also be given to fines and reparations in cases where the creditor had the ability to know the person’s debts before extending credit.

"If you knew your fines might affect your ability to put a new TV on hire purchase, you might be more likely to call up the court and make an arrangement to pay" said Mr Barker.

"To avoid all these measures, people just need contact the Court to pay, request to enter into a time to pay arrangement or request to have their circumstances considered by a judge. Avoidance is not an option."

Other changes will see offenders whose sentence could have been influenced by offering to pay reparation,  who have then failed to do so, brought back to court for the judge to reconsider sentencing.

These moves follow a review of the current infringement system and are designed to address the 2.7 million infringements issued last year and the outstanding fines.

It is proposed that these measures be included in a Courts and Criminal Matters Bill that the government would look to introduce sometime next year.

Minister Barker said he was again pleased by the level of [collaboration](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/joint+operations+net+over+1m+unpaid+fines) between the Transport agencies, NZ Police and Ministry of Justice.

People can contact their local District Court or ring 0800 4 FINES to resolve any outstanding fines or reparation.
