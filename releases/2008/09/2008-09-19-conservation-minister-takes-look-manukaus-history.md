Conservation Minister Steve Chadwick learnt more about the history of Manukau when she visited the city’s newest historic reserve today.

The Minister used the opportunity to express her thanks to all those involved in securing the land for present and future generations to enjoy.

The 43 hectare reserve was officially announced by the Minister in July.  It includes the Matukuturua Stonefields, which make up a significant portion of the 5 per cent of stonefields remaining in the Auckland region, and the remains of the volcanic cone Matukutureia (McLaughlin’s Mountain).

“This is a great example of government, councils, business and iwi working together to protect a vital part of our history,” Steve Chadwick said.

“A number of parties were involved in the creation of the new reserve, including the Department of Conservation, Winstone Aggregates (a division of Fletcher Concrete and Infrastructure Ltd), the Manukau City Council, and Ngati te Ata and other iwi, including Te Akitai.

"Protecting the Stonefields and volcanic cone for future generations is extremely important for New Zealanders. Being able to safeguard these taonga is part of the government’s aim to protect places that represent important aspects of New Zealand’s history and character.

"Sites like Matukuturua play a vital part in developing our understanding of the way early Maori used the land, and help explain the first centuries of Auckland’s settlement,” she said.

The Minister also recognised the reserve for the part it plays in securing more open space and recreation areas in what is one of New Zealand’s most rapidly growing urban areas. The new reserve is adjacent to Manukau City’s Puhinui reserve, which runs down to the Manukau Harbour shoreline.

The Department of Conservation is currently holding discussions with the Manukau City Council and Ngati te Ata and Te Akitai to discuss opportunities, aspirations and options for the future management of the reserve.
