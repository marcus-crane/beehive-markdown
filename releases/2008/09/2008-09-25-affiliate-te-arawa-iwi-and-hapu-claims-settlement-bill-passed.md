The Affiliate Te Arawa Iwi and Hapū Claims Settlement Bill completed its third reading today, Treaty Negotiations Minister Michael Cullen announced.

The Act provides for quantum of $38.6 million, and the transfer of 19 areas of Crown-owned land of special significance, including the land under 6 Rotorua schools and the Ngatamariki geothermal assets, to Te Pumautanga o Te Arawa.

The leadership of the Affiliate Te Arawa Iwi and Hapū has played a major role in working with other Central North Island Iwi to support the Central North Island Forests Iwi Collective settlement. “Te Pumautanga o Te Arawa has made a significant compromise by passing the final decisions about most of its forestry redress over to what will be the largest forestry collective in the country,” Dr Cullen said.

“This settlement can be celebrated as a well tested, robust and sustainable deal, negotiated with humility and consideration for the Affiliate’s neighbouring iwi.”

This is a historic day in Treaty Settlement and parliamentary history, with three settlement bills being enacted and new bills for two significant settlements being introduced.
