Prime Minister Helen Clark and Courts Minister Rick Barker today announced that the Labour-Led Government is committing more than $10 million for a major expansion and refurbishment of the Nelson courthouse.

"This is a major project for the Nelson area and is part of the government's significant investment in the Courts system, with five new courthouses built, 28 refurbishments, and more in planning stages," Helen Clark said.

"This project in Nelson will double the courthouse's floor area with the addition of two new courtrooms to the existing three courtrooms. Space for the court's administration and public waiting areas will increase, and there will be three additional judicial chambers.

"As well as being bigger, the refurbished courthouse will have advanced security systems, and be capable of supporting the latest technology, including video conferencing and evidence recording services.

"Environmentally sustainable design practices will be incorporated into the concept for the courthouse wherever possible," Helen Clark said.

Rick Barker said the refurbished Nelson Courthouse is designed to meet the future needs of the local community.

"The expansion and refurbishment of the existing courthouse will include extensions on the current Bridge Street site.

"Tenders for the main contract work will be called for before construction on the expansion and refurbishment begins in March 2009. Work is expected to be completed by late 2010," Rick Barker said.

Labour MP Maryan Street, who lives in Nelson, welcomed the announcement.

"The local courthouse is a point of civic pride for all communities and Nelson is no exception. I'm sure this funding and the consequent refurbishment will be welcomed by the Nelson community which has been looking forward to making progress on this issue," Maryan Street said.
