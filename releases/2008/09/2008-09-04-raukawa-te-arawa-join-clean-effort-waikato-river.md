The Crown today signed an agreement with Raukawa and Te Arawa to provide for the co-management of the Waikato River.

“The agreement between the Raukawa, Te Arawa and the Crown on a co-management framework for the Upper Waikato River is a major step toward ensuring the environmentally sustainable management of the river for all New Zealanders,” Treaty Negotiations Minister, Michael Cullen, said today.

“Te Arawa and Raukawa, along with other river iwi, will become an integral part of the governance and management framework for the river. The agreement will ensure the clean up of the river moves quickly, engages all stakeholders and considers iwi interests adequately for the first time,” Dr Cullen said.

Raukawa and Te Arawa were first brought into the governance arrangements for the river when they became members of the Guardians Establishment Committee established earlier this year to determine a Vision and Strategy for the river. The

The work of this committee is reflected, and built upon, within this agreement.

“The spirit with which Raukawa and Te Arawa have engaged with the Crown to develop a framework that will clean up and manage the Waikato River for future generations is a very positive sign for both the river and our nation.”

“Negotiations on this agreement began earlier this year and have moved at a fast pace to reach the agreement today,” Dr Cullen said.
