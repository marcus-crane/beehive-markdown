The legacy of Sir Edmund Hillary’s work to build ties between New Zealand, India and Nepal will be commemorated through a fellowship in his name, Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today.

"The Sir Edmund Hillary Fellowship will enable people from India or Nepal who have the potential to become leaders or have influence in parliamentary, academic, business, cultural, or other fields to visit New Zealand," Helen Clark said.

"We believe Sir Edmund would be honoured that this new Fellowship will allow people from India and Nepal to get to know New Zealand better.

"One visit under the Fellowship will take place to New Zealand each year and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade will oversee the selection of the fellows.

"Sir Edmund is an important figure in the history of New Zealand’s relationship with India and Nepal.

"He served as New Zealand’s High Commissioner to India in the 1980s. Earlier this year, India posthumously awarded Sir Edmund Hillary the Padma Vibhushan award, one of its highest civilian honours.

"The announcement of the fellowship coincides with the first state visit to India by the Governor-General Hon Anand Satyanand and Mrs Susan Satyanand.

"His Excellency will convey the news of this fellowship when he meets the President and Prime Minister of India in New Delhi today. (Note eds: approx 2.00am 10 September NZ time)

"Lady Hillary has been consulted about the fellowship and agreed to the naming of it in Sir Edmund’s name," Helen Clark said.
