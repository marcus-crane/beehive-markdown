A Rule proposing a ban on the use of hand-held mobile phones while driving a vehicle has been released to public consultation, Transport Safety Minister Harry Duynhoven announced today.

The Road User Amendment Rule contains a proposed amendment to ban the use of hand-held phones, Blackberry devices and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) while driving.

“In June, the Government agreed to [consider an amendment Rule](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/hand-held+phone+ban+vehicle+drivers+considered) in order to ban the use of mobile phones while driving. Drivers would still be able to use hands-free devices and two-way radio under the proposed law change,” Mr Duynhoven said.

“Mobile phone technology and the culture around their use has moved on significantly since 2004, when the Government first looked at banning cellphones while driving.

“The number of reported crashes involving the use of mobile phones has more than doubled over the last six years, with research showing that using a mobile phone while driving increases the risk of being involved in a crash by up to four times,” Mr Duynhoven said.

Between 2002 and 2007 there were 411 injury crashes and 26 fatal crashes where the use of mobile phones or other telecommunication devices was identified as a contributing factor.

“In a car, [mobile phone distraction](http://www.landtransport.govt.nz/research/reports/349.pdf) is part of a much bigger driver distraction issue. In 2006 driver distraction was identified as a contributing factor in 11 percent of all crashes, with a total social cost of $300 million.”

While awareness campaigns will continue to focus on the wider issue of [driver distraction](http://www.ltsa.govt.nz/road-user-safety/driver-distraction/index.html), the Government’s decision to consider a ban on cellphone use recognised the unique nature of mobile phone distraction.

The NZ Transport Agency has today released the Rule for public consultation. The Rule contains a number of other proposed transport Rule changes. To view the Rule or have your say visit www.nzta.govt.nz/consultation/road-user-amendment/index.html.
