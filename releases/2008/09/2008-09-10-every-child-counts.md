"The release of the top ten policy priorities for children by ['Every Child Counts](http://www.everychildcounts.org.nz/)' is a timely reminder of the importance of [placing children at the centre of good policy](http://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/publications-resources/corporate/statement-of-intent/2008/outcome-one-children-and-young-people.html)," says Social Development & Employment Minister Ruth Dyson.

“Every Child Counts has carefully considered potential policies from the perspective of New Zealand’s children.

“Policies such as supporting quality early childhood education, extending paid parental leave provisions and reducing child poverty have been central to government activities.

“We know that there is still further to go, and we are committed to continuing in this direction. We therefore applaud the contribution of groups such as Every Child Counts in setting out their future aspirations in these areas.

“We are also firmly committed to the idea of having regular and transparent indicators of children’s health and social wellbeing.

Earlier in the year we [welcomed research](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/government+policies+reduce+poverty) that indicated that 130,000 children have been lifted out of poverty as a result of increasing employment, Working for Families, income-related rents and other government policies.

A further report "Children and Young People – Indicators of Wellbeing in New Zealand 2008" will be released in full shortly. It confirms that the position of children in New Zealand has improved across a wide range of indicators.

"Since 1988 infant mortality has halved and immunisation levels have significantly improved," said Ms Dyson.

"The Children and Young People Report demonstrates the results of good policy," said Ms Dyson.
