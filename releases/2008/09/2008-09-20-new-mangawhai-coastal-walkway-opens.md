Conservation Minister Steve Chadwick today opened a new Coastal Walkway at Mangawhai, south of Whangarei. 

The track is eight kilometres long with stunning views of the northern Hauraki Gulf. It begins with a beach walk, has three kilometres of cliff top track and an elaborate boardwalk through native coastal forest.

"This beautiful new walkway was made possible through the generosity of the local landowner. I thank him for making the land, and the wonderful vistas, accessible for all New Zealanders to enjoy," Steve Chadwick said.

"Mangawhai Coastal Walkway is the culmination of years of work between the Department of Conservation (DOC), the landowner and others, and it is a great example of diverse groups working together in the best interests of the wider community and improved public access."

The walkway’s biggest attraction is the number of stunning ocean vistas of the northern Hauraki Gulf, through to Bream Head and the scattered offshore islands that lie in between. It is another link in the chain that forms Te Araroa Trail – The Long Pathway. Te Araroa is a trail of linked walkways and tracks that aims to traverse New Zealand from Cape Reinga to Bluff.

"I congratulate all who were involved in creating the track. The engineering contractors, the project manager, DOC staff, iwi/hapu, the developer and the local council can be proud of the end result."

Approximately $500,000 has been spent on track upgrades by the local landowner, and close to $1,000,000 on landscaping alone.  Additional funding was used to seek archaeological advice during the track construction.

DOC is responsible for upgrading the track system as required and maintaining signage and structures in the future.
