The Labour-led government gave New Zealand’s genomics infrastructure a shot in the arm today when Research Science and Technology Minister Pete Hodgson announced funding of $40million to a consortium led by the University of Otago to further develop New Zealand’s genomics research capability. 

The funding will be used for new genomics in a broad range of areas of leading edge genetic research including medicine and health, food production and environmental protection.

“The link between scientific endeavour and a robust economy and society cannot be understated,” Pete Hodgson said.

“This funding will provide a significant and much needed step-up in genomic research. New Zealand’s genetic scientists are some of the best in the world and their work has produced many tangible results.

“Genomics research has helped the fight against diseases such as cancer, obesity and heart disease. In agriculture genomics has helped improve health, productivity and quality of animals and crops. In biosecurity genomics research plays a role in identifying pests and diseases. And research into ruminant genetics is important in reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” he said.

The $40 million over nine years will fund infrastructure including the purchase of new gene sequencing and data equipment and recruitment of technical staff.

In addition the funding will support an increase in New Zealand’s bioinformatics capability. Bioinformatics is a new field that blends biology, computer science, mathematics and statistics, providing a critical link between raw data and the genomic researcher using the data.

The new venture brings together the University of Otago, Massey University, the University of Auckland and AgResearch operating as New Zealand Genomics Limited. Wholly owned by the University of Otago the company will support all genomic research in New Zealand, both publicly funded and commercial.

Pete Hodgson said the investment signalled the government’s commitment to the RS&T sector and comes on top of $205.4 million of new funding over the next four years contained in this year’s budget. The government’s annual operating investment through the RS&T portfolio for 2008-09 is $725.7 million.
