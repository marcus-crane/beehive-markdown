The Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark and her Associate Minister Judith Tizard have welcomed the passage of the Public Lending Right for New Zealand Authors Bill through Parliament today.

"This new Act clearly establishes in law the right of eligible New Zealand authors to receive an annual payment compensating them for free access to their books in our libraries," Helen Clark and Judith Tizard said.

The Public Lending Right scheme replaces the New Zealand Authors' Fund, which has been administered by Creative New Zealand under section 31 of the Arts Council of New Zealand Toi Aotearoa Act 1994. 

The new law repeals section 31 of the old Act, disestablishing the New Zealand Authors' Fund, and establishing the Public Lending Right scheme in stand-alone legislation. The scheme will be administered by the National Library of New Zealand. 

The scheme will ensure that registered New Zealand authors receive annual payments, based on regular surveys of New Zealand libraries. 

The new law was developed after consultation with authors and with interested parties in the literary and library sector.

Helen Clark said their new scheme and the additional funding invested by the Labour-led Government will go some further way towards recognising the vital role our authors play in our cultural life.

"Many New Zealanders rely on libraries providing works by favourite, or newly discovered New Zealand authors.  Our literature is a great gift to our nation and one we should never take for granted," said Helen Clark.

Judith Tizard, who is also Minister Responsible for the National Library said our authors have provided a great service to generations of New Zealand library users.
