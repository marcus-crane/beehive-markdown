Minister of Health David Cunliffe has today announced his decision to approve a $45.7 million redevelopment of Wairau Hospital in Marlborough.

"I note Nelson Marlborough DHB has had considerable success securing public and staff support for the new facility." Mr Cunliffe said.

Mr Cunliffe said he appreciated that people have been anxious to see the redevelopment move ahead and was pleased to be able to announce his decision.

Mr Cunliffe said an independent review had concluded that the new design for the proposed Wairau Hospital development meets the ‘fit for purpose’ test through the provision of a flexible, efficient and clinically safe design that will enable modern integrated healthcare to be provided.

"It was important that we took the time to ensure that the people of Marlborough were getting a building that would meet their needs for years to come.

New Zealanders from Kaitaia to the deep-south have benefited from this government’s massive investment in hospital infrastructure.

Seven new hospitals have been built since 2000.

Eight hospital campuses have had major refurbishments or been significantly redeveloped since 2000. In addition, ten specialist facilities have been built, three redevelopment projects are almost complete and a further four major capital projects for hospital redevelopments have been approved and are underway.

"Communities will benefit for decades to come from the investment this government has made in improving health services around the country."
