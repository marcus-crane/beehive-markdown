A Bill securing public access to New Zealand's great outdoors was passed in Parliament today by an overwhelming majority.

Rural Affairs Minister Damien O'Connor said the *Walking Access Bill*, which creates a Commission to provide leadership on access issues, goes to the heart of what most New Zealanders regards as their fundamental birthright.

"The Bill builds on the legacy of public access established over the last century and a half and creates the Walking Access Commission to clarify, promote and extend walking access to lakes and waterways throughout New Zealand.

"The Bill reflects the consensus reported by the Walking Access Consultation Panel, that new walking access over private land should be achieved by negotiation and agreement.

"I am pleased to have led this issue from a time when it caused large-scale controversy and division until now, when it has passed through the House with strong support.

"An easier option would have been to shelve the issue but the challenge to persevere was accepted because of the changing pressures and circumstances facing rural New Zealand.  With quality input from a wide range of individuals a sound way forward has been achieved.

The new Commission will provide national leadership, including a national strategy, coordination of access among key stakeholders and a code of conduct for those using this access.  It will also provide impartial and robust advice; offer local and regional leadership and coordination to help local groups with access issues and mediate any disputes over walking access.

Mr O'Connor thanked members of the Ministerial Reference Group, led by his predecessor Jim Sutton, as well as the Consultation Panel and Advisory Board for the Commission - in particular John Acland who has chaired the committees.  He also thanked the Local Government and Environment Committee for their feedback on the bill, as well as all individuals and organisations who took the time to make submissions on the Bill.

"Hundreds of New Zealanders have shared their views on walking access issues over the last five years and this Bill is a significant milestone.  It is part of a wider vision for the preservation of the heritage of all New Zealanders," said Mr O'Connor.
