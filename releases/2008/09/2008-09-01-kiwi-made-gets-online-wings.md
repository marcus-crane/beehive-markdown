The Buy Kiwi Made campaign gets its online wings today with the launch of the website [getnzmade.net](http://www.getnzmade.net/) so shoppers can now find and buy Kiwi made goods online.

 

“I congratulate the independent Buy NZ Made Campaign for putting together this online network of manufacturers, retailers and shoppers,” says Sue Bradford, Government Spokesperson for Buy Kiwi Made.

 

The web portal has been half funded by the government Buy Kiwi Made campaign to provide an easy way for shoppers who want to support local business and workers and our local economy to do so.  There is no cost to shoppers to use it.

 

“The [getnzmade.net](http://www.getnzmade.net/) website is an excellent way New Zealand shoppers can be sure that they are buying genuine NZ goods that are made by fellow New Zealanders,” says Ms Bradford.  “We were pleased to support the development and promotion of this initiative and encourage manufacturers and retailers to sign-up if they haven’t already done so.”

 

“For Buy Kiwi Made to continue to succeed manufacturers and shoppers need the support of retailers and this is great tool for retailers to profile their Buy Kiwi Made business. Through the Buy Kiwi Made media campaign we have achieved a 150% increase in retailer awareness.  More than half of all retailers support the campaign and almost half actively think about whether goods are made in New Zealand when deciding what to stock.”

 

“We’ve got 1.3 million shoppers regularly thinking Kiwi made and if we can boost that even more through use of the [getnzmade.net](http://www.getnzmade.net/) website, the whole country will benefit.”
