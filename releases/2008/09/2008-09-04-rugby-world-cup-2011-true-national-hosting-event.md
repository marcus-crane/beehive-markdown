New Zealand’s bid to host [Rugby World Cup 2011](http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/destinationnewzealand/index.html) in a “stadium of four million” took a giant leap forward today with the announcement that the quarter final matches and the Bronze Final will be shared around the country, said the Rugby World Cup Minister Clayton Cosgrove.

Mr Cosgrove applauded [Rugby World Cup](http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/) Ltd’s decision today to approve the recommendation made by Rugby New Zealand 2011 Ltd, to have Wellington and Christchurch cities host two quarter-final matches each. The Bronze Final will be hosted at Eden Park in Auckland.

“In terms of hosting major global sporting events, Rugby World Cup (RWC) 2011 is like New Zealand’s ‘Olympics’. It is the third largest sporting event in the world. An event of this scale and significance offers every city and town a rare opportunity to realise a wide range of benefits across the sport and business sectors, as well as the community. *”*

“It is estimated that the RWC 2011 will generate an additional $500 million to the New Zealand economy. Hosting the quarter-finals in Wellington and Christchurch will provide a huge boost to those regions and will help ensure that the benefits to be gained from the RWC will be shared around the country. It will also be great for die-hard rugby fans to see these matches on their home turf.”

Mr Cosgrove said regardless of where the key matches are played, every city and town in New Zealand will have a part to play in RWC 2011. “There are 40 pool matches yet to be allocated and plenty of other opportunities for regions to maximise the economic, social and cultural benefits and tourism spin-offs from this event.”

Mr Cosgrove said planning had already started and regions were working to maximise the gains brought by the national spread of the Tournament’s matches. “We must work together and start thinking now about how to capitalise on what is coming our way in 2011.”

Mr Cosgrove congratulated both Wellington and Christchurch on successfully securing two quarter final matches each. He also acknowledged Hamilton’s disappointment at not securing the Bronze Final, but encouraged the city and other regions to focus on opportunities that are coming up in the pool match and team base allocations.

“Our country will be in the international spotlight in the lead up to and during RWC 2011. We’re expecting over 70,000 international supporters, media and VIPs to visit New Zealand during the Tournament and they will have lots of spare time in between rugby matches. They will be looking to visit new places, experience our kiwi hospitality and try new activities, so now is the time to make sure they come to your place.”
