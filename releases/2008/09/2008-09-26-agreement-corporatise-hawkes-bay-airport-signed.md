Transport Minister Annette King says she and Finance Minister Dr Michael Cullen have signed the heads of agreement with the Mayors of Napier City Council and Hastings District Council to corporatise Hawke's Bay Airport.

 

The agreement sets out the terms on which the airport company will be established, and will inform the drafting of the company documents and the transfer of assets to the new entity.

 

Transport Minister Annette King said the agreement marked the beginning of a new era for the region.

 

"There are numerous benefits associated with corporatising the airport, including clearer governance, limited liability and the ability to borrow for investment," Ms King said. "Corporatisation will enable the airport to be operated more efficiently, and provide more flexibility to meet the airport's future requirements."

 

The new airport is expected to be fully commercial and there is no obligation under the agreement for the shareholders to provide additional funding.

 

The airport will continue to be owned 50 percent by the Crown, 26 percent by Napier City Council and 24 percent by Hastings District Council. The new airport company board will have two directors appointed by the Crown and two appointed by the Councils jointly.

 

Hawke's Bay Airport was established in 1963 as an unincorporated joint venture between the Crown and local councils.

**Questions and Answers**

 

**What does corporatisation mean?**

Corporatisation means that a new legal entity, an airport company, is created. The ownership of the airport business will be transferred to that new company and the councils and the Crown will both be shareholders of the company. This means that central government will still retain its 50 percent stake in the airport, but as a shareholder. Corporatisation also means a change of the governance structure of the airport. A company board appointed by the councils and central government in proportion to their shareholding in the airport will be in charge of the operation of the airport.

 

**What difference will airport users see?**

Corporatisation will have no effect on the day to day running of the airport.  Some differences may be apparent over time, such as the level of investment in airport assets (the company will have greater ability than the joint venture to raise funds).

 

**Is this privatisation and does it mean Hawke's Bay airport could be sold?**

No, this is not privatisation. The airport will remain in public ownership operated by a company board appointed by the councils and central government. Councils and the Crown can decide to sell their respective shares in the airport in the future, but this will be subject to rights and conditions as set out in the agreement. 

 

**What conditions or limitations will there be on shareholders selling shares?**

Under the agreement, both the councils and the Crown will have normal pre-emptive rights; that is, they will have the first chance to buy each other's shares if they become available for purchase.  The only exception is that the Crown could transfer all or part of its shareholding as part of a Treaty settlement without triggering the councils' pre-emptive rights. The Crown and the Councils will also each have special Kiwishares which will give them the opportunity to veto sale of shares in the airport to overseas interests if they wish.  They can continue to own their Kiwishares even after they have disposed of their main shareholding.

 

**Why does the agreement mention a possible Treaty settlement?**

A local claimant group has a cultural and historical interest in land that underlies and surrounds the airport. The Waitangi Tribunal recommended in its report on the WAI 55 claim that the Crown's interest in the airport should be considered as a possible part of future settlement of the claim. The Crown has protected its ability to use its interests in the airport for a future Treaty settlement by retaining the right to transfer its shares to claimants. It has also retained a first option to repurchase land which it contributed, if it is no longer needed by the airport. Most of the airport land, however, will be leased by the airport company from the councils. 

 

**What was the role of Treaty claimants in the corporatisation process?**

Both the Crown and the councils have talked with Treaty claimants to establish what the nature of their interest is in the land and the airport business, in order to ensure that those interests are protected.

 

**What needs to be done for a runway extension to proceed?**

The board will need to assess the business case for a runway extension and also the options available to the company to raise the necessary revenue to fund an extension. If the board thinks it appropriate, they would then need to seek the approval of at least 75 percent of the shareholders because the runway extension would be a ‘major transaction' as defined in the Companies Act 1993.  In practice, this is likely to mean all the shareholders need to agree.

 

**Who will manage the government's interest and how?**

The Crown Company Monitoring Advisory Unit (CCMAU) will monitor the performance of Hawke's Bay Airport.  It is already responsible for monitoring Crown shareholdings in Christchurch, Dunedin and Invercargill airports. CCMAU will provide advice to Ministers on the performance of the airport and recommend suitable persons to sit on the board to represent government interests. The government shares in the other three corporatised airports are Christchurch (25 percent), Dunedin (50 percent) and Invercargill (45 percent).

 

**Will landing and other charges increase? Who sets these charges?**

The airport company will be responsible for setting landing and other charges.  The airport company's board will also be responsible for deciding whether charges should increase and the level of any increase. The airport company must consult its major customers when it resets its charges. 

 

**Does the airport have to make a profit? Who gets the profit?**

Under the Airport Authorities Act, any airport operated by an airport authority is required to operate as a commercial undertaking. Corporatisation doesn't change this. Profits will be reinvested into the company or distributed to shareholders as a dividend.  Any dividend will be decided by the board and will depend on a number of factors, such as the company's financial performance and expected cash flow.

 

**How will board members be selected, and what will they be paid?**

There will be four directors, two appointed jointly by the councils and two by the Crown. Remuneration of directors will be decided by the councils and CCMAU.

 

**Who will have the casting vote?**

There will be no casting vote. 

 

**Who are directors answerable to?  What duties and powers will they have?**

The board is accountable to shareholders as a group. Although appointed by different shareholders, all directors are required to place the company's interests above the interests of the party who appoints them. Their duties and powers will be those of normal company directors under the Companies Act 1993.

 

**When will their appointment be announced?**

They will be announced as soon as appointments are made.

 

**When will the corporatisation process be completed?**

Drafting the legal documents and getting approvals for land transfers, airport authority status and bylaws are expected to take several months.
