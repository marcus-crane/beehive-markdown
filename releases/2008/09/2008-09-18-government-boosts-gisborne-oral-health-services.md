Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that the Ministers of Health and Finance have approved capital funding of $1.5 million to boost and improve oral health services provided by Tairawhiti District Health Board.

The funding will pay for the refurbishment of an existing dental clinic and the purchase of three new mobile clinics.

Helen Clark also announced ongoing funding of $331,000 a year for additional staffing for the new vans and upgraded facilities.

"This funding is targeted at addressing the Tairawhiti area’s poor dental record for its children and adolescents by taking the dental clinics to people who live in isolated parts of the region.

“It is expected that the first of the two new self-drive mobile dental clinics, which have one chair each and will replace older models currently used, will come into service next year, “Helen Clark.

“By making the service more mobile and taking the dental clinics to the region’s young people, we can improve oral health a lot.

“In addition, the dental clinic to be refurbished provides services to pupils at Ilminster Intermediate and Te Wharau Primary School. “

“Today’s announcement is part of the roll out of a $100 million Labour-led Government commitment to improve community-based oral health services in New Zealand.

“I am very proud of the Labour-led Government’s commitment has made to the health of children and New Zealanders as a whole.

“Today’s announcement while exciting for Tairawhiti is part of a much bigger picture under Labour which has seen huge investments in staff, services, and infrastructure in the public health system,” Helen Clark said.
