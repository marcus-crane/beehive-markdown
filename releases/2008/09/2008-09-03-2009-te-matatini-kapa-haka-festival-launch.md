Minister Mita Ririnui attended the 2009 Te Matatini Kapa Haka Festival launch today at Parliament Buildings and expressed his great excitement at the national kapa haka festival being held in Tauranga next year.

“I am delighted that Te Matatini will be hosted by Tauranga Moana next year. Of course my home town is a beautiful place, as Im sure all the people from around the motu will discover when they come to support their favourite kapa haka group.”

Te Matatini held its first biannual festival in Rotorua in 1972 and it was here that the platform for administration and management was set.

“It is at Te Matatini that people, Maori and non-Maori alike will be able to witness cultural Maori performing arts at its best.”

“Roopu from around the motu will be competing at regional competitions through out the year to vie for a placing in the national festival and an opportunity to win bragging rights for the following 24 months.”

“I am especially pleased to see that Te Arawa has re-entered the festival as their absence has been surely missed. Te Arawa roopu have always been a force to be reckoned with in the field of Maori performing arts and their re-entry will make for an exciting festival.”

“I encourage everyone who is able to get out and support our local and national talent as well as a festival that showcases our unique culture and national identity.”
