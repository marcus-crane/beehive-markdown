A Bill to increase flexibility and efficiency in the building consent process -- the Building Amendment Bill No. 2 -- was introduced to Parliament today by Building and Construction Minister Shane Jones.

The Bill will:

o Introduce a new pre-approval system that will fast track the building consent process for homes where designs are to be replicated on a substantial scale.

These will be known as national multiple use approvals. However, councils will still need to assess site specific matters.

o Clarify the process for making variations to consented building work. This will encourage consistency by councils and reduce unnecessary costs for applicants.

o Make it optional for a building consent applicant to obtain a Project Information Memorandum (PIM) from a territorial authority.

“This Bill will help reduce unnecessary delays in the building consent process which I know causes frustration among builders," Mr Jones said.

“This and other measures I am taking will assist in increasing the supply of good quality affordable homes.”

The measures include a compliance document for modest simple homes, which brings together in a way that has not been done before, all the compliance information needed to build a simple starter home. These also include extending the list of low-risk building work that does not require a building consent.

“This Bill and other initiatives demonstrate the government has been listening and is prepared to act to help improve the supply of good quality affordable homes,” Mr Jones said.
