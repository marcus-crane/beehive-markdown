Ngati Maniapoto and the Crown today initialled an agreement that provides for co-management arrangements for the Waipa River.

“This agreement is an important further step in providing iwi engagement in the management of the Waikato River system. The Waipa is an important source of water for the lower Waikato River and has a profound impact on the effectiveness of the project to restore the health and well being of the Waikato,” Treaty Negotiations Minister Michael Cullen said.

Ngati Maniapoto has taken part in the development of a vision and a strategy for the restoration of the health and well being of the Waikato River through membership of the establishment committee of the Guardians of the Waikato River and this agreement proposes to extend the restoration projection to the Waipa, the most important tributary of the Waikato River.

“Ngati Maniapoto is one of the five iwi or groups with strong interests in the Waikato River clean up project. The Crown has concluded or will conclude agreements for participation in the co-management of the river with Waikato Tainui, Raukawa, and Te Arawa,” Dr Cullen said.

“The Maniapoto Trust Board will now take this agreement out for full consultation with their people and other interested parties,” he said.
