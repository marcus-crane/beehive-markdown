Justice Minister Annette King says a Citizens Initiated Referendum on the question --- *"should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in New Zealand?"* --- will be held between Friday 31 July 2009 and Friday 21 August 2009.

The Chief Electoral Office will run the postal referendum, the first held under the Referenda (Postal Voting) Act 2000.

The legislation requires a three week voting period for a postal referendum.

Ms King says the Referenda (Postal Voting) Act was enacted "to provide a simple and cost effective means of conducting referenda".

"The postal referendum will be held after the Chief Electoral Office has completed the conduct of the 2008 General Election. The Chief Electoral Officer has recommended to the Government that the referendum be held between 31 July and 21 August 2009, with that timing reflecting the need to finish work on the 2008 election and complete the logistics needed to run a postal referendum."
