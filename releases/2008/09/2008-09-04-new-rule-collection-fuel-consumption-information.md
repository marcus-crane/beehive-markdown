Transport Safety Minister Harry Duynhoven today announced the signing of a new land transport rule to improve the quality of fuel consumption information for imported vehicles.

The *Land Transport Rule: Fuel Consumption Information 2008* provides the legal basis for the collection of fuel consumption data, which vehicle inspectors will be required to check when certifying vehicles for entry into New Zealand.

 

Fuel consumption information for imported vehicles can be derived from any one of four recognised international test standards from the United Kingdom, Australia, United States or Japan.  At present, the standards or technical requirements used to obtain a vehicle’s fuel consumption information are not always provided when the vehicle is first registered in New Zealand. This means there is a risk that inaccurate or unreliable information can be recorded on the Motor Vehicle Register.

 

The *Fuel Consumption Information Rule* will require importers of light vehicles to provide accurate and reliable fuel consumption information. It will clarify the legal requirements around the process of collecting the information and will provide the power to correct erroneous fuel consumption figures.

 

 “This rule will help to provide the accurate and reliable information on vehicle fuel economy and fuel consumption that New Zealand needs to assist in addressing climate change and to improve energy efficiency and conservation,” said Mr Duynhoven.

 

The rule will apply to light vehicles (vehicles with a gross vehicle mass not exceeding 3.5 tonnes) manufactured on or after 1 January 2000. It will come into force on 1 February 2009.
