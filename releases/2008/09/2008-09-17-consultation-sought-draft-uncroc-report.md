Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta has today released New Zealand’s third and fourth (consolidated) draft report on the United Nations Convention of the Rights of the Child (UNCROC) for consultation.

“Children and young people are very important and we need to ensure we provide them with the opportunities, and the support they need to enable them to do well,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“The report shows the leadership the Labour-led government has taken over the past five years. We have seen a lot of assistance go into, for example, the health, education and youth justice areas, all with the aim of supporting our young people.”

Social Development and Employment Minister Ruth Dyson earlier released the *Children and Young People: Indicators of Wellbeing in New Zealand 2008* report, which shows improvement across a number of areas.

"The findings of the report show that in New Zealand there has been continual improvement with fewer young people smoking, improved internet access, increased educational achievement, and higher household incomes.  However, there are still areas for improvement," Ms Dyson said.

Nanaia Mahuta said the government’s contribution is only part of the story.

“We know that families make a critical difference to the upbringing of young people. Equally, the input of non government organisations and private sector organisations has also been valuable,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“Our goal is to make a difference in the lives of our children and young people, and while there are areas we can still improve on, I’m heartened by the progress that has been made,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

The reports are available online. The *Children and Young People: Indicators of Wellbeing in New Zealand 2008* report can be found on [www.msd.govt.nz](http://www.msd.govt.nz/) and the draft UNCROC report can be found on [www.myd.govt.nz](http://www.myd.govt.nz/).

Feedback on the draft UNCROC report is due by 17 October 2008. Details of how you can provide feedback as part of this process are provided alongside the draft report on the above link.

The report is due to go to the United Nations in November.
