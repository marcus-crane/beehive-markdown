Conservation Minister Steve Chadwick today celebrated the start of the construction of Wellington Zoo’s new animal hospital 'Nest'.

“The Nest will be a state-of-the-art animal hospital providing benefits for wildlife including taking care of the animals living at the Zoo, and caring for sick and injured native wildlife from the community," Steve Chadwick said.

“It will also be a research and teaching facility for vets, vet nurses and biologists, and be open for visitors, who will be able to view the fascinating work of the Nest staff as they care for native and Zoo collection animals. This will present another fantastic opportunity for New Zealanders to further understand our intriguing native species."

The celebration included sealing a time capsule that contains artefacts from the Zoo’s current hospital and small contributions from the project donors.

The Minister used the opportunity to thank those people involved in developing the project, from a series of ideas and thoughts on paper to a project that would work on the ground. She acknowledged financial contributions from the Wellington City Council, New Zealand Lottery Grants Board and many others who have helped fund the $6 million project.

"The new hospital will also bring specific benefits to the Department of Conservation by providing triage and rehabilitation of injured wildlife, advocacy and education opportunities and a higher profile for the rescue of native animals."

The Nest is expected to be completed by early 2010.
