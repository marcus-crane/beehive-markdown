Education Minister Chris Carter today announced grants worth $9.3 million for 27 early childhood education providers across New Zealand.

The Minister made the announcement during a visit to Aoga Amata EFKS Early Childhood Centre in Newtown, Wellington, with local Member of Parliament, Hon Annette King.

“Today’s announcement forms part of the government’s commitment to increasing participation in quality early childhood education and achieving the goals of the ten-year strategic plan for early childhood education.

“Research shows that the greatest benefits are for children who traditionally have been less likely to access early childhood education,” said Chris Carter.

The Aoga Amata EFKS is a successful Discretionary Grant applicant and the centre will receive $999,201 to relocate and build a new facility to increase licensed child places from 30 to 40.

“We know that a quality early childhood education gives our children the best possible chance of succeeding in school and later in life,” said Chris Carter.

The Ministry of Education’s Discretionary Grants Scheme and the Establishment Funding initiative will increase the provision of early childhood education through the creation of 306 new child places in the early childhood services network and help retain 156 places in services that are required to relocate.

These grants provide assistance to eligible community-based groups to plan for and build new early childhood services, extend existing services and meet costs associated with establishing a new service.

Discretionary Grants and Establishment Funding initiatives have provided over $100 million towards early childhood education services since July 2000.

Applications for the second round of the Discretionary Grants Scheme for 2008 close on Friday 24 October 2008. Applications for the second round of Establishment Funding for 2008 close on Friday 31 October 2008.

Information and application forms for the Discretionary Grants Scheme and Establishment Funding are available on the Ministry’s website.
