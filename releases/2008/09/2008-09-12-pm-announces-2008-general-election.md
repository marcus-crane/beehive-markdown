I have called this press conference today to announce the date of the 2008 General Election and the timetable of events which will unfold from the dissolution of Parliament.

I have advised the Administrator of the Government today that the date for the dissolution of Parliament will be 3 October.

Writ day will follow on 8th October and nomination day will be on 14th October.

The general election will be held on 8th November.
