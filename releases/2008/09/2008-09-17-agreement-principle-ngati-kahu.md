Te Runanga-ä-iwi Ngäti Kahu, today signed an Agreement in Principle with the Crown, Treaty Negotiations Minister Dr Michael Cullen said.

The Agreement in Principle outlines the broad settlement package that the parties have agreed will settle Ngati Kähu’s historical Treaty of Waitangi claims. In signing the agreement, Dr Cullen acknowledged the difficult history between Ngati Kahu and the Crown.

 

“This is a history of large-scale loss of Ngāti Kahu land, much of it within twenty-five years of their ancestors and the Crown signing the Treaty of Waitangi,” Dr Cullen said.

 

“With this Agreement in Principle we acknowledge that history and start the work to repair our relationship.”

 

It includes financial and commercial redress of $14 million (including the opportunity to purchase Rangiputa Station), a social revitalisation package worth $7.5 million and cultural redress including a Statutory Board consisting of Ngäti Kahu and Crown representatives over conservation lands. It also includes the transfer of 17 sites of high cultural and historicalsignificance to Ngäti Kahu.

 

The Minister extended his congratulations to the mandated body Te Rünanga-ä-Iwi o Ngäti Kahu and its negotiators on achieving the important milestone, saying it further demonstrated their hard work and determination for progressing Ngäti Kahu claims toward settlement.

 

Ngäti Kahu is located around Kaitāia, Taipā and Mangonui, and has between 8,300 and 14,000 members.

 

The Crown has supported the initiation of a regional forum, Te Hiku O Te Ika Iwi Forum, for iwi to deal with their shared interests in Te Hiku o Te Ika. The Crown will now begin a process of consultation with third parties and overlapping claimants on the Agreement.

 

The Crown and Ngāti Kahu will work towards a detailed Deed of Settlement, which will be subject to ratification by all members of Ngāti Kahu.
