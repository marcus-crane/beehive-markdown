Communications and Information Technology Minister David Cunliffe today announced a decision relating to a Commerce Commission proposal in respect of national mobile telephone roaming.

Having previously accepted the Commission’s recommendation to amend the terms of the national roaming service, he has now also accepted the Commission’s view that the service should not be subject to price regulation.

"After making my decision however, further potentially material evidence was brought to my attention. I believe it important that this evidence be tested.

"I am asking the Commerce Commission to consider whether there are grounds to commence a fresh investigation into whether, in light of this new information, designation, including price regulation, is warranted."

**Background**

National roaming enables the retail customers of "access seekers" such as NZ Communications to use their mobile phones on networks outside the access seeker’s own service area.
