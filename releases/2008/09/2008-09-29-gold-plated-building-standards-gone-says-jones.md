Building and Construction Minister Shane Jones has responded to the criticisms of the Building Act and removed its "gold plated building standards".

"The Prime Minister asked me to find ways to create flexibility and tackle regulation. I promised to cut red tape and that is exactly what I have done.

"There are a number changes, which will come into effect on October 16, which will make it easier for homeowners to do minor building work without having to get council consent."

The list of work that no longer requires a building consent has been extended and now includes:

- Changing existing household plumbing, including minor drainage work, as long as the work is done or signed off by a licensed plumber or drainlayer.
- Building or installing a small cabin near to an existing home, as long as the cabin is smaller than 10 m2 and does not have cooking or sanitary facilities.
- Removing or changing a non load-bearing wall
- Building awnings, pergolas or verandas over a deck
- Installing or replacing windows or exterior doors, provided there have not been weathertightness problems and there is no change to structural elements
- Making a home more accessible by widening doorways and building access ramps
- Fitting out shop or office interiors where the work does not modify certain important building features, such as fire escapes
- Erecting tents or marquees, as long as they are smaller than 100 m2 (for private use) and 50 m2 (for public use) and will not be used for more than a month.

"The value of what I have done here will be seen over time. The pleasing thing for me is that Kiwis up and down the country can take up their tools once more and go about doing what has always been a tradition in New Zealand."
