"More communities are getting funding to support the change required to prevent family violence", said Ruth Dyson, Social Development and Employment Minister.

Thirty five projects will receive a total of $826,680. This is in addition to 62 community organisations that have already received a total of $1.35 million from the Community Action Fund.

“Family violence is a community problem and the government has a responsibility to support local efforts to help put an end to it. We are making good progress but there is still more work to do to ensure that family violence is regarded as a community issue that is everyone’s business," said Ms Dyson.

The Community Action Fund is a key component of the Campaign for Action on Family Violence – the It’s not OK campaign. The campaign includes TV advertising, an 0800 information line and website and partnerships with community and government organisations.

"Research shows that 89% of people surveyed are aware of the It’s not OK campaign and nearly one in five (19%) have taken some action as a result," said Ms Dyson.

"The campaign is changing people’s attitudes and their behaviour. This funding enables work to happen at a local level to assist communities to think and talk about what eliminating family violence means for them," said Ms Dyson.

A new founding round will open in February, 2009. Details are available on the campaign website at [www.areyouok.org.nz](http://www.areyouok.org.nz/)
