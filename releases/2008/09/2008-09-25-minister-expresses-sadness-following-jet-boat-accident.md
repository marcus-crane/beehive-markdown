Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor has expressed sadness after learning one person is missing and several people are injured following a jet boat accident in Queenstown this afternoon.

It is understood the jet boat flipped on the Shotover and Kawarau River delta near Queenstown. 

Mr O'Connor, a former jetboat operator himself, said such incidents were unusual and that it was important to get to the bottom of what happened to minimise the prospect of it happening again.

"New Zealand's reputation as a world-class visitor destination is underpinned not only by the quality of what we offer, but how safe our country is for visitors.

"No-one yet knows what factors might have led to this accident.  But regardless, we must continue to do everything we can to maintain the highest standards of safety across the industry. Anything less is unacceptable.

"My thoughts are with the family of the missing person and those involved in today's accident," said Mr O'Connor.
