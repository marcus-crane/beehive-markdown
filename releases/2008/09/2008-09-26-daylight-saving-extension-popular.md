An overwhelming majority of New Zealanders support the extension to daylight saving, Internal Affairs Minister, Rick Barker, said today.

 

The government reviewed and extended the period following public debate and a petition to Parliament.  As a result, daylight saving began a week earlier last year and finished three weeks later this year.  The period now runs from the last Sunday in September to the first Sunday in April.

 

A survey of public attitudes showed that 82 percent of the population approved of the extension and only 11 percent disapproved. The survey also found that 90 percent of the population approved of daylight saving in general with only six percent disapproving. The margin of error for these results is ±3.6 percent.

 

"The results show that New Zealanders enjoy making the most out of the summer daylight," Rick Barker said. Benefits respondents identified were being able to enjoy more leisure activities, do more gardening and get more exercise in the evening. 

 

Dairy farmers were also specifically surveyed for their opinions.  These results have a margin of error of ±4.5 percent.

 

"While this is a group traditionally opposed to daylight saving, 54 percent approved of the extension compared with 41 percent who disapproved", Mr Barker said. "Of daylight saving in general, 82 percent approved and just 15 percent disapproved. This shows that all New Zealanders benefit from the extra daylight hours, not just city-folk."

 

Mr Barker also noted that the Department of Internal Affairs received positive reports from a number of tourism operators who felt the extension benefited their business.

 

The public attitude survey was conducted by Research New Zealand for the Department of Internal Affairs and full details are available at: [www.dia.govt.nz](http://www.dia.govt.nz/)
