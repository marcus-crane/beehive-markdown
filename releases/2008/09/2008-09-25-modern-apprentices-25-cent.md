"This takes the number of New Zealanders who are doing or have completed [Modern Apprenticeships](http://www.modern-apprenticeships.govt.nz/) to 17,287 in June 2008, up from 13,838 in June 2007," Helen Clark said.

Helen Clark released the figures during a visit with Associate Tertiary Education Minister Maryan Street to two top construction industry Modern Apprentices in Nelson today.

Blenheim's Roger Townley was recently named the Registered Master Builders' Federation Upper South Island Apprentice of the Year, while Nelsonian Chris Donnelly was the runner up.

"These two young men are outstanding apprentices, building careers for themselves through the Modern Apprenticeships programme.

"When the Labour-led government launched the Modern Apprenticeships programme in 2000, we set about rebuilding trade training for young people in New Zealand. We have achieved that objective with the target of 14,000 Modern Apprentices by the end of 2008 being exceeded in September 2007," Helen Clark said.

"Industry Training figures are also on the rise, with 134,500 Industry Trainees at 30 June 2008, up 3.7 per cent from 129,695 on the same quarter in 2007. Increasing the skills of New Zealanders is fundamental to driving the country's economic transformation," Maryan Street said.

"There were 236 active Modern Apprentices in Nelson as at 30 June - up from 177 at the same time last year which is a 33 per cent increase. In addition, there are 3,152 Industry Trainees in the Nelson area, up from 3125 last year," she said.
