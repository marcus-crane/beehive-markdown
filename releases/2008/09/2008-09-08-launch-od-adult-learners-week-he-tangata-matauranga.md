Adult Learners’ Week is a wonderful opportunity to celebrate the achievements of adult learners, educators and tertiary education organisations, Associate Tertiary Education Minister Maryan Street says.

Maryan Street will speak at the national launch of the week at Te Papa this evening.

“This year’s theme - Adult Learners are Leaders – highlights the important leadership role adults play, not only within their own families, but in the wider community, when they make life-long learning a priority,” said Maryan Street.

“About 409,000 New Zealanders take part in informal community-based education each year. From attending a programme at a local school to earning a university degree, all adult learning achievements are worth celebrating.

“By striving to improve their own skills and knowledge, adults empower and inspire others to begin their own learning journey,” she said.

Adult Learners’ Week is celebrated worldwide in more than 50 countries as part of UNESCO’s International Adult Learners’ Week. It incorporates International Literacy Day on 8 September.

“Adult learning is often about building skills such as literacy and numeracy. The Adult and Community Education sector has led the way in developing adult literacy and numeracy programmes over the past couple of decades. Developing these skills continues to be a priority for the sector,” Maryan Street said.

“The government is also working to increase the opportunities for adults to develop literacy and numeracy skills in the workplace. We know that learning at work has many positive flow-on effects – from improved job prospects to being able to help with children’s learning in ways not possible before.”

The government supports Adult Learners’ Week in New Zealand by providing funding to ACE Aotearoa to organise a range of events.
