A new passport book incorporating distinctive New Zealand artwork design and updated security features will be introduced around the middle of next year, Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker said today. The existing passport design theme has not been changed since 1992.

“New Zealanders have one of the best and most trusted passports in the world giving visa free access to over 50 countries," Mr Barker said.

He said that the New Zealand passport already meets the stringent international requirements for travel documents and will continue to contain a microchip as has been the case since ePassports were introduced in 2005.

“Our current passport is fairly indistinguishable from many others around the world, but the new design has a very distinct Kiwi character, black with an embossed silver fern on the front and rear cover.”

The visa pages will also have new artwork depicting a theme of navigation and travel. The artwork is of specific locations throughout New Zealand, depicting a journey heading north to south, the same direction as many of the early migrants to New Zealand. The artwork also contains images of navigation tools used in New Zealand throughout the ages, progressing chronologically with early features highlighted at the start to modern techniques portrayed at the end of the book.

“So many Kiwis love to travel. I think the new artwork will capture our adventurous spirit perfectly. I can’t wait to have one,” Mr Barker said. Passports will be in English and Te Reo Maori throughout. The new passport will have enhanced security features as well.

Mr Barker says that to ensure the security and integrity of the passport, full details of the artwork inside the book will be issued closer to the date when these books will be introduced.

“There are no plans to increase the passport fees, resulting from this work, and people can continue to use their existing passports until they expire. The new passport book will be issued progressively as people apply,” Mr Barker said.

Mr Barker said the passport is an iconic document and probably the most valuable identity document people carry. “Kiwis have every reason to be proud of their passport. The changes I’m signalling today will ensure they have a modern, secure, attractive document that they can be proud of,” Mr Barker said.
