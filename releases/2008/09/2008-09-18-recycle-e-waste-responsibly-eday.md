Now is the time for households to prepare to get rid of old computer and cell phone equipment in an environmentally friendly way, Environment Minister Trevor Mallard said today at the official launch of eDay 2008 at RemarkIT Solutions Ltd.

eDay will be held on the weekend of October 4 and 5 with 32 collection points around New Zealand. It provides households, small businesses and schools with an opportunity to drop off old computer equipment in the knowledge that it will be recycled in a sustainable way and not end up in a landfill.

"In New Zealand over 25 per cent (825,000) of our mobile phones are no longer being used, and over 250,000 unused computers are stored in homes.

"When dumped in landfill, e-waste can harm both the environment and human health. eDay is a fantastic opportunity for households to deal with their e-waste in an environmentally responsible way," Trevor Mallard said.

"Cleaning up New Zealand’s e-waste is something we have to work on together. eDay is an excellent example of how computer equipment producers and distributors can work together with local communities to raise awareness of the impacts e-waste has on our environment.

"I commend everybody involved in the event, especially the Computer Access New Zealand Trust for its hard work making eDay a reality.

"The Labour-led government is committed to sustainable development, and I am pleased the government is able to support eDay again this year through the Ministry for the Environment’s Sustainable Management Fund."

Last week parliament passed the Waste Minimisation Act which intends to deal with waste in a smarter, more concerted way for more sustainable use of resources. This includes offering economic incentives and rewards to businesses and councils who do their bit for waste reduction.

"I strongly urge all households with electronic and electrical waste to do the right thing by the environment and take part in this year’s eDay,” Trevor Mallard said.

All equipment collected on eDay will be sorted at the drop-off site before being transported to recycling plants within New Zealand or overseas. All equipment dropped off at an eDay site will be recycled by accredited recyclers in order to maximise the safe recovery of materials.
