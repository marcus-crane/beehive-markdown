Conservation Minister Steve Chadwick and Far North Mayor Wayne Brown today announced the purchase of the last remaining block of land still in private ownership in the Kororipo-Kerikeri Basin. 

“The property has been owned by the Kemp family since the mid 1800s and I am extremely grateful to them for agreeing that the time was right for it to move into public hands. I can assure them the property will be treated appropriately and with respect,” Steve Chadwick said.

“The foresight of this historic Kerikeri family will contribute towards further sustainable development of the Kororipo-Kerikeri Basin. The purchase protects a critical historic part of the basin, while allowing for footpaths and access to the land from a new car park to be established behind the property.” 

The Kerikeri Basin is considered by many historians to be one of New Zealand’s most important cultural and historic sites, and the government has recently announced that it is promoting the basin as a potential World Heritage Site.

The Far North District Council and the Department of Conservation (DOC) jointly purchased the property. The land will be held and managed by the Far North District Council.

The Kemp property was the site of the early Church of England Mission and currently houses a restaurant, an old blacksmith’s shed and a pear tree planted in 1819. 

“The joint purchase of the Kemp property is a reflection of the good working relationship and understanding between the district council and DOC through the Kerikeri Heritage Bypass project,” Mayor Brown said.

“I am pleased that the community now has a tangible interest in the sustainable management of this important and iconic area.”
