Pacific Island Affairs Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban today launched Water Safety New Zealand's Pacific Peoples Water Safety Strategy.

The strategy is promoting water safe behaviour and skills for Pacific peoples to use and enjoy the water safely.

"As Pacific Islanders and people of the Pacific region, whether we’re working, playing or at home, the water is never far away.

"In 2007 there were 11 Pacific drowning deaths. The impact on people’s families and communities is devastating, particularly as most are avoidable.

"Statistics show that about 90 per cent of Pacific people who drown are male, and two thirds are aged 15-44 years - so we clearly need to be targeting our young men."

The strategy will be promoted to Pacific communities through churches, community road-shows and other direct interactions, supported by posters, DVD's and pamphlets in Cook Island Māori, Tuvaluan, Samoan, Tongan, Tokelauan and Kiribati.

"We want our Pacific children, families and communities to enjoy our rivers, lakes, pools and all that New Zealand and the beautiful Pacific region has to offer. It is important that the risks in doing so are understood and safe responsible behaviour practices are put into place," Laban said.

ACC has supported Water Safety New Zealand in the development of the strategy.
