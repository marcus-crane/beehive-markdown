Associate Transport Minister and Auckland Central MP Judith Tizard says the passing of the Public Transport Management Bill is a watershed moment for Auckland's public transport.

The Bill enables the Regional Council and ARTA to improve our public transport system.

"This legislation allows ARTA to impose better standards over commercial public transport services," said Judith Tizard.

“If we want Aucklanders to move towards more sustainable transport, it is our job to ensure the public transport system is a realistic alternative to using private cars and that ratepayers and taxpayers, as well as passengers, get value for money.

After passing this legislation through the House today, Transport Minister Annette King said, "It is essential that New Zealand's public transport services are affordable, integrated and accessible, safe, responsive to change and – above all – economically, socially and environmentally sustainable.”

Judith Tizard pointed out that the Bill does not tell regional councils or ARTA how to run their public transport systems.

"It simply gives them the tools to develop and run them as effectively as possible and better plan for, and manage, future public transport demands.

“The framework is now in place to enable travel on public transport to become much simpler, and passengers can expect a more consistent level of service, something everyone will welcome," said Judith Tizard.

ARTA and regional councils will be able to set longer notice periods for commercial public transport providers in commencing, varying and withdrawing services. 

They will also have greater access to information, like detailed patronage statistics, to enable more effective planning of public transport and development of regional public transport plans.

Judith Tizard said she was delighted to see this Bill pass its third reading and that she looked forward to improvements rolling out for public transport users in Auckland and around New Zealand.
