Rural Affairs Minister Damien O'Connor said a number of small provincial bus companies have contacted him following announced changes to the school bus system in the country.

"I am very aware of the announced changes to the school bus system affecting many local contractors.

"My office has been contacted by operators from my own electorate and from all around New Zealand," said Mr O'Connor.

"I would encourage any operator who is concerned about the processes or outcomes of the recent assessment of contracts to seek a review, as they are entitled to do.

"I have met with Education Minister Chris Carter and officials from the Ministry of Education to clarify the number of claims that have been made and will work through the issue with the Ministry," said Mr O'Connor.
