Environment Minister Trevor Mallard today welcomed the Board of Inquiry’s final decision regarding Contact Energy Limited’s proposed Te Mihi geothermal power station near Taupo, and thanked the board for an effective and efficient process.

On 22 January this year, Trevor Mallard called in Contact’s applications for the Te Mihi proposal because of its national significance and appointed Environment Court judge Gordon Whiting to lead a Board of Inquiry. The call-in combined the local council’s consideration and a potential Environment Court appeal process into a single consideration by the board. Following a public submission process and a three-day hearing, the board made a final decision on the application in accordance with district and regional plans.

"I would like to congratulate Judge Whiting and his board on its timely and well-considered decision making. The board has demonstrated how well the Resource Management Act’s (RMA) call-in process can work," Trevor Mallard said.

"This is the first time since amendments to the RMA in 2005 that a Board of Inquiry has made a final decision on a called-in consent application, so it’s a significant milestone for the RMA.

"The time taken for this project to be approved completely puts paid to suggestions that the RMA can delay projects for years.

"As this decision demonstrates, changes to the RMA are not needed and projects can be approved within acceptable timeframes – with public input and consultation secured throughout the process. The Labour-led government believes public input must be protected regardless of the project that is proposed.

"Throughout the call-in process, the board adopted good practice approaches, including pre-hearing meetings to resolve outstanding issues, and pre-circulating evidence which would be taken as read at the hearing.

"The parties involved in the decision making process should also be commended for working to resolve the issues before a decision was made by the board," Trevor Mallard said.
