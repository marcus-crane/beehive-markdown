Prime Minister Helen Clark and Rugby World Cup Minister Clayton Cosgrove today welcomed Emirates Airlines as the first WorldWide Partner for Rugby World Cup 2011. 

Helen Clark said this is a significant milestone in the lead-up to New Zealand's hosting of the third largest sporting event in the world.

"Emirates Airlines has joined a team of committed people who have a passion for rugby and are determined to make this the most successful Rugby World Cup tournament.

"The government's commitment to the Rugby World Cup includes a 50:50 share with the New Zealand Rugby Union in Rugby New Zealand 2011 (the joint venture company established to organise the tournament); an underwrite of up to $190 million to redevelop Eden Park as the finals venue for the Rugby World Cup; and a dedicated office within government to ensure that the essential services required from across government will be well coordinated and prepared for 2011.

"As the official airline for the tournament, Emirates will play a key role in bringing many of the 70,000 expected Rugby World Cup visitors to New Zealand in 2011.  The involvement of Emirates as a Worldwide partner for the Rugby World Cup, will even further elevate the profile of this fantastic event that we are looking forward to hosting," Helen Clark said.  

Clayton Cosgrove said New Zealand is well advanced in its planning for the event, and he emphasised the importance of working together at a regional, national and global level to make the most of the wide range of opportunities the Rugby World Cup presents.

"We are a rugby nation and proud of it - but we are so much more than that, and the Rugby World Cup 2011 provides us with a fantastic opportunity to showcase our country and its unique regional attractions to the world," he said.

"Hosting this event will not only bring financial benefits to New Zealand - it will also raise our profile and promote our country as a great place to live, work, play and do business.  That is how we see our home.  That is how we want the rest of the world to see us too," Helen Clark said
