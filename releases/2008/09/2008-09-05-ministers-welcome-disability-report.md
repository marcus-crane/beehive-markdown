The Ministers of Health, Mr David Cunliffe and Disability Issues, Ruth Dyson today welcomed the Social Services Select Committee Report into the Quality of Care and Services for Disabled People.

“We are pleased that the report has multi-party support. It means that it will provide ongoing guidance for the development of this important sector."

“The Government is already moving in the direction of many recommendations in the report. But the Select Committee has said that it wants some of those things to happen more quickly, and wants significant change in other areas”, said Mr Cunliffe.

“I am mindful that the short term issues of sector funding are becoming important and pressing. I have therefore asked for an urgent meeting with key players on this issue. I look forward to meeting constructively with all the interested parties on this matter."

The Minister for Disability Issues Ms Dyson said Parliament has come a long way since 1999, when we set up the first disability issues portfolio. The importance of this issue is reflected in the cross party support for the New Zealand Disability Strategy.

"When the Strategy was launched in 2001 it heralded a whole new way of approaching disability issues and it is very pleasing to see how this has transformed discussions about disability, said Ms Dyson.

"The first step for achieving positive change is often about raising expectations. This report shows how disabled people, providers, government agencies and now Parliament, are expecting a more inclusive world for disabled people - one in which they are valued as members of our community and where their rights are honoured."

"There is still much work to be achieved and I look forward to considering the report's recommendations," said Ms Dyson.
