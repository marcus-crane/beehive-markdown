Two of New Zealand’s Crown Research Institutes (CRIs) have been granted shareholder approval to merge, Minister of Research, Science and Technology Pete Hodgson said today.

HortResearch and Crop & Food Research will merge on 1 December 2008 into a new CRI.

The Boards of the two companies initiated the merger to create a critical mass based on the combined strength in plant-based food research capabilities that are currently segregated in the two companies.

“This change is a bold and exciting step which will produce benefits for scientific endeavour and will enhance the contribution of the CRI sector to New Zealand’s economic, social, and environmental well-being,” Pete Hodgson said.

The merger will combine the two companies’ knowledge and expertise in nationally significant areas of sustainable production, elite genetics and smart breeding, and food and health, which will benefit wider national initiatives and strategies.

“The critical mass created through the merger will allow the combined CRI to better service key client needs, combine complementary skills, and share equipment,” Pete Hodgson said.

There are no proposed closures of sites, although Crop & Food Research and HortResearch staff members in some areas may be brought together in the same location. Jim McLean, current chair of HortResearch has been appointed as chair.

A name for the new CRI will be announced before 1 December 2008.

HortResearch currently has 541 staff and in 2007/08 earned revenue of $65 million. It is acknowledged as a world leader in integrated fruit research and is responsible for a range of successful cultivars including the ZESPRI™ GOLD Kiwifruit and ENZA JAZZ™ apple.

Crop & Food Research currently has 380 staff and in 2007/08 earned revenue of $56 million. Its key research focus is engaging with industry in producing and transforming high-quality raw materials into high-value foods.
