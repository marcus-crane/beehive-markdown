Recycling steel cans and using them creatively has paid off for students at Greenacres School in Tawa who have won the Wellington Region "Hanable the CANable" Monster Making Competition, Environment Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

"The competition, was to design a monster from used steel cans with only minimal use of other materials such as glue, rope or nails to hold the monster together. The winners are the five year old students of Room One at Greenacres School with their monster 'Tin-O-Saurus' – a monster resembling a stegosaurus dinosaur," Trevor Mallard said.

Trevor Mallard visited Greenacres School today to congratulate the new entrant students and present them with prizes. He also congratulated the organisers CANZBAC – the face of the Steel Can Association's campaign to educate consumers about the importance of recycling steel cans.

The winning entry receives $2000 for the school to put towards environmental training programmes, while each child in Room One receives a Hanable the CANable tshirt, clock and certificate.

"It's great to see kids doing their bit to recycle, and using their recycled cans in such creative ways," Trevor Mallard said.

"On average each family in New Zealand uses about six cans every week. Only about three of those are recycled, while the other three end up in the rubbish.

"If each of us throughout the whole country recycled just one more can every year, we would recover enough steel to build 20 buses.

"It's easy to recycle these days, and the government is making it easier by allocating $4.6 million until 2010 to establish about 600 public recycling bins throughout New Zealand. There are already some in Wellington so you can recycle when you are out in town, as well as when you're at home."

The competition was open to all primary schools in the Wellington region. Thirteen primary schools entered, with 89 monsters being created. The public voted online to select the winner.

Runner up was Koraunui School with their monster 'Clyde the Cool Can Man', and Oxford Crescent School won the People's Choice Award with the 'Horrible Unbeatable Oxterminator'.
