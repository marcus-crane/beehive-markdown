Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that the [Royal Commission on Auckland Governance](http://www.royalcommission.govt.nz/rccms.nsf/) has been granted an extension of its reporting date until 31 March 2009.

“The workload created by the submissions, hearings, and research processes has been greater than expected,” Helen Clark said.

“The Commission needs adequate time for its recommendations to be thoroughly researched, reviewed and explained, and to enable its members to present a robust and full report.

“Since April, the Royal Commission has received over 3500 [submissions](http://www.royalcommission.govt.nz/rccms.nsf/SUBMISSIONS?openview&count=-1), and conducted hearings for 27 days in nine locations throughout Auckland.

“It has commissioned an extensive programme of research, held five hui with Maori in the region, workshops with Pacific and ethnic communities, and had numerous informal consultations with individuals and organisations.

“The Commissioners have also travelled to Brisbane and Melbourne, and plan further overseas travel in order to study large city governance structures and to meet international experts.

“Auckland governance is a complex jigsaw. The Commission has undertaken a significant task and intends to obtain expert and peer reviews for aspects of its report, so it is not surprising that further time will be needed.” Helen Clark said.

The Royal Commission was [originally](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/royal+commission+inquiry+auckland+governance+%E2%80%93+terms+reference+and+membership+announced) required to report on 1 December 2008.
