New Zealand’s next ambassador to Timor-Leste will be career diplomat Tim McIvor, Prime Minister Helen Clark said today.

"Dili is an important [post](http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Embassies/1-NZ-representatives-overseas/0-embassies-list.php?country=Timor-Leste&emb=1) for New Zealand. Since 1999, we have [worked closely with the Timorese](http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Countries/Asia-South-and-Southeast/Timor-Leste.php), the UN, and with other governments to help bring peace and development to Timor-Leste.

"Many New Zealand military personnel, police, customs, corrections staff, and others have stood alongside the Timorese as they have worked to build their independent nation. Timor-Leste’s needs will change over time, but New Zealand’s commitment remains undiminished.

"There are 180 New Zealand troops and helicopter crews currently based in Timor-Leste – formerly East Timor – as part of the Australian-led International Stabilisation Force.

"Twenty-five police officers and several military personnel are attached to the UN Mission in Timor-Leste, UNMIT.

"The New Zealand police officers in Timor-Leste are currently trialling a community policing initiative which shows great promise. Additional development projects in a range of other areas are under active investigation," Helen Clark said.

Tim McIvor is currently head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s Asia Regional Unit.

Previously he was New Zealand Deputy Permanent Representative at the United Nations in New York. He has also served in Manila and Moscow.

Tim McIvor will begin his assignment in mid-December, taking over from Ruth Nuttall who is returning to Wellington.
