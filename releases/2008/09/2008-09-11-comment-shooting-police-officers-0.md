Prime Minister Helen Clark and Police Minister Annette King said today they are deeply saddened by the fatal shooting of an Auckland police officer, and the wounding of another, during an incident in Mangere early this morning.

"Today is a very sad day for the family of the police officer killed, and for his colleagues. Police serve our community well, and it is a tragedy that a police officer has been killed in the line of duty.

"My thoughts and deepest sympathy are with the family of the deceased police officer, the family members of the injured officer, and the all members of the police organisation who will be reflecting on this morning’s tragedy," Helen Clark said.

Annette King said police officers worked hard to serve the community.

"These were two policemen going about their duties, but on any given day police know that they may be exposed to great danger."

Ms King said the fatal shooting was even sadder given that it followed the recent death of another police officer on duty in Porirua.

"I extend my sympathies to the families of the two officers, their colleagues and their friends, and wish the injured officer a speedy recovery."
