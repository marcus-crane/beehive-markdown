Local Government Minister Nanaia Mahuta has paid tribute to former Christchurch Mayor Sir Hamish Hay, who passed away last evening.

“Sir Hamish was a stalwart of local politics in Christchurch, and enjoyed a distinguished career as a politician and as Christchurch’s longest serving mayor,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

Sir Hamish was Mayor from 1974 to 1989, and before that was a Christchurch City Councillor.  He was also a Regional Councillor for Christchurch North from 1995 to 2001.

The 80-year-old was also a member of a number of national trusts and committees.

“He had a reputation for having a great eye for detail, and enjoyed great standing in the community.  He was a strong advocate and was a force behind the building of Christchurch Town Hall,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“Sir Hamish was an exceptional politician and worked hard to serve the community, and his contribution to local government politics will not be forgotten

“As Minister of Local Government, I would like to relay my sincere condolences to Sir Hamish’s family, and express the deep gratitude for the experience and service he gave to Local Government,” Nanaia Mahuta said.
