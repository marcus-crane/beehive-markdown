Associate Minister of Health Mita Ririnui today announced the 15 Maori health and disability service providers that have been selected as finalists for the Whanau Ora Awards 2008.

“The Whanau Ora Awards showcase the professionalism and commitment of Maori health providers working to help Maori families achieve their maximum health and well-being,” Minister Ririnui explained. “They celebrate the achievements of Maori health services and promote programmes and people who have made a difference in the health and well-being of their communities.”

This year’s finalists include three health providers from the Far North, two from Rotorua, three from Auckland and three from the Wellington region. Eight of this year’s finalists were also finalists in the Whanau Ora Awards 2006.

“It is very pleasing to see that the best of our Maori services in the health and disability sector are not only continuing to do great work but are also building and enhancing their services with innovative thinking and new initiatives,” said Minister Ririnui.

“Equally it is exciting to welcome new faces from different regions and we look forward to seeing what is on offer. The opportunity to meet with all the finalists and talk with them about their projects and see their displays should not be missed.”

All finalists will be displaying their award applications from 1.00pm to 2.30pm on Friday 12 September in the West Court of the Wellington Town Hall, Wellington.
