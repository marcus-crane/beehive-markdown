Sport and Recreation Minister Clayton Cosgrove said the nation has lost one its greatest coaches and sporting mentors, with the death of Duncan Laing.

The Minister was paying tribute to arguably New Zealand’s greatest swimming coach whose funeral is in Dunedin this afternoon (17 September).

“From moulding Olympic champions through to helping toddlers learn water skills, Duncan Laing was a tremendous asset to the entire community as a swimming coach. He also made valuable contributions in his capacity as a rugby coach and through his work with disadvantaged youth.

“Duncan Laing simply loved to coach. His devotion to nurturing the talent of our young people of all levels of ability is an outstanding example of selflessness and service to the community.”

Mr Cosgrove said it is probably Duncan Laing’s immense contribution as an elite level coach that he is most renowned for.

“His influence spanned three decades and he laid the foundation for much of New Zealand’s successes in the pool over that period. Many people agree the high point of his career was coaching Danyon Loader to his two gold medals at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996.

“Duncan obviously had a major impact on Otago swimming, but his talents helped elite swimmers nationwide.  New Zealand sport was extremely lucky to have had a man with his passion and ability.”

Mr Cosgrove said his thoughts and sympathy are with Duncan Laing’s family and friends at this sad time.
