New Zealand and the Republic of Korea have signed a film co-production agreement to facilitate screen industry partnerships between the two countries, Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today.

The agreement was signed by Helen Clark and Korean Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism You In-chon, in a ceremony at Parliament Buildings in Wellington.

"New Zealand and Korea have a strong film-making relationship. The successful New Zealand film [Black Sheep](http://www.blacksheep-themovie.com/) was a joint venture with Korean investors, and many significant Korean films have been located here including Silmido, Old Boy, and Laundry Warrior," Helen Clark said.

"There have been a number of recent film festivals in each country, and partnership agreements signed between industry and government bodies in the sector. There is a great deal of interest in both countries in the relationship, and a number of promising productions in development. This agreement will provide a further boost for filmmakers to advance those projects. I look forward to seeing the results on screen.

Co-production agreements enable approved joint film projects to gain official co-production status. This enhances their access to funding and incentives in line with those available for ‘national' films in each country. Governments also facilitate, within existing regulations, temporary immigration and importation of equipment. Each agreement is jointly administered by the New Zealand Film Commission and an equivalent organisation in the other country.

The agreement with Korea is limited to productions intended to be shown in cinemas.

"We intend to explore the possibility of including television and other format productions in the scope of the agreement in the future.

"The Government has been working hard to expand our current pool of nine international co-production agreements. In the last year we have signed agreements with Ireland and Spain, and an agreement with South Africa has been finalised, and awaits signature. Work is also underway on agreements with India and China," Helen Clark said.
