The New Zealand Government has now provided a total of $850,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross to provide shelter for the homeless in the wake of the Sichuan earthquake, say Prime Minister Helen Clark and Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter.

New Zealand, through NZAID, has responded to the request from China for tents to help provide shelter for those left homeless after the earthquake.

“All New Zealanders watching television news pictures of the devastation following the earthquake have been moved by the plight of the people in Sichuan. The government of China is co-ordinating the major relief effort, and has welcomed support of the practical kind New Zealand is providing,” Helen Clark said.

Chris Carter said that New Zealanders have also contributed through a wide range of community fund-raising activities to the relief effort, in solidarity with New Zealand’s Chinese communities.

“More than 150,000 New Zealanders are Chinese, and many are new migrants. Events in the earthquake zone will have impacted on a number of families here in New Zealand.

“The heart-rending stories from Sichuan, along with the stories of bravery and courage, have reached into New Zealand homes and evoked a hugely sympathetic response in our country,” Chris Carter said.

“Our thoughts are with the people of China and New Zealand’s Chinese communities over these tragic events,” Helen Clark and Chris Carter said.
