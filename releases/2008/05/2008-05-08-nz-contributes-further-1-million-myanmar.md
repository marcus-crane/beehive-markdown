New Zealand will contribute another $1 million to the United Nations efforts to help Myanmar recover from the devastation caused by Cyclone Nargis, Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today.

Helen Clark said the money will be made via NZAID and is in addition to the $500,000 pledged yesterday to New Zealand aid and relief agencies involved in Myanmar.

“Reports coming out of Myanmar suggest that 40 percent of those killed, injured, or left homeless by this disaster are children. It’s important that New Zealand does what it can to assist.

“Children in the affected regions will be vulnerable to disease and infection and immediate assistance is required to ensure more lives are not lost.

“Our contribution to UNICEF will focus on caring for the injured, preventing the spread of disease and ensuring children have access to clean water and food.

“Working through the agencies of the UN ensures New Zealand’s assistance gets to those who need its most.

“While access to Myanmar has proved difficult, UNICEF is now mobilised on the ground. They have the expertise and relationships in place to coordinate quickly to help the young victims of this disaster,” said Helen Clark.
