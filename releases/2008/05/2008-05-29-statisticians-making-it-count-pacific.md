Pacific Island Affairs Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban and Statistics Minister Darren Hughes yesterday welcomed visiting statisticians from the Pacific, saying this is an excellent opportunity to share expertise and knowledge.

The visit is part of Statistics New Zealand’s Strategy for Building Statistical Capability in Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs), with visiting Heads of Statistical Offices and Planners from Tokelau, Niue and the Cook Islands attending workshops throughout the week.

"Statistics New Zealand has a role to play in developing the statistical capability of Pacific nations, and the Statistics New Zealand Pacific Statisticians and Planners Forum provides an important opportunity for engagement and planning for the future." Hughes said.

"This encourages the sharing of information about statistical methods and technologies, and statistical management and governance policy."

Objectives of the forum include clarifying the role and function of Statistics New Zealand's statistical assistance to the Pacific, identifying statistical needs and priorities, and the agreement of forward work programmes.

“New Zealand is a Pacific nation, and I am very pleased that we are able to support our Pacific cousins. Data is important for policy development and measurement of economic and social progress for Pacific communities and countries.

"I am confident that this programme and partnership with Statistics New Zealand will provide positive outcomes, 'making it count' for all Pacific Island counties including New Zealand,” said Laban.

The Pacific statisticians visit coincides with Statistics New Zealand's release of QuickStats About Pacific Peoples in New Zealand from the 2006 Census. This information is available at www.stats.govt.nz.
