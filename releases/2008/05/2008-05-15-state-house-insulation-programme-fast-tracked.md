A major Budget 2008 funding injection will see the state house insulation programme dramatically accelerated, improving tenant health and delivering energy cost savings, says Housing Minister Maryan Street.

“The new timeframe will see 21,000 state houses insulated within five years. Almost 12 homes a day will be insulated, doubling the pace of Housing New Zealand’s existing Energy Efficiency Retrofit campaign which began in 2001.”

Many homes in the South Island, where it is colder, have already been insulated and houses in Auckland, Wellington and Manawatu, where the greatest concentrations of the stock are, will be targeted next,” Maryan Street said.

“The package includes $22.4 million in new funding over four years, a further $1 million in the fifth year and $30 million in reprioritised spending. We appreciate the Green Party’s support in developing this initiative.”

“There is mounting evidence linking poor housing conditions with negative health and social outcomes. Over half of people in state homes are under the age of 20, and 10 per cent are over the age of 60,’’ Maryan Street said.

“Rising fuel and energy costs are set to put further pressure on low income households to keep warm and it is important that the government set an example for other landlords to follow. Insulated homes use about 20 per cent less energy than uninsulated ones.

“Housing New Zealand owns and maintains about 68,600 properties. Many were built before 1978, before insulation was mandatory. As a result, they have poor or no insulation and/or use inefficient heating, such as open fires,” she said.

About 16,500 state houses have been insulated and the fast-track will see the remaining homes without insulation retrofitted within five years. A retrofit includes insulation of floors and ceilings, hot water cylinder wraps and pipe lagging.

“Research confirms insulation is an appropriate first step in improving heat retention in older state homes. The warm air programme we are proposing will also see heaters installed where appropriate,” Maryan Street said.
