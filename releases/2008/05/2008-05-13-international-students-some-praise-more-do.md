International students have high praise for New Zealand, according to the latest National Survey of International Students, Tertiary Education Minister Pete Hodgson and Education Minister Chris Carter said today. 

But more work needed to be done to ensure better connections between international students, their domestic peers and support services, the Ministers said.

“The National Survey acts as a barometer on how satisfied New Zealand’s international students are and provides valuable feedback on students’ experiences of living and studying in New Zealand,” Pete Hodgson and Chris Carter said.

The 2007 survey shows that overall international students have a positive experience. Compared with results from a survey in 2003, students from Asia in particular are more satisfied with progress in their studies and a higher proportion say they intend to stay in New Zealand after their studies to seek work and permanent residence.

Pete Hodgson said that was good news. “Not only do fee-paying international students contribute to the economy but on completion of their education, provide a vital pool of skilled and enthusiastic workers for employers.”

“The results show that New Zealand education is a significant national asset and one that we should feel proud of,” Chris Carter said.

However the survey highlighted the need for New Zealand to ensure a quality experience for international students that extended beyond education. Some 34% of international students believed making friends was difficult and 61% wanted to have more New Zealand friends.

The Ministers said work was underway to improve pastoral care for international students, including consultation with New Zealand education institutions and liaison with community groups and other agencies in New Zealand and China.
