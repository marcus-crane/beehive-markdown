Improvements to the schooling network worth $51.7 million, including a new primary school, are in the pipeline under Auckland’s Tamaki Edge strategy, Education Minister Chris Carter announced today.    

The changes were needed to meet expected population growth in the area, including a 6500-resident community in the former Mt Wellington Quarry. An extra 2300 students (1300 primary and 1000 secondary) expected to enrol by 2021. 

“The plans for Tamaki Edge include building a new school and providing additional classrooms for expanding local schools,” Chris Carter said. 

“State-integrated schools in the area will also play a part in accommodating the increasing student population. In time, additional Early Childhood Education facilities are likely to be built to cater for the growth in under-fives.”

Chris Carter said the changes were designed to bring sustainable development to the area’s schools and to serve the community for decades to come. 

The new primary school in the Mt Wellington Quarry is planned to be open for 2010.   

Chris Carter thanked schools, parents and the wider community for contributing to the strategy through the consultation process. 

“The consultation carried out was thorough and I am confident the schooling changes will meet the needs of the local community”.

“Consultation with local school boards will continue before the establishment of the new Mt Wellington school and other proposed changes.”
