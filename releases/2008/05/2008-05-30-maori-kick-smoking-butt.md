“Congratulations to everyone who has accepted the challenge and have successfully become smoke free” says Associate Health Minister Mita Ririnui on the eve of World Smoke Free day.

Maori are highly represented in national smoking statistics but the latest Ministry of Health’s 2006/07 New Zealand Health Survey - the largest survey of New Zealanders’ health ever completed – shows that Maori smoking statistics have dropped markedly.

Smoking statistics from this survey indicates that Maori men have dropped from 42.9 per cent and Maori women have dropped from 51.0 per cent in 2002/2003 to 40.1 per cent in 2006/07.

“This is a huge decrease in Maori smokers and I think it is fantastic to see that people are finally realising the dangers of smoking and choosing to do something about it.”

“I know that you have heard all the messages about the importance of giving up and it is obvious to us through the latest statistics that the message is getting through.”

“For all those who have yet to accept the challenge, kia kaha! With encouragement and support from your whanau, you can do it too!”
