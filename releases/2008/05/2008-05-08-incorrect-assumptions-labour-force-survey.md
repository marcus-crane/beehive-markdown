Some incorrect assumptions have been drawn from the latest Household Labour Force Survey, says Employment Minister Ruth Dyson.

“There were not 29,000 fewer jobs available in the March quarter compared to the previous quarter. What the survey report says is that there were 29,000 fewer people ­in employment, the majority of whom left the labour force. That will be for a variety of reasons.

“As I said in my earlier statement today, there are still over 350,000 more jobs in our economy than there were in 1999. Over 140,000 fewer people are relying on working age benefits.

“Despite these enviable figures, the Labour-led Government, like many other countries, is mindful of the current global economic challenges. We take those challenges seriously,” said Ruth Dyson
