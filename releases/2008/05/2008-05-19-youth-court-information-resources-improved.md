Courts Minister, Rick Barker has today launched a set of new information resources, developed to ensure that all people who interact with Youth Court are aware of the court process and what to expect.

"For nearly two decades the Youth Court has worked to ensure that negative patterns of behaviour in young people are broken and that they are placed on the path to rehabilitation," Mr Barker said.

"Youth Court is a serious court which is charged with ensuring there is accountability, resolution and restoration for young offenders, their families and victims.

"This government is committed to improving and streamlining all Court process and providing improved information resources is a key part of this drive.

"Going to Court is a difficult time for all parties, but ensuring there is clear and concise information available to defendants and the victims of crime can improve outcomes and reduce any stress.

"The resources we are launching today will help ensure people turning up to the Youth Court know what to expect on the day, what is expected of them. They will cover what the Youth Court is and how they work, who is involved in the Youth Court process, Family Group Conferences, and the sorts of decisions a Youth Court Judge can make."

The new material will be specifically tailored for victims, families and for young people and are designed to be appropriate to the target audiences.

They will be available at all District Youth Courts, and can also be downloaded from the Youth Court section of the [Ministry of Justice’s website.](http://www.justice.govt.nz/youth/)

The Youth Court uses restorative and therapeutic justice processes to make young people accountable, provide support for their families and take into account the needs of the victims.

In the 2006/07 year the Youth Court disposed of over 7,500 cases nationwide.
