Australia and New Zealand Customs have today committed to a series of initiatives that will further streamline travel and trade between the two countries.

 

The Australian Minister for Home Affairs, Bob Debus, and New Zealand Customs Minister Nanaia Mahuta met in Canberra, Australia, to discuss closer ties between the Australian and New Zealand Customs Services.

 

Mr Debus said Australian and NZ Customs would work jointly to make passengers’ travel between New Zealand and Australia easier.

 

“Arriving New Zealand passengers are already able to use the Australian Customs SmartGate solution at certain Australian airports,” he said.

 

Ms Mahuta said agreement had now also been reached between the two Customs agencies to install Australian SmartGate kiosks at Auckland International Airport, to pre-process traveller’s arrival in Australian before leaving New Zealand.

 

“The kiosks will be for use by eligible new Zealand and Australian e-Passport holders traveling to Australian airports equipped with SmartGate.

 

“We are continuing to work to find ways to streamline travel between both nations for airline passengers,” Ms Mahuta said.

 

Mr Debus said Australian and NZ Customs were also involved in a data sharing pilot that could ultimately allow Trans-Tasman traders to submit a single data entry to both Customs administrations simultaneously. This would allow for earlier and more accurate receipt of data by Customs and for reduced compliance costs and time-savings for industry.

 

The Ministers also committed to enhance border security through more effective cooperation targeting criminal networks, maritime security threats and intellectual property theft.

 

Customs are now working on joint intelligence and investigation responses to identify border risks, including those posed by criminal networks common to both countries.

 

Mr Debus said Australian and NZ Customs would shortly sign an agreement to formalise a cooperative relationship between Border Protection Command and the National Maritime Coordination Centre in New Zealand.

 

“This agreement will significantly enhance security in the trans-Tasman maritime environment and provide a greater capability for each nation to assess and respond to maritime security threats,” he said.

 

“The seizure of 27kg of cocaine in 2006 from the hull of a vessel which transited NZ en-route to Australia is a prime example of the value of such an approach," Ms Mahuta said.

 

Both Ministers also agreed to work together to continue building the capacity of Customs agencies throughout the Pacific region.

 

“It is essential that Pacific nations possess the skills and technology to be able to tackle emerging problems such as terrorism, drug and people smuggling,” Mr Debus said.

 

“Both of our Customs agencies face large increases in cargo volumes and passenger numbers at ports and airports in coming years.  In addition, criminal networks are becoming more sophisticated,” Ms Mahuta said.

 

Ms Mahuta said initiatives to tackle these developments jointly, rather than in isolation, recognise that the challenges are not unique to either side of the Tasman.
