NZ On Air’s annual Local Content report shows the highest ever levels of local content on New Zealand television for the second year in a row, Broadcasting Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

Trevor Mallard welcomed NZ On Air’s 2007 Local Content report released today.

"Total local content hours increased to 10784 in 2007, up 529 hours over 2006. This is also nearly double the 6142 hours under the National government in 1999, and shows this government's commitment to supporting local kiwi content on New Zealand television," Trevor Mallard said. 

Government provides support for local television content by funding through NZ On Air of $71.6 million for the 20007/08 financial year and through direct funding to TVNZ of $15.1 million per annum and through Te Mangai Paho of $41.1 million for 2007/08.

"When the collation of local content hours started in 1988, there were only two channels showing a total of 2111 hours local content. I am pleased that public demand for New Zealand programmes on our screens alongside significant government support for local content has seen this level increase so dramatically. Meaning that across six free-to-air channels, Kiwis can still find and view their own stories.

"I am particularly pleased to see a 52 hour increase in children’s programming. It’s important that New Zealand children have access to quality New Zealand programming.

"Local content on television is a vital part of ensuring a strong national identity. The Labour-led government is committed to ensuring the ongoing availability of high local content levels."
