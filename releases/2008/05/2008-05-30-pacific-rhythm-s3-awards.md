Tomorrow night’s S3 Pacific Music Awards are a fantastic opportunity to honour and celebrate the creative talents of our Pacific people, says Pacific Island Affairs Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

“Music is an integral part of life for Pacific peoples, with singing and dancing woven into the very fabric of our Pacific way of doing things.

“Our Pacific artists are vibrant, dynamic and full of potential. These awards acknowledge the success of Pacific artists, and encourage our young Pacific musicians to aspire to excellence,” Laban said.

A key focus of the government's Pacific Economic Action Plan is seeking opportunities and development aspects of emerging and creative industries for Pacific people.

“Our government recognises the significance of providing educational, social and economic opportunities for Pacific peoples through artistic development. We see colour, life and energy in Pacific arts and music, but we also see a platform for the economic development of Pacific communities,” said Laban.

The S3 Awards complement a range of initiatives such as Starmap, a website for and about Pacific artists, which will be launched later this year. The website will provide a place for potential, emerging and established Pacific artists to gather together and share experiences, opportunities and information.

“It is also fitting that the awards are being held on the last day of New Zealand Music Month. I was honoured to be this year’s winner of Arts, Culture and Heritage Associate Minister Judith Tizard’s annual New Zealand Music Month Quiz, which encourages MPs, their families and staff to become more aware of New Zealand music.

“I am looking forward to attending the awards ceremony and presenting the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs’ Lifetime Achievement Award.

“It makes me very proud to be part of an event which showcases Pacific music and recognises the wonderful achievements of our Pacific artists,” Laban said.
