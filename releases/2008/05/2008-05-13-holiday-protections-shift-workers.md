Shift workers and their employers will benefit from a bill going through parliament that will allow the transfer of public holidays, Labour Minister Trevor Mallard said.

"This bill demonstrates again our Labour-led government's commitment to New Zealand workers. It follows on from our recent moves to boost protections for our most vulnerable workers – by enshrining meal and rest breaks and breastfeeding breaks into legislation.

"The Holidays (Transfer of Public Holidays) Amendment Bill being debated in Parliament today amends the Holidays Act 2003 in relation to the transfer of public holidays for employees whose work shift crosses midnight. It will ensure that when a shift spans two days, at least one of which is a public holiday, an agreement can be reached, by an employer and employee, so that the public holiday can be recognised on one whole shift.

"This legislation is needed following a recent Supreme Court decision which found that an employer and employee cannot agree to transfer a public holiday from a day listed in the Holidays Act to another day. This was not the intent of the act, and not being able to transfer public holidays is having a particularly disruptive effect on shift-based operations.

"It means that in these businesses, many employees whose work shift crosses midnight are not able to enjoy a full shift as a public holiday.  And many shift-based operations are experiencing increased production and payroll costs as a result. 

"It means employees' wages have to be calculated at differing rates for an entire shift when the shift crosses into a public holiday.  Presently, where a business chooses to close down on the public holiday their employees may be required to work up to midnight when the public holiday starts, and complete their shift from midnight at the end of the public holiday.

"This goes against the government's intention in the Holidays Act to promote balance between work and other aspects of employees’ lives.

"This bill will ensure that employers will have the flexibility to transfer a public holiday in line with their business needs and that employees working shifts that span two days are able to enjoy the application of a public holiday to one whole shift.  It is supported by both Business NZ and the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions," Trevor Mallard said.
