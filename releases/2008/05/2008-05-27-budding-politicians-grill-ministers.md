Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta and Statistics Minister Darren Hughes were on the receiving end of Young Persons’ Question Time at Parliament today.

 

“It’s always interesting to be on the receiving end of questions from our young people because you’re hearing different viewpoints on topics that of interest to them,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

Young Persons Question Time is one of dozens of events planned for Youth Week 08 and was attended by a group of 12 – 15 year-olds.

 

The questions ranged from the top priorities for youth, to the state of the environment, the use of methamphetamine or ‘P’and the recently signed Free Trade Agreement with China.

 

“This is a good opportunity for young people to ask questions about topics that interest them, and it was good to get such a great variety of questions on various issues,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

“The whole focus of Youth Week is encouraging relationships between young people and the communities they’re part of.

 

“Now they’ve had a taste of it, this may also encourage these young people to think about a career in politics. It’s about letting them know that they can make a difference if they’re prepared to put in the work,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

Darren Hughes said he was encouraged by the response from the young people.

 

"It was fantastic to be with a group of young people who are not only interested in today but who are also thinking about the future," Darren Hughes said.

 

“These are the kind of young people we should see more of in the newspapers and on TV because they are the real future of our country."
