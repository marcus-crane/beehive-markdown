Pacific Island Affairs Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said she was extremely proud to see that our Pacific sports stars were finalists at last night's Dominion Post Wellington Sportsperson of the Year Awards.

"The awards are an opportunity to celebrate and recognise excellence and achievements in sport in the Wellington region, acknowledging the contribution of athletes, coaches, officials, volunteers and administrators from all levels of sport," Laban said.

Victor Vito was a finalist for the Emerging Sportsperson of the Year, and both Ma'a Nonu and Frances Solia were finalists for the Personality of the Year award.

"Who could forget Victor's winning try at the Wellington 2008 NZI Sevens. While he destroyed Samoa supporters' hopes of victory, he gave all of us Kiwis much to celebrate.

"Both Ma'a and Frances are known for their big smiles, supporting their communities and their enthusiasm and leadership," said Laban.

"It is fantastic that these three top sportspeople who are role models and ambassadors for our Pacific communities were recognised for their enormous contribution to both the Wellington region and our nation," Laban said.
