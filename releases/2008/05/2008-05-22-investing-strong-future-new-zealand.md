Budget 2008 invests in the Government’s plan for a strong, sustainable future for New Zealand, Prime Minister Helen Clark said today.

“The Budget brings tax relief for individuals and families who are doing their best to manage the cost of living pressures at the petrol pump, the supermarket checkout, and in the rent or mortgage”, Helen Clark said. 

“The Government’s previous eight budgets have been marked by careful stewardship of the economy. Now when faced by global economic uncertainty, the strength of the New Zealand economy enables us to prioritise the needs of Kiwi families young and old, and continue to invest in our common future.

“The Budget enhances public investment in education, health care, social agencies, and other important services.

“It features major investment to support the roll out of a world-class broadband network, and the largest ever public investment in science and research to boost innovation and sustainability in the food and pastoral sectors. There is significant investment in upskilling our workforce.

“Investments in sustainable homes and communities, and in planning for our response to climate change, build on work already underway.

“New investments are made in the promotion of our arts, culture, and heritage – so critical to New Zealand’s unique national identity. Our international presence through foreign affairs outreach is greatly enhanced.

“Budget 2008 is a budget which addresses both the pressures of today, and the needs of future years”, Helen Clark said.
