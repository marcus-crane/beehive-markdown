The Auckland leg of a nationwide roadshow informing businesses about how to make the most of the China Free Trade Agreement was filled to capacity this morning, Trade Minister Phil Goff said.

Government agencies Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise organised the series of events as part of a range of Government initiatives aimed at supporting Kiwi businesses keen to move into or expand in China.

"The first day of the two-day Auckland event, which started today, was oversubscribed. About 300 people from local businesses registered for day one and are taking part, which meant an additional 50 had to be encouraged to attend one of the other legs in Hamilton, Christchurch and Dunedin. One hundred and eighty three people have so far registered for day two, tomorrow," Mr Goff said.

"I am delighted at the great interest shown by New Zealand companies in taking up the unique opportunities the FTA with China presents us with. It is important for New Zealand exporters to fully exploit the competitive advantages from being the first developed country to have such an agreement with China.

"The roadshow follows the launch of the all-of-government ChinaFTA.govt.nz Website, which has received around 184,000 hits in seven weeks, also indicating the strength of interest in the opportunities opened up by the agreement.

The Wellington event, which ended yesterday, attracted 250 people over two days," Mr Goff said.  

The two-day events include interactive workshops which provide valuable information for businesses to take the next step in developing capability in the vast and growing China market.

Presentations include an outline of the content and impact of the agreement and offer practical advice on doing business in China, including case studies from New Zealand companies knowledgeable of the market.

The all-of-government website [www.ChinaFTA.govt.nz](http://www.chinafta.govt.nz/) provides detailed information on the agreement including useful information about tariff level reductions.
