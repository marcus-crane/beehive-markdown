This government continues to invest in education so our young people can successfully meet the challenges of the 21st Century.

The government is investing $182 million in operating funding, and $33.5 million in capital funding, over four years for an extra 762 teachers, delivering on our commitment to reduce class sizes for new entrants to one teacher per 15 students.

“We know that school is a big step for youngsters. This funding will ensure they have the best education start possible,” Education Minister Chris Carter said.

Schools get an increase of $171.6 million over four years in Operations Grant funding, a 5 percent increase which includes $65.3 million over four years to help meet the cost of Information Communications Technology (ICT).

“ICT is a vital part of our education system. We must prepare our students for a world with rapidly changing technology and this funding is an important part of doing that,” Chris Carter said.

The government also continues to invest in early childhood education, with an extra $63.6 million over four years to help services meet increased costs, reducing the need for these to be passed to parents. The government’s school property programme, meanwhile, receives operating funding of $20.8 million over four years, and capital funding of $74.7 million over the next three years, to complete nine new schools announced in Budget 2007 and to begin construction on two new schools, 130 new classrooms, and to modernise existing school property.

Major initiatives in special education include the provision of $18.4 million of operating funding over four years for students with high needs and the provision of $7.3 million of operating and $659,000 of capital funding over four years to expand the newborn hearing screening programme. The government will also redirect $6.1 million over four years of existing operating funding to provide extra specialist staff to support blind and vision impaired students.
