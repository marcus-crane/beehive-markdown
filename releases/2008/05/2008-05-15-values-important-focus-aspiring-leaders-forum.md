“It is great to see so many of our future leaders gathered together in one place to learn from each other and from some of New Zealand’s current business, media, community and political leaders,”  Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta said.

Nanaia Mahuta today welcomed the delegates for the third Aspiring Leaders Forum at Parliament. The Forum brings together 100 of the country’s aspiring young leaders for the four-day forum in Wellington.

 

She said the Aspiring Leaders Forum is a proactive approach to work towards developing future leaders and is based on similar models run in the United States, Australia, Europe and Norway.

“This forum provides an opportunity for young leaders to think and take action on issues that affect their community and the type of society they want to live in,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

“This year, there is a focus on faith and values and the differences they make to young people’s approach to leadership.  It’s also a great opportunity to establish relationships with our future leaders.”

 

Nanaia Mahuta said the Forum will offer aspiring leaders life-changing experiences and mentoring and will encourage them to reach their potential.

 

“I would like to acknowledge the organisers of this forum and the volunteers who have given their time to assist and work with these young leaders,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

“It’s important to celebrate our young people and the Labour-led government is committed to ensuring young people have a voice and have the chance to develop their talents and build creative, satisfying lives.

 

“They are our future leaders. Events like this are worthwhile investments in helping them develop their skills, which in turn will enable them to make a valuable contribution within their communities - and our country.”
