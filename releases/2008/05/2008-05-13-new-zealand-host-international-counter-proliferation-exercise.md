New Zealand's ability to deal with shipments concealing weapons of mass destruction (WMD) will be put to the test in a major international exercise hosted in Auckland in mid-September, Customs Minister Nanaia Mahuta announced today.

 

"Exercise Maru will test our ability to halt shipments containing chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, their delivery systems or dual-use goods (goods that can be used to make such weapons) as they cross New Zealand's borders and will also test our post-seizure procedures," Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

The exercise will take place in the Hauraki Gulf and the Port of Auckland between 15-19 September and forms part of New Zealand’s commitment to the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI).

 

The PSI is an international counter-proliferation initiative that aims to prevent weapons of mass destruction, their delivery systems and related materials ending up in the wrong hands. 

 

“This month marks the fifth anniversary of the PSI and we've chosen to use this milestone to announce Exercise Maru,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

“New Zealand has been a strong and active supporter of the PSI.  Our participation in PSI helps deter would-be traffickers from targeting New Zealand and the wider Asia-Pacific region.”

 

“Exercise Maru is an across-government exercise bringing together the New Zealand government agencies including the New Zealand Defence Force, New Zealand Police, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Ministry of Defence, along with international partners, and local industry,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

“Hosting the exercise will assess our capability and arrangements for responding to any attempts to smuggle dangerous weapons, or their components into our country.”

 

New Zealand will welcome a number of fellow member countries of the PSI to Auckland to participate in the exercise, as well as member and non-member observers from the Asia-Pacific region, Nanaia Mahuta said.
