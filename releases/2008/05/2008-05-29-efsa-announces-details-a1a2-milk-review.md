Food Safety Minister Lianne Dalziel has welcomed today's announcement by the European Food Safety Authority ([EFSA](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/EFSA/efsa_locale-1178620753812_home.htm)) that it has published the terms of reference for its review of the science behind the A1/A2 milk debate.

EFSA says it will undertake a 'self mandate' on the potential health impact of beta-casomorphins and related peptides in food and has published terms of reference for the review on their website.

This issue has been raised in New Zealand in the context of A1/A2 milk.

"I am very pleased that an agency of EFSA’s high standing has decided to undertake this review which is to be completed by the end of 2008," Lianne Dalziel said.

The EFSA study will consider beta-casomorphins and related peptides in a range of foods, including milk, cereals and other foods of vegetable origin. These compounds are present in A1 milk which is the main type produced by New Zealand herds. They are not present in A2 milk which currently makes up about 10 per cent of the milk supply in New Zealand.

EFSA plans to review available evidence of a possible association, or lack thereof, between these compounds and a range of non-communicable diseases such as type 1 diabetes, heart disease and autism. Following the review, and depending on its outcome, EFSA will decide whether any further research will be needed.
