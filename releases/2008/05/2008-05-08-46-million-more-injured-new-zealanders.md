The Government has allocated an additional $46.5 million over four years to support injured New Zealanders, ACC Minister Maryan Street announced today.

"The additional money will go to non-agency providers of home-based support. Predominantly that means friends and family members of injured people who have given up aspects of their own lives to care for the injured person," said Maryan Street.

The types of care covered include attendant care, child care and home help.

"Earlier in the year I announced extra money for contracted agencies providing home-based support and so I am delighted to now be able to do the same for individuals working in this important area."

ACC funds non-agency care for around 14,000 claims each year.

Hourly rates for non-agency providers will increase from $11.28 to $13.82 for home help, attendant care (level 1) and child care; and from $13.54 to $16.59 for attendant care (level 2).

The different rates reflect different skill level requirements and issues around complexity of care.

The new rates will be effective from and back-dated to 1 April 2008.

"With an ageing population, longer life expectancy and a widespread preference among clients for living at home rather than in residential care, demand for home support services has been growing steadily."
