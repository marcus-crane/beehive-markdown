Former Automobile Association president Robin Morton has been appointed as the Road User Representative on the Road Safety Trust Board, Transport Minister Annette King announced today.

 

Mr Morton, of Auckland, was associated with the New Zealand Automobile Association for more than 20 years, serving on the board for eight years and as president for three.

 

“Robin Morton has a huge interest in road safety issues and brings an impressive range of skills, insight and experience in the transport and roading area.  I believe he will make a significant contribution to the work of the Trust,” Ms King said.

 

Mr Morton’s appointment is for three years from 1 June 2008. He was nominated by the New Zealand Automobile Association.

 

The Road Safety Trust funds community safety initiatives, research and study awards, training, education, private sector technological developments beneficial to road safety, and any other specific projects that the Trustees consider are likely to contribute to improved safety on roads.

 

Road Safety Trust chair Yvonne Sharp said today that she looks forward to welcoming Mr Morton’s “wealth of experience,”
