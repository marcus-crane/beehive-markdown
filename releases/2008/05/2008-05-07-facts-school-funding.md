Funding for the day-to-day running of schools has gone up every year under the Labour-led government, Education Minister Chris Carter says.

Since 1999, operations grant funding has risen by just over 40 percent. Taking account of inflation, the figure is almost 20 percent.

Last year the government increased the operations grant by 4 percent, or approximately $139 million. That increase followed a 3 percent increase in Budget ’06.

“While some North Shore schools have said they don’t have enough funding, increases in operations grants have been significant,” Chris Carter said.

 “It would be nice to have unlimited funds but schools will always be asked to make decisions about allocation of resources because taxpayer dollars must be spent carefully.”

Along with regular increases in operations grants, education spending overall has risen from $5.7 billion to $9.8 billion since 1999.

An extra 5000 teachers have been provided, over and above those required for roll growth. Those teachers are also paid better, with average increase in salaries of almost 40 percent.

School property funding has been boosted by $238.3 million, providing 180 new classrooms, new gymnasiums and modernisation of existing schools. Funding has been provided for 14 new schools.

A further review of the grant had been completed and advice on that review from the Ministry of Education would inform decisions for Budget ’08, the Minister said.

“This government understands the vital importance of education to this country’s future and has invested accordingly. This year’s budget will again see increases for education.”
