Bringing local companies together with experts from Google, Virgin Comics & Animation and Intel is an opportunity to drive growth for New Zealand’s digital content industry, Economic Development Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

Speaking at the opening event of the first such international  two day workshop held  in New Zealand, Pete Hodgson said,  “The workshop will help New Zealand digital businesses to develop and manage their ideas and build relationships with key contacts in global markets.”

Run by the organisation X Media Lab, the workshop will bring local and international experts in digital media together with New Zealand companies, to help build product and company strategies.

The government has supported the event as part of its work to boost growth in the digital sector.

“Holding X Media Lab in Wellington is an opportunity to make connections to drive local and international growth for New Zealand companies.

“Individuals, communities and businesses throughout New Zealand are creating, using and sharing content in digital form. The focus of the lab is the commercialisation of ideas that are not only innovative but that meet market needs in and beyond New Zealand.”

New Zealand companies and project teams participating in the Lab range from Sidhe Interactive, the largest interactive entertainment studio in New Zealand; to television production company the Gibson Group; and digital display company Lumen Digital.

 The teams workshop their project ideas alongside international and local mentors, who include Trade Me founder Sam Morgan; Marcelino Ford-Livene, General Manager of Interactive Content at Intel Digital Home Group; Google’s Tom Duterme; Suresh Seetharaman, Founder and President of Virgin Comics and Virgin Animation; and new media pioneer Chris Adams.
