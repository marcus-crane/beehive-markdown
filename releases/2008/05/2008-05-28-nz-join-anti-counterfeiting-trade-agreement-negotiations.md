New Zealand will participate in developing a multi-lateral agreement with the aim of combating the growing global trade in counterfeit goods and pirated products, Associate Commerce Minister Judith Tizard announced today.

“International enforcement of intellectual property rights is important to New Zealand’s trade interests which suffer losses through counterfeiting and piracy. We look forward to working towards combating this serious global problem,” she said.    

The new Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) will be developed with a number of New Zealand's key trading partners.

“Improved enforcement of intellectual property rights will benefit both businesses and consumers. Counterfeiters and pirates not only steal income from our businesses and artists, they also jeopardise the health and safety of New Zealand consumers by selling shoddy goods," Judith Tizard said.

The agreement is intended to establish a common standard of enforcement of intellectual property regulations among nations committed to anti-counterfeiting.

The decision to participate in the development of the ACTA reinforces this government’s intention to strengthen the existing enforcement measures in the Copyright Act 1994 and the Trade Marks Act 2002.

A decision will be taken on whether to sign the treaty when it is finalised. Meanwhile the Minister is calling for public submissions on the agreement.

“I would like to encourage the public to identify specific matters that should be the focus of the agreement for New Zealand.”

Further information can be found on the following link and submissions can be sent to: [trademarks@med.govt.nz](mailto:trademarks@med.govt.nz).

The closing date for submissions is Monday, 14 July 2008.
