Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark today congratulated the New Zealand National Maritime Museum on completing its fundraising efforts to build a special tribute to yachting great, Sir Peter Blake.

Speaking at an event in Auckland to mark the completion of fundraising for the new museum wing, Blue Water Black Magic – A Tribute to Sir Peter Blake, Helen Clark said funding for the $8.9 million project had been drawn from public and private sources.

“The government has committed $2.5 million to the project and the Auckland City Council $2 million. Extensive fundraising over the last two years has made up the balance.

“The government is very proud to support this project, along with so many other funders, private and public. With funding complete, we now look forward to the building phase.

“This very special wing at the New Zealand Maritime Museum will be a great asset, not only for Auckland, but also for all New Zealand. The exhibition will focus on learning programmes and interactive activities designed to inspire teamwork and success in young New Zealanders. It will also tell the proud story of New Zealand yachting and of those who have contributed to its high profile internationally.

“My hope is that in finding out more about Sir Peter’s remarkable life and achievements, young New Zealanders will see what can be achieved with determination and through setting clear goals. Peter Blake went all the way to the top of international sailing.

”In fulfilment of Sir Peter’s wishes the wing will house NZL 32, the winning yacht in the 1995 America’s Cup Campaign.

“I commend the National Maritime Museum and Te Papa for their collaboration on the project. The new wing will stand at the heart of the waterfront in our City of Sails,” Helen Clark said.

The new wing is expected to open in August next year.
