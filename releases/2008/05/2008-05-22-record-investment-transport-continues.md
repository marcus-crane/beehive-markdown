This government’s major reinvestment in transport infrastructure takes another step forward from July 1.

Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Transport Minister Annette King said that some of the highlights of today’s budget include funding for a 10–year Canterbury Transport Regional Implementation Plan and funding for regional development initiatives in both Northland and Tairawhiti.

Other highlights include new funding to strengthen transport regulatory agencies, support for the Civil Aviation Authority to continue to meet its best practice international obligations and an expansion of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission’s capability and services.

“This government has invested heavily in rebuilding New Zealand’s transport infrastructure,” the Ministers said.

“We are currently funding the largest ever investment in our road network and have increased public transport funding by almost 1100 per cent from the $41 million spent in 1999/00.

“Building-up the public transport capability benefits not only the travelling public, but also assists other objectives such as helping New Zealand meet its commitments to reduce the effects of global climate change and to improve New Zealand’s competitive position as a trading nation.

Highlights of Budget 2008’s investment in rebuilding New Zealand’s transport infrastructure include:
