Customs Minister Nanaia Mahuta will today head to Australia for her first official meeting with Australian counterpart, Home Affairs Minister, Bob Debus.

 Nanaia Mahuta will attend meetings in Canberra and Sydney during the visit.

 

“New Zealand and Australia have always enjoyed a close relationship, and I’m looking forward to the opportunity to build on this, and encourage the long-standing co-operation between Australia and New Zealand Customs,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

 

“We’ve already seen the strength of these ties with some New Zealanders now able to use Australian Customs’ SmartGate system in some Australian airports and we want to build on the strong ties we already have.”

 

Nanaia Mahuta said passenger processing, streamlining Trans-Tasman trade and collaboration on Pacific issues are among the issues to be discussed at the meeting.

 

“It’s important that we make the most of the opportunities available to advance and improve the border processes between our two countries,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

 

Nanaia Mahuta, who is also Minister of Local Government, Youth Affairs and Associate Minister for tourism, will hold meetings in Sydney with New South Wales Local Government Minister Paul Lynch, senior youth officials and Tourism New Zealand officials.

 

Nanaia Mahuta returns to New Zealand on Thursday.
