New Zealanders are standing tall in New York today with the presentation of the prestigious Roosevelt International Disability Award to the Governor-General at the United Nations this morning, said Disability Issues Minister Ruth Dyson.

The award has been won by the New Zealand Government  in recognition of the progress made in advancing the participation of disabled people across New Zealand society. 

“This success owes much to the initiatives that have been introduced under the New Zealand Disability Strategy, which has been developed as a partnership between the Government and disabled people and their representatives,” Ruth Dyson said.

“The strategy has set a new standard for participation by disabled people not only in New Zealand but internationally. It has achieved a great deal in a relatively short time, thanks largely to the dedication and commitment of disabled people across the country.

“This Government is committed to the principle that everyone is entitled to live a life to the fullest extent of his or her abilities. That is what the strategy is all about.

“This is a proud day for disabled people in New Zealand and for everyone who has contributed to the successes of the Disability Strategy,” Ruth Dyson said. 

Ruth Dyson is hosting an informal celebration to mark the occasion with disability sector representatives at midday today. The Governor-General will host a formal celebration on 15 May at Government House, where he will present the Bust of Roosevelt received as part of the award to Minister Dyson to place in Parliament.
