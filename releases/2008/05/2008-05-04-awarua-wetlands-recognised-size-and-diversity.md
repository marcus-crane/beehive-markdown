Conservation Minister Steve Chadwick today congratulated Southland’s local communities for their commitment to maintaining the internationally recognised [Awarua wetland](http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/summary.aspx?id=46310).

 

Steve Chadwick joined private landowners, local and central government agencies, runanga and community groups to officially celebrate the newly renamed Awarua Wetlands.

 

“It is marvellous to see groups and communities come together to protect this diverse area. Less than 10 per cent of New Zealand’s wetlands remain; Awarua raises the bar for wetland restoration and expansion in New Zealand,” said Steve Chadwick.

 

The government recently announced that an additional 16,000 hectares of wetlands would be recognised as ‘Wetlands of International Importance’ under the [International Ramsar Convention on Wetlands](http://www.ramsar.org/).  Only six New Zealand sites have received that recognition, and the Awarua wetland is the largest of these.

 

Awarua wetland is now five times larger than when it was first registered in 1976, and includes forests, tussock lands and sand dunes, as well as estuarine areas and swamps that extend from south of Invercargill to Toetoe Bay. 

 

“The international recognition of Awarua is testament to the local community’s collaboration to achieve sustainable development. Where else can you stand on a beach, enjoying alpine flowers and plants and listening to the calls of dozens of species of birds?”

 

 The wetlands include private land as well as public lands and the ceremony will recognise the contributions made by the owners of those lands.

 

“These wetlands are not just of value to science, but are an important playground for Southland.  They teem with wildlife, are a key whitebaiting area, and provide a stunning landscape for recreational use.  I hope that many more New Zealanders will learn to value these areas, and take the opportunity to explore them.”
