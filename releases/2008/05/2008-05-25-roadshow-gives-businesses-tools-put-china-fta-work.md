A nationwide roadshow to begin tomorrow will help businesses make the most of New Zealand’s Free Trade Agreement with China, Trade Minister Phil Goff said today.

 

“Kiwi businesses have an edge on competitors because of New Zealand’s first mover advantage and the huge exposure we gained in China during the FTA signing,” Phil Goff said.

 

“But we have to capitalise on this advantage and make the FTA work for us. That is why the Government has organised this roadshow.

 

“The roadshow, organised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, is part of a range of Government initiatives aimed at supporting Kiwi businesses keen to move into or expand in China.

 

“It follows the launch of the all-of-government ChinaFTA.govt.nz Website, which has received 159,000 hits in six weeks, and the start of a new Beachheads China programme.

 

“Those seeking to break into the China market face challenges of working in a different culture and legal system, but the potential benefits to New Zealand are huge. The two-day interactive workshops will provide valuable information for businesses to take the next step in developing capability in the vast and growing China market.

 

“Presentations will provide insight into the content and impact of the agreement and offer practical advice on doing business in China, including case studies from New Zealand companies knowledgeable of the market.

 

“There is a wealth of information to be found among New Zealand business people who already have in-depth experience of China, and a real willingness to share,” Phil Goff said.

 

The all-of-government website [www.ChinaFTA.govt.nz](http://www.chinafta.govt.nz/) provides detailed information on the agreement including useful information about tariff level reductions.
