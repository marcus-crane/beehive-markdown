The New Zealand Government is deeply concerned to learn that the Australian High Commissioner in Fiji has received a second politically-motivated death threat, Prime Minister Helen Clark said today.

"The difficult environment in which foreign diplomats find themselves working in Fiji makes these threats particularly troubling.  I expect the Fiji Police to investigate them thoroughly as a matter of priority.

"The Australian High Commissioner, James Batley, has received two death threats – on 7 May and 15 May.  They appear to have been made by people who object to the Australian Government’s policy on Fiji.

"The Australian Government has rightly reiterated that it will not be intimidated by threats of this nature.  As the Forum Chair, Prime Minister Sevele of Tonga highlighted today, Forum members, including New Zealand, are doing their best to help Fiji hold parliamentary elections in March 2009.  Death threats against those helping in that process help no-one at all.

"I am also very disappointed that the Fiji Interim Government authorities have rejected a perfectly reasonable request from the Australian Government to be allowed to send Australian close protection personnel to Fiji to provide additional security to their High Commissioner.

"The threats also highlight some of the more general concerns about the security climate in Fiji.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s advice to New Zealanders living in or travelling to Fiji continues to highlight the risk and the need for caution.  This advice is being kept under regular review.

"The New Zealand High Commission in Suva is also taking sensible precautions in respect of the safety of its staff members", Helen Clark said.
