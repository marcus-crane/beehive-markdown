Energy Minister David Parker today released the government’s revised and updated Government Policy Statement (‘GPS’) on Electricity Governance.

The GPS has been revised and updated to be consistent with the New Zealand Energy Strategy and New Zealand Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy, as well as to reflect changes that have taken place since the GPS was released in October 2004.

The Government Policy Statement sets out the objectives and outcomes that the government wants the Electricity Commission to give effect to. 

“We’ve set a target of generating 90 per cent of electricity from renewable sources by 2025, and we’re asking the Commission to look at how wind generation can best be integrated into the system, alongside geothermal and other forms of generation. This will include considering where grid upgrades are necessary to get renewable electricity from point of generation to where it is used.

Reserve energy policy has also been updated, David Parker said.  “The Electricity Commission carried out a comprehensive review of reserve energy policy last year, which has helped the government in making decisions to improve the way the Commission monitors security margins.”

“Finalising the updated GPS for Electricity Governance included the input of a wide range of stakeholders. Their input has been important to ensure the GPS is relevant and reflects current understandings,” said Mr Parker.
