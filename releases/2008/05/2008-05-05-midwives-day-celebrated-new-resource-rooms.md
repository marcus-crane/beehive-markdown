The [New Zealand College of Midwives'](http://www.midwife.org.nz/) resource centre will provide education and a sense of community for midwives, pregnant women and new mothers, Associate Health Minister Steve Chadwick said today.

 Steve Chadwick today opened the midwifery resource centre at Royal Oak in Auckland.

 "The Government is encouraging moves to support people's health care needs at a primary health level, and I am happy to see that the College is adopting this approach.

 “Opening the Centre is a great way to mark International Midwives Day. The rooms will allow easy access to a variety of community support groups, and is part of ongoing improvements in maternity services.

 "New mothers are empowered by the education they are receiving and are revelling in the control they now experience when it comes to planning their pregnancies and births.

 "Today, on International Midwives Day, I want to thank midwives for the crucial contribution they make to our communities. Last year there were over 60,000 births in New Zealand and midwives were involved in most of them.

 “This government continues to see the lead-maternity-carer model as a valuable patient-centred model of care, and we are committed to finding ways to overcome midwifery workforce shortages.

 “Midwives show a deep commitment to the women and families they care for and a commitment to high standards of professionalism. It’s a big, emotional, time-consuming, sometimes frustrating, but ultimately fulfilling job and I congratulate all midwives for their efforts.

 “I also thank the New Zealand College of Midwives, who play a fundamental role in supporting midwives and work with a variety of organisations to ensure high quality maternity and midwifery services in New Zealand.”
