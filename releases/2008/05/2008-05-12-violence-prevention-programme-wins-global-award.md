Associate Health Minister Steve Chadwick today congratulated the Aotearoa New Zealand Peace Foundation on their recent Global Peacebuilders’ Award.

“This is fantastic recognition for the Foundation’s ‘Cool Schools’ programme, and for the efforts of schools, students and families in addressing this important issue.”

The Ministry of Health funds the Foundation to deliver the  ‘Cool Schools’ programme which trains students, teachers and parents in conflict resolution and peer mediation skills.  Schools involved with the programme consistently report reduced playground conflict and increased use of the ‘Cool Schools’ techniques in the classroom. 

“Students must be safe at school, and have a secure environment in which to learn. We know that young people who witness or experience bullying, violence or abuse are at risk of poorer mental and physical health, so programmes such as this are extremely important to the well-being of our children.”

The Ministry of Education has a number of anti-bullying initiatives, including information on the Team-Up website, the Traumatic Incidents Management support for schools, and the Eliminating Violence programme that takes a whole-of-school approach. The Ministry of Education supports the ‘Cool Schools’ programme in decile 1-3 schools. 

“‘Cool Schools’ is one of fifty international violence prevention projects to receive the Global Peacebuilders’ award and deserves celebration,” Steve Chadwick said. 

The ‘Cool Schools’ programme started in 1991 with 12 schools in the Auckland region and has grown to include 1600 primary, intermediate and secondary schools.  The Ministry of Health has funded the programme since it began, and in 2008 will provide additional funding to expand into another 500 schools in the South Island and Wellington regions.
