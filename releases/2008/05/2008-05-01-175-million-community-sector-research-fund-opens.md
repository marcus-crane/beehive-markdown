Internal Affairs Minister, Rick Barker today declared the new Lottery Community Sector Research Fund open for applications.  $1.75 million will be made available this year for community organisations applying to undertake research or evaluation projects about New Zealand communities.

"The Lottery Community Sector Research Fund presents an excellent opportunity for   community based organisations to develop a knowledge base and carry out research into the communities they serve," Mr Barker said.

"Lottery funding is all about supporting communities. This Lottery Grant Board Fund will help them keep their finger on the pulse and will ensure that they have new, robust ideas to apply to the operations of their respective organisations.

"The Fund will strengthen the research capacity of community organisations and allow them to develop the scope and nature of the research they want to carry out themselves.

"We are a fast-changing society and it’s very important that we keep up with what is happening for all New Zealanders – young and old, and for all our ethnic groups. The Fund will also be available to strengthen the practice of Maori-centred and kaupapa Maori research," Mr Barker said.

There are two stages for applications to the new fund. The first stage is to submit a Research Idea to be considered by the distribution committee.  The committee will then invite its selected applicants to submit a Full Research Proposal.  Applications for Stage one, the Research Idea will open on 1 May 2008 and close on 1 July 2008.

Invitations to selected applicants to lodge a Full Research Proposal will be issued after the committee meets to make its selection in late August.
