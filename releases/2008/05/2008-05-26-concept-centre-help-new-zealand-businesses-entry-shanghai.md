New Zealand businesses looking to China will have a new entry point in the market with the opening of a New Zealand Concept Centre in Shanghai in October this year, Trade Minister Phil Goff said today.

"New Zealand is expanding its footprint in Asia in order to increase the volume and value of trade with China. The Concept Centre is an essential part of this strategy and provides a physical presence for New Zealand in Shanghai in the lead up to the Shanghai Expo in 2010," Phil Goff said.

"The centre will help companies build connections and create a long-term presence in China via Shanghai, which is the heart of commercial growth in the world’s largest market.

"By enabling Kiwi exporters to get in on the ground and increase visibility, it will help New Zealand businesses maximise the benefits of the Free Trade Agreement with China.

"Companies looking at moving into or expanding in the China market will have a function and event space, a demonstration kitchen, meeting rooms and hot desks available for use in the centre.

"They will have the opportunity to demonstrate the best of New Zealand capability in a highly branded and professional New Zealand environment. This opens the door for business, trade and investment opportunities which can be leveraged and supported on an on-going basis through the Concept Centre.

"In a complex and rapidly evolving market such as China the key is to get a good first-hand understanding. It is also critical for New Zealand companies to take a collaborative approach to make an impact.

"The Concept Centre will be invaluable for New Zealand companies both looking to explore the market and build connections," Phil Goff said.

New Zealand Trade and Enterprise’s (NZTE) expansion plans for China include the opening of up to five more offices across the country in the next four years, the development of the Beachheads network programme in China and participation in trade show Food and Hotel China.
