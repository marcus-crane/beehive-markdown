Tertiary Education Minister Pete Hodgson has welcomed the appointment of Professor Roy Sharp as TEC chief executive. 

"Professor Sharp has extensive tertiary sector knowledge and understands the importance of tertiary education's interaction with industry, business, iwi and other key groups,” he said.

“I am confident that Professor Sharp will drive greater achievement in tertiary education and ensure the success of recent changes to the way tertiary education is funded. “

“I would also like to take this opportunity to thank outgoing TEC chief executive Ms Shiner for her contribution to tertiary education in New Zealand over the past three years. She has worked in partnership with the tertiary education sector to put in place strong foundations for the future," Pete Hodgson said.   

Professor Sharp will join the TEC in August 2008.
