Māori are entrepreneurial, youthful and dynamic and Budget 2008 aims to harness this potential and grow it to help secure Māori now and into the future, says Minister of Māori Affairs, Parekura Horomia.

“Budget 2008 supports making changes arising out of a review of the Māori Trustee and [Māori Trust Office](http://www.tpk.govt.nz/en/about/mto/), which includes establishing the Māori Trustee as a stand alone organisation and the formation of Māori Business Aotearoa New Zealand.”

“During [consultation](http://www.tpk.govt.nz/en/consultation/reform/maoritrustee) on the changes proposed by the Māori Trustee and Development Bill, there was overwhelming support for the Māori Trustee to be established as a stand-alone organisation. Budget 2008 invests $19.4 million operating and $4.4 million capital funding into making this possible.”

“Budget 2008 also sets aside $40.5 million in capital funding into **Māori Business Aotearoa New Zealand** (MBANZ) in 2008/09, who will establish services for Māori including providing business support, identifying opportunities for Māori economic development, and some facility for loans to Māori businesses.”

"MBANZ will work with Māori to progress their economic aspirations, building upon and expanding their already strong place in New Zealand’s economy.”

“Budget 2008 is also about ensuring the safety of our communities, establishing new facilities to showcase Māori culture to the world, providing support for Māori participation in the health sector, as well as investing in the Treaty negotiations process to accelerate progress”

This government is providing $14.9 million in operating, (of which $6.8 million (including 2007/08) is funded through reprioritisation in Vote Māori Affairs), and $2.3 million in capital funding to strengthen the capacity and capability of Māori wardens.

“[Māori wardens](http://www.nzmwa.co.nz/) do a great job in many communities,” Minister of **Justice**, Annette King, said.

“They have had a very positive impact in regions like south Auckland, and the government will now support wardens across all regions, and will enhance their effectiveness even further by providing a total of 20 vans.”

New facilities in Wellington and Whakatane will be established to both showcase and educate tourists by providing them with a unique chance to experience a part of our indigenous Māori culture.

$7 million dollars has been allocated to support the establishment of a Wharewaka on the Wellington waterfront, near Te Papa, to provide a significant venue for Māori cultural events. Another $7 million will go towards supporting the erection of the Mataatua Whare at Whakatane which will go along way in supporting cultural tourism in the region.

“As well as investing in the promotion of Māori culture, Budget 2008 invests in preserving Māori records. $1.4 million has been allocated to Te Mangai Paho to preserve historical Māori footage, and $2.7 million in operating funding over the next four years will help the Māori Land Court/Waitangi Tribunal to access and preserve physical records.”

Minister of **Health** David Cunliffe announced $12 million dollars over the next four years to build a competent, capable, skilled and experienced Māori health and disability workforce.

“This funding of $12 million over four years will be used to increase the numbers and skill base of Māori nurses including a leadership course, specialist skills in primary care and well child services. In addition, a range of initiatives aimed at secondary school students will be developed to encourage and recruit Māori students to take up health as a career, including supporting Māori students studying at tertiary institutions.”

Budget 2008 will also support further acceleration of the treaty settlements process, with $5.3 million over four years invested in Vote **Treaty Negotiations**. This builds on the renewed momentum in settling historic treaty claims, including significant progress on the Waikato River, Port Nicholson, and Central North Island forestry claims.

Budget 2008 invests in Māori across the board. This investment in the future of Māori Development will provide real opportunity for Māori to realise and reach their full potential in all aspects of development, now and into the future.
