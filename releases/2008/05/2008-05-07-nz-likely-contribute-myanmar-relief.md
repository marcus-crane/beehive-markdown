Prime Minister Helen Clark today expressed concern at the large number of lives lost and devastation caused by the cyclone in Myanmar.

 

"Myanmar is seeking international assistance to deal with this disaster and is discussing with the United Nations what assistance is needed and how it can best be delivered," Helen Clark said.

 

"The New Zealand Government is closely following developments and is willing to play a part in disaster relief.

 

"The government will make a financial contribution through NZAID to an appropriate UN agency, as soon as arrangements are in place. We want to ensure the relief gets to those most in need.

 

"The size of the contribution from NZAID is expected to be announced shortly," Helen Clark said.
