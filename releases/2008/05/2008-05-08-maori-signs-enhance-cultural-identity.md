Associate Minister of Health has welcomed the newly developed Maori signs by New Zealand’s Deaf and Maori communities saying that it will enhance the special identity of Maori with hearing impairment.

“Having Maori signs in the New Zealand Sign Language will enable our Maori who are hearing impaired to maintain another level of their cultural identity. It is great to see that signs have been developed to express concepts relating to Maori culture.”

While there is no separate Maori Sign language, there are many Maori signs– such as powhiri, hangi, aroha and kaumatua. The signs for Maori concepts are unique because they are expressed in a slightly different way to the common New Zealand Sign Language structure, they incorporate a tikanga Maori way of saying things.

“With this week being New Zealand Sign Language Week, it is important to raise the awareness of hearing issues affecting our people. Of the people under the age of 19 diagnosed as deaf, 39% of them are Maori.”

New Zealand Sign Language week extends from 5 – 11 May 2008.
