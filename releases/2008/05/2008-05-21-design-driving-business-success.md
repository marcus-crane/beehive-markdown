Ci Munro, a division of Tourism Holdings Ltd (THL), has become the 100th business accepted into New Zealand Trade and Enterprise’s Better by Design programme, Economic Development Minister Pete Hodgson said today. 

The programme assists high growth New Zealand companies to increase profitability and exports through the use of design. “Integrating design principles across business, from product development to production processes, branding and leadership, helps New Zealand companies to build their brands and differentiate their products in competitive international markets,” says Pete Hodgson.

Hamilton-based Ci Munro manufactures motor homes, caravans, and holiday homes, and a range of custom trucks and vans, which are sold in New Zealand and Australia. General Manager Paul Hebberd says, “The Better by Design programme will support our plans to expand our product offering and increase export revenue.”

Since Better by Design was launched in 2005, companies of all sizes and across all industries have entered the programme. Businesses who have committed to using design as a tool for innovation and international growth by signing up to the programme include Comvita, Macpac, Gallaghers, Skellerup, Design Mobel, Methven, Villa Maria, Wellington Drive Technologies, and Tait Electronics.

Since its establishment, Better by Design has:

• Helped clients report an average increase in export revenue of 23%.

• Helped 81% of clients release new products since joining the programme.

• Co-funded more than 55 design projects, which include branding, new product development and organisational design, for clients.

“Better by Design is about government helping businesses compete internationally to drive economic growth,” says Pete Hodgson.

The programme has received $14.5 million in government funding over its first five years. For more information about Better by Design, visit www.betterbydesign.org.nz
