A new information roadshow aimed at helping small businesses to start up, better manage themselves and grow with help from the government arrives in Palmerston North today.

Hosted by Statistics Minister, Darren Hughes, this event is the third of a series of twelve regional meetings. Mr Hughes says he hopes small businesses will decide to attend to find out how the government can help them improve their bottom line.

“The Manawatu has a history of vibrant, educational opportunities and small businesses account for a third of all employment in the region,” says Mr Hughes. “This is an excellent opportunity for them to discuss their business problems with agencies that can help them.”

Small Business Minister, Clayton Cosgrove launched the roadshow and the new, complementary publication*, Start, Manage and Grow your Business*, in Dunedin last week to a full house. Both the information events and the booklet were inspired by feedback from the small business community that finding information about the wide range of government programmes and services on offer can be difficult.

“The booklet contains case studies of business people who solved their business problems with help from government agencies,” Mr Cosgrove said. “The people in these case-studies want to share their stories so other business owners won’t have to say, I wish I’d known about that.”

“There is a wide range of information and services available for small businesses, but often, because of the volume of information available, people don’t know where to find it or what exactly they can get,” said Mr Cosgrove. “In response we have gathered the key services and programmes provided by the government into one useful publication.”

Joining Mr Hughes at the information forum will be representatives of the key government agencies relevant for small businesses. Local business people will be encouraged to ask questions, solve problems and find out about what is available.

Small businesses are the backbone of the New Zealand economy, accounting for 97% of all firms and employing 31 percent of the workforce.

Mr Hughes said that Statistics New Zealand was also engaged in helping small businesses through the *Go Stats* seminars and the *Making Information Freely Available* initiative.

*Go Stats* aimed to encourage small-to-medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to use statistical information to grow their business.

While the *Making Information Freely Available* initiative, launched in May 2007, has already made more than $19 million worth of statistical information products available for free.

The Manawatu Chamber of Commerce is co-hosting the event at Arena 2 in Palmerston North from 4.30pm. Media are welcome to attend.

Mr Hughes, the MP for Otaki, will also be hosting the Otaki information roadshow on Thursday 5th June at the Otaki Memorial Hall.
