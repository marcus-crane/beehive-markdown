Acting Prime Minister Michael Cullen today extended New Zealand’s sympathy to China following a large earthquake which has affected the country’s central region.

Reports so far suggest more than 8,000 people are dead and 20,000 injured.

“On behalf of New Zealanders the government extends its sympathy and condolences to China following the tragedy that has struck the country’s central region,” Dr Cullen said.

“China has immense capability of its own but New Zealand stands ready to assist in an appropriate way if we are asked.

“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our Embassy in Beijing are contacting New Zealanders known to be in the affected area and who have registered on the government’s Safetravel website: [www.safetravel.govt.nz](http://www.safetravel.govt.nz/), to check on their well-being.

“Currently we know of 15 New Zealanders registered as being in the Sichuan and Chongqing provinces.”

New Zealanders concerned about the welfare of family members known to be in the region can call the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade on (04) 439 8000 and ask to speak to a consular officer.
