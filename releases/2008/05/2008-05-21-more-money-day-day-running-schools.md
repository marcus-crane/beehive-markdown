Budget 2008 sees schools get a significant boost in funding to help meet their day-to-day running costs and provide computer technology, Education Minister Chris Carter announced today.

Budget 2008 boosts schools’ Operational Funding by 5 percent, or $171.6 million over the next four years.

Included in this increase is $65.3 million over four years to help schools meet the costs of Information Communication Technology (ICT).

“Our education system needs to prepare our young people for a rapidly-changing world, particularly in the area of information technology, and to provide a world class education for all students,” Chris Carter said.

“This money will help schools provide technology and a wide range of other resources, everything from library books to support staff.”

The additional ops grant funding is the biggest increase since 2001, and follows increases in both of the past two years. The government’s total investment in schools’ operational funding is $4.7 billion over the next four years.

A funding review in 2006 found schools had cost pressures around ICT and support staff. Sector representatives had significant input into the review.

“All up over the past three years operational funding under the Labour-led government has risen every year and since 1999/2000, over 40 percent and when that’s adjusted for inflation, the figure is close to 20 percent,” Chris Carter said.

The Minister announced the new funding at Auckland’s Matipo School which will see its operational funding rise from $283,094 in 1999 to $423,178 January 1 next year. A large secondary school such as Rangitoto College on Auckland’s North Shore will see its operational funding increase from $1,983,570 in 1999 to $3,993,326 next year.
