State Services Minister David Parker announced today that the government has agreed to introduce common leave provisions in public service employment agreements.

“The government’s purpose in introducing common leave provisions is to provide consistency across the public service.

“Establishing common provisions also means that departments won’t waste time and effort re-negotiating these provisions,” David Parker said.

The provisions, which apply to the 35 public service departments, have been agreed as part of the Partnership for Quality Agreement between the government, the Public Service Association, and the State Services Commissioner.

These leave provisions are already in place in many departments, and will be introduced across the rest of the public service as part of regular departmental negotiations, or by variation, prior to 1 July 2009, and are expected to apply to all employees by then.

“Departments are generally expected to absorb any increased costs within their baselines and to seek productivity enhancements in the ongoing process of bargaining,” David Parker said.
