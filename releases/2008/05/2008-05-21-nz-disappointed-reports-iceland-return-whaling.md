New Zealand is disappointed that Iceland is considering a return whaling Conservation Minister Steve Chadwick said today.

 

Steve Chadwick was commenting following recent media reports that indicated Iceland is considering issuing commercial whaling quotas for 2008.

 

In August last year Iceland announced that it was suspending commercial whaling due to a lack of demand for whale meat.

“New Zealand welcomed Iceland’s decision to halt whaling last year, and I am troubled that Iceland may be reversing its decision,” Steve Chadwick said.

 

“Iceland’s resumption of whaling would come at a time when the IWC is making a genuine effort to build trust, and would undermine the trust developed through recent diplomatic efforts.

 

“New Zealand is in contact with other pro-conservation countries to discuss responses to Iceland’s possible resumption of whaling.

 

“Dialogue, diplomacy and direct negotiation are New Zealand’s best opportunity to influence whaling, and the International Whaling Commission (IWC) is the best forum for New Zealand to promote the protection of whales. I am looking forward to progress at the IWC meeting in June.”
