The government has again demonstrated its commitment to the future of New Zealand’s primary industries, Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries, and Biosecurity Minister Jim Anderton said today.

The Budget has confirmed the capital investment of $700 million to the [New Zealand Fast Forward fund](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/feature/nz+fast+forward), the new research, development, and innovation plan for the future of New Zealand’s pastoral and food industries which was announced in March.

It also allocated $10.1 million to set up a national animal identification and tracing system and farm register. This funding is capital expenditure. In addition, the government will invest another $13.2 million over four years for operating costs for the traceability system.

Jim Anderton said NZ Fast Forward is the largest ever boost to innovation funding in New Zealand’s history and will help transform New Zealand’s primary industries to meet future challenges.

“These industries are the backbone of our economy, and we need them to continue to be so well into next century.”

Other Budget 2008 allocations to primary industries include:

- extra trade training places for students intending to work in primary industries;
- extra funding to boost trade negotiations capability within the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry and Biosecurity New Zealand;
- more observers on fishing boats;
- funding to develop plan changes to promote aquaculture; and
- boosting programmes to assist companies exporting.
