Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister released her annual Parliamentary Music Month quiz today.

“I am an equal opportunity quizmaster, I want everyone to have a fair chance at answering this year’s quiz. Take your time, have some fun with it.  That’s what New Zealand Music Month is about,” said Ms Tizard.

"My annual quiz is a fun way to get my Parliamentary colleagues, their friends, family and staff, to really think about all sorts of New Zealand music.  So it doesn’t matter if they have to search the internet to complete it!

"We’ve come a long way since we set quotas to ensure our music was heard.  It's hard to believe that back in 2001 only 6% of album sales for the month were by New Zealand acts.  These days our home-grown acts makeup around 20% of album sales.

"“I challenge everyone to go to (or create) one live music event in May, where ever in the world they may be.  Let's all sing, play, watch, listen and buy New Zealand music this month.

"Enjoy the rest of NZ New Zealand Music Month," she said.
