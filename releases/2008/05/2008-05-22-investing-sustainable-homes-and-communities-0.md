Investing in sustainable homes and communities is part of this government’s vision for a sustainable nation, and Budget 2008 builds on work already underway to help New Zealanders use our resources wisely, and protect our precious natural environment.

 

**Energy Efficiency**

Budget 2008 allocates $23.3 million operating and $22.4 million capital funding over four years towards energy efficiency investments to assist businesses, households, motorists and consumers, Energy Minister David Parker and Housing Minister Maryan Street said.

As announced last week, the $22.4 million capital goes towards insulation and clean heating retrofits for state houses. The $23.3 million operating funding includes:

- $9.3 million for energy saving programmes for **businesses**
- $6 million over four years for another 32,000 **insulation retrofits** for low-income families in homes
- $3 million for energy performance **labelling on consumer appliances**
- $1 million for the **Vehicle Fuel Economy** Labelling programme
- $4 million contingency is set aside for additional energy efficiency initiatives

An additional $5 million in 2008/09 (through the Electricity Commission) goes towards the interest-free loans programme, which provides insulation and clean heating retrofits for middle-income households.

“Well-insulated homes are healthier and more comfortable to live in. It’s an investment that pays us back through fewer hospital admissions, reduced respiratory illness and lower electricity and gas bills,” David Parker and Maryan Street said.

 

**Climate Change**

Budget 2008 will also help New Zealand respond to climate change in other ways.

$37.4 million over five years, plus $5.6 million in capital funding between 2007/08 and 2008/09, goes towards delivering the Emissions Trading Scheme and linking it to international markets.

A further $1 million over four years will assist communities and local government to adapt to the physical impacts of climate change.

Transport Minister Annette King also announced the government will provide $4.8 million over four years to enhance weather forecasting for severe weather events.
