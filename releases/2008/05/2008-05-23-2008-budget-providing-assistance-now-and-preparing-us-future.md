“The 2008 Budget announcement shows that this Labour-led Government is, as always, focusing on prudent financial management to see us through the financial hard times that families have been facing” says Minister of State Mita Ririnui.

The 2008 Budget Announcements were made yesterday by the Labour-led Government amidst much anticipation.

Minister Ririnui says yesterday’s budget announcements come during a time of great unrest caused by food, petrol and interest rate increases but that the Labour-led Government have thought long and hard about what would suit the average New Zealander and have tailored the 2008 budget to that effect.

Tax cuts and Working for Families increases are a certainty under the Governments announcements and Minister Ririnui says he is happy that the budget allows for financial breathing space for Maori families struggling coping with the pressures of today.

“Over the past few years we have made sure to hold a tight grip on spending and to concentrate on adequately funding the services that all New Zealanders need. During these years, we have refrained from over spending and we are now in the position to offer some relief to families while continuing to maintain public services.”

“For many of us, every dollar counts. The Government is not just looking at increasing budgets within the Government sectors; we are also committed to insuring that families have extra money in their own pockets.”

The Government also announced yesterday that there will be substantial budget increases for the social service, health, education, housing sectors, areas that have high Maori representation and high Maori needs. Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations will also receive an increase in funding to support further acceleration of the treaty settlement process.
