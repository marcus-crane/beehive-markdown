Funding certainty for future New Zealand film and television production is boosted under a new scheme announced as part of today’s budget by the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Helen Clark.

“The new Screen Production Investment Fund will support the production of strong New Zealand-driven creative screen projects with significant levels of private and international finance,” Helen Clark said.

“The new Screen Production Investment Fund is allocated $27.8 million over four years in new funding, plus $26 million from existing funding to the New Zealand Film Commission, providing a total of $53.8 million.

“The Screen Production Investment Fund will provide a 40% grant on qualifying New Zealand feature film production expenditure, and 20% on qualifying New Zealand television and other screen production expenditure – primarily drama/comedy, documentary and animated content.

“Internationally, competition for production finance is intense. Many major screen producing nations, including Australia, now operate a domestic incentive scheme similar to the new Fund. If New Zealand is to maintain and develop a strong domestic screen industry and keep our filmmaking and television talent here, we have to be able to compete effectively. The Screen Production Investment Fund is a strong new incentive for producers and investors in New Zealand films”.

“This investment will boost domestic production and maintain a strong platform for our talented New Zealand industry. It complements the range of other government support for domestic screen production, including funding through the Film Commission, NZ On Air, and Te Mangai Paho.

“The new fund will also help maintain the foundation of industry capability in New Zealand which is necessary to continue to attract large offshore productions to New Zealand through the Large Budget Screen Production Grant.”

“The new fund will be administered by the New Zealand Film Commission and will begin on 1 July 2008. Targeted minimum and maximum qualifying expenditure thresholds and other eligibility criteria relating to New Zealand content will apply to the grants. Consultation with the New Zealand screen industry on the detailed criteria being undertaken over the next three weeks,” Helen Clark said.
