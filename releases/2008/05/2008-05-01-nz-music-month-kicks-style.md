New Zealand Music Month 2008 was launched today by Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard. The launch, organised by the New Zealand Music Commission, was held at Cuba Mall’s the Matterhorn and featured a live performance by Chris Knox.

“The 2008 New Zealand Music Month is the 8th so far and looks to be the biggest yet,” said Judith Tizard. There have been 450 gigs confirmed for Music Month with 60 new titles being released either in or around May this year. 

This years Music Month begins with NZ Artists occupying the top two spots on the NZ Music Chart, with Shihad’s new album at #1 and Flight of the Conchords at #2. “A fantastic start to May,” she said.

“Music Month 2008 boasts something for everyone, from the NZSO to Moana & The Tribe, to Gray Bartlett and Shihad. There are also plenty of new bands on offer.”

“It's hard to believe that back in 2001 only 6% of album sales for the month were by New Zealand acts.  But within six years our home-grown acts now makeup around 20% of album sales,” said Judith Tizard.

NZ Music Month aims to increase exposure for Kiwi musicians on television and radio, by both public and private broadcasters. It has been remarkably successful in doing this.

One in five albums sold last NZ Music Month was by a New Zealand artist. Sales of New Zealand music almost doubled during NZ Music Month 2007. For the past three years, a New Zealand song has been at number 1 on the radio charts for the entire month of May.

“The Labour-led government is committed to supporting New Zealand music.  Following on from the success of New Zealanders embracing their own music, New Zealand is now taking music to the rest of the world.  Tonight, in New York you could see Crowded House supported by Don McGlashan, Opshop in Los Angeles, Collapsing Cities or Cut Off Your Hands in London.  It’s truly remarkable how much times have changed.” says Judith Tizard.

"“I challenge every New Zealander to go to (or create) one live music event in May, where ever in the world they may be.  Let's all sing, play, watch, listen and buy New Zealand music this month."

Judith will release her annual New Zealand Music Month Quiz to MPs when the House resumes on 13 May.
