Today the first ever Terms of Negotiation combining historical Treaty claims and foreshore and seabed claims, was signed in Wellington by the Crown and Ngāti Pahauwera.

 

Ngāti Pahauwera are a confederation of hapū centred around the Mōhaka River in the northern Hawke’s Bay.  

 

Attorney-General and Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Hon Dr Michael Cullen signed the Terms of Negotiation on behalf of the Crown with representatives of Ngāti Pahauwera this morning.

 

 “Ngāti Pahauwera and the Crown have achieved a major milestone towards settling the grievances of the past” Dr Cullen said. “Our goal is to establish a lasting framework to manage the interests of Ngāti Pahauwera in the public foreshore and seabed, lands and rivers.

 

“The Terms of Negotiation signed today will provide a platform upon which the Crown and Ngāti Pahauwera can build a positive relationship. Successful relationship-building with Ngāti Pahauwera can only contribute to the wellbeing of New Zealand as a whole.”

 

“Today’s signing is a welcome addition to the latest steps by the government to settle all historical Treaty claims by 2020. In addition to significant progress made on settling Treaty claims, two foreshore and seabed Heads of Agreement were recently signed under the Foreshore and Seabed Act.

 

“Together these achievements show that this is a positive and dynamic phase for Crown-Māori relationships in New Zealand” said Dr Cullen.

 

The Crown and Ngāti Pahauwera aim to reach an agreement in principle by September this year. It will be an intensive negotiations process, however both parties are confident this ambitious timeframe can be met. The Crown and Ngāti Pahauwera have prioritised the specific redress sought by Ngāti Pāhauwera as key components of the negotiations.
