New Zealand will make an immediate contribution of $500,000 to New Zealand aid and relief agencies involved in Myanmar, Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today.

“The scale of this devastating cyclone disaster is beginning to emerge and the thoughts of all New Zealanders are with the people of Myanmar.

“New Zealand NGOs have strong connections with those working on the ground in the region and making this money available will strengthen their response.

“Our priority is to make sure our assistance gets to those who are most in need, and NGOs are able to reach those communities quickly,” said Helen Clark.

The $500,000 will be made available from NZAID’s Humanitarian Action Fund.

“The United Nations and the International Federation of the Red Cross are continuing to monitor the impact of the disaster and are beginning to assist survivors.

“While the international community stands ready to assist, the response is being slowed by the military regime which has so far refused to waive visa requirements for aid workers. This is delaying relief reaching those injured and made homeless by the cyclone.

“The New Zealand Government is continuing to monitor the situation closely. It is likely further assistance will be made available through NZAID once further assessments have been made,” said Helen Clark.
