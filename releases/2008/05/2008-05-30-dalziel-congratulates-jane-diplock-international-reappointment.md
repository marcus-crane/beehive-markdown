Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel today congratulated Securities Commission Chair Jane Diplock on her re-election as executive chair of the [International Organisation of Securities Commissions](http://www.iosco.org/) (IOSCO). 

"It is gratifying to see New Zealand represented at such a high level, and is a testament to IOSCO's faith in Jane's abilities that they should elect her for a third term" Lianne Dalziel said.

"The work done by IOSCO in promoting mutual assistance, cooperation, information exchange and effective surveillance is vital not only to New Zealand but to the international financial community. The importance of the work done by IOSCO can not be underestimated.

Jane's role as Chair of IOSCO is important in raising New Zealand's profile amongst the many members of IOSCO and within the international community of financial institutions. It is also important in promoting New Zealand as a well regarded securities market".

"I wish Jane all the best during her term of office and trust that IOSCO will continue to flourish under her leadership".
