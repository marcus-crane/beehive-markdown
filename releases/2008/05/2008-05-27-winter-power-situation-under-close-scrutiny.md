Low hydro lake levels continue to create concern for the government, Energy Minister David Parker said today. 

“Although the east coast drought is broken, it remains very dry in key southern hydro catchments. Unless we have some increased in-flows in the South Island hydro catchments in the next three weeks, further conservation measures will have to be looked at.”

The Minister said he was pleased to see the power industry working proactively to manage the situation.  Today a website set up by the industry was made available to provide the public with up-to-date information on electricity generation and storage levels.

“Work is continuing on the full range of contingency measures that could be used to help us through this drought year. 

“If we do need to move to the next level of response, it’s important we consider all options.

The Minister noted the electricity system was proving its resilience by coping with a situation of near-record low lake inflows, combined with unexpected power constraints earlier in the year when major thermal plant was unavailable for use.
