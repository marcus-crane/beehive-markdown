The Minister of Health David Cunliffe says he is satisfied that Medsafe is taking a consultative and transparent approach over health products coated with the contaminated blood thinner Heparin.

 

“The country’s clinical networks were all informed about a possible risk from injectable heparin in April and to the best of our knowledge there is none of the contaminated injectable Heparin in New Zealand. In addition, information about the possible use of contaminated heparin in the coatings of medical devices was distributed to DHBs last week,” said Mr Cunliffe.

 

“A Medsafe Action Team has identified that only 1 medical device that is in contact with patients contains contaminated heparin in its coating. This device is an oxygenator used in heart-lung surgery.” ”

 

“It is also important to remember that none of the contaminated blood thinner used in injections has been distributed in New Zealand and the concern here is over one Heparin coated product used in cardiothoracic surgery,” said Mr Cunliffe.

 

“Expert advice is that clinicians should use uncontaminated products where possible, Replacement supplies of this device are not expected for at least two months and DHBs are taking steps to obtain an alternative to the affected devices.” 

 

“All the country’s DHBs and private surgical hospitals have been alerted to the contamination and the manufacturer of the affected device has already taken steps to inform DHBs to limit the use of the device.
