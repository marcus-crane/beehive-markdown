Health services will receive $750 million per annum in this year’s budget to focus on key areas within the health sector to ensure co-ordinated enhancement of services

“Health services are constantly changing and evolving, and what we are focused on is providing a strategic, cohesive national approach to further improving this country’s health services,” Minister of Health David Cunliffe said.

“Budget 2008 continues this government’s massive investment in health care for all New Zealanders: future proofing services, driving for quality, investing upstream in primary and public health, and focussing on children and youth – where early intervention counts the most,” Mr Cunliffe said.

- **Strengthening health services** we can trust – the sector will receive $2 billion over four years to future proof health services for population growth and cost increases. There will also be an additional $160 million over four years for electives (already announced).
- Actioning the **Agenda for Quality** – this will include $172.3 million over four years of investment for strengthened DHB collaboration and $40 million over four years for connected health Information Technology Systems
- Investing in **wellness and public health** – Including $52 million over four years to fight obesity, there will also be an additional $80 million over four years to implement next steps of the primary care strategy
- Investing in **early years and youth potential** – there will be $164.2 million over five years for HPV vaccinations, $79 million over four years for oral health services, $40 million for the pneumococcal vaccine.

“Health is not only about ensuring accessible health services exist for those people who fall ill, its also about keeping people well and giving them the information to make healthier decisions,” Mr Cunliffe said.

“This government has set its self the target of delivering a health service that is world class, and by delivering a combination of prevention and promotion programmes, increased elective services, more accessible primary care and increasing numbers of frontline medical staff we are heading in the right direction.”

Finance Minister Michael Cullen first signalled $750 million would be put into health funding in Budget 2008 [in 2006](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F25799).
