Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta is today saluting 12 Young New Zealanders chosen from across the country to be part of a special Youth Week ceremony at Parliament this evening.

The young people were chosen from more than 140 nominations for the *Celebrating Everyday Young New Zealanders* event. 

 

“I’m impressed by the quality of the nominations received from across the country, and this highlights the extent and variety of the many positive things young people are doing in our communities every day,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

Nanaia Mahuta said those nominated for *Celebrating Everyday Young New Zealanders* made marked contributions to their communities, from environmental work, volunteering, entrepreneurship, mentoring, sporting/cultural success, to young people who had turned their lives around.

 

“Each of the nominees works hard to create quality relationships in their communities. All of them are passionate about making a difference,”  Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

The twelve young people, whose contributions are being celebrated are:

 

·        **Tuhulu 'Oe Mo'oni 'Isileli-Fo'ou (Pukekohe)**

·        **Ariana Denise Toetoe (Manurewa)**

·        **Vau Atonio ( South Auckland)**

·        **Te Rawhitiroa Bosch (Whaingaroa /Raglan)**

·        **Bryn Baz Tunohopu Palmer (Mount Maunganui)**

·        **Sian Te Riini (Rotorua)**

·        **James Tautuku (Hawera)**

·        **Paula Strickland- Laumemea (Porirua)**

·        **Harriet Salisbury (Wellington)**

·        **Josh Fitzgerald (Motueka)**

·        **Greg Sinclair (Westport)**

·        **Paula MacKenzie (Gore)**

 

‘‘It takes courage and commitment to use the skills you have to make a difference. From championing those less fortunate, challenging negative stereotypes, organising dance competitions, to being a volunteer fire-fighter, each of the young people nominated, have a great sense of community,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

“It’s great to know that through the relationships these young people have formed, more young people lives are enriched.”

 

Young New Zealanders are volunteering in a variety of ways through: their communities, sport, church, cultural groups and schools. Volunteering provides an opportunity for young people to develop valuable social and organisational skills and boosts self confidence. 

 

The 12 young people reflect the diverse nature of their communities and have contrasting achievements highlighting the variety of activities in which young people engage.
