Senior Citizens and Disability Issues Minister Ruth Dyson today paid tribute to Grey Power President Graham Stairmand, who died this morning.

“Graham has been a staunch advocate for older people over many years, both locally in Christchurch and nationally.

“I have greatly valued his contribution to policy discussions over the years, not just on matters concerning older people but also on disability issues.

“As well as being Grey Power’s national president, Graham had been health spokesperson for Christchurch Grey Power through most of the 1990s. He used his extensive knowledge of the health and disability sector, not to mention a strong determination, to encourage greater integration of services for older people.

“I was very pleased to see him included in the reference group for the development of the New Zealand Disability Strategy.

“Graham never swayed from his commitment to advance local and national issues on behalf of older people. He never minced his words. You always knew where you stood with him but he was always courteous and never lost his sense of humour.  

“Graham’s contribution will be deeply missed.

“My sympathies and condolences go out to Graham’s family on their sad loss,” said Ruth Dyson
