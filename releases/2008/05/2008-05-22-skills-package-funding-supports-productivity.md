Productivity increases are being supported by this government with $168 million in operating funding over four years to provide workers with the right skills for the complexities of the modern workplace, Tertiary Education Minister Pete Hodgson and Employment Minister Ruth Dyson said today

“Better skilled workers are also more motivated and more effective workers. They have ongoing opportunities within the workplace to keep up to date with their technical workplace literacy, language and numeracy skills,” Pete Hodgson said.

“Investing in these skills leads to higher work quality, better health and safety, and improved staff retention. Equally important, it enhances family and community life,” Ruth Dyson said.

The Ministers said the funding would be used to implement the Skills Strategy, a partnership between government, Business New Zealand, the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions and the Industry Training Federation.

The New Zealand Skills Strategy discussion document was launched on

29 April 2008.

The strategy will look across the entire skills spectrum – from increasing literacy and numeracy skills to how those skills are best used.
