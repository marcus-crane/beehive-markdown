Youth Week is a fantastic opportunity to acknowledge the enormous contribution of our Pacific youth, who are energetic, full of aspiration and have a great future ahead of them, Pacific Island Affairs Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.

"The theme of Youth Week is supportive relationships with young people. We all have a role in supporting and developing our young Pacific people who are the foundation on which our families and communities are built," Laban said.

"It is important to connect with our youth, and encourage them to reach their full potential, because their success is crucial to our success as a nation," Laban said.

Census 2006 figures show that the Pacific population is youthful, urban-centred and growing in number, with the median age of a Pacific person 21 years, compared to 36 years for the total New Zealand population.

"The Pacific population is growing faster than the average population and will become a larger proportion of the workforce which is an important factor to consider when looking at our future contribution," Laban said.

"Our government is committed to providing the pathways to harnessing the enormous potential of our Pacific youth. We know our young people have a critical role to play in the success of our country both now and in the future."

In addition to continued investment in education, skills development and community services supporting our young people, Budget 2008 invested $10.4 million over four years to support Pacific Health Providers, with part of this funding specifically to establish health programmes focused on Pacific youth.

"Through investment in education, training and the wellbeing of our Pacific youth the Labour-led government is committed to ensuring that our young people are heard, supported and encouraged to realise the bright futures ahead of them.

"Youth Week is an opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate our Pacific youth and all those who support them, like New Zealand born Samoan Ross Taylor who scored a brilliant 154 not out for the Black Caps over the weekend," Laban said.

Pacific communities are encouraged to get involved in the youth-related activities taking place throughout the country this week. Information on Youth Week events is available at www.youthweek.co.nz
