Sport and Recreation Minister Clayton Cosgrove congratulated New Zealander Scott Dixon today for his win at one of the world’s most prestigious motor sporting events, the Indianapolis 500 race in the United States.

Dixon, who is the first New Zealander to win Indy 500, took pole position from the start and lead for most of the 200 laps, winning by 1.75 seconds ahead of Vitor Meira from Brazil.

“This is a huge achievement for Scott Dixon and the Chip Ganassi Racing Team. A win such as this doesn’t happen without years of preparation, expertise and hard work,” said Mr Cosgrove.

“Today’s win will become part of New Zealand’s rich sporting history and will be idolised by many aspiring motor sport participants and enthusiasts. This shows once again that New Zealanders can compete and win against the very best in the world,” said Mr Cosgrove.

Dixon, like many of the greats of New Zealand motor sport, started racing in karts at the Mt Wellington track in Auckland many years ago. He progressed through New Zealand’s motor sport ranks winning New Zealand Championships in Formula Vee, Formula Ford and Formula First. Dixon has won prestigious MotorSport NZ race awards, including the Steel Trophy in 1996 and 1997 and the Jim Clark Trophy in 1999, 2001 and 2004.

"This is a great example of a New Zealander starting from humble beginnings and working his way to the top of his sport. It shows that with determination and the right support you can achieve at the highest levels,” Mr Cosgrove said.

In 2004, the national sport organisation MotorSport NZ began a much acclaimed Annual Academy which aims to develop the next generation of motor racing legends.

The Government, through its agency SPARC, invested $166,000 into MotorSport NZ and invested $36,000 into KartSport New Zealand in 2008.
