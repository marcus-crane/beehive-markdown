"I am delighted with the results of this year's annual NZ Music Month quiz and it is obvious that MPs are thinking about the range of music on offer in NZ," Judith Tizard said.

"The aim of the quiz is to have some fun and to help MPs, their families and staff become more aware of New Zealand music.”

This year Luamanuvao Winnie Laban is the winner, scoring 98% in Judith Tizard's annual NZ Music Month quiz.  There was only half a point between her and Ron Mark, Jim Anderton and Doug Woolerton.  Pita Paraone, Lianne Dalziel, and Winston Peters also deserve a mention for their high scores.

“Most of the MPs sought help from staff, families or friends, but whether they already knew the answers, asked around or did their research, I’m pleased that my colleagues took such an interest.  And the intense rivalry between MPs and their offices to win just adds to the fun!" Judith Tizard said.

It's hard to believe that back in 2001 only 6% of album sales for the month were by New Zealand acts.  These days our home-grown acts makeup around 20% of album sales.

"New Zealand music has well and truly arrived.  Creative industries like music are a vital plank in growing an innovative New Zealand and they are also a high growth sector in our economy," she said.

“I congratulate all who entered and I hope they enjoyed finding out more about the wonderful New Zealand music that surrounds us."
