Tertiary Education Minister Pete Hodgson said today the New Zealand Vice-Chancellors’ Committee assertions are unfortunate because in the 15 years to 2006 funding for universities has not declined but rather has increased by 87%.

 The government acknowledges the gap between New Zealand and Australian academic salaries which has been with us now for some decades.

 In recent times that gap has actually narrowed, though only slightly.

 The New Zealand government’s Budget is due to be announced next Thursday.
