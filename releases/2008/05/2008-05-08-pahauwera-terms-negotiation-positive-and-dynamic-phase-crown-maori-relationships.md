“Today we achieved a major milestone towards settling the grievances of the past and establishing a lasting framework to manage the interests of Ngāti Pahauwera in the public foreshore and seabed, lands and rivers” Minister of Maori Affairs, Parekura Horomia said today.

 

The first Terms of Negotiation combining historical Treaty claims and foreshore and seabed claims, was signed in Wellington by the Crown and Ngāti Pahauwera. Ngāti Pahauwera are a confederation of hapū centred around the Mōhaka River in the northern Hawke’s Bay. 

 

Attorney-General and Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Hon Dr Michael Cullen signed the Terms of Negotiation on behalf of the Crown with representatives of Ngāti Pahauwera this morning.

 

 “The Terms of Negotiation signed today will provide a platform upon which the Crown and Ngāti Pahauwera can build a positive relationship.”

 

“Combining both the historical treaty claims and foreshore and seabed claims is an innovative and exciting new approach accelerating the process for providing redress to iwi Maori.”

 

“I would like to congratulate Ngati Pahauwera, and would like to recognise the hard work all those involved. I wish them well in progressing this journey further,” Mr Horomia said.
