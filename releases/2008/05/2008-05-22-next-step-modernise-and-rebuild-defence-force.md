Budget 2008 invests $276.4 million in the New Zealand Defence Force over the next four years as part of our sustained efforts to rebuild and modernise the defence force under this Government, Defence Minister Phil Goff said today.

“This investment will be used primarily to grow the New Zealand Defence Force and retain existing personnel. The $276.4 million is out of the $4.6 billion Defence Sustainability initiative [started by this government in 2005](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F22874).

“This latest instalment in a consistent stream of funding under this government gives Defence the means to fully modernise and enhance its capability, to be able to meets New Zealand’s defence and strategic objectives at home and overseas.

“Funding for recruitment and retention is essential for Defence, like most other large organisations, to be able to attract and retain people in the face of a tight labour market, brought about by record low unemployment,” Phil Goff said.

The Ministry of Defence will also continue the purchase and upgrade of capital equipment including NH90 Helicopters, the P3 Orion fleet, C-130 Hercules and Boeing 757s for use by the New Zealand Defence Force.

“This is funded from the $4 billion 2002 – 2012 Long Term Development Plan started by this government,” Phil Goff said.
