The first in a series of DVDs looking at climate change gives students a chance to produce their own news segment, Education Minister Chris Carter said at the launch of “Sustainability in Action” in Auckland today.

The "Sustainability in Action" DVD, produced by TV3, aims to educate environment and media studies students about the effects of climate change. The series will be sent free to schools, with supporting materials for teachers developed by the faculty of Education (TEAM Solutions) at the University of Auckland.

“These DVDs will give students the opportunity to access footage on issues relating to climate change and then compile their own news segment and have the winning entry played on TV3.

“This is a great way for young people to not only get involved in the exciting world of television news but to increase their understanding of this major issue at the same time,” Chris Carter said.

TV3 is running the competition, where secondary schools can enter up to two films, with the selected one to two minute films playing on TV3’s news or current affairs shows later this year.

The DVD launch comes only one month out from World Environment Day 2008 which will be hosted by New Zealand for the first time. 

WED 2008 will help profile New Zealand as an international leader on issues of environmental sustainability, including developing understanding about climate change.  It will also demonstrate the leadership this government is showing on priority environmental issues, including the development of sustainability programmes in education.
