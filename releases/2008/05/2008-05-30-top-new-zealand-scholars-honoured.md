Education Minister Chris Carter congratulated New Zealand's top secondary school students at the annual Top Scholar Award Ceremony at Government House today.

The Governor General, The Honourable Anand Satyanand, presented awards to 28 students for their achievements in the 2007 New Zealand Scholarship exams.

Speaking at the awards ceremony, Chris Carter outlined the importance of a modern education system that stresses the significance of excellence and achievement as values and attitudes he wants to see all young New Zealanders strive for.  Our 21st century education system must promote achievement and success.

“The 28 young people here today are being recognised for their outstanding achievements and they all have a great deal to be proud of,” Chris Carter said.

The Premier Award is granted to the top five to ten students in the country. All have achieved a minimum of three results at Outstanding level.

All recipients were in the top 10 of candidates nationally for at least three subjects in which they received Outstanding Awards. This year, eight students received a Premier Award worth $10,000 for three years.

Top Subject scholarships were also awarded to students with the single highest score in each of the 27 Scholarship subjects.

Top Subject scholars will receive $2000 a year for three years.

All Scholarship recipients must be enrolled in tertiary study in New Zealand in the years they receive monetary awards.

“These dedicated young men and women have demonstrated a passion for learning and achievement that has stretched beyond what is taught in the classroom and I wish them all the best for their future endeavours,” Chris Carter said.
