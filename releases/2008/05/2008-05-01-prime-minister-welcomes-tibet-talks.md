Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that the New Zealand Government welcomes the announcement that Chinese authorities will meet with a representative of the Dalai Lama to discuss issues relating to Tibet.

"New Zealand has [consistently urged](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/parliamentary+notice+motion+re+tibet) the Chinese Government to enter into dialogue with the Dalai Lama and his representatives," Helen Clark said.

"I was able to put this position directly to Premier Wen Jiabao when we met earlier this month in Beijing.

"The New Zealand Embassy in Beijing was briefed on this development by China’s Foreign Ministry late last week.

"Naturally the scope of the discussions and the agenda will have a bearing on just how much progress can be expected. This fresh sign of engagement, however, is a step forward. My hope is that it will lead to real progress," Helen Clark said.
