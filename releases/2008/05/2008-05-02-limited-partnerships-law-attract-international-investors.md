Legislation establishing the new legal form of limited partnership has come into force from today making New Zealand an attractive place for international investors offering start-up finance for new businesses.

"This is a cutting edge limited partnership structure that will be recognised by international investors. It will help grow the local venture capital industry and attract venture capital investment from overseas. This in turn will help New Zealand firms to grow and will encourage the economic development which is a cornerstone of the Labour-led government's economic transformation agenda," Lianne Dalziel said.

Anecdotal evidence suggested that the absence of an internationally recognised limited partnership structure has been an impediment to New Zealand attracting venture capital investment. The new law should reverse that, Lianne Dalziel said.

Under the legislation the key features of the limited partnership structure include:

- a separate legal personality for the limited partnership;
- "general" partners who manage the limited partnership are liable for its debts and liabilities if the limited partnership itself is not able to satisfy those debts or liabilities;
- "limited" partners whose liability is limited to the amount of their investment so long as they don't take part in the management of the limited partnership;
- "safe harbours" that set out the activities that a limited partner may participate in without being deemed to have taken part in management and potentially exposing themselves to liability;
- a requirement for limited partnerships and overseas constituted limited partnerships to register with the Registrar of Companies; and
- the confidentiality of investors will be maintained as an incentive for investors and in line with many of the preferred international models.

The Limited Partnerships legislation was passed concurrently with the Limited Partnerships (Taxation) Bill, which establishes the tax treatment of limited partnerships and clarifies and simplifies the tax treatment applying to partnerships more generally. The limited partnership will be subject to “flow-through” tax status, meaning the partnership itself is not taxed. Instead, each partner is taxed individually at that partner's personal tax rate.

"The process we've engaged in has resulted in a good mix of widely accepted international standards which fit our local circumstances. It's an excellent outcome and has received very positive feedback from the industry," Lianne Dalziel said.
