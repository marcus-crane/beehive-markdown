New Zealand’s next Consul-General to Los Angeles will be career diplomat John Mataira, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

 

“The United States is a key economic partner for New Zealand, as well as an important source of tourists, and the Consulate in Los Angeles plays a critical role in advancing our business interests throughout the 13 western states of the US,” Mr Peters said.

 

“California and the West Coast are arguably the most dynamic growth areas of the United States in key aspects of the modern knowledge economy such as information, communications and environmental technology.

 

“This area is also well known for its leading research institutions and developed venture capital market,” Mr Peters said.

 

Mr Mataira is currently deputy director of the Economic Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and has previously been posted to Japan (twice), Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands.

 

He takes up his appointment in May, replacing Rob Taylor, who has returned to Wellington.
