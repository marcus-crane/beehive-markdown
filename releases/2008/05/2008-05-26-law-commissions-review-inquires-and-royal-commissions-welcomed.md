Law Commission’s latest report, A New Inquiries Act, tabled in Parliament today has been welcomed by Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker.

The Law Commission’s review focused on commissions of inquiry and royal commissions, which operate under the Commissions of Inquiry Act 1908, administered by Internal Affairs, and non-statutory ministerial inquiries.

In its report the Law Commission proposes draft legislation to establish two types of inquiries - public and government - to report on any matter of public importance. 

Public inquiries would be appointed by the Governor-General on major issues of concern to the public and government and the reports of these inquiries would be tabled in Parliament. 

Under the draft legislation government inquiries would be appointed by and report directly to Ministers.  They would deal with smaller and more immediate issues where a quick and authoritative answer is required by an independent inquiry.  Both forms of inquiry would enjoy the same legal powers and protections.

“The report is comprehensive and covers a range of issues including the appointment, status and conclusion of inquiries; procedure; powers of inquirers to obtain evidence; public access to inquiries and documentation; sanctions and offences; immunities for inquirers; and funding and administration of the inquiries,” Mr Barker said.

“The report is well researched and the Commission consulted widely. It also contains some interesting background on the history of inquiries in New Zealand. For example it is noted in the foreword that the first formal inquiry in New Zealand was held to determine the best site for the seat of government on the shores of the Cook Strait. The members of the enquiry were made up of Members of Parliament from the Australian colonies – as New Zealanders had exhibited too much bias on the issue.

"The government will give careful consideration to the Law Commission's recommendations and the draft Bill," Mr Barker said.
