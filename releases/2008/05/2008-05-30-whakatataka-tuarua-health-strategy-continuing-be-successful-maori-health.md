Associate Health Minister Mita Ririnui is delighted with the progress made by The Ministry of Health on their delivery and implementation of Whakatataka Tuarua – the national Maori health strategy, in this latest quarter.

The Ministry of Health released their quarterly report (1 Jan – 31 March) of Whakatataka which outlined that almost all of their initiatives for reducing inequalities in Maori health have been successful.

“I am delighted to know that Whakatataka Tuarua is on track with almost all of their milestones. One of the highlights of Whakatataka’s achievements is that Maori have been taking advantage of the zero fees for Under 6’s. The figures show that 87.5% of the Maori population receive free care and this is a marked increase from past statistics.”

Two CMRI’s (Crown Maori Relationship Instruments) were signed during this quarter between Canterbury DHB – Manawhenua ki Waitaha and Wairarapa DHB with Te Oranga o Te Iwi Kainga. The signed CMRI’s state that both the Canterbury and Wairarapa DHB’s have made formal agreements with their local iwi and Maori communities to increase Maori participation throughout the health and disability sector.

Almost all DHB’s have formalised agreements and Minister Ririnui encourages those DHB’s yet to form CMRI’s with their local iwi to do so as soon as possible.

“We should all be very impressed with the achievements that the Ministry of Health have made in the last quarter. They are working to deadline and are achieving the milestones set within tangible time frames.”

“It is extremely important that Maori health continues to be a priority in Aotearoa. We are well on our way to reducing inequalities in Maori health and I commend all those within the health sector for striving towards a positive and healthy future for Maori.”
