PM expresses shock at death of journalist in Kenya

Prime Minister Helen Clark today expressed shock at news of the death of New Zealand photo journalist Trent Keegan, in Nairobi, Kenya, and extended her sympathy to his family and friends.

“Our thoughts are with the family and associates of this talented young New Zealander during this difficult time,” Helen Clark said.

“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade is in contact with Mr Keegan’s family, and is providing assistance and advice to them on the process for bringing his body back to New Zealand.

“Foreign Affairs officials are also in contact with authorities in Nairobi through New Zealand’s High Commission in Pretoria and Honorary Consul in Nairobi.

“There is a lot of speculation in the media surrounding the death. The New Zealand Government expects Nairobi police to conduct a thorough investigation into Mr Keegan’s death.

“The investigation is expected to take some time, and MFAT will keep Mr Keegan’s family informed of any developments,” Helen Clark said.
