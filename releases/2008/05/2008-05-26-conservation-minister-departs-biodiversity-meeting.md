Conservation Minister Steve Chadwick departs for Germany today to discuss global efforts to halt the unprecedented loss of biodiversity that poses a major threat to plant and animal life around the world.

"These are very important international discussions to be part of – we are a country which is highly dependent on biodiversity for our long-term economic well-being, and our natural heritage is central to our national identity," Steve Chadwick said today.

The Minister will join conservation ministers from around the world at the 9th meeting of the Conference of Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in Bonn, Germany.

“New Zealand is firmly committed to playing its part to reverse the decline of global biodiversity.

“I will be announcing a proposal for New Zealand to host a regional technical workshop on pest management, based on our extensive experience. We have had major successes in this area, so it is important we share this knowledge with the international community so it can be of global benefit.”

The proposal will build on the most recent experiences in Kiribati in the eradication of rats and rabbits from three of their islands.  The remote location of this project presents logical challenges and would not be possible without the active involvement of the Kiribati Government.

New Zealand ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity in 1993, and in 1998 the government adopted "Halting the decline of indigenous biodiversity" as one of its strategic priorities. In 2000 the government launched the New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy.
