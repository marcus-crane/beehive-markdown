Prime Minister Helen Clark has congratulated the five new recipients of [New Zealand Bravery Awards](http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/honours/overview/bravery.html) announced today by the Governor-General.

“We have all wondered at some point what we would do when confronted with danger and when lives are at risk. The recipients of the bravery awards announced today have all displayed selfless courage in saving or attempting to save the lives of their fellow human beings. They are all to be commended for their actions,” Helen Clark said.

The list of awards include one New Zealand Bravery Star, two New Zealand Bravery Decorations, and two New Zealand Bravery Medals.

“The highest of the awards announced today, the New Zealand Bravery Star, goes to a 67 year-old North Shore man who attempted to save his neighbour from a stabbing attack in 2004.”

Helen Clark said that the other four awards have been made to police officers.

“Police officers daily face danger and they handle such situations professionally and bravely. Today’s awards recognise exceptional cases, and they are fitting recognition for the work our police force does.

“The New Zealand Bravery Decoration goes to two unarmed officers who confronted an armed offender at the St Lukes Shopping Centre Car Park in 2005.

“The New Zealand Bravery Medal has been awarded to a Senior Constable who rescued a man from a gas-filled building on Great Barrier Island in 2006, and to a Senior Sergeant for his role in effecting the rescue of UN personnel and quelling a disturbance at a refugee camp in Timor-Leste in November the same year,” Helen Clark said.

A total of 77 Bravery and 11 Gallantry awards have been made since their institution in 1999.

The Governor-General, on behalf of the Queen, will formally present the awards at investitures to be held in September this year.
