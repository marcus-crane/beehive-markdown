Budget 2008 continues this government's drive to enhance and support the social wellbeing, economic prosperity, and diverse cultures of Pacific people in New Zealand, Health Minister David Cunliffe and Pacific Island Affairs Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban announced today.

"Our government recognises the significant contribution of Pacific Health Providers, who understand our Pacific communities and their needs. We have invested an additional $10.4 million over the next four years to support workforce development for strong community providers," David Cunliffe said.

"This funding will also be used to establish health programmes specifically focussed on Pacific youth. Wellbeing is essential to Pacific young people reaching their full potential," David Cunliffe said.

"This government is committed to supporting our young Pacific people and recognises that they will be a considerably larger proportion of the workforce in the future," Winnie Laban said.

A targeted campaign at a cost of $200,000 over 2008/09 to 2009/10 will enable the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs to promote and encourage the uptake of Modern Apprenticeships in Pacific communities, creating the skills needed to transform New Zealand's economy.

"Investing in the capability of the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs as a knowledge based agency ensures they are able to provide leadership and improved outcomes for Pacific peoples," Winnie Laban said.

This investment in a strong public service provides $1.3 million in 2007/08 and a further $1.3 million of operating funding over the next four years and $290,000 of capital funding in the 2008/09 financial year.

"This government is investing in the enormous potential of our Pacific communities, ensuring they are equipped to fully contribute to, and share in, the future success of New Zealand," the Ministers said.
