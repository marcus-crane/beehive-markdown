“It’s inspiring to see young people dedicated and committed to making a contribution to protecting the environment,” said Associate Environment Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

 

Nanaia Mahuta praised the effort of the 44 teenagers from across New Zealand who were part of the 2008 Sir Peter Blake Youth Environment Forum.

 

The forum, aimed at inspiring youth to take action against climate change in their communities, today ends with the presentation ceremony.

 

“These young people have had a chance to take part in community projects, discuss environment and sustainability issues and a chance to learn more about   environmental management,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

 

“It’s important to recognise that youth have concerns and responsibilities in dealing with the environment, because they are living with the risks and hazards around them. 

 

“By ensuring that young people are encouraged to learn more, and gain a stronger awareness of environmental issues, we will go a long way towards generating effective responses to the sustainability challenges.

 

The Sir Peter Blake Youth Environment Forum is hosted by the Minister for the Environment in partnership with the Sir Peter Black Trust, with delegates being nominated by regional councils for their outstanding interest in the environment.

 

Nanaia Mahuta said the Labour-led government believes young people can make a difference to the sustainable development of Aotearoa/New Zealand.

 

“Today’s young people are tomorrow’s leaders, and investing in them now is critical because young people today play a crucial role in changing how Kiwis think and feel about the environment, and how they will look after it in future,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
