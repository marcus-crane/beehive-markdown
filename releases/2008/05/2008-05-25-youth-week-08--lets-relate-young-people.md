Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta said Youth Week 08 is a chance to acknowledge the work being done to ensure young people are supported.

"Supportive and encouraging relationships between young people and their communities is important. Parents, teachers, mentors and peers all play crucial roles in young people’s health and wellbeing,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

Nanaia Mahuta is backing national Youth Week, and will launch Youth Week 08 tomorrow in Porirua.

 

“The good news is that we can support young people to make better decisions by encouraging the development of strong connections within schools, families and communities,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

Youth Week is coordinated by New Zealand Aotearoa Adolescent Health and Development (NZAAHD), with support from the Ministry of Youth Development and other organisations.

 

A programme of youth-related events across the country will highlight the week, with performances by young musicians, dance competitions, youth festivals, workshops, exhibitions and more.

 

“This Labour-led Government is firmly committed to ensuring young people have every opportunity to be heard, and Youth Week is an example of this. 

 

“We’ve expanded workplace training, supported the Youth Transition Service and increased the youth minimum wage, because we want to support young people so they’ve got the best chance to achieve,” Nanaia Mahuta said.
