Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta said Waikato whanau will benefit from the *whanau pack* she launched today.

 

“It’s appropriate that this is launched on Youth Week, especially as the theme of Youth Week is encouraging relationships,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

The whanau pack is a Waikato District Health Board initiative supported by the Ministry of Youth Development.  It provides helpful tips and advice on issues facing teenagers in Aotearoa New Zealand.

 

“I realise there are many testing issues facing parents and young people, and that is why the launch of the whanau pack is so important,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

“Parenting is a lifetime commitment so it’s important we maintain a strong relationship with our rangatahi, and send them a clear message that we love, support and encourage them, all the while retaining the essential boundaries that are also important to being a parent.”

 

Nanaia Mahuta said the response was positive and will be made available to all families in the Waitako District Health Board’s region.

 

“It’s practical, and has information on things like getting your driver’s licence,  dealing with bullying, to  recognising signs of depression. It helps parents keep the communication lines with their rangatahi open,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

“I congratulate the Waikato District Health Board and the NZ Police for sponsoring the production of the Whanau Pack, and all of the local schools that were distributing the pack to families. 

 

“I want to make a special acknowledgment of the work of Hilary Karaitiana and Ken Wells of Te Kuiti who developed the pack, andTom Roa of Waikato University who translated it into te reo Maori. 

 

“This is a true bilingual resource which I believe will make a real difference to the health and wellbeing of Waikato rangatahi - and to the peace of mind of their whanau,” Nanaia Mahuta said.
