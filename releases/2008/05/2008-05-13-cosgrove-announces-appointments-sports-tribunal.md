Minister for Sport and Recreation Clayton Cosgrove has today announced three new appointments to the Sports Tribunal of New Zealand.

“I am very pleased to announce the appointment of Alan Galbraith QC as Deputy Chairperson along with Anna Richards MNZM and Dr Lynne Coleman as members of the Sports Tribunal,” Mr Cosgrove said.

The Tribunal is an independent body, governed by the Sports Anti-Doping Act 2006, that determines anti-doping violations, hears appeals against decisions of national sport organisations or the New Zealand Olympic Committee, and determines other ‘sports-related’ disputes.  On average it deals with 20 cases a year.  

The Tribunal offers an expert panel of nine members who bring together a comprehensive range of legal, administrative and elite-level sporting experience. These three appointments bring the Tribunal up to its full capacity.

 “We are fortunate to have three people of such a high calibre appointed to the Tribunal.  They bring a balance of skills, expertise and experience that will be greatly valued,” said Mr Cosgrove.

Alan Galbraith QC is an eminent barrister and former Rhodes Scholar who was appointed a Queen’s Counsel in 1987 and has also acted as a member of the Public and Administrative Law Reform Committee (1985-1987), the Legislation Advisory Committee (1987-1996), the Broadcasting Commission (1989-1993) and the Racing Industry Board (1992-1996).  Mr Galbraith has a long career in athletics, winning several New Zealand and Australian age-group track titles and more recently winning world masters age-group titles in the 1500m (2001) and the 10km road race (2004).

Black Fern Anna Richards is the country’s most capped female rugby player, having played for New Zealand since 1990.  With a legal background, Ms Richards has worked as a tax consultant for KPMG Peat Marwick and is currently Programme Manager for the Alan Duff Charitable Foundation (Books in Homes).  She was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2005 for services to rugby.

Dr Lynne Coleman is a general practitioner and sports doctor who has been the team doctor for the Tall Ferns, Black Ferns, NZ swimming team and the North Harbour rugby and netball teams.  Dr Coleman was the health team leader for the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games and will hold the same position for the upcoming 2008 Beijing Olympics.  She has also been on the Waitemata District Health Board since 2001.

lan Galbraith’s and Anna Richard’s terms on the Tribunal run to 31 August 2012. Dr Lynne Coleman’s term runs to 31 August 2011.
