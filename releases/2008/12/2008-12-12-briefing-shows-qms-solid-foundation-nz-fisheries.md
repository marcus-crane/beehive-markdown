The Minister of Fisheries, Phil Heatley, today released the Briefing for Incoming Ministers (BIM) from the Ministry of Fisheries.

The briefing highlights the importance New Zealanders place on fishing and on the marine resource. It describes a project underway to develop a vision and strategy for fisheries, intended to help set the future direction for New Zealand's fisheries.

"The fishing industry is a critical part of the New Zealand economy. It is one of New Zealand's largest earners of export revenue and a major employer. I am committed to looking at ways to enable the fishing industry to improve its economic performance.

"New Zealand's Quota Management System provides a solid foundation for managing our fisheries. The Fisheries Deed of Settlement gives certainty to both the industry and tangata whenua.

"There are issues with the recreational sector that need to be resolved. I want to make progress in this area by working co-operatively with all players and hearing all the ideas and proposals put forward.

"We need to sort out aquaculture and get this sector moving. I am committed to helping the aquaculture industry achieve its target of becoming a billion dollar a year industry by 2025.

"The Government is seeking more efficiency from the public sector as a whole and I will be looking for more efficient delivery of services by the Ministry. I want to see more of those resources directed to frontline enforcement and scientific research."
