Civil Defence Minister John Carter is urging New Zealanders to take a few simple precautions and keep safe over the holidays. 

"To help people be prepared, the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management is broadcasting its ‘Get Ready Get Thru' ads from January 4 to 17," Mr Carter said.

The television and radio advertisements can be seen and heard on the campaign [website](http://www.getthru.govt.nz/web/GetThru.nsf/web/BOWN-7GYTRQ?OpenDocument).

"You could be anywhere when an emergency strikes, and that is especially true during holidays when you usual routines don't apply."

Being prepared with a simple plan is just as important when you are in a new or unfamiliar place as it is when you are home or at work.  Some things to consider:

- The local city or district council is always the civil defence contact point no matter where you are in the country. Their telephone numbers are in the local Yellow Pages.
- For up-to-date highway conditions visit [http://www.transit.govt.nz/road/highwayinfo.jsp](http://www.transit.govt.nz/road/highwayinfo.jsp) or telephone 0800 44 44 49.
- For weather forecasts and warnings visit [www.metservice.com](http://www.metservice.com/)
- Think about how you would get in touch with your family or friends, or where you would meet, if you were separated.
- Consider what the local hazards might be and remember the standard safety messages, e.g. during an earthquake take cover under a sturdy piece of furniture and hold on, do not drive through flood waters, stay inside during a storm and keep away from windows and doors etc.
- Have spare water bottles in your car - they are useful even if you are stuck in a holiday traffic.
