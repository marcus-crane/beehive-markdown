Environment Minister Nick Smith today announced the appointment of the RMA Technical Advisory Group to support the Government's programme of reform of the Resource Management Act.

"Streamlining and simplifying the Resource Management Act is an important part of the new Government's programme. This advisory group will be tasked with assisting in the drafting of the reform bill to be introduced to Parliament in February," Dr Smith says.

"The Government wants to provide for more efficient decision making on infrastructure, reduce the costs and delays of consenting, speed up planning making processes, and restrict trade competition and vexatious and frivolous objections."

The advisory group will be chaired by barrister Alan Dormer and includes environmental consultant Guy Salmon, Rodney Mayor Penny Webster, barrister Paul Majuery, Tasman District Council Environment and Planning Manager Dennis Bush-King, barrister Michael Holm, planning consultant Michael Forster, and businessman and former Deputy Prime Minister Rt Hon Wyatt Creech.

The group has been formed as part of the National - ACT confidence and supply agreement.

Dr Smith says: "The functions of the group are to provide independent perspectives, analysis of reform proposals, act as a sounding board for any recommendations being made, and report to me."

The biographies of group members follow, along with the terms of reference for the group.
