People hit by redundancy will get breathing space to adjust to their new situations under the Government's ReStart package, Social Development and Employment Minister Paula Bennett said today.

"We've wasted no time putting ReStart in place because people need assurance that help will be there as we move into tougher, more uncertain economic times," she said.

"ReStart provides short-term support to low to moderate income families with children, and to people with high housing costs, who have been made redundant. It is there to help people get back on their feet."

ReStart will be available to people who have been in work for the last six months, including self-employed people and those who have changed jobs or employers during that time. The assistance will be available for 16 weeks or until they move into work.

ReStart comprises three components:

• ReCover - a payment for families with children and who are no longer eligible for the In Work Tax Credit, of $60 a week for families with up to three children and $15 a week for each extra child

• RePlace - available for those who qualify for the maximum Accommodation Supplement after they have been made redundant. RePlace increases the amount by up to $100 a week.

• ReConnect - employment and job services.

ReStart entitlement will be backdated to the election date - people made redundant between 8 November and today will have until 15 January to apply for ReStart Assistance. People made redundant after today will have 20 working days to apply from the date they are laid off. Payments will be made from 1 January, 2009.

"People made redundant may be eligible for different parts of the assistance package. For instance, people without children may be eligible for RePlace housing assistance. People looking for work can use the ReConnect assistance, which focuses on supporting people back into work," Ms Bennett said.

She urges employers who may need to make staff redundant, or employees who have been made redundant, to call 0800 559 000 as soon as possible to find out what support can be provided.

"It's important to remember that job numbers are still holding up pretty well, though we are entering tougher times. I know that good employers value good staff, and will do their best to keep them in work," she said.
