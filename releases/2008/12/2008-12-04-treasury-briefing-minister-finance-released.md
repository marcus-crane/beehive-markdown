A second briefing document, *Economic and Fiscal Strategy - Responding to your Priorities*, is being withheld under 9(2)(f)(iv) of the Official Information Act to "*maintain the current constitutional conventions protecting the confidentiality of advice tendered by ministers and officials.*" This document will be released early in 2009.
