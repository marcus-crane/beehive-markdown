The Minister of Agriculture David Carter congratulates Lain Jager, the new chief executive of Zespri Group Limited, on his appointment.

"Mr Jager's extensive experience and understanding of Zespri and the kiwifruit industry, ensures the company's leadership is in very capable hands.

"With Zespri's recent announcement of a record-breaking season this year and projected future growth, the long-term prospects for New Zealand's kiwifruit industry look bright.

"However, it is also clear that in the current international economic environment, New Zealand kiwifruit faces a potential threat from cheaper overseas substitutes.

'This threat means that Zespri's commitment to continuous improvement and innovation is more important that ever before.

"The Zespri brand marks New Zealand as a world-leading supplier of premium kiwifruit products.

"Creating and managing brands known for premium quality is a key part of the way forward for New Zealand agriculture, and as Minister I will do all that I can to support such work."
