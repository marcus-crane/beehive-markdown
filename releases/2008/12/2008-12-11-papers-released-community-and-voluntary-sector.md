Briefing papers released today reveal a distinctive and comprehensive contribution is made to New Zealand's economy and society by a community and voluntary sector made up of many parts.

"Some 97,000 organisations, over 105,000 paid staff and in excess of one million volunteers play a significant part in enhancing the wellbeing of New Zealanders, and together, contribute 4.9% of GDP - a net value-added $7 billion" said Tariana Turia, Minister of the Community and Voluntary Sector.

"As a nation, we must take pride in our extensive volunteer input creating strong, sustainable communities.  I am not surprised to learn that Maori women have the highest rate of volunteering, or to learn that of those people who volunteered, some 80% also gave money or goods".

"A key challenge outlined in the papers is that there is still much work to do to build capability in government agencies to work effectively with communities, whanau, hapu and iwi Maori, and to coordinate the work across all levels" said Mrs Turia.

"As Minister I will be encouraging my Departments to ensure that effective engagement with the sector becomes a priority" said Mrs Turia.
