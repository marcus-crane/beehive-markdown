Prime Minister John Key today announced National has fulfilled its commitment to introduce extra measures to help those New Zealanders unfortunate enough to be made redundant in these difficult economic times.

"In October during the election campaign, I announced National's plans for a transitional relief package to help New Zealanders caught out by the economic conditions.

"As I said in the election campaign, in these times of economic uncertainty it is absolutely vital that the Government provides New Zealanders with security about the public services they can expect.

"ReStart will provide short-term help for up to 16 weeks to low and moderate income families with children, and to people with high housing costs, who have lost their jobs through redundancy.

"It has three parts - a payment to those no longer eligible for the In-Work Tax Credit, an Accommodation Supplement boost, and employment and job services. The plan has been built on existing entitlements to keep it simple and introduce it quickly, without the need for legislation.

"The ReStart entitlements will be backdated to the election date of 8 November. We have deliberately prioritised ReStart by including it in the National Government's first 100-days action plan.

"I am determined that the National-led Government will support hard-working New Zealanders who are unfortunate enough to be made redundant and need help meeting their commitments while they look for another job.

"I am proud that the Government is able to offer this sort of assistance."
