Racing Minister John Carter has released the formal briefing by the Department of Internal Affairs on his new portfolio.

"The briefing shows that racing has a significant impact on New Zealand's economy, and employment," Mr Carter said.

"Racing contributes $1.48 billion dollars to the economy, and sustains more than 9,000 jobs.

"Racing contributes to the sense of community with more than 150 race days, the work of more than 4,000 volunteers, and the participation of more than 27,000 racing club members."

Mr Carter said our strong racing heritage linked generations and its international reputation enhanced the country's agricultural prestige.

"As Minister I plan to listen to the views of the many people who take part in racing and to support the development of the sport, which has brought pleasure and excitement to generations of New Zealanders".
