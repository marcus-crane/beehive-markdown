Labour Minister Kate Wilkinson has today released the Department of Labour briefing to her.

The briefing covers the department's work in the areas of immigration, workplace health and safety, employment relations, labour market information, and ACC policy.

"All of these areas play a critical role in the economic development of New Zealand.

"As this briefing points out, it is important that in the current economic climate that New Zealand's workforce and workplaces become as flexible and resilient as possible to deal with the challenges faced by us all.

"In these uncertain times we need to look closely at what is working and what is not

"I am looking forward to working with the Department on the challenges that lie ahead and coming up with practical solutions, which will be effective and long lasting."
