Prime Minister John Key announced today that the National-led Government will honour its pre-election promise to ensure a full 12-month course of the breast cancer drug Herceptin is available.

"I am proud to lead a government that has honoured such a commitment to the women of New Zealand," says Mr Key.

"The commitment was part of National's first 100-days action plan.  I am pleased that the Herceptin funding policy effectively applies from the swearing in of the Government on 19 November.

"Women who have paid for Herceptin treatment privately between that date and today can seek reimbursement from the Ministry of Health for the full cost of their treatment.

"I am pleased that women with early Her-2 positive breast cancer now have the option of accessing the one-year course of the cancer drug.  Women will also have the nine-week treatment option available.

"I hope that this policy gives women with breast cancer, and their families, cause for greater optimism at what must be a very difficult time.

"The Government expects that over time, up to 300 women a year will benefit from the year-long course."

Health Minister Tony Ryall has released more details today on the Herceptin announcement.
