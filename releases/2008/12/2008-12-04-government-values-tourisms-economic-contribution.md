The Associate Minister of Tourism, Jonathan Coleman, has told tourism groups that the new Government is placing real emphasis on the sector.

Speaking to the Inbound Tourism Operators Council forum in Auckland yesterday, Jonathan Coleman said the fact that the Prime Minister is also the Minister of Tourism shows the industry how seriously the Government takes it and the contribution it makes to the economy.

He said the Government can make sure that it doesn't hinder the efforts of the largely small- and medium-sized businesses that are the bulk of the tourism operators in New Zealand.  The proposed bill to streamline and simplify the Resource Management Act will remove unnecessary red tape and compliance that hinder sensible development.

Jonathan Coleman said that National has a range of policies that will benefit the wider tourism industry.

"We want the private and public sectors to work together to develop the industry further.  Our intention to review the Department of Conservation's approach to concessions is one example of how we can make sure the public sector supports private initiatives.

"Our environmental policy will protect the resources that tourism providers rely on - clean water, clean air and unique landscapes."

The Minister said that the Government will ensure that all its international focussed agencies - tourism, trade and enterprise, and foreign affairs - work together effectively, and work effectively with the private sector. 

"We will be working closely with Tourism New Zealand to make sure we are putting as many resources as possible into the front line marketing effort to get maximum bang for our buck."

The Minister also touched on the issue of GST on facilitation services provided by inbound operators, and he told the tourism operators that he understood the industry's desire for certainty and consistent application of the law.

"With the world economy tightening, growth in international tourism is slowing.  It's important that Government policy supports an industry that is a major contributor to the economy."
