New Zealand Police are being stretched too thin, and more Police are on the way, Police Minister Judith Collins told graduates at the Royal New Zealand Police College today.

"Every day you will go to work with the knowledge that you are making New Zealand a better and safer place.  As your Minister, my priorities are that you have the tools and the support to achieve that goal.

"It's also important to me that you are as safe as possible while serving your fellow New Zealanders.

"This government believes the police are being stretched too thin. We will increase the number of sworn Police by recruiting 224 new police officers on top of the present recruitment plan. That will mean 600 new officers by the end of 2011.

"We will also put them where they're needed - on the streets and in the neighbourhoods where crime happens."

Ms Collins says the New Zealand Police are renowned around the world for their integrity, professionalism, and commitment to making communities safer.

She reminded graduates that it was important to the smooth functioning of society that the public had faith in the Police.

"It is vital that the Police are respected and trusted. It is up to each and every one of you to maintain that trust."

Seventy-nine new officers graduated from the college today. They are the 11th group to graduate this year, including three groups of officers recruited from the United Kingdom.

All of today's graduates will be posted to frontline roles.
