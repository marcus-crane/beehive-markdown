Minister Hon John Carter has released the Briefing to the Incoming Minister for his civil defence portfolio.

The briefing explains leadership in civil defence; the Minister's role, legislation, strategy, planning, management of emergencies and co-ordination across government; and the policies being implemented.

Volcanic eruption is identified as the most under-valued threat, particularly because of the possible consequences to the whole country's economy from an eruption in Auckland.

A major earthquake is one of the most significant hazards. Large movements on the Wellington and Main Alpine Faults would have serious consequences for the capital and most of the South Island.

Research and modelling since the Boxing Day 2004 tsunami indicate that the possible loss of life from a tsunami hitting New Zealand is at least on a similar scale to other major events.

However, the National Hazardscape Report referred to in the briefing identifies floods as New Zealand's most frequent and costly natural hazard.
