Food Safety Minister Kate Wilkinson today released the Briefing for the Incoming Minister from the New Zealand Food Safety Authority (NZFSA).

"The briefing identifies a number of issues currently being managed within the food safety portfolio.

"New Zealanders have an active and increasing interest in food safety matters. I welcome the emphasis NZFSA places on protecting consumers.

"New Zealand's reputation as a trusted supplier of safe food is of critical importance in a challenging global trading environment.

"NZFSA's science-based approach to food safety must withstand rigorous scrutiny from New Zealand consumers and our overseas trading partners. This is why ensuring the quality of the scientific analysis undertaken by NZFSA is crucial.

"I look forward to making progress with NZFSA on the wide range of food safety issues facing New Zealand's consumers and businesses."
