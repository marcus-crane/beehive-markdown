Foreign Minister Murray McCully will visit Fiji later this week as part of the Pacific Forum Ministerial Contact Group tasked with encouraging Fiji's return to democratic rule.

The Contact Group was established at the March 2008 meeting of Forum Foreign Ministers in Auckland. It comprises the Foreign Ministers of Papua New Guinea, Tuvalu, New Zealand, Tonga, Samoa, and Australia.

The group will meet with representatives of Fiji's interim government, and other political stakeholders, during a three-day visit starting on Wednesday.

"It is sobering to reflect that last Friday marked the second anniversary of the Fiji coup," Mr McCully said.

"Since becoming Foreign Minister last month, I have had a number of discussions with colleagues from around the region which have underlined our shared concern that a way must be found to get Fiji moving in the right direction.

"The Contact Group's visit is an important opportunity to talk to a range of people in Fiji about the best way of helping their country make genuine progress towards a return to democracy."

Mr McCully said that after the visit, the Contact Group would prepare a report to be considered by Forum Leaders at a special meeting on Fiji in PNG early next year.
