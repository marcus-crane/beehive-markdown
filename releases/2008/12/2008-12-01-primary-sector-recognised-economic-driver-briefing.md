The Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Biosecurity, David Carter, has today released the Briefing for Incoming Ministers (BIM) from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.

“The briefing identifies a number of exciting challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in agriculture, forestry, and biosecurity. “At the very heart of the BIM is recognition of the absolute importance of our primary industries as drivers of New Zealand’s economic well-being.

“That is a message that this Government will not forget.”

The briefing makes it clear that increased irrigation and water storage is vital for our land based industries.

“I welcome this and as part of the Government’s increased investment in infrastructure we will be looking to facilitate investment in irrigation and water storage infrastructure.

“I applaud the emphasis placed on the importance of sound environmental management in the primary sector.

“Maintaining environmental best practice is essential for our farmers and foresters. “I am also pleased to see acknowledgement of the importance of the primary sector to Maori.

“A number of challenges are raised in the BIM from under-resourcing of animal welfare, to climate change solutions, to the bleak economic outlook.

“These are all major and serious issues but I am confident that we can work through them and deliver the solutions that the sector so badly needs.”
