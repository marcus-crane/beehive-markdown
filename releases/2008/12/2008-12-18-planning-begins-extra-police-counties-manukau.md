Police Minister Judith Collins has welcomed the speedy commitment by police to the Government's policy of injecting 300 new police into the Counties-Manukau district.

Planning for more police in Counties-Manukau formally got under way today under the direction of Police Deputy Commissioner Operations Rob Pope.

"This government promised to commit 300 new officers to frontline roles by the end of 2010. This will lead to a police service that is better able to respond to crime and whose visible presence deters crime in the district," Ms Collins says.

"We need more police and we want more of them on the front line, targeting the offenders most likely to commit crimes, and targeting the places where crime most often occurs."

Police will develop a plan to ensure resources are used in a way that best ensures community safety and reduces crime.

"The work will help ensure Police in Counties-Manukau can build on the many good things already happening in the district," Ms Collins says.

In recent years staff from other districts have been sent to Counties-Manukau on a temporary basis to help manage spikes in serious crime.

"By increasing the number of police on the street in Counties-Manukau, we will also help ease pressure on police in other parts of the country," Ms Collins says.
