A report on the major issues facing Police today has reaffirmed the government's policy direction on law and order, Police Minister Hon Judith Collins says.

"The Police are saying that they need the mandate, the tools and the support to deal with increasingly difficult policing challenges," Ms Collins says.

"Our policy will ensure they have the government's full backing when it comes to reducing crime and keeping New Zealanders safe."

In a briefing paper to Ms Collins as new Minister of Police, the New Zealand Police identify several key issues, including alcohol as a driver of criminal offending, over-representation of Maori in the criminal justice system, policing in South Auckland and  youth offending.

Already the new government has identified problems associated with policing in South Auckland and has promised an additional 300 officers. Police patrols have been increased to raise visibility and reduce threats to dairies and liquor stores, the report says.

The Government has also given the green light to the introduction of tasers and will increase the use of DNA sampling.

"The Government is convinced that the time has come to front up to the tough issues facing law and order in New Zealand," says Ms Collins.

"The Police will continue to be our best resource for preventing and fighting crime. Our investment in the police is an investment in making New Zealand a better and safer place to live," Ms Collins says.

"As Minister, my priority is that Police have the tools and support they need to carry out their difficult role, and that they are as safe as possible while serving their fellow New Zealanders," Ms Collins says.
