Minister of Local Government Rodney Hide today released the formal Briefing to the Incoming Minister (BIM) prepared by Department of Internal Affairs.

"As Local Government Minister, I have primary responsibility for local government and for its overall effectiveness - the Minister is not responsible for specific decisions or actions of local Councils," Mr Hide said.

"As well as the formal legal role, I will have a leadership role - and that's the key role as I see it.  I want the 85 local authorities to account for their spending and effectiveness in a way which gets the full confidence of their citizens.

"The briefing shows that the decade from 1998-2007 saw a constant trend of rates and expenses rising faster than general inflation.  After adjusting for inflation, rates rose by 41.6 percent.

"I want a New Zealand where ordinary ratepayers can say 'my Council does a good job, and spends my money wisely'.  That's the goal I will urge Councils to work towards - and I urge all citizens to take a keen interest in the progress they are making," Mr Hide said.
