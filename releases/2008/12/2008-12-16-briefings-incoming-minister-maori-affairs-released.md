The Minister of Māori Affairs, Hon Dr Pita Sharples, today released the Briefings to the Incoming Minister of Māori Affairs from Te Puni Kōkiri and the Crown entities within the Māori Affairs portfolio - Te Māngai Pāho (Māori Broadcasting Funding Agency), Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori (Māori Language Commission) and the Māori Television Service.

The briefings provide an overview of the context within which Te Puni Kōkiri and the Crown entities work, as well as their respective work programmes and resources, and the duties encompassed within the Māori Affairs portfolio.

"Te Puni Kōkiri and the Crown entities within my portfolio make a significant contribution to advancing the aspirations and potential of Māori. Key sectors include Māori well-being, culture and language revitalisation, economic development, Treaty settlements and the Crown-Māori relationship." Dr Sharples said.

"I have met with staff from Te Puni Kōkiri's national office, Te Māngai Pāho, Te Taura Whiri and Māori Television. I am looking forward to meeting staff in the regions as we work together to advance the interests our people."
