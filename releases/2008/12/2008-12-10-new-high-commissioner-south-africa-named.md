New Zealand's next High Commissioner to South Africa will be career diplomat Geoff Randal, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"New Zealand and South Africa enjoy excellent bilateral relations cemented though close personal links, common Commonwealth membership, and a shared passion for sport," Mr McCully said.

"We cooperate on many international issues, including trade liberalisation, environmental protection, nuclear disarmament, human rights, and assisting Africa's economic development.

"South Africa has a significant voice on the world stage, and is a forthright advocate for Africa in the United Nations and other multilateral institutions. It is also Africa's largest economy, and a leading player in the African Union and the Southern African Development Community.

"Around 50,000 South Africans are now living in New Zealand, and links between our countries will be further strengthened following the announcement that South Africa will open a High Commission here next year," Mr McCully said.

Mr Randal was most recently High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur. His previous postings were to Canberra, Port Moresby, Riyadh, Bahrain, London and Rome.

He takes up his post in January, replacing Malcolm McGoun, who is returning to Wellington.
