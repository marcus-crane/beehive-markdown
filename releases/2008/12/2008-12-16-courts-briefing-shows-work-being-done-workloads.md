It is encouraging to see work is underway to address the issue of court workloads in New Zealand's court system and to simplify criminal procedures, says Minister for Courts, Georgina te Heuheu in releasing the Briefing to the Incoming Minister.

"The Criminal Procedure (Simplification) Project is a joint project between the Ministry of Justice and the Law Commission. This is a crucial opportunity to create a more efficient procedure for criminal cases and reduce court delays and should be welcomed.

"Another positive move is to support the reform of district court civil rules. These are aimed at improving the efficiency of procedures and processes for civil matters in District Courts.

"These reforms also aim to ensure an efficient dispute resolution process.

"The particular pressures facing Auckland courtroom capacity and strong workload growth are being addressed through the Ministry's Auckland Service Delivery Programme. The Ministry will report back on progress with this programme early in the new year.

"I acknowledge that courts are generally disposing of more cases than ever before, however there are significant challenges moving forward.

"I will be working closely with officials to relieve the pressures on our court system."
