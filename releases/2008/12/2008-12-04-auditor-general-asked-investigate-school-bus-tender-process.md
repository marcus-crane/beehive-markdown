Education Minister Anne Tolley has requested that the Auditor General initiate an inquiry into the Ministry of Education school bus transport tendering process.

"I have been receiving regular briefings on this issue both in Opposition and as Minister of Education, and it has become apparent to me that an independent inquiry would provide certainty to the Ministry of Education over the propriety of their running of the tender process, and would allow school bus operators to have their concerns about the tender process tested by an impartial investigator."

Mrs Tolley says many operators feel that the process was run in an unfair and illegal manner and believe that they have evidence to back up their claims.

"I have had a chance to examine their concerns and believe that, prima facie, their concerns warrant an inquiry into the tender process. I understand the Auditor General has already received information about these allegations and I wish to add to this information, my concerns.

"It is my view that in the interests of justice and fairness, these allegations should be investigated independently and if the Auditor General deems there to be sufficient evidence to warrant an inquiry, one should be carried out forthwith.

"I believe that the concerns of operators can only be allayed by having an independent body that has no involvement in the tender process assess the allegations and evidence, to test their validity."
