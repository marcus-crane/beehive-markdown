The Government today introduced to Parliament a bill that will help tackle violence and neglect against children.

The Sentencing (Offences against Children) Amendment Bill is the first step in the National-led Government's plan to better protect children.

It makes offending against a child a specific aggravating factor when sentencing by directing the court to take special account of various factors when sentencing offenders where violence or neglect of a child is involved.

"National promised to review the Sentencing Act as it relates to violent crimes against children, and this is the first part of that promise.

"We are delivering it in our first 100 days in office because it is that important. More importantly, we are delivering it before Christmas, when so many children are especially vulnerable to abuse and neglect.

"This country can no longer stand by and brush off crimes against children by those who are supposed to treasure and nurture them.

"The bill lists the factors the court must take into account when sentencing for violence or neglect, and those factors will make sentences more severe than would otherwise be the case." 

The bill requires the court to:

- Take into account the defencelessness of children.
- Consider the serious or long-term harm that can result from offending against children.
- Take into account any threats made to the victim to prevent him or her reporting to the authorities, or any attempts to conceal the offending from the authorities.

"This bill tackles these pressing and urgent issues, and I am confident it will receive the unanimous support of the Parliament."

Mr Power says officials are already working to bring sentences for crimes against children into line with penalties for crimes against adults, which will result in legislation when the House returns next year.
