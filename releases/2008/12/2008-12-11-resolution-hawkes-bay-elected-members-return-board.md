The new Health Minister Tony Ryall has confirmed that the Crown will consent  to the applicants' request to withdraw its application for a judicial review of the previous Health Minister's sacking of the Hawke's Bay District Health Board.

"In my personal view, the events leading up to this litigation were most unfortunate and I can understand why the people of Hawke's Bay were angry with what happened. I am determined to do what I can to put things right," Mr Ryall says.

The judicial review proceedings were brought by five Hawke's Bay local bodies following the sacking, and the installation of a Commissioner, Sir John Anderson.

Mr Ryall says, "Sir John has invited the former elected Board members to join a Governance Board for the DHB, which he will chair, from February 2009. The Governance Board can remain in existence until DHB elections are next held and a new Board is formed."

The National Party committed pre-election to restoring the elected members to a governance role in the affairs of the Hawke's Bay District Health Board.

The Minister is pleased this has been achieved within a month of the election.
