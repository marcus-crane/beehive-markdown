The Education Minister Anne Tolley has released the Briefing to the Incoming Minister (BIM) from the Ministry of Education and other education organisations.

"The briefing identifies a number of positive and exciting developments in education as well as a number of challenges and opportunities that need to be addressed in the immediate future and long-term.

"It shows that the New Zealand education system has a strong base and educational participation has improved in some areas.

"It also notes that ‘there are some challenging decisions ahead to prioritise expenditure and focus effort on those areas and activities that will raise the performance of the education system'."

Mrs Tolley says the government will have an unwavering focus on improving education standards.

As outlined in our 100-day action plan legislation will be passed that:

Amends the Education Act 1989 so the Minister of Education can set agreed National Standards in literacy and numeracy.

Increases fines for parents of truant children and enables the Ministry to take prosecutions.

Mrs Tolley says further areas that have been singled out for improvement in the BIM include participation and learning for children with special education needs, and access to early childhood education.

"These are real and significant challenges. I am committed to ensuring they are addressed to enable the education sector to deliver a world-class education system."
