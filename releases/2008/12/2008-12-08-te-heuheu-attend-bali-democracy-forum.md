Disarmament Minister Georgina te Heuheu will discuss building democracy in the Asia region when she represents New Zealand at the first meeting of the Bali Democracy Forum.

The meeting takes place on 10-11 December in Nusa Dua, Bali, and will bring together ministers from across Asia.

"At the meeting, strengthening democratic institutions in Asia will be discussed and New Zealand will be able to share its positive experience of democracy with other countries," Georgina te Heuheu said. 

"Democracy has contributed to New Zealand's peace and prosperity as a nation and it is in our interests to see that the Asia region, to which we are now so closely linked, fosters the same environment.

"New Zealand is also committed to working with Pacific partners to strengthen their democratic institutions and looks forward to seeing how we might also be able to contribute to useful projects in Asia as well. 

"The Bali Democracy Forum is another opportunity for New Zealand to join what may prove to be a major grouping of our Asian neighbours. 

"Indonesia is to be congratulated on its regional initiative to set up this forum," Mrs te Heuheu said.

It is expected that more than twenty leaders and ministers from countries as far away as Afghanistan and Mongolia will attend the meeting.  Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono will host the forum and co-chair sessions of the meeting with Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.
