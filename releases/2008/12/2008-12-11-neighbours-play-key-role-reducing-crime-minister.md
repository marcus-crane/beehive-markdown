Neighbourhood Support is an important way the community can contribute to making New Zealand a safer place, Police Minister Hon Judith Collins says.

Ms Collins met Neighbourhood Support representatives in Wellington yesterday, and emphasised the role the organisation played in reducing crime.

"Getting to know neighbours and what is going on in the neighbourhood is one of the best defences against crime. Neighbours provide a good source of community intelligence for police on community-related crime and safety problems," Ms Collins says.

Police introduced Neighbourhood Watch to New Zealand as a crime prevention initiative in the late 1970s. In 1999 Neighbourhood Support began operating independently of Police.

The initiative has evolved to become Neighbourhood Support New Zealand, a community owned and managed organisation with a wide-ranging interest in crime prevention and community safety.

"It is important that community safety is not the sole responsibility of Police, but that we look at ways we can all contribute. Neighbourhood Support is an established organisation and I encourage all neighbourhoods to consider using their support and experience."

Talks between Ms Collins and Neighbourhood Support also focused on ways the organisation could connect with communities in lower socio-economic areas and recent migrant communities.
