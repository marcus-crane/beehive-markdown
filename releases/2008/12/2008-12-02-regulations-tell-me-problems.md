Minister for Regulatory Reform Rodney Hide today appealed for ideas from the public on regulations that should be scrapped or modified.

"National's 'First Actions on the Economy' section of the National-ACT Confidence and Supply Agreement commits it to 'Begin a regulatory review programme to identify and remove inefficient and superfluous regulation'. I have been tasked to help with that programme," Mr Hide said.

"I particularly want to hear from people about 'low-hanging fruit' in the regulatory area on which the Government could make a start - Energy Minister Gerry Brownlee's move to scrap Labour's decision to phase out traditional light bulbs is a good example of this.

"Bigger issues - such as the Resource Management Act - will be dealt with separately in terms of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.

"Far too much irksome regulation is putting unnecessary burdens on households and businesses.  I want my Christmas stocking filled with good ideas for reducing this burden," Mr Hide said.
