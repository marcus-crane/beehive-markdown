Education Minister Anne Tolley today announced capital funding of $17.3 million for a new primary school in Queenstown, Remarkables Primary School.

"Remarkables Primary School will be built in Frankton, the suburb with the largest roll pressure in Queenstown. The chosen site is currently home to an early childhood education centre, which will be relocated during construction and then rebuilt on site.

"The school can provide places for an additional 460 Year 1 - 8 children. An enrolment scheme will ensure the network of Queenstown schools is maintained.

"I will also ask the Ministry of Education to investigate site options for an additional primary school in Queenstown to meet the area's long-term needs."

The funding kickstarts National's election campaign commitment for a 21st century school building programme which will continue to be rolled out in the New Year.
