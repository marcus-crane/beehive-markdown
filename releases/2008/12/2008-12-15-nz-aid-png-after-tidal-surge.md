New Zealand will contribute $300,000 to assist with relief efforts in the wake of extensive flooding in the northern provinces of Papua New Guinea, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"Severe tidal surges, caused by a combination of unusually high sea levels and tropical depressions, have resulted in flooding that has left an estimated 25,000 to 30,000 people homeless," Mr McCully said.

"New Zealand's assistance, which will be delivered through the government's international development agency NZAID, will go to organisations such as the Red Cross, to provide stocks of emergency supplies.

"Papua New Guinea's provincial and central authorities have responded quickly and effectively to meet the immediate needs of those displaced by the flooding, and the Australian government is also assisting with relief efforts.

"New Zealand will also contribute an emergency response specialist to a United Nations Disaster Assessment and Co-ordination (UNDAC) team which will support the national government and co-ordinate the international response," Mr McCully said.
