Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce has welcomed the formation of a new information and communications technology industry group - NZICT.

Mr Joyce says this is an important development for the sector which has lacked a unified voice since the demise of the Information Technology Association of New Zealand.

"There are some hefty issues in the ICT sector and an industry body will provide a coordinated voice to Government on issues of common concern.  This kind of industry-driven approach for representation is always preferable to a government-driven, top-down approach."

NZICT has identified raising New Zealand's prosperity as a key objective.

Mr Joyce says this has never been more important than is currently the case.

"ICT will play a very important role in this and the Government is doing its part by investing in ultra-fast broadband and updating the regulatory environment.

"The new National-led Government is commited to listening to the businesses that drive innovation and employment growth in New Zealand and I look forward to working with NZICT to that end," says Mr Joyce.
