Police Minister Judith Collins today received an assurance from Police Commissioner Howard Broad that the Police were meeting their responsibilities regarding the operations of Special Investigation Groups (SIG).

"At our regular weekly meeting this morning, I asked the Commissioner to give me an assurance that the Police were working within their responsibilities in their operation of SIGs. The Commissioner gave me that assurance," Ms Collins says.

"In a free society such as we have in New Zealand, it is important that the rights of groups to undertake legitimate and lawful activity is upheld."

Ms Collins says it is important that the Police are able to operate free of political influence.

"Any further comment from me would be inappropriate in light of the need for the Police to maintain operational independendence."
