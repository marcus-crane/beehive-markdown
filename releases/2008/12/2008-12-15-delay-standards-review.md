Education Minister Anne Tolley today announced further consultation on the implementation of new NCEA standards.

"After meeting with principals and hearing from many heads of department and others, I have decided to revise the implementation timeline for the new standards by one year to allow further consultation with the sector," says Mrs Tolley.

Mrs Tolley has told the Ministry of Education that wider consultation with principals is required and, that as leaders of learning in their schools who are responsible for implementing the standards, input from principals and teachers is vitally important.

"This is especially so where recommendations for changes to standards in specific subject areas is concerned."

The Ministry of Education and the New Zealand Qualifications Authority are working on an Improvements Programme which includes aligning the NCEA standards to the new curriculum.

"I have instructed the Ministry of Education to extend the implementation timeline so that aligned Level 1 NCEA standards will occur in 2011, Level 2 in 2012, and Level 3 in 2013. This will allow time for wider consultation and also ensure that these changes are supported by appropriate resources.

"The government is committed to continuing to improve NCEA to ensure schools, teachers, pupils, parents and employers have confidence in our school qualifications system."
