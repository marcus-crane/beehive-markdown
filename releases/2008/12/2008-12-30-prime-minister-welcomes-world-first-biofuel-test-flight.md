Prime Minister and Tourism Minister John Key has congratulated Air New Zealand for its successful test flight today of a biofuel-powered Boeing 747 aircraft.

"The fortunes of Air New Zealand and New Zealand's tourism industry are closely tied together," says Mr Key.

"As we promote ourselves to the world as 100% Pure, it's great to see Air New Zealand showing environmental leadership.

"This is an historic day for aviation and I'm proud that our national airline is working with world-leaders in their fields to develop more sustainable fuels for aircraft.

"As New Zealanders, we can feel immensely proud of the innovation and research that has taken place to ensure the world's first test flight using jatropha biofuel has become a reality.

"As New Zealanders we are privileged to live in one of the most beautiful environments in the world, and as a Government we are committed to ensuring we preserve that for future generations."
