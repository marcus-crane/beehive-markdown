Senior Citizens Minister John Carter says the ministerial briefing on his new portfolio provides a useful summary of the issues facing older New Zealanders.

"With the older population predicted to double by the year 2028 and to be a quarter of our total population in 2051, we have a critical window of opportunity," Mr Carter said.

"New Zealand needs to carefully consider polices and services that ensure older people can live where they want and participate in their communities as long as they are able.

"The Office for Senior Citizens briefing points to some of the challenges New Zealand will need to address. These include meeting older peoples' growing expectations on healthcare and ensuring older people know where to go for help and are encouraged to do so.

"We have the opportunity to improve needs assessments for older people so their health needs are better met, to work with local government on ways to make communities friendlier, safer places; and to support older New Zealanders to continue working for as long as they are able.

"I'm heartened that we are making good progress. Older people have a great deal to offer. Feedback from organisations working for older people reaffirms my commitment to ensuring that the valuable contribution all older New Zealanders have to make to this country is realised," Mr Carter said.
