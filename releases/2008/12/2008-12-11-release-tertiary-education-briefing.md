The Tertiary Education Minister Anne Tolley has released the Briefing to the Incoming Minister (BIM) from the Tertiary Education Commission.

"The briefing notes that New Zealand's tertiary education system is a key national strategic asset. It also shows that the tertiary sector is rich in its diversity and will continue to play an important role in upskilling New Zealanders of all ages to help them meet the challenges of the 21st century," says Mrs Tolley.

"The government will strive to develop a dynamic tertiary education system that ensures New Zealanders from all educational backgrounds have opportunities to gain world-class skills and knowledge, and we are able to progress to higher levels of learning.

"This will require a responsive, innovative, and diverse range of tertiary education institutions. We acknowledge the important role played by universities, polytechnics, wananga, industry training organisations, private training establishments and adult and community education providers.

"Our policies will help education providers meet the demands of students and the economy - rather than help meet the bureaucratic demands of government agencies."
