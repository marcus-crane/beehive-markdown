The decision by the Environmental Risk Management Authority to cease the use of the insecticide endosulfan reinforces the importance of an independent scientific system of assessment, says Environment Minister Nick Smith.

"There has been public concern about the environmental safety of this insecticide that led to the decision to reassess its use and today's decision shows those concerns were justified.

"ERMA followed a comprehensive reassessment process on the use and effects of the chemical gathering information both locally and internationally.

"The decision was carefully made weighing up a number of adverse effects on the environment and human health.

"ERMA has concluded that those factors outweighed any positive effects associated with the availability of endosulfan in New Zealand.

"New Zealand needs to protect its clean, green image by taking a cautious approach to the use of hazardous chemicals."
