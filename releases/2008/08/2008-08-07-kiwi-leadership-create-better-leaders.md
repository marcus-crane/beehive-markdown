Principals throughout the country will benefit from a new document which outlines the qualities, knowledge and skills required to lead New Zealand schools Education Minister Chris Carter says. 

Chris Carter said Kiwi Leadership for Principals presents a model of leadership that will help to develop the leadership skills of New Zealand Principals.

"At the heart of the model is a clear focus on how to improve educational and social outcomes for all our young people," Chris Carter said.

"Kiwi Leadership provides an approach to school leadership that is distinctively suited to New Zealand and draws upon our 'can do' Kiwi attitude.

"With studies showing that principal leadership contributes to improved student outcome, I believe this document will be helpful in developing educational leaders."

During the extensive consultation process to develop this document, many individuals, associations and sector groups responded.

“I would like to thank all those who took the time to send in their comments. There were some great ideas and consistent themes which we have incorporated into the final version of the document.”

“Kiwi Leadership for Principals will provide great assistance to the professional learning of principals' in this country,” said Chris Carter.
