New Zealand’s next Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the World Trade Organisation in Geneva will be career diplomat David Walker, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

"This is a key role in New Zealand's trade diplomacy. Completion of the Doha negotiations in Geneva, and implementation of the results, remains our top trade priority," said Mr Peters.

“New Zealand's dependence on agricultural exports means that the WTO’s system of trade rules and dispute settlement has crucial importance for us."

Dr Walker was New Zealand’s lead negotiator for the recently-concluded Free Trade Agreement with China, and for the Free Trade Agreement with Chile, Brunei and Singapore. He has also served as New Zealand’s APEC Senior Official, and been posted to London and Washington.

Dr Walker takes up his position in January, replacing Crawford Falconer, who is returning to Wellington.
