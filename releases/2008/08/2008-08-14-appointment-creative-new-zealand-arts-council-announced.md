Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Hon Judith Tizard, today announced the appointment of a new member to the Creative New Zealand Arts Council.

Erima Henare has been appointed for a three-year term ending on 30 June 2011.

Erima Henare (Te Aupouri, Ngai Takoto, Ngati Kuri, Ngati Kahu, Te Rarawa, Ngapuhi, Ngati Hine, Ngati Wai, Ngati Whatua, Kahungungu, Te Atiawa, Tainui, Tuwharetoa, Rongowhakaata, Te Aitanga-a-Mahaki) is Chair and former Chief Executive of Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Mâori/The Mâori Language Commission.  Mr Henare has a wide-ranging background in regional community development and governance.

“I am delighted that Erima has agreed to serve on the Council”, said Judith Tizard.  “His knowledge of te reo and tikanga Mâori and extensive management and governance experience will make a valuable contribution. Erima has had a long interest and involvement in Mâori arts and I welcome his willingness to contribute to the Crown’s major arts development organisation.”

Mr Henare replaces Waaka Vercoe, whose term on the Council has expired.  “I very much appreciate the valuable contribution that Waaka Vercoe has made to the Council”, said Judith Tizard.  “He has ensured there is an appropriate Mâori viewpoint on the matters being deliberated”.

Creative New Zealand encourages, promotes and supports the arts in New Zealand for the benefit of all New Zealanders.  The Council is responsible for overall policy development and is the “public face” of the organisation, determining the division of funding between the Arts Board and Te Waka Toi.
