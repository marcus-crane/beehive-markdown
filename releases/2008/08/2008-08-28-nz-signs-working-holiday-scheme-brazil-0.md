Up to 300 New Zealanders aged between 18 and 30 will be able to live in

Brazil for one year to work, holiday or study under a new reciprocal

working holiday scheme signed today, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said.

“The working holiday scheme with New Zealand will be a first for Brazil,

and it will further promote the important links between our two countries,"

Mr Peters said.

“It will encourage young New Zealanders to include Brazil as part of their

overseas travel, and it will also help to stimulate the interest of young

Brazilians to live, study and work in this country.

The agreement, signed in Auckland this evening by Mr Peters and Brazilian

Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, will also allow 300 Brazilians aged 18 to 30

to come to New Zealand for a year to holiday, study and work.

“Brazil is a priority country for New Zealand under the government’s Latin

America Strategy, and the working holiday scheme is a great mechanism to

boost mutual understanding between our two countries,” Mr Peters said.

“Minister Amorim last visited New Zealand as Brazil’s Foreign Minister in

1994, and this new scheme demonstrates how the relationship has

significantly deepened since that time.”

The working holiday scheme will come in to force for New Zealanders

following approval by the Brazilian legislature. Brazilians will be able to

travel to New Zealand under the scheme from December this year.
