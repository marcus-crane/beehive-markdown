Territorial and regional authorities will receive an additional $26 million in funding assistance from the Government to support a range of land transport activities and projects, Transport Minister Annette King has [announced](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/speech/launching+transport+strategy+policy+and+agency).

The funding – announced as part of the 2008/09 National Land Transport Programme - will see approximately $10 million go towards a new initiative, the Targeted Community Fund, to provide assistance to address unmet transport needs in communities with a high level of socio-economic deprivation.

Another $5 million will provide for emergency reinstatement works for local authorities hit by multiple storms and other emergency events.

“This additional funding will make a real difference to those councils that are recovering from a series of storm events. It will also make it easier for local authorities to find the money required to address the concerns of some of our poorest communities, which suffer from having poor or unreliable land transport infrastructure and services,” Ms King said.

The remainder will go toward supporting regional council activities in developing three-year regional land transport programmes, studies and strategy development, asset management planning, bus and ferry facilities and infrastructure.

“The funding also recognises the greater importance of regional land transport planning and the development of regional programmes under the Land Transport Management Amendment Act. Around $6 million is now available in additional funding to meet the costs of regional land transport planning, studies and programme development to encourage more integrated planning.”
