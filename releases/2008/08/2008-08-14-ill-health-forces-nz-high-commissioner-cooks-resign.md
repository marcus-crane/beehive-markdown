New Zealand’s High Commissioner to the Cook Islands, Brian Donnelly, has resigned due to ill health, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

“It is with considerable regret that I have accepted Brian Donnelly’s resignation,” Mr Peters said.

“Brian has told me that he feels his medical condition is preventing him from carrying out duties as High Commissioner to his fullest ability, and I respect that decision,” Mr Peters said.

“I wish Brian all the very best as he seeks treatment for his illness.

“Since becoming High Commissioner in February, Brian had been an effective and energetic representative of New Zealand in the Cook Islands.

“His longstanding connection with the Cooks gave Brian a special insight into the uniqueness of the relationship between our two countries, and the importance of maintaining the exceptional strength of those ties,” Mr Peters said.

An Acting High Commissioner will be appointed until a replacement for Mr Donnelly is named.
