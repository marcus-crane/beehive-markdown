A trial to scrap old vehicles in Auckland has resulted in motorists making greater use of public transport, Associate Transport Minister Judith Tizard said today.

The vehicle scrappage trial ran for six weeks over May and June last year and provided vehicle owners in Auckland with an incentive to trade in vehicles that were nearing the end of their life. A report detailing the results of the trial was released today by Ms Tizard.

“We know that older, poorly maintained vehicles tend to be less fuel efficient and emit more harmful emissions. This scheme was one way to assess how these vehicles could be best removed from our roads,” Ms Tizard said.

The programme targeted unwarranted vehicles, vehicles that wouldn’t pass their next warrant and those where the warrant would cost more than the vehicle. The aim was to see whether removing older vehicles from the road could, over time, help to reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and encourage public transport use.

Ms Tizard said the public were offered two months free passage on Auckland’s buses and trains in return for handing in their vehicle. The only conditions of the scheme were that the vehicles collected had to be running and required a current warrant of fitness in the two months prior to being collected.

“Almost half of those who responded to a follow up survey said the trial had encouraged them to make more use of public transport. Almost a quarter of respondents said their opinion of public transport had changed – the vast majority for the better. This could have significant benefits in the longer term.”

A total of 253 vehicles were scrapped in the scheme. The trial was a collaborative effort involving the Ministry of Transport, Auckland Regional Council, Auckland Regional Transport Authority and the Broken Car Collection Company.

 “These organisations need to be congratulated for the work they have done. This trial told us a lot about the vehicles being disposed of and their owners – much of which was new and unexpected. This information will certainly help with any further work in this area,” Ms Tizard said.
