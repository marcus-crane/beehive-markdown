Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that New Zealand is deeply concerned about the hostilities and loss of life in South Ossetia and the ramifications for regional stability in the Caucasus.

“The New Zealand Government calls on all parties to exercise restraint. We call for an immediate ceasefire and a resumption of negotiations to end the conflict,” Helen Clark said.

“The outbreak of hostilities has been the subject of ongoing discussions in the United Nations Security Council over recent days.

“We urge all parties to continue to discuss and seek to resolve this matter through the good offices of the United Nations.

“The UN Secretary General has called for an immediate ceasefire, and for all parties to engage in negotiations, and for a resumption of the status quo of 6 August 2008,” Helen Clark said.
