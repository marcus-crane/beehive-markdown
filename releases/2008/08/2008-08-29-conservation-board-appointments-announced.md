Conservation Minister Steve Chadwick today announced this year’s appointments to all fourteen of New Zealand’s Conservation Boards.

“I am pleased to appoint new members to the boards and to reappoint some existing members,” Steve Chadwick said.

“The boards represent a wide range of local communities throughout New Zealand and give sound advice to the Department of Conservation (DOC) on its policy and directions.  Conservation boards play a vital role in giving independent advice on local issues and are a way for local communities to be a part of conservation decisions.”

Conservation boards provide links between the community and DOC, and represent the public interest in the department’s work and conservation in general.

 “I am sure that all the new appointees will add valuable experience and skills to these highly competent and committed boards, and I thank them for their willingness to take up these important conservation roles.”

Ms Chadwick thanked retiring board members for their efforts and commitment during their time on the board.
