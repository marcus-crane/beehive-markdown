Internal Affairs Minister, Hon Rick Barker, has announced reappointments and appointments to the Lottery Grants Board (the Board) and five Lottery distribution committees. 

“I am pleased to announce the reappointment of Garth Nowland-Foreman, to the Lottery Grants Board. He has made a very valuable contribution to the Board, and I am pleased that will continue,” Mr Barker said.

Mr Nowland-Foreman is a part time lecturer at UNITEC Institute of Technology and a consultant in Voluntary Management and Social Policy. Mr Nowland-Foreman has been reappointed for a further three year term commencing from 14 August 2008. The Board and distribution committees exist under the Gambling Act 2003 (the Act).

The Board’s primary function is to determine the proportions of lotteries profits to be allocated to the Lottery distribution committees and distribution agencies.

Eleven Lottery regional community distribution committees and eight national distribution committees distribute the profits of New Zealand Lotteries such as Lotto, Lotto Strike, Instant Kiwi and Keno. The main function of Lottery distribution committees is to provide funding for community projects.

Members of the Board are appointed by the Governor-General, on the recommendation of the Minister of Internal Affairs. Members of Lottery distribution committees are appointed by the Minister of Internal Affairs.

The distribution committee appointments and reappointments are:

Auckland: April Nicholson (appointed); Hawke’s Bay: Mary Kippenberger (reappointed); Wellington/Wairarapa: Pat Hanley (reappointed); Environment and Heritage: Sue Bennett (reappointed), Lois Livingston (appointed) and Judith MacDonald (appointed); and Health Research: Dr Beverley Lawton (reappointed).
