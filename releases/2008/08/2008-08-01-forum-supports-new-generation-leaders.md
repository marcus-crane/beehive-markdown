Youth Affairs Minister and Tainui MP Nanaia Mahuta says young leaders will continue to benefit from the work Papakura Youth Leadership Forum organisers.

“Papakura is in good hands, and we see this through the young people involved in the current Papakura Youth Leadership Forum,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“The next generation of Papakura’s volunteers and community leaders may well emerge from this group of young people” said Nanaia Mahuta.

The forum is run by the Papakura District Council with Papakura High School and Rosehill College, and aims to build civic awareness through a range of initiatives and discussions.  It helps develop the skills of young people who have been identified by their schools as potential youth leaders.

“I see youth leadership as a key aspect in the development of our rangatahi and initiatives that foster youth leadership, like the Papakura Youth Leadership Forum, are important” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“The Ministry of Youth Development operates networks such as *Provoke, The National Youth Council’s Network, The Student Decision Makers Network* and *The Youth Health Network.* These networks all support and encourage youth leadership on issues that impact on young people” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“It’s great to support the Papakura Youth Leadership Forum as a way of developing  young people’s leadership skills and encouraging them to become involved in their communities,” Nanaia Mahuta said.
