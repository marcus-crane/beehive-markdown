The Law Commission will undertake a comprehensive two-and-a-half year review of New Zealand's liquor laws to bring them into line with current community behaviours and concerns around the use of alcohol, Associate Justice Minister Lianne Dalziel announced today.

 "There have been many changes in society and many ad hoc changes to the liquor laws since the last comprehensive review (the Laking Report) in the mid-1980s," Lianne Dalziel said.

 "The time has come to revisit the legal framework, identify the kinds of outcomes we want from 21st century liquor laws, and have a look at the whole balance of rights and responsibilities again."

 The announcement was made in conjunction with the tabling of the government's Sale and Supply of Liquor and Liquor Enforcement Bill which will give communities a greater say over when, where and how liquor can be sold and will improve the enforcement of liquor policy.

 "This Bill addresses some very important and urgent community concerns while the Law Commission gets on with the job of what is essentially a first principles review of New Zealand's liquor laws," Lianne Dalziel said.

 The government has approved the terms of reference for the Law Commission to undertake the review (see below). The project will be led by led by Law Commission President the Rt Hon Sir Geoffrey Palmer.

 The Law Commission's brief includes looking at:

- the proliferation of specific types of liquor outlets and the effect this has on consumption;
- the purchase age for alcohol;
- the responsibilities of parents for supervising young members of their family who drink;
- restrictions on trading hours for liquor outlets;
- the relationship between the Sale of Liquor Act 1989, the Resource Management Act 1991 and the Local Government Act 2002;
- alcohol advertising; and
- the contribution alcohol consumption makes to criminal offending.

 "This is a wide-ranging and fundamental review.  It's important to note that the Law Commission is independent and will arrive at its conclusions independently of any government department or minister.  However, the government will set up an interdepartmental officials’ committee to provide resources and information about a number of difficult issues that arise under the present law," Lianne Dalziel said.

 The Law Commission will also assemble reference groups of community, industry and other relevant representatives to be consulted in the course of the review.

 "The Commission’s funding has been increased in order to undertake this significant task, which will take between two to three years. The review will start immediately," Lianne Dalziel said.

 "This is an important project that bears on many aspects of New Zealand society.  I am confident the Law Commission will do a thorough and expert job."
