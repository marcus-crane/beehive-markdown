Associate Minister of Justice Rick Barker has announced the lay members of the Lawyers and Conveyancers Disciplinary Tribunal, following their swearing in today.

“The Lawyers and Conveyancers Act came into effect at the beginning of the month and it provides for this independent Tribunal as part of a robust complaints and disciplinary process.

“The Tribunal will consider the most serious disciplinary charges against members of the legal and conveyancing profession and will receive applications regarding suspension, striking off and restoration of practitioners.

“The 12 people selected for appointment as lay members bring a broad range of skills and expertise to the Tribunal from all around the country,” Mr Barker said.

The lay members of the Lawyers and Conveyancers Disciplinary Tribunal are:

Christine Rowe (Warkworth), Bill Smith (Hibiscus Coast), Jay Clarke (Waiheke), Peter Shaw (Hamilton), Alison de Ridder (Rotorua), Sue Ineson (Te Horo), Sandra Gill (Lower Hutt), Sharron Cole (Petone), Alisdair Lamont (Canterbury), Michael Gough (Lyttleton), Ian McAndrew (Dunedin), and Thursa Kennedy (Invercargill).
