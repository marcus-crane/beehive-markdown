Hundreds of Northland families are living healthier lives in warmer, drier homes thanks to a joint government and community initiative.

Housing Minister Maryan Street was in Whangarei today to celebrate the completion of the Healthy Housing Programme run by Housing New Zealand, the Northland District Health Board and Te Tai Tokerau Trust.

“Since Healthy Housing began in Northland five years ago, a total of 665 families have benefited from the programme,” said Maryan Street.

“For some, this means their homes are better ventilated, insulated and heated. For others, their houses have been modified or modernised so they are no longer living in overcrowded situations.

“A number of families were also assisted from state housing into private rental accommodation, freeing up Housing New Zealand properties for other families in need.

“Along with Northland, the Healthy Housing Programme also runs in Auckland, Counties Manukau and has just begun in the Hutt Valley. The areas were chosen due to high rates of potentially avoidable hospitalisations due to infectious diseases,” Maryan Street said.

All families living in state housing in areas where Healthy Housing operates are contacted and offered the opportunity to participate. Those who do take part are visited by Housing New Zealand staff and a public health nurse who undertake a joint health and housing assessment.

Interventions can include:

• healthy environments for all homes (insulation, ventilation, range hoods, heating upgrades), as required within the property

• design improvements (modifications such as accessible bathrooms and kitchen upgrades) based on the health needs of the family

• transfers, part-household transfers and extensions (where possible) for seriously overcrowded families needing an extra two or more bedrooms

• referrals to health and social services through Public Health Nurses

 

“Research has shown that there is clear link between overcrowding and the spread of infectious diseases, In Counties Manukau, however, the programme has reduced acute housing-related hospital admissions by 47 per cent and resulted in a nine per cent increase in primary health care visits and improved links between health, social and housing providers, ” Maryan Street said.

“Just as importantly, more families are participating in the community and in education; they feel safer and more comfortable in their homes and community; many have a sense of pride in their home and report positive changes to their family life.”
