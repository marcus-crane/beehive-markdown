Lottery Grants Board Presiding Member Rick Barker today announced a grant of up to $433,000 from the Lottery Significant Projects Fund, to Hamilton City Council. The grant will enable the completion of Te Parapara Garden, New Zealand’s first public traditional Māori garden.

“Thanks once again to New Zealand’s ongoing support of Lotto products, another worthwhile project is brought to completion.

“This beautiful garden will help to conserve and tell the stories of local hāpu. It will be a major attraction for the people of Hamilton, the Waikato and for the millions who visit Hamilton Gardens each year,” said Lottery Grants Board Presiding Member Rick Barker.

“Our entire country will benefit from a better understanding and appreciation of the heritage, sophistication and culture associated with Māori horticulture.

“Leaders from the local Māori community have been heavily involved in the planning and design of Te Parapara. The practices and symbols of local hāpu and the knowledge and guidance of local kaumatua have helped to determine the shape of the new garden,” said Mr Barker.

The Lottery Significant Projects Fund provides opportunities for the development of projects that are of benefit at the wider community, regional or national level. The Fund is for projects that have received funding from other sources, including from the community, but are still unable to raise sufficient money to complete the project.

Funding is to complete large community capital expenditure projects costing at least $1 million in total. Projects must contribute to one or more of the outcome areas of arts, culture and heritage, sport and recreation, conservation and the environment.

The New Zealand Lottery Grants Board has allocated $16 million for distribution to significant projects in 2008/09.

Funding decisions are made by the Lottery Significant Projects Distribution Committee.

Lottery funds come from the profits of the New Zealand Lotteries Commission. The New Zealand Lottery Grants Board is an independent decision making body. It sets policy and allocates funds to be distributed by Distribution Committees.
