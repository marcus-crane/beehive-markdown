Education Minister Chris Carter and Pacific Island Affairs Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban launched the Pasifika Education Plan 2008-2012 today, stepping up the Labour-led government’s commitment to ensure more Pasifika students achieve their educational potential.

The Plan uses evidence from 2000 to 2007 to set out goals and targets across early childhood, school and tertiary education sectors that will significantly raise Pasifika achievement, retention and participation.

“Our government is committed to making sure that Pasifika students achieve and succeed at all levels of the education system. This Plan is our opportunity to be explicit and deliberate about what we need to zero in on at each stage of our Pasifika students education journey,” said Chris Carter.

The Ministries of Education and Pacific Island Affairs have worked in partnership to produce the Pasifika Education Plan 2008-2012, with contributions from all education agencies.

Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said the goals and targets of this new Plan were deliberately designed to stretch the education system further.

"Monitoring data shows that Pasifika education is heading in the right direction, the challenge for the next five years is to ensure that we continue to move forward. The best way to do that is to have a more concentrated and collaborative approach, working together with our Pasifika families and communities.”

The 2007 Pasifika Education Plan Monitoring Report also released today shows positive trends. More Pasifika students are gaining strong learning foundations with participation in early childhood education continuing to grow, and more Pasifika students are leaving school with at least NCEA Level 2. In tertiary education Pasifika participation continues to be the fastest growing of all ethnic groups.

"While the report shows Pasifika education is heading in the right direction, we need to ensure these gains continue. This Plan is about everyone in education working for achievement for all Pasifika students. We all have a role to play in the future success of our young people," said Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.
