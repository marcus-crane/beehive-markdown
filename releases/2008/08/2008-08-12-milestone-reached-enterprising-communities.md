Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment, Darren Hughes, today welcomed the 200th recipient of the enterprising Communities Grant.   

“I am delighted to announce that Te Reo O Raukawa today joins 199 other organisations who have proven themselves to be leading economic growth and long-term sustainability within their communities,” said Minister Hughes. 

 “Te Reo o Raukawa is an Otaki-based Trust that has established a local radio station and aims to provide training in radio operations to local Iwi. 

“This grant marks an important milestone since the programme moved from the Department of Labour to the Ministry of Social Development in 2005. 

“In the three years since, the scheme has provided funds to support a wide variety of projects from recycling and waste care initiatives, establishment of childcare facilities and services, community nursery expansions and tourism ventures,” said Mr Hughes. 

Funding is given to projects that will create skills and job opportunities for people who are finding it hard to get work. 

Enterprising Communities Grants support not-for-profit community projects that plan to become self sufficient and provide training and employment opportunities to local people. 

Today, Mr Hughes gave a speech at Earthlink Incorporated in Upper Hutt. 

“In addition to the success of Te Reo o Raukawa it was really encouraging to see another one of the real success stories of the Enterprising Communities Grant scheme in Earthlink Incorporated”. 

“The Hutt City Council and Work and Income pitched in to ensure that a sustainable environment and sustainable work opportunities were created at Earthlink and its really paying off”, said Mr Hughes 

“Since starting, this community enterprise has assisted 31 disadvantaged people, many of whom were on sickness or invalids benefits, into real jobs in the community”. 

“Earthlink were one of the first successful recipients of an Enterprising Communities grant and now we have 200 making positive contributions to their communities”.
