The New Zealand Government is establishing a scheme to provide training in New Zealand for [Recognised Seasonal Employer](http://www.dol.govt.nz/initiatives/strategy/rse/index.asp) (RSE) scheme workers from the Pacific, and is inviting Solomon Islands to join the five other nations which already have kick start status under the scheme, Prime Minister Helen Clark announced from Niue today.

“The first year of the RSE scheme has been a success. Over 4500 workers have come to New Zealand, working for more than 100 employers. On average, over summer and autumn, these workers spent four months in New Zealand and were each able to send several thousand NZ dollars home to benefit their families and communities,” Helen Clark said.

“The Labour-led Government is committed to getting the RSE working even better. We are therefore undertaking several new initiatives to enhance the benefits of the scheme to the Pacific.

“NZAID is working to establish a scheme to offer basic education and training to RSE workers, focused on areas such as basic literacy, numeracy, and financial literacy, with the aim of having a pilot in place by early 2009.

“These types of initiatives will help expand the benefits of the RSE scheme to workers and employers. This will help ensure that it delivers on the dual objectives to provide a secure labour supply for New Zealand employers while sparking genuine development opportunities for Pacific peoples.

“More than 200 workers have come to New Zealand this year under the RSE scheme. Our government has decided to extend status to Solomon Islands to boost support for workers engaged under the scheme,” Helen Clark said.
