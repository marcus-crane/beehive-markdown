New Zealand is to increase its diplomatic representation in Brazil by appointing a diplomat as Consul-General in Sao Paulo, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

New Zealand has operated a Consulate in Sao Paulo since 1999, which is currently headed by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise.

"The appointment will help to enhance important political, economic, and trade links between our two countries," said Mr Peters, who made the  
announcement during a meeting with Brazil’s Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, in Auckland this evening.

“Brazil is an emerging economic and political superpower, and Sao Paulo is the economic and financial centre of Brazil.

“Expanding our diplomatic presence in Sao Paulo will help New Zealand promote its interests in Brazil, complementing the work of our Embassy in Brasilia.

“We are seeking to boost our relationship with Brazil, and during discussions with Mr Amorim, it was agreed that our foreign ministries should meet more frequently to discuss common perspectives.

“This reflects Brazil’s importance as a global player on many issues of importance to New Zealand, such as in the World Trade Organisation (WTO), where Brazil is a valued ally on agricultural trade, and also on international environmental issues.

“At the same time, New Zealand business interests are growing in Brazil, particularly in the agribusiness, tourism, education, and telecommunications services sectors,” said Mr Peters.

New Zealand's embassy in Brasilia opened in 2001.
