Reductions in nitrous oxide emissions included in the Emissions Trading Bill are deliberately ambitious, and achievable, agriculture minister Jim Anderton says.

He says the government is looking for new technologies to emerge to help meet a target of reducing agriculture emissions by three hundred thousand tones.

“But we won’t be expecting the impossible if no new technologies emerge.

“There are no changes to the way agriculture is dealt with in the Bill. The date for entry into the ETS for agriculture is still 2013. The Government has kept faith with the Memorandum of Understanding that we signed with agriculture in 2003. There will not be a price on non-CO2 agriculture emissions in the first commitment period.”

The government is spending $175 million over five year to better manage land and prepare for climate change. Examples include:

• Six million dollars will be invested this year on research agreed with the agriculture sector. One focus will be reducing greenhouse gas reduction emissions and increasing the use of carbon sinks. (Sinks are used to ‘soak up’ greenhouse gases.)

• A technology transfer strategy will make information and technology available to land managers.

• A greenhouse gas ‘foot-printing’ strategy will help us find out more about agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. It will help to position us to respond to the pressure over climate change and emissions in export markets around the world. And it will help us to develop more business opportunities for our eco-friendly low-carbon products.

“This work is critical to change the way we use land, as we have to if we take climate change seriously. It will help us to reduce agricultural emissions and to plant new forests.

“The Government is also working with the dairy and fertiliser industries to develop a Heads of Agreement. It will get us working together on measures to significantly reduce nitrous oxide emissions in the dairy sector over the next five year, through research, demonstration and a communication programme. It would help dairy to prepare for entry into the emissions trading scheme in 2013 by substantially increasing the use of technologies to reduce nitrous oxide emissions and nitrate losses over the next five years,” Jim Anderton said.
