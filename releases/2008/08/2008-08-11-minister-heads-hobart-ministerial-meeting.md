Local Government Minister Nanaia Mahuta will today leave to attend the 7th annual Local Government and Planning Ministers’ Council meeting in Hobart, Australia.

“This is an opportunity to discuss issues of common concern with our Australian counterparts, and provide an update on local government issues in New Zealand,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“The meeting will focus on a number of issues, including climate change, and improving services to indigenous communities.

“Climate change is a crucial issue worldwide.  It will be good to provide information on what New Zealand is doing on climate change, and to learn first hand of the Australians’ approach to this issue.”

The Local Government and Planning Ministers’ Council is one of a series of joint Ministers’ councils which has a standing membership of state and federal Ministers, and New Zealand Ministers.    

The meeting will also discuss local government sustainability and development assessment reform.

Nanaia Mahuta, who is also Minister of Youth Affairs and Associate Minister of Tourism, will also hold portfolio-related meetings with youth and tourism officials in Hobart.

She returns to New Zealand on 13 August.
