Nine successful regions to receive government funding for sustainable tourism have been announced today by Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor.

Each region will receive $88,000 over three years through the Sustainable Tourism Advisers in Regions (STAR) Project for them to employ an adviser who will work one on one with tourism operators to help reduce their business’ impact on the environment.

The nine successful regions are:

• Auckland

• Central Otago

• Coromandel

• Hawke’s Bay

• Marlborough

• North Canterbury

• Queenstown

• Wairarapa

• Wellington

Mr O’Connor congratulated the successful regions, saying each one has demonstrated a strong commitment to the project both from local government and from within the region.

“The STAR initiative contributes to one of the most important outcomes in the New Zealand Tourism Strategy which highlights the need for the tourism sector to take a leading role in protecting and enhancing New Zealand’s environment. I congratulate the successful regions and look forward to hearing about developments in their regions in the area of environmental sustainability.

“This new project complements the recently developed Qualmark Green criteria which recognises tourism businesses that can show evidence of their effort to minimise their environmental impact. The STAR advisors will give priority to Qualmark accredited businesses which aspire to improve their performance in sustainability.

“Ensuring New Zealand tourism is sustainable is vital to the survival of the industry. I am confident these advisors will make a huge difference in the regions. I encourage individual tourism operators to use the services of these advisors, making every effort to ensure their businesses are sustainable,” said Mr O’Connor.
