Minister of Health David Cunliffe today dismissed claims of District Health Board amalgamation.

Mr Cunliffe said he had been open regarding calls for greater DHB collaboration, and stated that there would be no reduction in the number of Boards in the foreseeable future.

“I have made it clear on many, many occasions that I expect to see increased levels of national and regional collaboration– that does not equate to less DHBs.”

“There are 21 DHBs now and there will be 21 DHBs into the foreseeable future.”

“But we are going to insist on more collaboration.

“That means more use of regional clinical networks to underpin consistent service delivery in all areas.

“It means using every opportunity to gain the advantages of joint procurement to reduce any compressible unnecessary costs.

“It will mean more co-ordinated planning in areas like workforce development, information technology standards and tertiary health care delivery.”
