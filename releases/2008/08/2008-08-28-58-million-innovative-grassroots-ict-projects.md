"The 2008 / 2009 funding round of the Community Partnership Fund will open on 6 October 2008 and the government looks forward to receiving applications,” said Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Ruth Dyson.

The new [Digital Strategy 2.0](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/feature/digital+strategy+20) allocated $5.8 million dollars to fund innovative, community-based information and communication technology (ICT) projects through the Community Partnership Fund (CPF) which provides funding for projects that focus on building ICT skills and capability within New Zealand’s communities. 

"The Community Partnership Fund has allocated funds to foster development of internet based ideas.  One such proposal was to assist children to surf the internet safely by developing an educational tool called Hector's World," said Ms Dyson.

"This tool can now be used in classrooms and homes and is a great example of the funding exceptional ideas.  By supporting grassroots ICT initiatives, the government is actively assisting communities throughout New Zealand.

Since 2005, the Community Partnership Fund has provided funding to over 100 community-driven ICT projects across the country.

“The Government has so far provided $17.4 million through the Community Partnership Fund while over $30 million was contributed from communities, businesses and local government,” said Ms Dyson.

“We must also tackle issues of geographic isolation, fear of new technologies and ignorance of ICT’s benefits.  The Community Partnership Fund is an excellent example of business, government and community working collaboratively to overcome many of these issues,” said Ms Dyson.

Projects that receive funding are community-driven and have partners that provide financial or 'in-kind' contributions that match or exceed the funding applied for. Projects must be sustainable after funding from the Community Partnership Fund ceases.
