Associate Minister of Health Minister Mita Ririnui will be visiting Perth next week to sign an arrangement between the New Zealand and Western Australian governments.

The purpose of the arrangement, to be signed on the 13th August at Government House in Perth, is to establish a trans-Tasman relationship between the respective governments to enable communication, information sharing and networking as a possible mechanism for improving the indigenous health in each country.

“This is the first arrangement of its kind between the New Zealand and the Western Australian governments. It will be beneficial for both Maori and Aboriginal health as we will be given the opportunity to communicate and share information to advance indigenous health in both countries” said Minister Ririnui.

“It is common knowledge that indigenous people suffer worse health statistics than non-indigenous populations. This arrangement is an effort between our two governments to improve those statistics.

“Indigenous health has some of the most innovative strategies for reducing health inequalities and the ability to share these strategies on an international level as well as view how other indigenous peoples are working will provide great insight into new strategies for both Maori and Aboriginal people.”

The arrangement between the two governments will enable the Ministry of Health of New Zealand and the Department of Health in Australia to work together on issues such as health research methodologies, workforce development, equity of health outcomes for indigenous populations and to facilitate exchanges of personnel between the two ministries.

“New Zealand Government is committed to improving indigenous health and this is an example of innovative ways this can be done.”
