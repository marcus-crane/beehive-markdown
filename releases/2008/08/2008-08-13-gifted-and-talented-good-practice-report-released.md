Education Review Office Minister Chris Carter released a report today that will be helpful for teachers looking to better understand and more effectively extend learning opportunities for Gifted and Talented students.

In the report, ‘Schools' Provision for Gifted and Talented Students: Good Practice’, the Education Review Office has set out some best practice examples of successful initiatives developed by schools.

“We found that some gifted and talented students are not engaged in learning because they don't see school as being relevant to them," Chris Carter said.

"The evidence shows that by providing special support programmes tailored to suit individual needs, school becomes more relevant to these students."

Kelston Girls' College, where the Minister launched the report, has a High Motivation Class for academically gifted Years 9 and 10 students, a High Motivation Pacific Class for Year 10 Pacific students, and a High Performing Sports group.

Speaking at Kelston Girls' College today, Chris Carter said gifted and talented students can be found in a range of different fields.

“As well as students who are top of the class in academic subjects, some students show exceptional talents in sports, music or arts.

"This report shows how teachers can extend the abilities and talents of gifted students,” said Chris Carter.

The Ministry of Education is currently reviewing the education provided for gifted and talented learners, including professional development for teachers.
