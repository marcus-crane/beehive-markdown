Enhanced Taskforce Green funding to help with the clean-up of the recent storms affecting the Horowhenua and North Canterbury regions was announced today by Ruth Dyson, Minister for Social Development and Employment.

“These storms have caused a great deal of damage and today I've authorised funding for Enhanced Taskforce Green to assist with the clean-up and recovery in the worst affected area.  This funding is in addition to the range of emergency assistance that the Ministry of Social Development has already provided to help people affected by the storms,” said Ruth Dyson.

“Enhanced Taskforce Green will cover the wages of workers and supervisors to help with the clean-up operation in areas where there is too much damage for local councils to manage alone. Enhanced Taskforce Green can help with clearing trees and debris, repairing fencing, building repairs and general clean-up. Enhanced Taskforce Green workers can be local jobseekers, students, and workers who may not be able to work because of the damage caused by the storms.

“The emergency assistance already available includes Recoverable Assistance Payments and Special Needs Grants to meet peoples’ immediate and essential needs. This assistance is available for such things as the replacement of bedding and furniture, help with accommodation or food costs and the repair of septic tanks.

“The Government Helpline for people affected by the severe weather conditions has also been activated. Anyone needing assistance from government services can phone 0800 779 997.

“The Ministry of Social Development co-ordinates the helpline which provides people affected by the weather with a single point of contact for information on the government services available.

“Agencies are working closely together to help these regions get back to normal as quickly as possible,” said Ms Dyson.
