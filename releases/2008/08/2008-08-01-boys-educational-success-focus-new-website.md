Today Education Minister Chris Carter launched a new website and an ERO report that will help schools meet the educational needs of boys.

The ‘Success for Boys’ website provides a directory of Ministry of Education resources, New Zealand examples of successful practices and recent international research on boys educational programmes. 

Chris Carter said that today’s announcement will be of particular interest to schools where boys are currently falling behind.

“While there are many high-achieving boys in our schools right now, at age six, twice as many boys require reading recovery as girls.

“At NCEA Level 3, girls’ achievement in literacy has surpassed boys, while in Maths and Science achievements levels are broadly the same.

“There is clearly an issue about promoting reading and writing skills among some boys. These resources will help schools develop programmes that focus on lifting the literacy levels of boys.

Chris Carter also said that it is very important to give a positive message to boys that achievement in school work was important.

“Fathers need to tell their sons that doing well in reading and writing is just as important as being successful in sport or any other school activity.”

Today Chris Carter also released the ERO report: Boys’ Education: Good Practice in Secondary School.

The report includes case studies from ten New Zealand secondary schools that are successfully engaging boys in education.

Launching the resource at Kelston Boys’ High School has a special significance for Chris Carter as this was the school where he began his teaching career.
