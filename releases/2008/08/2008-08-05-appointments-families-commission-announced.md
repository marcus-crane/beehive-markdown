I am pleased to announce the appointments for the Families Commission said Social Development Minister Ruth Dyson.

The Families Commission, established in 2004, provides a voice for New Zealand families and whānau. The Commission speaks out for all families to promote a better understanding of family issues and needs.

"I have appointed four commissioners, including Dr Jan Pryor as Chief Commissioner replacing current chief commissioner Rajen Prasad.  Dr Prasad did not seek reappointment, said Ruth Dyson.

The four appointments are:

- Dr Jan PRYOR as Chief Commissioner (3 year appointment).
- Ms Sandra ALOFIVAE who has been reappointed as a Commissioner (two year appointment).
- Mr Gregory FORTUIN who has been appointed as a Commissioner (three year appointment).
- Mr Kim WORKMAN who has been appointed as a Commissioner (three year appointment).

"I'd like to thank Rajen Prasad for his service.  Rajen has given the Commission a very solid base from which to grow and I welcome the new commissioners who will continue this important work.  The Commission is a strong advocate and provides a valuable voice for all families," said Ruth Dyson.
