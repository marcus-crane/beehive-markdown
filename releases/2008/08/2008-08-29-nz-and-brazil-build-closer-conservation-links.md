A Memorandum of Understanding signed today between Brazil and New Zealand will lead to cooperation in the management, research and protection of natural protected areas Conservation Minister Steve Chadwick said.

“Greater understanding of the conservation issues facing New Zealand and Brazil will benefit both countries and be used to positive effect on the world stage,” Steve Chadwick said.

“This agreement follows other successful ones with Italy, Chile and Korea, and will see the sharing of research, knowledge and expertise and provide opportunities for greater understanding of our environmental challenges.”

The agreement aims to achieve practical conservation outcomes, including research, the protection and recovery of ecosystems and endangered species, management of weeds and pests, as well as the management of tourism operators in national parks.

“Brazil is interested in how New Zealand balances commercial use with the conservation of protected areas – managing conservation values in this way is relatively new to Brazil, but something they are really committed to. This is an opportunity for New Zealand to showcase its skills and make a real contribution to another country.”

A Department of Conservation (DOC) representative visited Brazil earlier this year to share information about the value protected conservation areas contribute to tourism, and later this year a delegation of Brazilian environmental officials will visit New Zealand to study how DOC works with tourism operators and manages the effect of visitors on protected areas.

“New Zealand is recognised as a world leader in many areas of conservation, particularly pest control and the recovery of threatened species, so I am delighted that we will share our experiences with Brazil.

“Both countries face challenges and this is a really positive agreement that allows both countries to learn from each other,” she said.

Steve Chadwick, on behalf of the New Zealand Government, and Brazil’s Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, on behalf of the Federative Republic of Brazil, signed the memorandum today at a ceremony held at Auckland’s Sky City.
