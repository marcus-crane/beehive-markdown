It is essential New Zealand continues to deliver on our 100% Pure New Zealand brand and the government has committed significant money in doing so, Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor said today.

Mr O’Connor was responding to a statement from Air New Zealand’s Deputy CEO Norm Thompson on funding for tourism.

“The government has committed significant funding both directly and indirectly into the tourism industry. I recognise that it is a more challenging market at present and to keep up with our competitors we must continue to offer an authentic, world-class product and deliver on our world famous 100% Pure New Zealand brand,” said Mr O’Connor.

“This year’s Budget committed heavily to transport, which benefits the tourism industry hugely, with the total spend on land transport over the next four years forecast to be over $10 billion.

“Also, $124.4 million has been committed to develop New Zealand’s arts and culture and preserve New Zealand’s heritage including management of historic places, the development of a memorial park in Wellington and funding for Te Papa.

“There are a number of other projects and initiatives which received government funding in this year’s Budget and will benefit the tourism industry.

“We know that tourism is one of the most significant contributors to the New Zealand economy. Its sheer size and its potential to help transform our economy into one which is more sustainable and of higher value means it is a priority industry for government attention.

“That’s why the government recently committed an extra $2.83 million over the next year for the implementation of the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015. The money will contribute to tourism workforce initiatives, advancing sector research, building Maori tourism capability, and environmental initiatives including the promotion of new Qualmark Green criteria to international and domestic visitors.

“Extra funding for the tourism industry will be inevitable in the future to ensure New Zealand tourism continues to prosper and we continue to deliver on our 100% Pure brand. The government has committed substantial funding into the industry thus far and will continue to do so,” said Mr O’Connor.
