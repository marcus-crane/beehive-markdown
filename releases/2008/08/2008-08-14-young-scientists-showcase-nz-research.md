This year’s MacDiarmid Young Scientists of the Year Awards winners again show New Zealand has some incredibly talented science leaders in the making, says Research, Science and Technology Minister Pete Hodgson. 

“We have world-class research being carried out by dedicated young researchers in areas that are making a big difference for New Zealand and the world,” Pete Hodgson said while presenting the awards in Auckland.

A marine ecologist from the University of Otago, Dr Rebecca McLeod, was named the [MacDiarmid Young Scientist of the Year](http://www.frst.govt.nz/news/Winner-2008-MacDiarmid-Young-Scientist-of-the-Year-Award) for 2008.

In total, 13 awards were presented to winners from an original pool of 146 entries from students in New Zealand universities, Crown research institutes and specialist research organisations. More than $50,000 was given in prize money.

“Young scientists are communicating the value of science and working in innovative areas. They are proving to be excellent role models and helping to raise the international profile of New Zealand as a base for scientific excellence.”

The MacDiarmid Awards are presented annually by the government’s independent investment agency, the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology, to celebrate the achievements of New Zealand’s future leaders in science and encourage others to follow in their footsteps.

Pete Hodgson also acknowledged the important role established scientists and businesses play in mentoring promising students.

“The MacDiarmid Award winners have all received ongoing support and guidance from academic supervisors and some from business partners working with them on commercial applications for their research.

“That collaboration is a crucial part of further strengthening New Zealand’s scientific capability and increasing the change of successful innovation.”
