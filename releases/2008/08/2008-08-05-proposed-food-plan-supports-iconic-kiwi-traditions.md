Since 2003, the New Zealand Food Safety Authority (NZFSA) has been developing proposals for a new food safety regulatory system through the Domestic Food Review. The result of all this work will be a new Food Act, but this has not yet been introduced to Parliament. To build on the momentum of the Review, NZFSA has provided for a Voluntary Implementation Programme (VIP) which enables local councils to take up the new approach without a specific requirement to do so. Over 60 per cent of New Zealand’s councils have done so, and by the end of this year that number will be around 75 per cent. But even if your council has gone into the VIP, it is still voluntary for all the food businesses in the district, although NZFSA is hopeful that most businesses will see its benefit.

Under the current Food Act 1981 all food selling activities, no matter their size or frequency of operation, are required to meet the provisions of the Food Hygiene Regulations 1974. Under the proposed system, which is designed to be flexible and to avoid the application of a “one-size-fits-all” approach, it is proposed that all persons who sell food will be required to operate using one of three risk management tools: a food control plan, a national programme (both of which are regulatory tools), or food handler guidance (a non-regulatory, educational tool that provides information on cleaning, sanitation and on how people can prepare food safely).

Given the range of clubs in New Zealand, from those with full catering facilities and paid staff right through to small sports clubs not employing any bar or food service staff, there will be different provisions that apply. However, let me make this clear, small clubs that provide sufficient food simply to meet their bar licensing requirement (by providing for example, hot chips or pies) and those that provide afternoon teas or suppers based on the “bring-a-plate” or “pot luck” traditions will only be subject to food handler guidance. There will be no requirement for such clubs to have a food control plan.

Even where a club provides food on a commercial scale and is operating with a food control plan, there will be nothing to require that the “bring-a-plate” or “pot luck meal” events run by club members be covered by the plan. Food handler guidance will be it.

I am concerned that small clubs are being told that they will need to hire expensive consultants to help them meet regulatory requirements when the truth is they won’t have to. The proposed system is being designed to:

1\. support “iconic” Kiwi traditions by providing the organisers of sausage sizzles and other food related fundraisers, bring-a-plate and pot luck events with food handler guidance free of charge; and

2\. provide commercial operations with pre-evaluated template food control plans, that they can fill in and register with their local council.

NZFSA has a good working relationship with the Sports Clubs Association of New Zealand (Inc) (SCANZ) as it has with many other associations, including the Hospitality Association, the Restaurant Association and Clubs New Zealand. NZFSA will continue to work with SCANZ and other associations on how the particular needs of their members will be accommodated within the proposed new food regulatory system.
