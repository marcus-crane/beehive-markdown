Seven outstanding people have been appointed to the New Zealand Fast Forward board, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said today.

Jim Anderton said he was delighted with the calibre of the new board members, which matched the potential of the up to $2 billion investment to boost innovation in our food and pastoral agriculture sectors.

“These people will help facilitate the investment of the single biggest boost to innovation in our history. They will play a hugely important role in maintaining our global leadership in food production.”

The board members are: Bill Baylis, Bill Falconer, Rob Fenwick, Richard Janes, Kevin Marshall, Mike Matthews, and Jacqueline Rowarth.

The board will be chaired by Bill Falconer.

New Zealand Fast Forward is an initiative set up with $700 million from Government, to be allocated over the 10-15-year life of the fund. The Government contribution is to be matched with private sector investment.

Already seven industry groups have committed to be cornerstone investors, each putting in at least $10 million in the next five years.

Jim Anderton said the board members all had a long association with different sectors in New Zealand’s primary industries.

“They understand the importance of innovation, of maintaining our global leadership in food production, and of applying knowledge – new technologies and new products - to our primary industries.”

He said the New Zealand Fast Forward initiative had been warmly embraced by the primary industries sector.

“There is clear and overwhelming recognition of the timeliness of this initiative.”
