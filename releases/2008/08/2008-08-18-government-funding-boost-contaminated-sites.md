Four contaminated site projects, in Bay of Plenty, Canterbury, Otago, and Tasman and Nelson, will be allocated about $150,000 from the Government’s clean-up fund, Environment Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

 The allocations are the first from the Ministry for the Environment’s Contaminated Sites Remediation Fund this year.

 A total of $890,000 of the $3.28 million annual fund is contestable by regional councils and unitary authorities through two application rounds a year.

 “These contaminated sites need to be cleaned up for the sake of communities and the environment all around New Zealand, and the Government is pleased to be able to partner councils in getting the job done,” said Trevor Mallard.

 “Six applications were received this time, and four extremely worthy proposals chosen. Two have previously received money from the Fund, and it is great to see the relationship with the councils involved is working well.”

- **Canterbury**: Just over $100,000 in this funding round goes towards Environment Canterbury’s site investigation of the **“Bankside” pit**, a former World War II fuel tank site that has become an illegal dump.
- **Otago**: About $10,000 goes towards Otago Regional Council’s remedial action plan for the third stage of the former **Barrow Box** sawmill site.
- **Bay of Plenty:** Environment Bay of Plenty gets $14,000 for its clean-up plan for the **Omokoroa Boatyard** site where contaminated material is leaching into the valued estuary.
- **Nelson-Tasman**: Nelson and Tasman councils are to receive about $31,000 towards joint investigations of sheep dips on numerous farms to determine the nature and extent of possible contamination.

“While the Government has prioritised the funding of large scale clean-ups such as the Mapua site near Nelson, Tui Mine near Te Aroha, Patea’s former freezing works, and the Waiwhetu Stream in Hutt City, it’s important that smaller projects also get help from the Fund,” said Trevor Mallard.
