Associate Minister of Health Mita Ririnui signed a trans-Tasman Indigenous Health agreement with the Western Australian Government today in Perth, Western Australia.

This is the first agreement of its kind between the two governments, initiated to create a formal pathway for the Ministry of Health NZ and the Department of Health WA to enable information sharing and communication on strategies for indigenous health.

“This signing marks an historic day between our two Governments and two indigenous peoples. This ceremony signifies that the agreement is much more than just a lot of words on a page, but the meeting of two cultures” said Minister Ririnui during the signing ceremony.

“As part of this agreement, we would like to exchange our cultural and health practices, our programmes and our health initiatives – what has worked for us and what hasn’t.”

“Maori have always venerated their ancestors and their land and we have much to learn from Aboriginal people. Yours is an ancient race that has lived on this land for many thousands of years retaining unique culture that extends back to dreamtime. Maori come from a similar history, with our whakapapa and tikanga stemming from Hawaiki.”

“Maori health is improving but we still have a long road ahead of us. It is through your traditional practices, our Aboriginal cousins, where we will be able to learn from your extensive practices and knowledge and in turn, show and share with you what we as Maori do.”

As Hon Jim McGinty, Minister of Health for Western Australia was unable to attend the ceremony, signing the agreement on his behalf was Dr. Peter Flett, Acting Director General of Health for Western Australia.
