The Minister for Social Development and Employment, Ruth Dyson is pleased to announce that a development and lease agreement was signed between Parekarangi Trust and Child, Youth and Family last night at a ceremony on the Te Pakira marae.

Minister Dyson said that the positive and constructive working relationship with the Parekarangi Trust had been pivotal to plans to build a Youth Justice residence in the region.

“The Parekarangi Trust is a valued partner of Child, Youth and Family. I’m very pleased the Trust has provided us with the opportunity to work so closely with them in bringing a much needed resource to the young people in their community. The willingness of communities to be part of the solution is essential to turning young lives around,” said Ms Dyson.

The 10-hectare site is on Parekarangi Trust land, off State Highway 30, Rotorua, 12 kilometres south of Rotorua City.

"This is a significant step forward and Child, Youth and Family expect site work and construction to begin in the fourth quarter of this year, said Ms Dyson.

“We remain on track for Youth Justice Rotorua to open as planned in 2010.  The centre is a much needed facility that will provide accommodation for up to 40 young people and employment in the region for approximately 80 full time equivalent staff. There will also be educational, recreational, administrative and cultural facilities constructed on the site,” said Ms Dyson.

The land at Kaharoa, the previously proposed site, has been declared surplus. It is being sold using a Land Information NZ accredited agent.
