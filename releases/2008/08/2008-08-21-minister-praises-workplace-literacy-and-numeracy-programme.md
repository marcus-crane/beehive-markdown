Associate Tertiary Minister Maryan Street saw the direct benefits of learning literacy and numeracy skills on the job at her visit to Queensberry Leather Ltd today.

“Today was an excellent opportunity to see first hand what workplace literacy and numeracy programmes can achieve for New Zealand businesses,” said Maryan Street.

“Our continuing wealth as a country depends on Kiwis being supported to work to the best of their potential and this includes developing high level literacy and numeracy skills for the workplace.”

Queensberry have worked closely with Workbase, the New Zealand Centre for Workforce Literacy Development, to develop a flexible programme that is tailored to the specific demands of the workplace, employees’ skills and the overall goals of the business. Participation is voluntary and individual learning plans are agreed with each employee.

“Queensberry recognise that providing the opportunity to learn literacy and numeracy at work is an important part of supporting their employees to deliver the best service possible to their customers,” she said.

“Workplace literacy and numeracy programmes like these have many benefits, with employers reporting better employee retention and attendance, less errors and higher quality work. That is why the government is helping employers to introduce these programmes in workplaces across the country.”

The literacy and numeracy programme delivered by Workbase for Queensberry is funded through the Workplace Literacy Fund which is administered by the Tertiary Education Commission.

This year’s Budget included $168 million over four years to build literacy, language and numeracy skills within the existing workforce. This new investment more than doubles the opportunities for adults to learn in the workplace, at education organisations and in community settings, and gain the skills they need for work, family and community life.

In August the Tertiary Education Commission launched the Literacy, Language and Numeracy Action Plan - Ako Tuāpapa which provides a detailed outline of how the new investment will be spent.

More information on the Literacy, Language and Numeracy Action Plan - Ako Tuāpapa and the Workplace Literacy Fund can be found on the TEC website.
