The Minister responsible for Archives New Zealand Judith Tizard says the inaugural Archives New Zealand Scholarship will encourage the use of archives holdings in new and innovative ways.

Applications are now open for the annual $6000 Scholarship. It is available to people or groups who are developing quality projects that use the Archives holdings.

Judith Tizard announced the scholarship at the end of 2007 as part of the celebrations to mark the 50 years since the establishment of the National Archives in New Zealand and the passing of the Archives Act in 1957.

 

"Archives New Zealand is a remarkable storehouse of our nation’s records and treasures, including the original nine sheets of the Treaty of Waitangi," she said.

"The holdings include an astounding 86 kilometres of archives, many of which are yet to be explored. Added to this there is a considerable collection of photographs, maps and plans and motion picture reels.

“The scholarship will enable and encourage the use of the holdings in ways that will add to and enrich our nation’s stories for the future.

“Well kept records enable us to look back at our past. They give us a sense of where we have come from, so that we may have a clearer idea of where we're going. They enhance our historical and cultural heritage and help us build a stronger national identity.

“Knowing our history and heritage helps us to understand who we are as New Zealanders. As a result we become a stronger, richer and more confident nation.”

Archives New Zealand is making these records more accessible to many more people. This is being achieved through its ongoing digitisation project which will give greater accessibility online to many more public records of historical importance.

People can also access records in the department’s four reading rooms in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.

Information about the scholarship including how to apply is available on the Archives New Zealand website [www.archives.govt.nz](http://www.archives.govt.nz).
