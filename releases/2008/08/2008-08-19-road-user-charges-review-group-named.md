Transport Minister Annette King has today confirmed the members of an independent group to review Road User Charges.

“In July, I announced a review of the model for allocating the costs of maintaining roads and building new ones, and for reviewing the way these charges are collected,” Ms King said.

“The review will consider the basis on which National Land Transport Programme costs should be allocated and collected and ensure that the charging system is fair, efficient and based on up-to-date information.”

The members of the Review Group, appointed after consultation with major stakeholders, are: James Hill (Chair), Warren Young and Tony Gibson. All three have expertise and knowledge of economics, business principles and the transport and roading sector.

James Hill is a Chartered Accountant.  He is currently self-employed as a professional director and consultant. Previously, he was the Managing Partner at KPMG.  He is currently the Chairman of Manukau Water Limited, Seafood Processors Limited, the CDP Group Limited and Sealegs Corporation Ltd.  He was also a member of the Transit New Zealand Board until July 2008.

Warren Young has held senior governance roles in the health sector for a number of organisations including chair of the NZ Blood Service, Auckland Healthcare Services, Health South Canterbury, Capital Coast Health, and Hutt Valley District Health Boards.  He has held a variety of other directorships in the private and public sector.

Tony Gibson is an experienced transport professional with extensive national and international experience in senior management roles within shipping and logistics.  He has previously been Managing Director of Maersk Line New Zealand, Director of Maersk Logistics and Managing Director of P&O Nedlloyd for New Zealand and Pacific Islands

Ministry of Transport Acting Chief Executive Wayne Donnelly will act as the review adviser, assisting with links to the Government sector.

The Group is due to report back to Government in March 2009.
