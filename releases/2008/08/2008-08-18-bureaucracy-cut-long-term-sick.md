The Minister for Social Development and Employment, Ruth Dyson, is welcoming a cut in unnecessary administration for elderly, sick and disabled people.

“We know that the circumstances of many elderly, long-term sick and disabled people don’t change from year to year,” said Ms Dyson.

“From now on people receiving New Zealand Superannuation, Veteran’s Pension, Invalid’s Benefit, or Disability Allowance will just receive a letter checking that the details Work and Income holds are correct.

“If the information is correct, the person doesn’t have to do anything.  Previously they would have to fill in a form every year reconfirming all their details.

“This relieves clients and case managers from excessive paperwork and allows them more time to have meaningful discussions about what support a person may need” said Ms Dyson.

“It is this kind of policy - treating people based on their individual circumstances and focusing support on those who are ready to plot a realistic path back into work - that has led to plummeting benefit numbers, record unemployment and falling child poverty.
