Applications to the Safety Development Fund for 2008/09 are now open, Racing Minister Winston Peters announced today. 

“The second year of the Safety Fund starts today, and clubs are invited to submit applications,” Mr Peters said.

"The Fund provides financial support for projects that enhance race course safety, which is one of the most pressing issues in the industry. This includes the health and safety of riders, spectators, officials, and others involved in racing, as well as the health and safety of the animals.

“Clubs need to be proactive in addressing their safety issues and this fund supports them to do so.

“Last season, the Safety Fund was used for a wide range of projects, including installing modern and safe running rails at a number of tracks, grandstand structural repairs, safer horse stabling facilities, and single-level greyhound kennels.

“There are around 150 racing clubs racing at nearly 70 racecourses around the country. Clubs should be looking at the condition of their facilities, and assessing whether they provide a safe environment,” Mr Peters said.

Applications for the first round close on 30 September. A second funding round will open on 1 February 2009.

Information on how to apply to the Racing Safety Development Fund and a copy of the application form, is available on the Department of Internal Affairs’ website www.dia.govt.nz or by calling 04 495 9303.
