Veterans’ welfare received a $1 million boost today with the handing over of a cheque from Associate Senior Citizens Minister Winston Peters and Veterans’ Affairs Minister Rick Barker to the Returned and Services Association.

The presentation was made to RSA National President Robin Klistcher at a National Executive Council meeting.

"This money recognises the valuable work the RSA does in assisting New Zealand’s veterans. It is a sign of respect and thanks on behalf of New Zealand to servicemen and women who have made so many sacrifices for our defence and freedom," Mr Peters said.

"New Zealand First is very pleased to have been able to negotiate this initiative in Budget 2008 to help meet the needs of many veterans and their families."

“The men and women who are put in harm's way defending our country rightly occupy a special place in New Zealand society. Our government is committed to ensuring the services delivered to them are of the highest standard and that our duty of care to them is maintained,” Mr Barker said.

“This contribution is part of a broader government programme investing in the care of our veterans.

“The reintegration of Veteran’s Affairs New Zealand as part of the New Zealand Defence Force, and the rewrite of the War Pensions Act currently underway are other examples of this government’s commitment to supporting veterans,” Mr Barker said.

The RSA Executive Council has deciding to accept the $1 million in four instalments as the most effective way of sustainably supporting the RSA’s welfare infrastructure.
