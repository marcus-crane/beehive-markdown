Minister for Courts, Rick Barker, has welcomed the findings of research conducted on Manukau and Waitakere Family Violence Courts. The Ministry of Justice released the evaluation reports today. 

“The Family Violence Courts, a judicial initiative, is a constructive improvement in the Justice system to assist in dealing with domestic violence in New Zealand. This evaluation will help to further improve the ongoing effectiveness of the Courts,” Mr Barker said.

The Ministry of Justice has been making ongoing improvements to the operation of these courts. Specifically, the evaluation’s findings validate the work the Ministry is doing to further improve how Family Violence Courts operate. Such work includes Family Violence Court training for court staff and key stakeholders, developing National Operating Guidelines and involvement in developing the new Independent Victim Advocates role for Family Violence Courts. In addition, the Government has provided funding for non-mandated counselling and rehabilitation programmes.

Internationally, Family Violence Courts have been set up in response to recognition across communities, governments and the judiciary that family violence requires a different approach to other forms of violence. Because the relationships are close and personal, the issues are complex and often the parties expect the close relationships to continue, but they want the violence to stop. The Justice system needs to provide for more complex situations and for issues to be addressed quickly. This is where the Family Violence Courts have been an improvement.

New Zealand's Family Violence Courts are a judicially-led response to community and government concerns about the extent and impact of family violence on our society. New Zealand’s approach shares many common themes with overseas jurisdictions, such as Government agency and community collaboration, dedicated judiciary and court days, promotion of victim safety and offender accountability.

“Family Violence Courts seek to provide a more holistic response to family violence than that currently available in the conventional court setting,” Mr Barker said.

“As our approach to these courts evolve, evaluations such as this assist in identifying what is working and what can be improved. We will continually look at how further improvements to Family Violence Courts can be made over time.”
