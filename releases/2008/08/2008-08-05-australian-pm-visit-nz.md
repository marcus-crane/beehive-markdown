Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd would visit Auckland on 19 August to participate in a trans-Tasman climate change conference.

“I am looking forward to welcoming Kevin Rudd to New Zealand on his first visit as Prime Minister,” Helen Clark said.

“Following his election as Prime Minister last year I travelled to Brisbane for an informal meeting in December, where discussions ranged across the vitally important trade area, security and development in the Pacific, and regional issues including APEC and the East Asia Summit, as well as efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change.”

“Since then, Ministers across a range of economic and social portfolios from both countries have also held formal and informal bilateral talks, as we build on the strong links between New Zealand and Australia.

“New Zealand and Australia are neighbours and close friends, and our contemporary relationship is underpinned by common values, shared history, and a very strong partnership across a wide range of policy areas,” Helen Clark said.

Prior to a bilateral meeting, Helen Clark and Kevin Rudd will participate in a session at the 4th Australia New Zealand Climate Change conference.

“Our meeting will give us the chance to review bilateral, regional and international issues, including the bilateral trade and economic relationship, and the Pacific Islands Forum in Niue,” Helen Clark said.

Following their meeting, Helen Clark and Mr Rudd will both be travelling to Niue to attend the Pacific Islands Forum.
