Civil Defence Minister Rick Barker officially launched the Kia Takatū resource today with a ceremony at Te Kura Māori o Porirua, a

Māori immersion school in Porirua City. Kia Takatū aims to teach students how to prepare for disasters and emergencies, and give them the skills to act in a safe manner.

More than 300 Māori immersion and bilingual schools recently received New Zealand’s first Te Reo civil defence teaching resource, Kia Takatū.

“Te Reo Māori plays a huge part in our national identity and has become an integral part of who we are and how we live our everyday lives as New Zealanders,” said Mr Barker.

The resource is designed to be used in Māori language immersion and bi-lingual schools, and can also be used at home and in the community. “Teachers began asking for a resource in Te Reo after the Ministry developed its What’s the Plan Stan teaching resource for schools.”

“It is a great way for schoolchildren to learn about the hazards that we have here in New Zealand and to learn about what to do to be better prepared, while at the same time helping develop Te Reo skills,” Mr Barker said. “The storm events of recent weeks which affected many parts of the country are just one example of the impact hazards and disasters can have on our lives.”

Kia Takatū was developed by the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management with the help of a working group of representatives from the Māori community. It is specifically targeted at children aged from eight to 12. Kia Takatū comprises a handbook for teachers, a CD-Rom, and an audio CD for children to listen to disaster stories in Te Reo Māori.

The stories on the CD provide a Māori-world view of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunami, floods and storms. Each story concludes with information on what to do before, during and after a disaster. The audio CD is suitable for younger listeners as well as the target audience of eight -12 year olds.

The resource can also be accessed from the www.whatstheplanstan.govt.nz website.

Kia Takatū is based on the What’s the Plan Stan English language resource. The English language resource comprises a handbook, CD-Rom and a dedicated website. It was sent out to all primary and intermediate schools in early 2006.

The website of the Ministry’s Get Ready Get Thru public education campaign, www.getthru.govt.nz, was translated into Te Reo last year.
