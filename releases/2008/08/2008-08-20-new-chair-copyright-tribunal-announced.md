Associate Commerce Minister Judith Tizard today announced the appointment of Professor Susy Frankel as Chair of the Copyright Tribunal for a term of one year.

“I am very pleased to announce Susy Frankel as the new Chair of the Copyright Tribunal”, Judith Tizard said.

Susy Frankel succeeds Judge David Harvey as Chair, a position he had held for over five and a half years. 

“I consider Susy Frankel to be an appropriate candidate to succeed Judge Harvey,” said Judith Tizard.  “As an intellectual property academic, she has a very strong knowledge of copyright and intellectual property issues, combined with experience as an Assistant Commissioner of Trade Marks, Patents and Designs for the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand."

Judith Tizard also thanked Judge Harvey, for his significant contribution as the previous Chair of the Copyright Tribunal.

**Background on Susy Frankel**

Susy Frankel is a Professor of Law at the Victoria University of Wellington and an Assistant Commissioner of Trade Marks, Patents and Designs for the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand.  She is also an Arbitrator and Mediator under the World Intellectual Property Organization Arbitration and Mediation Centre in Geneva, and a consultant expert to the Waitangi Tribunal regarding the WAI 262 flora, fauna and indigenous intellectual property claim.

**Background on the Copyright Tribunal**

The Tribunal is a statutory body established under the Copyright Act 1994.  The role of the Tribunal is to resolve disputes between licensing bodies, or proposed licensing bodies, and those who hold or seek licenses in respect of works of copyright.

Organisations or individuals who wish to use copyright works may apply to a licensing body, who establish licensing schemes on behalf of copyright authors, to grant a license to use such copyright works.  Where a dispute arises between these parties, usually with respect to royalties, the matter can be referred to the Copyright Tribunal.  The Tribunal can choose whether to hear the case, and has the jurisdiction to confirm or vary the scheme as it sees fit.

The Tribunal consists of a Chair and two members, who are appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Minister of Commerce (the Associate Minister of Commerce has delegated authority on intellectual property matters, including appointments).
