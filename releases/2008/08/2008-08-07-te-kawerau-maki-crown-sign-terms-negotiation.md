Te Kawerau a Maki and the Crown have signed Terms of Negotiation which set out the scope and the nature of their upcoming negotiations to settle Te Kawerau a Maki’s historic Treaty of Waitangi claims, Treaty Negotiations Minister Michael Cullen said today.

Te Kawerau a Maki claims have been partially heard and the subject of two Waitangi Tribunal reports: The Kaipara interim report in 2002 and a final report, released in 2006. Te Kawerau a Maki’s area of interest also covers the Mahurangi and Tamaki Makaurau regions.

The claims of Te Kawerau a Maki primarily relate to the Crown purchase of Te Kawerau a Maki land, the operation of the Native Land Laws and public works takings.

“The signing of the Terms of Negotiation with Te Kawerau a Maki is a tribute to the significant efforts of all those who have been involved in these claims during the past fourteen years. Today’s signing is a welcome addition to the latest steps by the government to settle all historic Treaty claims by 2020,” Dr Cullen said.

“I very much look forward to working with the Te Kawerau a Maki Tribal Iwi Authority to comprehensively resolve their historical Treaty claims. We are in a positive and dynamic phase of Crown-Maori relationships in New Zealand”, Dr Cullen said.
