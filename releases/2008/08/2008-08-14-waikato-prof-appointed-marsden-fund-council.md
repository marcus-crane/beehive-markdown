The Minister of Research, Science and Technology, Pete Hodgson, has announced the appointment of Professor Richard Bedford to the Marsden Fund Council, the body that advises on and makes decisions about investment from the Marsden Fund in leading-edge science. 

“I am delighted to welcome Professor Bedford to the Marsden Fund Council. With his proven leadership ability in academia, his research experience and his ability to mentor others, he will bring new thinking and rigour to the Council that will complement an already strong group,” said Pete Hodgson.

The Council comprises eminent researchers who convene a panel in their academic field and recommend applications for funding. Professor Bedford will be convening the social sciences panel.

Professor Bedford is:

- Director of the Population Studies Centre at the University of Waikato,
- Director of Building Research Capability in Social Sciences Network at Massey University, and
- Chair of the Social Policy Evaluation and Research Committee, a cross-agency group established by government to oversee public investment in social policy research and evaluation.
- He is also a mentor to the social sciences group, He Waka Tangata, convened by the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology, and has published over 200 papers.

Professor Bedford replaces Professor Jones who stepped down earlier this year.

The Marsden Fund was set up to support excellence in research and to broaden and deepen the research skill base in New Zealand. It funds leading-edge science that contributes to the global advancement of knowledge. It is administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand and funded by the Government through the research, science and technology portfolio.
