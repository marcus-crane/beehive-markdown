The popularity of an information roadshow to help small businesses succeed has resulted in a second series of events that kicks off in Tauranga today, said the Minister for Small Business Clayton Cosgrove.

The first roadshow ran in 12 centres during May and June this year. Mr Cosgrove said this second series is in response to requests from the small business community to take the event to regional centres that missed out on the first roadshow, because of the practical assistance it provides to people who run their own companies.

“There is a wide range of government information and services available for small businesses, but often people don’t know where to find it or what exactly they can get,” Mr Cosgrove said. “The roadshow sets out to answer those and many other questions. The first roadshow criss-crossed the country from Dunedin to Whangarei and was very well received, and I have no doubt this second series will be as worthwhile.”

Joining Mr Cosgrove on the roadshow are representatives of the key government agencies relevant for small businesses. Local business people are encouraged to ask questions, solve problems and discover what is available to them.

Also available at the events is a new publication, *Start, Manage and Grow your Business,* which was inspired by feedback from small businesses wanting to find information about the government’s services and programmes.

“The booklet contains case studies of business people who solved their business problems with help from government agencies,” Mr Cosgrove says. “The people in these case-studies want to share their stories so other business owners won’t have to say, I wish I’d known that.”

Mr Cosgrove says he’s pleased to kick the second series off in Tauranga as it is one of the fastest growing cities in New Zealand and has a large small business population. “There are 30,796 small businesses in the Bay of Plenty and they account for more than 36 percent of employment in Tauranga. With its diverse and robust growth, this city is an excellent place for the roadshow to start its second run.”

The Tauranga Chamber of Commerce is co-hosting the event at Mills Reef Winery from 5.30pm. Media are welcome to attend. The roadshow then travels to:
