Prime Minister Helen Clark announced in Niue today that the New Zealand Government has developed a draft strategy for its Pacific Regional Natural Resources and Disaster Management Programme and is seeking feedback from regional partners.

"Climate change looks set to exacerbate a range of challenges in the region, including greater cyclone intensity and compromised water resources. New Zealand is committed to providing practical support to Pacific Island countries and communities who must respond and adapt to environmental challenges," Helen Clark said.

It is proposed that New Zealand’s assistance will focus on three areas:

- improving access to water;
- helping Pacific countries be better prepared for natural disasters and for responding to them; and
- strengthening the management of interlinked environmental issues by countries and communities.

"A draft strategy for this programme has been prepared and will be released for external consultation at the end of August 2008.

"It’s important for New Zealand to plan and target its assistance to ensure that it delivers results for Pacific communities. To do this well, we need to take time to listen and understand the priorities of the region.

"New Zealand will invite our partners to advise us on the strategy, so that we can build the best possible response to environmental challenges facing the region.

"The assistance programme, which could total up to $50 million, will be delivered over the next seven years through the regional programmes of NZAID. It will complement New Zealand’s additional current annual support of $10 million to those Pacific regional organisations which contribute to sustainable natural resource management, disaster risk reduction, renewable energy development and climate change adaptation," Helen Clark said.

NZAID will spend over $2 billion in development assistance to the Pacific region over the next seven years. The [New Zealand Pacific Development Strategy](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/launch+new+zealand039s+pacific+development+strategy) launched recently sets the shape and direction for our assistance to the region.

Helen Clark is in Niue for the [39th Pacific Islands Forum](http://39pifniue2008.gov.nu/) and post- Forum dialogue.
