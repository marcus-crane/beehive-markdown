Tapuika and Ngati Rangiwewehi have signed Joint Terms of Negotiation with the Crown which set out the scope and the nature of their upcoming negotiations to settle their historic Treaty of Waitangi claims, Treaty Negotiations Minister Michael Cullen said today.

Tapuika and Ngati Rangiwewehi claims have been heard as part of the Waitangi Tribunal’s Central North Island Inquiry. The area of interest of Tapuika includes the coastal Bay of Plenty north of Rotorua. The area of interest of Ngati Rangiwewehi lies mainly to the west of Lake Rotorua.

The claims of Tapuika and Ngati Rangiwewehi primarily relate to the operation of the native land laws, Crown purchases of land, public works takings and impacts on their natural environment. Both iwi were also affected by the New Zealand Wars.

“The signing of the Terms of Negotiation with Tapuika and Ngati Rangiwewehi is a further welcome addition to the latest steps by the government to settle all historical Treaty claims by 2020,” Dr Cullen said.

“I very much look forward to working with the Tapuika Iwi Authority and Te Maru o Ngati Rangiwewehi Iwi Authority to comprehensively resolve their historical Treaty claims,”Dr Cullen said.

The Terms of Negotiation are subject to the Tapuika Iwi Authority and Te Maru o Ngati Rangiwewehi Iwi Authority achieving Crown recognised mandates to represent their people in negotiations with the Crown.
