Associate Health Minister Steve Chadwick today announced the appointment of Bevan Turnpenny to the Tairawhiti District Health Board (DHB).

"Bevan Turnpenny has strong local governance experience, good links with the Tairawhiti community, and a broad perspective on the issues which most affect the community. I am pleased to appoint him to the Board," Steve Chadwick said.

The Tairawhiti DHB board is responsible for governing over $113 million of health and disability services funding for the people of Tairawhiti, including delivering care at Gisborne Hospital, along with Māori and other community health providers. 

"Mr Turnpenny’s analytical skills and experience with projects of strategic importance to the district will be of great benefit to the board as it continues its third term."

Mr Turnpenny is a resource management and planning consultant, has been Principal and Director of Turnpenny Consultants Ltd since 1993, and is also the part-owner and manager of Repongaere Estate, a vineyard with accommodation facilities. He has local governance experience through his appointment to the East Coast/Hawkes Bay Conservation board in 2004, as well as serving as the board’s Chair from 2006 to 2008.

Mr Turnpenny joins ten other members on the DHB's board.  Board members are responsible for ensuring the good governance of the DHB.  They develop the board's strategic direction within national frameworks, and oversee the activities of the DHB's management team. 

"I look forwarding to working with Mr Turnpenny and the board to improve health outcomes for Tairawhiti residents."
