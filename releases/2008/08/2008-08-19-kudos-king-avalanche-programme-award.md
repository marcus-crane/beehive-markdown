Transport Minister Annette King today congratulated the New Zealand Transport Agency for winning a prestigious international award for its Milford Road avalanche programme.

 “The avalanche programme does a magnificent job keeping one of our major tourist routes open, often in extremely adverse conditions,” says Ms King.

 “The programme has been a major success as far as New Zealand is concerned, and I am delighted that the dedication of all the staff involved in the programme has been recognised internationally, in their 25th year of operation.”

 The International Road Federation (IRF) has just announced the programme as winner of the Maintenance Management Category of its 2008 IRF Global Road Achievement Awards.
