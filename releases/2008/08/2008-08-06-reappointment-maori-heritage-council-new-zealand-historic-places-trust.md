Hon Judith Tizard, Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage today announced the reappointment of Gerard O’Regan to the Māori Heritage Council of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust for a three year term commencing on 1 July 2008.

 

Gerard O’Regan (Ngāi Tahu) has considerable work experience in the protection and interpretation of southern heritage and cultural resource management. He has worked in the Ngāi Tahu Development Corporation as Heritage/Culture and Identity Manager for five years and with many museums, including the National Museum and the Otago Museum, over the last two decades.

“I am pleased that Mr O’Regan has agreed to serve another term on the Māori Heritage Council” said Judith Tizard. “His knowledge of the Ngāi Tahu community in Otago and Southland and the tribe’s cultural treasures is extensive.  He brings invaluable regional knowledge to the Council.”

The Māori Heritage Council was established under the Historic Places Act 1993 to ensure that the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (NZHPT) meets the needs of Māori in a culturally sensitive manner in its work protecting wahi tapu areas, historic places and historic areas of Māori interest. The Council assists iwi to develop programmes for identification and conservation of these areas.
