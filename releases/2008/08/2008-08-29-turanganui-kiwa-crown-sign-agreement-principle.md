The Crown and Tūranga Manu Whiriwhiri have signed an Agreement in Principle to settle all the outstanding historical Treaty of Waitangi claims of Tūranganui-a-Kiwa, Treaty Negotiations Minister Michael Cullen announced today.

Tūranganui-a-Kiwa is a collective of iwi whose traditional tribal areas centre on the Gisborne district. It comprises Rongowhakaata (including Ngā Uri o Te Kooti Rikirangi), Te Pou a Haokai (comprising Te Aitanga a Mahaki, Whanau a Kai, NgaAriki Kaiputahi, Te Whanau a Wi Pere and Te Whanau a Rangiwhakataetaea), and Ngai Tamanuhiri. Representatives of these iwi have negotiated collectively as Tūranga Manu Whiriwhiri since the signing of Terms of Negotiation in May 2007.

The claims of Tūranganui-a-Kiwa include the execution of Tūranga Maori which took place at Ngatapa at the hands of Crown forces. In the words of the Waitangi Tribunal’s Tūranga report, “the Ngatapa executions are a stain upon the history of this country, and it is long past time for them to be put right.”

The Agreement in Principle broadly outlines a settlement package agreed between the parties. It includes financial and commercial redress of $59 million, and cultural redress including a cultural revitalisation plan and vesting of specific sites of cultural significance.

Dr Cullen congratulated Tūranga Manu Whiriwhiri on the constructive and collaborative approach to negotiations. He said that, by working together, Tūranganui-a-Kiwa members had been able to agree on a more significant settlement package than might have been possible had each negotiated separately.

The Crown and Tūranga Manu Whiriwhiri will now work toward a detailed Deed of Settlement, which will be subject to ratification by all members of Tūranganui-a-Kiwa.
