Education Minister Chris Carter announced today that 87 new schools nationwide will receive funding to implement Information and Communication Technologies Professional Development (ICT PD) at a cost of $5.4 million.

Chris Carter made the announcement at one of the successful schools, Timaru Boys’ High School, which will lead the Timaru cluster that includes Timaru Girls’ High School and Craighead Diocesan School.

"These three schools will have an opportunity to enhance their working relationships, benefit from shared teaching arrangements and develop innovative approaches in the use of technology for learning and teaching,” said Chris Carter.

"Teachers will also have the opportunity to explore the use of ICT to connect their students with quality resources and materials that can effectively support 21st century learning.

Pleasant Point School will also lead ten schools in the Aoraki Rural Cluster resulting in a total of thirteen new South Canterbury schools involved in the programme.

A ‘cluster’ is where schools group together to deliver innovative e-Learning programmes. Today’s national announcement includes 19 new clusters, each receiving varying amounts up to $360,000 over three years.

“Since the inception of ICT PD, 1,744 New Zealand schools have been involved in the programme. As a result more schools are using technology to make learning and teaching exciting and innovative, and are lifting standards for their students.

“The Government has invested more than $408 million into ICT for schools since 1999. A further commitment to ICT funding of $65.3m over the next four years was delivered in Budget 2008.

"Developing ways our students’ can learn through the use of ICT is vital to readying young New Zealanders for the future," said Chris Carter.
