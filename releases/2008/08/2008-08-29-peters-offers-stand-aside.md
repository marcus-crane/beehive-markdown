Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that the Rt Hon Winston Peters has offered to stand aside from his portfolios while the Serious Fraud Office makes its investigations.

Helen Clark said that at Mr Peters request she would become Acting Minister in each of his portfolios.

“It is to be hoped that the [SFO](http://www.sfo.govt.nz/) will address these matters expeditiously.

“Mr Peters is offering his total co-operation to the SFO and the first meeting between his lawyers and the Office will take place tomorrow morning,” Helen Clark said.
