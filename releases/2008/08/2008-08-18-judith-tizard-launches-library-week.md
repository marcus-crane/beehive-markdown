The launch of Library Week at the National Library in Wellington tonight will kick off a nation-wide programme of activities designed to celebrate the services of local libraries. 

The Minister Responsible for the National Library Hon Judith Tizard, and the Chief Librarian of the Alexander Turnbull Library Chris Szekely, will host the event. 

The Library Week programme follows the theme: “What’s your story? Nou te Korero.” The question is designed to draw out the reasons people use libraries, highlighting the diverse ways in which patrons enjoy their local library services.

“This theme shows how libraries are so much a part of our communities,” said Judith Tizard.

“Whether it’s a school child doing an assignment, or a grandparent keeping in touch with their grandchildren through the Aotearoa People’s Network, libraries are civic and safe places where information of many kinds can be passed from one to user to another.

“I know many libraries have planned events for throughout the coming week, and I encourage communities across the country to join in, have fun, and show their support.

The winners of the Library and Information Association New Zealand Aotearoa (LIANZA) Children’s Book Awards will also be announced at the launch. 

“I am thrilled that New Zealand childrens books are getting the recognition they deserve through the LIANZA awards,” said Judith Tizard.

“Children’s literature is so important in the development of life-long learning and fosters a love of reading early on. It's great that we are today acknowledging the dedication and skill of New Zealand writers through these awards.

The Library Week programme includes events such as New Zealand’s Biggest Storytime, where the same book will be read aloud simultaneously across the country, the Living Library, where patrons borrow people instead of books, and an interactive story blog for kids.
