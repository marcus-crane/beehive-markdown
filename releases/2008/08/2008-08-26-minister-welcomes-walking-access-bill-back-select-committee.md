A Bill securing public access to New Zealand’s outdoors had its second reading in Parliament today.

Rural Affairs Minister Damien O’Connor today welcomed the report back on the Walking Access Bill by the Local Government and Environment Committee. The Bill creates a Walking Access Commission to advise on and implement walking access policies. The Bill also replaces the New Zealand Walkways Act 1990.

“Providing access to our outdoor areas is an important issue that affects many New Zealanders. The purpose of the new agency is to provide national leadership on walking access issues,” said Mr O’Connor.

Mr O’Connor pointed out that the Commission will lead and provide a central point for the coordination of walking access, and support the negotiation, establishment, maintenance and improvement of walking access. Key functions of the Commission will be the provision of accurate and useful information on the location of existing access, the establishment of a code of responsible conduct on walkways and the negotiation of new access where required. These functions are substantial and I expect the Commission to be very effective.”

“The Bill reflects the consensus reported by the Walking Access Consultation Panel, that new walking access over private land should be achieved only by negotiation and agreement. This view was supported by the Committee, which heard and considered a wide range of submissions on the Bill.

Mr O’Connor dismissed criticism made by some individuals who wanted legislation forcing landowners to provide access.

“The approach being advocated by some, to ride roughshod over private property rights, would put at risk the considerable goodwill that presently exists on the part of landowners. I am confident that greater gains can be made from negotiating new walking access.

“I welcome the changes introduced by the Local Government and Environment Select Committee in response to submitters’ concerns. In particular, the Committee recognised the importance that recreation groups attach to unformed legal roads as a means of recreational access to the countryside, and removed the possibility of walkways being made on these roads.

“Other changes made by the Committee have clarified a number of provisions, and ensured that when considering walking access, the Commission will also be able to look at the scope for access with motor vehicles, bicycles, dogs and by hunters. I look forward to the Bill being passed through its remaining stages,” said Mr O’Connor.
