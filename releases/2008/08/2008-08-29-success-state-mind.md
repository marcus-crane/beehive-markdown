"Young people often face many challenges as they move from childhood to adolescence. The important thing to remember is that those experiences help to shape your character and outlook on life," said Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

The StepUP Foundation is a non-profit organisation with a goal of educating and exciting teenagers about the possibilities for their future in business and in life, by bringing high profile, inspirational leaders and young people together.

Nanaia Mahuta shared her personal experiences with young people, along with Tawera Nikau (former NRL Rugby League player), Sally Anderson (public speaker and behavioural specialist), Brother D (founder of Dawn Raid Entertainment), Sharon Kenny (who started the Green Acres franchise), and Annette Presley (founder of the Slingshot internet provider).

The Foundation runs two-day flagship events, has an online community, and produces school and individual products such as audio CD's. Future StepUP events are planned in Palmerston North and Christchurch later this year.

The first StepUP course ran in Australia in 2002, with 227 teens and 45 coaches attending. To date over 6,000 young people have participated in one of their programmes.

"The fact that you have come to an event like StepUP indicates that you have leadership potential, and we need to find ways and provide opportunities to nurture that talent," said Nanaia Mahuta.

The support of young people is a central part of the government's agenda, including the provision of opportunities for young people to become leaders and achieve success within their own communities, and supporting them to have input into decision making.

The event highlighted tips and strategies that young people could use in their own lives to achieve success.

"Making sure that young people have opportunities to demonstrate their talents and reach their full potential is a key goal. Often the chance to hear the life experience of other role models or to have a mentor can help that goal to be achieved."
