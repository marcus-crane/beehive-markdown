Associate Health Minister Steve Chadwick today announced the appointment of the inaugural members of the Family Violence Death Review Committee.

"I'm pleased to be able to appoint the first members to [this Committee](http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/indexmh/familyviolence-deathreviewcommittee), which will contribute to the prevention of family violence and family violence deaths,” Steve Chadwick said.

“Domestic violence of any sort is unacceptable, and New Zealand levels are alarmingly high – almost half of all reported murders each year are family violence related. This is a significant problem for us as a nation, and it is one that we all must address if we are to successfully overcome it.” 

The Minister has appointed:

- Wendy Davis (Wellington) as chair of the Committee and
- Dr Patrick Kelly (Auckland),
- Dr Alison Towns (Auckland),
- Ngaroma Grant (Rotorua),
- Rob Veale (Wellington),
- Vaoga Mary Watts (Auckland),
- Brenda Hynes (Wellington) and
- George Ririnui (Hamilton) as members.

“The Committee is well-balanced, with members having extensive experience and understanding of family violence issues.”

The appointed members have expertise in mortality review systems, social science research, family violence law, child abuse and protection issues, and service provision in the social sector. 

“The Committee will look at why family violence deaths occur and identify changes to systems, policies and services that may prevent family violence and related deaths.”

It will identify trends, review circumstances surrounding deaths, conduct specific reviews of clusters/subgroups of family violence deaths and participate in local family violence death reviews.

“Establishing this committee is a significant step towards addressing family violence in New Zealand, and I am looking forward to seeing the Committee’s ideas and solutions. 

“Family violence is a problem that affects all parts of our society, and it is an issue that we need all New Zealanders to take responsibility for.”

The Committee's first meeting is scheduled to take place in October.
