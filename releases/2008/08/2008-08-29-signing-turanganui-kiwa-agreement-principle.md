Associate Minister of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Mita Ririnui is pleased with the speedy progress that has resulted in the signing of today’s Agreement in Principle between the Crown and Turanganui A Kiwa collective iwi.

“The progress made with this treaty claim, and the speed in which an AIP has been reached is testament to the commitment and drive of Turanga Manu Whiriwhiri, Turanganui A Kiwa negotiating team, and they should be commended for the vision to lead their people into the future.”

The Turanganui A Kiwa collective are made up of three iwi groupings – Ngai Tamanuhiri, Rongowhakaata and Te Pou a Haokai (consisting of Te Aitanga a Mahaaki, Nga Riki Kaiputahi and Te Whanau a Kai).

Their historical claim dates back to the 1860’s and primarily relates to the Crowns acquisition of Maori lands through the Deed of Cession, the Native Land Court and the Poverty Bay Commission, but does not exclude the execution of unarmed prisoners by Crown forces, the detention of Turanganui a Kiwa on the Chatham Islands and the removal of Te Hau ki Turanga (a Rongowhakaata wharenui now located at Te Papa o Tongarewa Museum in Wellington.)

“The Turanganui A Kiwa collective have shown great skills in negotiation and leadership, not only in their dealings with the Crown, but also in their agreement to form a collective negotiating team to encompass all iwi in their region.”

“This is a relatively new approach to treaty settlement but as today’s signing has shown collective negotiation is an effective process and Turanganui A Kiwa iwi should be congratulated for their decision to work together.”

The Agreement in Principle financial and commercial package includes quantum of $59 million and interest accrued on the quantum, the gifting of 16 properties from the Office of Treaty Settlements’ Gisborne Land bank as well as a number of other opportunities. The cultural redress package is specifically designed to assist Turanganui A Kiwa cultural relief strategy and includes re-affirmation of Rongowhakaata ownership of Te Hau ki Turanga and an undertaking to investigate into legal title to give effect to ownership among other benefits to enhance their cultural wellbeing.

The Agreement in Principle is the first step to reaching a final settlement.
