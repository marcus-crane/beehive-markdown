Ruth Dyson, Minister for Disability Issues is today launching [ADD/ADHD Awareness Week](http://www.addnz.org.nz/news/add-awareness-week.html).

Attention Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a health issue which affects approximately five percent of the population which equates to around 200,000 people.  Of this number, approximately 45,000 are aged between 5 to 18 years and of these 70% will continue to have symptoms as adults.

"For many children, young people and families, the issues around ADD/ADHD are normal family and parenting issues but manifested in a more intense form," said Ms Dyson.

"Parents respond to this by engaging support services, parenting courses, counselling and alternative treatments in addition to or instead of healthcare interventions," said Ms Dyson.

The three main characteristics of ADD are difficulties with:

- Sustaining attention, effort and persistence.
- Inability of controlling emotions, impulses to act and delaying responses.
- Lack of organisational skills.

Events and seminars will be held around the country to mark the Awareness Week.  Today, Ruth Dyson along with a range of health professionals will speak at the launch in Wellington.

Speakers include:

- Dr. Leo Buchanan Paediatrician
- Dr Graeme Lear, Paediatrician; Director of Child Services CCDHB
- Dr Helen Rodenburg GP; Island Bay Medical Centre
