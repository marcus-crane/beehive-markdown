Figures stated by the National Party today about proposed levies on new and used cars are based on a discussion document released in January, said Associate Transport Minister Judith Tizard.

"A vehicle levy scheme was only one of three proposals put forward by officials for a vehicle fuel economy standard," said Judith Tizard.

"No decisions have been made on which proposal will be pursued, let alone what rates would be set up under such a proposal.

"Consultation on these proposals was carried out with industry at the start of this year and officials are expected to report to Ministers in the near future," she said.

The proposals aim at setting an appropriate standard to improve the fuel economy of vehicles entering New Zealand and in doing so will reduce both harmful emissions and New Zealanders’ use of fuel.

The proposed vehicle fuel economy standard is one of a range of Government initiatives, including the fuel economy (star-rating) labelling scheme, that aim to deliver fuel economy and emission improvements while ensuring vehicle choice and availability is maintained for consumers. The fuel economy standard should influence importers and consumers to buy vehicles with better fuel economy.

“This standard will contribute to a reduction in CO2 emissions, and help move us closer to a sustainable transport system for all New Zealanders. Further, by purchasing more fuel efficient vehicles, and driving and maintaining them well, New Zealanders will benefit from reduced running costs and cleaner air which will save lives,” said Judith Tizard.
