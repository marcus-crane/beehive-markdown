Minister for Disability Issues Ruth Dyson, welcomes the New Zealand Disability Strategy Implementation Review.  

The report is an independent review into the progress made by central government agencies implementing the strategy from April 2001 to June 2007.

“It's very pleasing to see a huge shift in the attitude towards disability in New Zealand.  The changes made across government agencies and wider society has ensured that disability issues are considered at all levels and quarters in New Zealand," said Ms Dyson.

“One indicator of progress has been that New Zealand [won](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/nz+wins+roosevelt+international+disability+award) the Franklin Delano Roosevelt International Disability Award ([Roosevelt Award](http://www.feri.org/awards/disability.cfm)) last year.  This award recognises countries that have made noteworthy progress in improving the lives of disabled people through economic, humanitarian and social efforts.

“The review involved wide consultation including in-depth interviews with disabled people, disabled people’s membership organisations, parents of disabled children, disability support providers, central government agencies, local authorities, District Health Boards, tertiary education institutions and lead implementation agencies.

”I acknowledge New Zealand still has some way to go before disabled people can say they are living in a fully inclusive society that values and enhances their participation in the community.  New Zealand is striving to make a truly enabling society a reality for all our citizens,” said Ms Dyson.
