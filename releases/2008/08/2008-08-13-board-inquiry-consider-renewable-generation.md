Environment Minister Trevor Mallard has appointed an independent Board of Inquiry to consider the proposed National Policy Statement for Renewable Electricity Generation.

The proposed national policy statement is one of the key actions aimed at achieving the government’s target of 90 per cent renewable electricity generation by 2025.

”When notified by the board, the proposed policy statement is likely to attract a high level of public interest, so I am pleased to be able to appoint board members of such high calibre and reputation,” Trevor Mallard said.

The board comprises:

• Dr Royden Somerville, QC – local government and environmental barrister (Chair)

• Geraldine Baumann – a senior legal adviser with an extensive involvement in the electricity industry

• Wira Gardiner – company director

• Dr Ralph Chapman – Associate Professor and environmental economist.

After hearing public views via an open submission process, the board will report back to the Environment Minister with recommendations on the proposed national policy statement.

The board is expected to publicly notify the proposed national policy statement next month.

The proposed national policy statement will require changes to local government plans, and give guidance to Resource Management Act decision makers when they consider resource consent applications for renewable electricity generation projects.

It will also provide clarity to the community and those seeking resource consents to develop, upgrade, maintain and operate new and existing renewable electricity generation projects.
