The Sport and Recreation Minister Clayton Cosgrove has tonight officially launched an exciting new exhibition that uses science and technology to inspire people, young and old, to learn about sport and get more active.  

Mr Cosgrove launched the *Sports Alive* exhibition at a special function at Science Alive, the New Zealand Science and Technology Centre, in Christchurch.

Mr Cosgrove said the new interactive exhibition allows people to have a go at a wide range of sports. He said this marriage of sport and science provides both the fun, and the facts, about the importance of getting involved in physical activity.

“There are activities across 10 major sporting codes (rugby, netball, football, cricket, softball, basketball, rowing, athletics, golf and cycling) where you can take on your friends and family to see who has the best accuracy, strength, reaction time and endurance skills. The technology components within the exhibition include radar that can measure the speed and trajectory of your throws, and you can watch your own progress in 3D on a big screen as you race for cycling and rowing victory.”

Other exhibits show the technological developments that have occurred in sport over the decades, and skeleton and muscle exhibits demonstrate the importance of food and exercise in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

Mr Cosgrove said events such as the Beijing Olympics reignite peoples’ interest in sport, and remind us as a nation about the great benefits of being active and healthy. He said technology is also a great way to inspire New Zealanders to get more active.

“It is great to see such an innovative approach to getting kiwis and our young people in particular, more informed, more interested and more involved in sport and recreation,” he said. “I commend the huge community effort that has gone into creating the Sports Alive exhibition, and hope that Cantabrians and visitors enjoy what it has to offer.”   

Mr Cosgrove said that if any of the Sports Alive activities trigger children’s or adults’ interest, there is information available at the exhibition on where they can join a local club.
