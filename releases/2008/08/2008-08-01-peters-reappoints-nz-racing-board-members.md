Warren Bell, Thayne Green, and Alistair Sutherland have been reappointed to the New Zealand Racing Board’s governing body, Racing Minister Winston Peters announced today. 

“Warren, Thayne and Alistair have all been making a valuable contribution to the Board, and they bring considerable business and industry experience to the boardroom,” Mr Peters said.

"These reappointments reflect the growing confidence in the racing industry following the implementation of a number of policies aimed at lifting racing’s economic contribution.

“The Board is expected to play a leading role in developing further policies that will capitalise on the revitalisation of the industry, in order to drive racing closer to realising its full potential,” Mr Peters said.

Warren Bell was recommended for reappointment as an independent member by a statutory panel following consultation with the racing industry, while Thayne Green and Alistair Sutherland were nominated by the greyhound and thoroughbred racing code bodies respectively.

The reappointments are effective from today until 31 July 2011.

Other members of the Board are chairperson Michael Stiassny; independent members Julie Crengle and Liz Dawson; and harness racing representative Ray O'Connor.
