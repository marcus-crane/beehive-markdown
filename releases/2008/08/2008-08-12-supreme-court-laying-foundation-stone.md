Courts Minister, Rick Barker today unveiled the Foundation Stone that will be laid on the site of the new Supreme Court. 

The foundation stone is a ceremonial masonry stone inscribed with the 11th of August 2008, the names of the architect, Warren and Mahoney, the builder, Mainzeal Construction and Courts Minister Rick Barker who has unveiled the stone. It will be eventually located on the front face of the plinth, at the left hand side of the entrance to the new building on Lambton Quay.

Mr Barker said, “This is a building of great significance to New Zealand, and once constructed will be an architectural legacy. The Supreme Court building will serve our country for at least 100 years. This foundation stone is a milestone on our journey. This will be the future home of the Supreme Court, the first permanent home of our highest court of appeal in New Zealand.”

The site incorporates the old High Court building, originally opened as the Courts of Justice in 1881. The government is committed to the restoration of the old High Court building and the construction of the new contemporary style building.

The proposed design concept includes restoration of the old High Court building and construction of a new Supreme Court building. Main Construction began work onsite in October last year and construction is expected to be completed in late 2009.

In addition, the Minister advised the contents of a time capsule which was buried during the time of the original courts of justice foundation stone laying in 1879. The capsule contained a parchment with the statement contained in the Evening Post of 1 December 1879. It also contained newspaper clippings from The Evening Post and The Chronicle of the 29 November 1879, and The New Zealand Times and The New Zealander of 1 December 1879. The Evening Post described the original foundation stone laying as “the most imposing public ceremonial which probably has ever yet been witnessed in New Zealand.”

A decision is still to be made to whether the time capsule will displayed or buried with a new time capsule under the foundation stone for the new Supreme Court Building.
