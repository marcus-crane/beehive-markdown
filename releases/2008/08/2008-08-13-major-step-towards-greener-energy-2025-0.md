Providing for the country’s energy needs now and into the future while reducing New Zealand’s impact on the environment is the goal of the government’s proposed National Policy Statement for Renewable Electricity Generation announced today.

Environment Minister Trevor Mallard and Energy Minister David Parker said today’s announcement was aimed at helping achieve the Labour-led government’s goal of generating 90 per cent of the country’s electricity from renewable sources by 2025.

“How we provide for our energy needs into the future is a key climate change issue,” David Parker said.

“We must move away from the technologies of the past to the technologies of the future if we are to reduce our impact on the environment. Those technologies are likely to include wind, geothermal, solar, tidal and hydro.

“This proposed National Policy Statement will encourage the development of a diverse and resilient energy sector and create more confidence for investors in renewable electricity generation projects.”

The proposed statement will give guidance to Resource Management Act (RMA) decision makers such as councils, who must balance the national benefits of renewable electricity generation projects with local considerations.

“We’ve always said that our 90 percent renewables target does not require damming every river and putting wind turbines on every ridge line,” Trevor Mallard said.

The National Policy Statement on renewable energy announced today would require local authorities to consider the ‘reversibility’ of effects of new renewable generation.

“Obviously, the effects of damming a river are far greater than erecting wind turbines. Large dams usually mean major permanent changes to water courses, with significant impacts on wildlife and ecosystems.

“Our rivers are a resource not only for potential hydro generation but also for fishing, recreation, tourism and as a habitat for native species.”

The proposed National Policy Statement will encourage small-scale development of renewable electricity generation projects and reduce rural communities’ dependence on the national electricity grid by, for example, making it simpler to set up small renewable energy sources such as a wind turbine in the backyard.

“The government has already done major work in this area through the New Zealand Energy Strategy and the announcement of an Emissions Trading Scheme to price carbon emissions. This policy statement is another significant stage in what is one of the key challenges facing the planet,” the Ministers said.

The proposed national policy statement is now ready to go to an independent Board of Inquiry, also announced by the government today, for public consultation.
