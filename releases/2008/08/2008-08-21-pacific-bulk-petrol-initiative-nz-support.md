New Zealand will provide financial support to develop initiatives which could reduce the cost of fuel imports for Pacific Island countries, Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today at the [Pacific Islands Forum](http://39pifniue2008.gov.nu/) in Niue.

“All countries have felt the pain of adjusting to higher oil prices, and Pacific Island countries have been particularly hard hit. In some of the smaller island nations, recent high oil prices have produced what amounts to a state of emergency,” Helen Clark said.

“Under the auspices of the Pacific Plan, the Forum has discussed ways in which Pacific Island countries could reduce their dependence on imported oil.

“One option is to move to more use of renewable energy. Another is to make diesel generators more efficient. Yet even with such efforts the Pacific would continue to depend heavily on imported oil for the foreseeable future.

“In order to give momentum to a proposal to investigate the bulk petroleum procurement initiative, New Zealand will fund the first meeting of experts within the next few weeks. This meeting will consider the benefits of small island states joining together to purchase fuel. Even if such procurement reduced the costs of fuel by five to six per cent, many millions of dollars could be saved by small island states each year,” Helen Clark said.

The meeting of national experts will take place prior to the Forum Economic Ministers, who are meeting in October, so that recommendations can be available for those ministers to consider.
