Low income families and beneficiaries have access to further financial assistance from tomorrow.

The doubling of Special Needs Grants (SNGs) for food and increased assistance for the other emergency category is administered by Work and Income.

‘’The government recognises that some families are struggling with the increasing costs of everyday items so we have reduced the time in which the maximum limits apply from 52 weeks to 26,’’ said Ruth Dyson, Minister of Social Development and Employment.

‘’This effectively doubles the assistance available as people can now access twice as much support as they could previously. This means over a year people will be able to apply for up to twice the amount of the current limits Crucially, this provides more support for low-income people in hardship," said Ms Dyson.

"Additionally, to help prevent people from falling into serious hardship, the SNG for the Other Emergency category has increased from $200 to $500.

"This support is available where special circumstances exist in order to prevent people falling into serious hardship. There is still discretion to raise this limit further if somebody continues to face hardship," said Ms Dyson.
