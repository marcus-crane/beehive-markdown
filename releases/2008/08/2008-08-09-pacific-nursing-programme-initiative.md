Pacific Island Affairs Minister and Social Development and Employment Associate Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban visited the Pacific Return to Nursing Programme at Manukau Institute of Technology (MIT) today. She said it is a fantastic initiative that is successfully encouraging nurses trained and registered in the Pacific to gain New Zealand registration.

The Return to Nursing Programme is a result of a partnership recently established between Counties Manukau District Health Board (DHB) and MIT, working within the government's Upskilling Partnership Programme to improve literacy, language and numeracy skills. It focuses on assisting people who hold Pacific nursing registrations to improve their English language competency levels, enabling them to pass the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) exam and attain New Zealand nursing registration.

"Our government is a strong supporter of upskilling in the workplace, with this year's budget providing $168 million over four years for this type of training.

"When we have Pacific trained nurses under-employed as health care assistants, it makes sense to support them achieve their New Zealand registration. This will lead to nurse vacancies being filled, addressing skill gaps at Counties Manukau DHB.

"Having more Pacific nurses will bring far-reaching benefits to Counties Manukau and the health sector as a whole. A key aim of our government is to improve the health status of Pacific peoples by reducing and eliminating health inequalities affecting our communities. Growth in the number of people involved in the Pacific health workforce who are able to offer advice and support to our Pacific people is vital in achieving this.

“It’s great to have the opportunity to see initiatives like this programme on the ground, and the difference they are making for the participants, their families, our Pacific communities and New Zealand,” Laban said.
