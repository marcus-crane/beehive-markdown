Education Minister Chris Carter says the learning of German language and culture in New Zealand schools will be enhanced through a new initiative, 'Schools: Partners for the Future', which was launched at Takapuna Grammar School last Tuesday.

Speaking at Takapuna Grammar School (the first school in New Zealand to join a global network of schools linked through the German based initiative) Education Minister Chris Carter told students the programme will not only strengthen the teaching and learning of German at their school but also create international connections with other schools.

"As the first partner school in New Zealand you will play an important role in expanding this initiative and creating greater knowledge, awareness and understanding of German language and culture," Chris Carter said.

The Goethe-Institut will work in consultation with the school to develop special projects and support the learning of both students and teachers.

"This is a great example of how international programmes can be developed and integrated into New Zealand teaching and learning.

"Learning new languages is a vital skill if New Zealanders are to succeed in an increasingly global society. It opens new doors and allows us to expand our horizons and truly appreciate cultures other than our own," said Chris Carter.

Burnside High School in Christchurch will be the second New Zealand school to join the programme.

"With German being the most widely spoken first language in the European Union, young people in New Zealand will have greater opportunities to travel and work throughout Europe as well as enriching their understanding of European culture."

Late last year the government launched the revised New Zealand Curriculum which now includes learning new languages as a separate achievement area.

All schools with students in years 7-10 should be working towards offering students opportunities for learning a second or subsequent language.
