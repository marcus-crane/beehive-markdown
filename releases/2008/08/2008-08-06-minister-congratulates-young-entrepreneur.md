Youth Affairs and Associate Tourism Minister Nanaia Mahuta said young entrepreneur William Goodfellow’s effort in winning a prestigious award at the Tourism Industry Awards, sets an example for Young people.

“William has proven that you can achieve your dreams if you set goals and work hard to achieve them,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

The 32-year-old entrepreneur, who is based in the North Shore, founded marine and adventure tour company Explore New Zealand nine years ago and picked up the 2008 PATA Young Tourism Professional Award.

“He has built on a dream that began nine years ago and has managed not only to expand, but has turned his business into a successful brand,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“William is a fantastic example of a young person whose determination has now seen him reap the much deserved rewards.

“William has already won a Tourism Industry award, and it’s great to see that his contribution to the industry has been recognised amongst fellow tourism operators.

“I think his achievement sends a clear message to young people that they can be successful in what they want to do and strive for excellence in whatever they do, and I congratulate William on his perseverance and his success,” Nanaia Mahuta said.
