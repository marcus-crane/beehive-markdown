Brazilian Foreign Affairs Minister Celso Amorim will visit New Zealand on Thursday and Friday, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today. 

During his time in Auckland, Mr Amorim will meet Prime Minister Helen Clark, Mr Peters, and Trade Minister Phil Goff to discuss areas of common interest, including world trade negotiations and the environment.

“New Zealand is working to intensify our relationship with Brazil, and Minister Amorim’s visit will further strengthen the links between our two countries,” Mr Peters said.

“As an emerging economic and political superpower, Brazil is a pivotal country in South America and on the wider international stage.

“Brazil has played an important leadership role in the World Trade Organisation’s Doha negotiations. Our two countries also work closely together in international environmental negotiations, and on issues such as disarmament.

“Collaboration in the area of conservation will be strengthened during the visit through the signing of a co-operation arrangement.

“A Working Holiday Scheme will be also launched, allowing up to 300 young New Zealanders to travel and work in Brazil for a year, and a similar number of young Brazilians to come here," Mr Peters said.
