The government is committing an extra $2.83 million over the next year for the implementation of the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015, Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor announced today.

Opening the Tourism Industry Conference in Christchurch today, Mr O’Connor said the implementation plan for the Strategy identifies four top priority areas: the environment, offshore marketing, tourism research and workforce issues.

The new funding comes on top of money committed through the existing Tourism Strategy Implementation Fund which allocates $1.6 million to implement the Strategy each year.

“The [New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015](http://www.tourism.govt.nz/strategy/index.html) is a joint government-tourism sector strategy that sets out the vision, priorities, actions and targets for New Zealand tourism over the next seven years. This new plan is endorsed by Cabinet and by stakeholders in the industry, confirming the roles of public and private sector agencies in the implementation of the Strategy,” said Mr O’Connor.

The money will contribute to tourism workforce initiatives, advancing sector research, building Maori tourism capability, and environmental initiatives including the promotion of new Qualmark Green criteria to international and domestic visitors.

“Tourism's future depends upon sustainability and delivering greater value from each and every visitor to this country. The industry is one of the most significant contributors to the New Zealand economy. Its sheer size and its potential to help transform our economy into one which is more sustainable and of higher value means it is a priority sector for government attention.

“This new plan gives direction for the public and private sector in implementing the goals of the New Zealand Tourism Strategy and it highlights the government’s commitment to our vital tourism industry. I look forward to seeing its goals and priorities actioned,” said Mr O’Connor.
