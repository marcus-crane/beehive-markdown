Youth Affairs and Associate Environment Minister Nanaia Mahuta said young New Zealanders are leading the charge in environmental awareness.

The United Nationals International Youth Day is being celebrated worldwide today with the theme for this year, *Youth and Climate Change: Time for Action*.

“This is a theme which many New Zealand youth and the government have already embraced,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“We have many examples of how passionate young New Zealanders are about the environment. At last year’s Youth Parliament, climate change and the environment were recurring themes, including strong debate on the 'Household Response to Climate Change Bill 2007.

‘’New Zealand youth are environmentally aware and the Labour-led government supports many initiatives encouraging youth involvement in environmental projects.’’

“This year the New Zealand Glass Environmental Fund has supported 14 schools to conduct environmental projects and 44 teenagers from across New Zealand, who were part of the 2008 Sir Peter Blake Youth Environment Forum, have inspired young people to combat climate change in their communities.”

Nanaia Mahuta said creating awareness of the issues and the simple steps required to become more energy efficient was vital and young people can make a difference to the sustainable development of Aotearoa/New Zealand.

 “Today’s young people are tomorrow’s leaders, and supporting them now is critical because youth today play a crucial role in changing how Kiwis think and feel about the environment, and how they will look after it in future,” Nanaia Mahuta said.
