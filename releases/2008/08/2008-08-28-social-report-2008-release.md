Minister for Social Development and Employment Ruth Dyson says the findings of the 2008 Social Report show that New Zealand’s overall wellbeing is improving.

"For the first time since 1988 we’ve seen the gap between the rich and poor close. [Working for Families](http://www.workingforfamilies.govt.nz) has made a significant impact, providing invaluable assistance for families and creating a more level playing field," said Ruth Dyson.

The report, produced by the Ministry of Social Development, shows that social outcomes are advancing strongly since the mid-1990s.  There have been significant improvements across a range of areas particularly health, knowledge and skills, paid work and economic standard of living.

Key findings of the Social Report are:

- NZ still has one of the **lowest unemployment** rates in the OECD
- Income **inequality has decreased** between the top and lowest income earners
- NZ is first equal in the world as the **least corrupt nation**
- Adults are **better educated** with more people gaining a bachelor’s degree or higher
- **Maori have made large strides** in attaining tertiary education
- **Life expectancy** has increased
- We’re living healthier lives as people can expect to live independently for longer
- **Teenagers** are leaving school with higher qualifications
- There’s been an increase in our **pay packets**
- Our **workplaces are safer**
- We’re better connected to the **internet** with more homes logging on

"Overall this report shows that New Zealander’s social wellbeing has made great strides in the past few years.  This report allows for robust debate and influences good policy making.”  said Ms Dyson.
