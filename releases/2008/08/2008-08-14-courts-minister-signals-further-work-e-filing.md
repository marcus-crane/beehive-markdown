Speaking today at the inaugural New Zealand Lawtech and e-Discovery Summit in Auckland, Courts Minister Rick Barker highlighted the work being undertaken to look at expanding electronic filing.

“The plan to expand electronic filing is a step in the right direction for Courts to reduce the mountain of paper they deal with. It is an example of sustainable behaviour also allowing much greater efficiency," Mr Barker said.

“This award-winning electronic filing technology, which replaced the manual filing of infringement notices in 2007, saved a million pieces of paper in just the first year. 94 prosecuting agencies now electronically link to the Ministry of Justice, and this is just the beginning.

“E-filing of infringements was the test-bed, and it has worked well. The next step is to roll it out to the District Court, Criminal Summary jurisdiction and the Environment Court. Other jurisdictions will follow.

“More extensive use of electronic filing will reduce the current duplication of paper and electronic records, enhance access to information, improve access to justice, and allow greater flow of matters through the courts,” Mr Barker said.

“Consultation with members of the judiciary and key stakeholders is currently underway to assess how electronic filing could be used in the District Court, Criminal Summary jurisdiction and the Environment Court.

“The progression towards an expansion of electronic filing is a large and complex piece of work, and careful consideration of the implications for stakeholders is required.

"Making the public sector carbon neutral is part of the government's response to climate change and this initiative contributes toward that.”
