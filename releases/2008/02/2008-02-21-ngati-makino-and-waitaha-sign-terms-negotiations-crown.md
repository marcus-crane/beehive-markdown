The Crown and two iwi from the central North Island have agreed to enter Treaty settlement negotiations. Waitaha and Ngati Makino approached the Crown to progress their settlements using a joint negotiation model.

Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Michael Cullen, Associate Minister Mita Ririnui and Minister of Māori Affairs Parekura Horomia signed Terms of Negotiation on behalf of the Crown with representatives of Ngāti Makino and Waitaha this morning.

Ngāti Makino’s area of interest lies between Lake Rotoiti and the Bay of Plenty coast.

Waitaha’s area of interest is from Tauranga harbour in the west across to Maketu in the east.

The historical claims of the iwi primarily relate to the confiscation of land (raupatu), land sales to the Crown, and the operation of the Native Land Laws.

Joint Terms of Negotiation set out how the parties will negotiate a durable settlement of all of the historical claims of Ngāti Makino and Waitaha.

They are subject to confirmation of the negotiators’ mandates to represent Ngāti Makino and Waitaha. The Crown previously recognised the mandate of Ngāti Makino negotiators in 1997.

“We are all pleased that the process carried out with Ngāti Makino can be reactivated, recognising the effort and mana of those who were involved a decade ago,” said Dr Cullen.

The Waitangi Tribunal has previously recommended that the Crown prioritise negotiations with Ngāti Makino and Waitaha.

These negotiations will take place in parallel to discussions underway with other Central North Island iwi regarding Crown forest land.

“These negotiations are an important contribution to the government’s goal of addressing all the historical Treaty claims in the central North Island. Settling these claims will allow significant assets to be returned to iwi, and benefit hundreds of thousands of Māori.”
