Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton said today that the decision by the High Court to rule against the Government on setting an orange roughy quota was disappointing but not unexpected.

A decision on an appeal will follow once we’ve had a chance to review and discuss the lengthy judgement of the High Court, he said.

“I don’t so much consider this ‘a loss’ as much as the Court clarifying how certain parts of the law should operate.

“I’ve been told by the court that, despite the limited information about the Orange Roughy 1 area, I can’t act cautiously in setting the Total Allowable Catch to ensure the sustainability of this fish stock.

“Orange Roughy 1 covers most of the coast off the North Island and the fish are widely spread. Consequently we have much less information about Orange Roughy 1 than we do about other orange roughy stocks. Our main orange roughy stocks on the Chatham Rise are condensed around a few prominent underwater features allowing us to gather more information about them in a cost effective manner.

“However, what I can tell you, from experience, is that there are no second chances with orange roughy. It is a long-lived fish that breeds slowly. If we allow over-fishing of an orange roughy stock it can take decades to recover.”

Jim Anderton said that as far this judgement setting a precedent for other Total Allowable Catch decisions, it had the potential to impact only the stocks where we have little or no information.

“I am confident that the court recognised my ability to make key sustainability decisions even if there is considerable uncertainty.”

The stocks that may be affected are largely low value and low volume that represent less than 10 percent, by value, of stocks in the Quota Management System. These fish stocks are mainly by-catch and are not directly targeted by fishers.

“It’s important that we understand how the Court interprets a piece of law.

“The Fisheries Act is frequently reviewed and updated to reflect emerging fisheries management issues. The Court’s interpretation of the Fisheries Act of course will be considered when the Act is next updated.”

He said that, as had occurred throughout these court proceedings, the Fisheries Ministry continued to work with all ORH 1 quota owners and fishers to ensure the orderly management of orange roughy in the area.

 Background

Orange Roughy 1 (ORH1) - 2006/07 Total Allowable Commercial Catch (TACC) – 1400 tonnes

ORH1 - 2007/08 TACC was lowered to 870 tonnes in the September sustainability round.

Orange Roughy 1 (ORH1) waters from Cape Runaway on the east coast, north to Cape Reinga and south on the west coast to Wellington.

The Minister decided to reduce the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for Orange Roughy 1 from 1470 to 914 tonnes and the TACC from 1400 to 870 tonnes in a sustainability round decision in September 2007, effective 1 October 2007.

A challenge to this sustainability decision was filed in the High Court by Anton’s Trawling, Esperance Fishing, and Orneagan Developments, which collectively own 66% of ORH 1 quota.

The challenge was heard on 28 January 2008.
