Associate Health Minister Damien O’Connor today welcomed the extensive feedback received on the review of tobacco displays in New Zealand.

Over 200 submissions were received on the Ministry of Health’s *Review of Tobacco Displays in New Zealand: Consultation Document* which closed on 15 February.

The [consultation](http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/indexmh/review-tobacco-displays-nz-consultation) document sought feedback on three options for the future of tobacco displays: current requirements with enhanced education and enforcement, further restrictions on tobacco displays or a total ban on displays altogether.

Mr O’Connor said no decision has been made by the government yet on the future of tobacco displays in New Zealand.

"I am looking forward to considering advice from the Ministry of Health and the views raised in the submissions, which I understand canvas a range of issues around tobacco displays in New Zealand."

Submissions came from a range of individuals and groups, including medical groups and professionals, cancer support groups, smokefree lobby groups, tobacco companies, retailers and tobacconists.

The last changes to tobacco display requirements were made in 2003 as part of the Smoke-free Environments Amendment Act, which allows retailers to display 100 packets of tobacco or 40 cartons of tobacco products. There are also controls on how displays are set up and their proximity to children’s products.

"Since these laws were introduced there has been increasing public interest in the issue. Retail displays are now the only place where many young people are exposed to significant quantities of tobacco products and it is timely that we had some public input on tobacco display," said Mr O’Connor.

"Tobacco control is a high priority for this Labour-led government and this consultation document formed part of the ongoing tobacco control programme.

"In last year’s Budget, [the government invested $43.6 million](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F29500) in additional funding over four years for smoking cessation services.

"Other initiatives include stopping smoking in indoor workplaces, campaigns against second-hand smoke, and introducing graphic images on cigarette packets from this Thursday," said Mr O’Connor.
