Local Government Minister Nanaia Mahuta says the Waitakere Ranges Heritage Area Bill is an important step in recognising the significance of the Waitakere Ranges heritage area.

“The Waitakere Ranges heritage area is rich in ecological, historical and cultural and recreational value,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“The ranges are home to many people and a playground for others so it is a truly significant area, and therefore it’s important to provide for the long-term protection of what is essentially part of our national heritage.”

Made up of 27,720 hectares of public and private land, the Waitakere Ranges, on the western edge of Auckland, boasts part of the Manukau harbour shoreline, a regional park, water catchment dams, west coast beaches and native bush and wildlife.

Nanaia Mahuta said the close proximity of the ranges to the expanding urban centre of Auckland raised questions about the possible loss of the character of the area.

“I support the strong local view that this area needs to be protected. The fact that no less than three councils have shown leadership and acted in promoting this bill indicates that people are serious about protecting the area for future generations,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“The progress that has been made so far with this bill has taken some time. I want to commend Lynne Pillay, members of the select committee and support parties – the Greens, the Maaori Party, Taito Philip Field and Jim Anderton, for taking this Bill through to its final stages.

“The amendments advanced by Dr Pita Sharples are progressive and affirms the strong connection that both Ngati Whatua and Te Kawerau-a-Maki have with the ranges,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“The Bill is an opportunity for local councils and tangata whenua to come together and work towards the common goal of not only protecting what is a significant taonga, but also showing that real partnerships can bring about positive goodwill and a positive outcome,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
