Environment Minister Trevor Mallard will today visit Christchurch eco-fashion success story Untouched World to pay tribute to its global leadership in sustainable business.

"Today is the first chance I have had to visit and congratulate Untouched World since the company received recognition from the United Nations for its sustainable achievements late last year. I wanted to meet the people here at Untouched World and check out their operations and tips for gaining a competitive edge in international markets out of sustainable business practices," Trevor Mallard said.

In November, the company became the first apparel label in the world to be given permission by Unesco to carry the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development Education logo on its labelling. It is one of a small number of organisations accredited internationally.

"The award reflects well on Untouched World and on New Zealand as a leader in sustainability, and it's important to recognise sustainability champions such as Peri Drysdale and the achievements of her company.

"Research has shown that consumers increasingly value sustainability when they buy products and Untouched World has used its environmental integrity to gain a competitive edge in international markets. Sustainability making good business sense is fantastic for New Zealand businesses and for New Zealand’s environment."

"Working in partnership with business is a fundamental part of the Labour-led government’s commitment to creating a sustainable New Zealand. The government is committed to helping business reduce any impacts on the environment, at the same time assisting them in international markets as world leading exponents of smart and innovative responses to sustainability.

"To achieve this, the Ministry for the Environment's Sustainable Business Group has been set up to help New Zealand firms integrate sustainability into business strategies, practices, organisational cultures and management structures.

"Untouched World is an excellent role model for other kiwi companies to follow. But everyone can do their bit for the environment. The interactive website [www.sustainability.govt.nz/](http://www.sustainability.govt.nz/) gives kiwis practical information and invites them to register their steps for sustainability at 'My Next Step'," Trevor Mallard said.
