Prime Minister Helen Clark will meet Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd for the annual bilateral meeting between the New Zealand and Australian Prime Ministers, to be held on Wednesday, 27 February, in Canberra.

“New Zealand and Australia are neighbours, longstanding friends, and our relationship is underpinned by common values, shared history, and a growing economic partnership,” Helen Clark said.

“The annual meeting gives the two Prime Ministers the chance to review a range of bilateral, regional and international issues, and to provide leadership to a very strong trans-Tasman relationship.

“In this 25th year of [CER](http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Foreign-Relations/Australia/1-CER/index.php), work on the single economic market will be a key discussion topic. We will also discuss the situation in Timor-Leste, our on-going joint efforts to support the development of good governance and stability in the Pacific, and our commitments in Afghanistan.

In addition to her meeting with Mr Rudd, Helen Clark will meet with members of the Australian Cabinet. Helen Clark also met informally with newly elected Prime Minister Rudd, in December last year.
