Luamanuvao Winnie Laban advised today that following a regular mammogram late last year, she was diagnosed with treatable breast cancer.

"I started chemotherapy before Christmas and after three cycles I am feeling great and I look forward to a positive outcome.

"The treatment that I have received through the public health system at Wellington Hospital has been fantastic and I would like to thank staff for the excellent service they provide.

"I encourage Pacific Island women, and all women, to have regular mammograms as early diagnosis provides a greater chance of a good outcome.

"I am committed to my role as Minister of Pacific Island Affairs and continuing the Labour-led government's good work with Pacific communities, and plan to run in the 2008 general election to continue to serve the people of Mana as their Member of Parliament," Laban said.
