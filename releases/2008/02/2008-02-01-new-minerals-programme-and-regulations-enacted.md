The Associate Minister of Energy, Hon Harry Duynhoven, today announced that the new Minerals Programme for Minerals (Excluding Petroleum) 2008 will come into force today.

This important statutory instrument provides the Crown and industry with:

• Up-to-date and robust regulatory policy and practices that should enhance New Zealand’s reputation as an attractive exploration destination for investment.

• An allocation regime which promotes the responsible discovery and development of New Zealand’s Crown owned mineral and coal resources.

• A programme that is supported by the Crown Minerals (Minerals and Coal) Regulations 2007. These regulations also come into force today and were amended to improve the administrative and data collection requirements of the minerals permitting regime.

“I welcome the regulatory changes which are designed to provide increased certainty and minimise the regulatory impact on industry,” said Mr Duynhoven today.
