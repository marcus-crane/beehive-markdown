Twelve clubs have been granted nearly $368,800 to support racecourse safety projects, Racing Minister Winton Peters announced today.

The grants make up the first round of the Racing Safety Development Fund, which offers up to $1 million per year in dollar-for-dollar contributions to clubs for projects that enhance the safety and quality of racecourse facilities.

“There was very positive interest from a lot of clubs for the first round of funding, and the successful clubs are to be congratulated for the quality of their applications,” Mr Peters said.

“The successful projects range from the installation of a modern, safe running rail at the Whangarei Racing Club’s track at Ruakaka, to significant structural repairs for the Westport Trotting Club’s grandstand.

“The on-course health and safety for all participants is one of the big issues facing the racing industry at present, and the successful projects will make a real difference to the safety and quality of the tracks involved.

“Four other submissions were unsuccessful, but the industry working group that was set up to consider applications has invited the clubs to resubmit their applications in a way that meets the fund’s criteria.

“The second round of applications, which closes on March 31, has about $631,200 in grants available.

“Racing clubs are strongly encouraged to submit applications to address any safety issues at their venues. The industry must be proactive on racecourse safety, and hopefully the plans of the 12 successful applicants from the first round will motivate other clubs to put forward proposals,” Mr Peters said.
