Prime Minister Helen Clark today praised the New Zealand Police for [their work](http://www.police.govt.nz/operation/valour/) in ensuring the safe return of the 96 medals stolen from the Waiouru Army Museum last year.

Helen Clark said the medals were an invaluable part of New Zealand’s heritage and their theft had appalled the nation.

“The police work on this operation has been painstaking and thorough. They have now got the results hoped for New Zealand, and I commend them.

"Today is a proud day for the New Zealand Police,” Helen Clark said.
