Education Minister Chris Carter officially opened Otago’s newest school buildings in the Clutha Valley today.

The six-room Clutha Valley School, near Balclutha, has been completely rebuilt with an ecological focus. The Labour-led government has invested over $4m in this new educational facility for Otago.

Chris Carter said the new buildings incorporated the latest in school design, with automated climate control for the classrooms and environmental features to make the buildings more sustainable.

“It has features such as under-floor and solar heating, a low-emission wood pellet-fired boiler, double glazing and air-conditioning. All of this reflects the government’s commitment to providing leadership in environmental design.

“The environmentally sustainable design of this school will provide well-lit, warm and comfortable surroundings for generations of children in the Clutha region,” said Chris Carter.

A redeveloped early childhood centre will soon be built on the Clutha Valley school site to offer a wider range of quality educational facilities in Otago.

Clutha Valley students began using their new school buildings this year and the initial roll was 107.
