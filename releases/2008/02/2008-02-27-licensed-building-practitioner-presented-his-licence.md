One of the first builders to successfully register as a Licensed Building Practitioner was today presented with his own ‘licence to build’ by Building and Construction Minister Shane Jones.

Mr Jones awarded Craig Shorrock with a Site 2 licence when he visited Mr Shorrock at a home he is repairing in Remuera, Auckland.

More than 8000 application packs have been distributed since the scheme was officially launched on 1 November last year and the first licenses are now being issued to practitioners who have successfully completed an application in their chosen license class.

The release of licence cards is a major milestone for the new scheme which is intended to raise standards and increase consumer confidence in the building industry.

Mr Jones said: “It is a pleasure to present Craig with his license. He is among the first, if not the first, to receive one and I must congratulate him for being prepared to stand by his skills and experience so that he receives the recognition he deserves.

“I want to take the opportunity to encourage other practitioners of what ever level of skill or experience to complete the form of their chosen licence class and to send it in for assessment.

“This scheme will bring designers and builders in line with many other skilled trades and professions, like plumbers, architects and electricians who already have similar registration schemes.

“Consumers will know that these people have the skills, knowledge and experience to build and design right first time.”

Mr Jones added: “I would encourage anyone who is considering building work on their homes and buildings to start asking their builders; ‘Are you licensed?’

“Only in this way can we be sure of building confidence in the sector, and making sure only those who are competent work on our homes and buildings.”

About the Scheme

The Licensed Building Practitioners Scheme was introduced by the Building Act 2004. Under the Scheme, building practitioners who take responsibility for their work, or their team’s work, are required to become licensed by November 2010.

After this date, certain ‘restricted work’ will only be able to be undertaken or supervised by a licensed building practitioner.

The licensing scheme aims to improve the quality of buildings and increase consumer confidence by:

• setting national standards of competence for people carrying out core design and building work

• ensuring buildings are ‘built right the first time’ and that designers and builders are accountable for their work.

Under the Scheme at present, there are seven licence classes for carpenters, builders, site supervisors, construction managers and designers and draughtspersons.

There is a complaints mechanism to hold all licensed practitioners accountable for their work. All complaints will be investigated by an independent Building Practitioners Board.

All licensed practitioners are also listed on a register to allow consumers to identify them.

The Scheme was officially launched on 1 November 2007. The first licence cards are currently being posted to practitioners all over the country.
