**Background on the Human Rights Commission**

The Human Rights Act 1993 sets out the primary functions of the Human Rights Commission. The Commission exists to:

advocate and promote respect for, and an understanding and appreciation of, human rights in New Zealand society;

encourage the maintenance and development of harmonious relationships between individuals and among the diverse groups in New Zealand society.

The Commission achieves these through:

education about human rights

production and distribution of human rights information and resources

inquiring into and reporting on human rights matters

resolving disputes relating to discrimination

The Commission consists of a Chief Commissioner, a Race Relations Commissioner, an Equal Employment Opportunities (EEO) Commissioner and up to five other part-time Human Rights Commissioners. All Commissioners are appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice.

Karen Johansen and Jeremy Pope join Chief Commissioner Rosslyn Noonan; Race Relations Commissioner Joris de Bres; EEO Commissioner Dr Judy McGregor; and part-time Commissioners, Robyn Hunt and Joy Liddicoat.

Commissioners hold office for a term not exceeding five years and may be re-appointed.
