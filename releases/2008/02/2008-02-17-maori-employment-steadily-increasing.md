Maori employment rates and participation in the workforce have both been steadily increasing since the Labour-led government took power, said Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia today.

“The National Party has wrongly said that Maori unemployment for the December 2007 quarter was 8 per cent. In fact the figures from the Household Labour Force Survey show that Maori unemployment for the December 2007 quarter was 7.3% - a 0.1% rise on the December 2006 quarter.

“While there may be some quarterly variations, annually Maori unemployment has been trending downwards – along with all other ethnic groups in New Zealand – since 1999.”

In the year to December 1987, the Maori unemployment rate was 10.4%.

By contrast in the year to December 1999, under a National government, the Maori unemployment rate had risen to a massive 16.6%. Now, under successive Labour-led governments, the Maori unemployment rate has dropped to 7.7% for the year to December 2007.

“In 1987 there were 131,900 Maori employed with a labour force participation rate of 64.9 per cent. By 1999, under a National government, Maori labour force participation rates had dropped to 62.4 per cent. Now, under Labour-led policies and programmes, there are 206,000 Maori in jobs, with a labour force participation rate of 68.0 per cent.”

“Mrs Te Heu Heu needs to remember that under her Party’s watch Maori unemplyment sky rocketed to just under 20 per cent. It now sits at 7.2 percent. To put it into perspective, in 1992 1 in every 4 Maori were unemployed. That is a disgrace.”

"It's a shame Mrs te Heuheu either isn't up with the facts or won't acknowledge the progress Mâori are making," Mr Horomia said.
