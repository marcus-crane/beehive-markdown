New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to the Cook Islands will be Brian Donnelly, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

Mr Donnelly, a Member of Parliament for NZ First, has extensive experience in the Cook Islands. He worked there in the late 1970s; represented the islands in rugby, and has two adopted Cook Islands children. He is currently co-chairman of the Pacific Parliamentary Friendship Committee.

“New Zealand and the Cook Islands share a unique relationship founded on constitutional links, a shared cultural heritage, and strong people-to-people ties,” Mr Peters said.

“The Cooks have been self-governing in free association with New Zealand since 1965, which means cooperation between the two countries is exceptionally close.

“Maintaining the strength of these ties is of special significance to New Zealand, and we work closely with the Cook Islands to address issues in the Pacific region.

“The Cook Islands also continues to be a premier tourist destination for many New Zealanders, and the development of the Cook Islands tourism sector has contributed to its strong economy,” Mr Peters said.

Mr Donnelly takes up his appointment in late February, replacing John Bryan, who has retired.
