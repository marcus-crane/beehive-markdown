Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said today that he was encouraged to see the strong spirit of collaboration operating in the National Drought Committee.

“Morale has picked up a bit with the recent rains but there are still difficult times ahead,” Jim Anderton said. “A wide range of sector organisations are represented on the Committee, all with a part to play in helping to make sure that farmers can get through this dry weather in the best possible shape. To achieve that, it’s critical everybody works well together and clearly that is precisely what they are doing.”

Meeting for the first time today in Wellington, the Committee finalised its terms of reference and confirmed the appointment of John Squires \** as the National Drought Coordinator. It will meet again in person on Thursday 13 March.

This morning’s discussions shared information about work already underway. Dairy NZ and Meat & Wool NZ have farmer field days in place, MAF has commissioned a national feed survey, while MSD and IRD have arrangements in place to provide advice and assistance, as required.

The recent rains have seen a greening of the landscape in Canterbury and lessened a little the parched conditions in Otago, but the situation in the North Island has not changed to any significant degree.

“There are some brighter signs,” Jim Anderton said. “I understand that the Federated Farmers 0800 number was getting an even number of calls looking for stock feed and offering stock feed. Now that ratio has shifted − of the 126 calls in the last week, 80 were offering feed.

“However, even where there has been relief from the rain, there is still a lot of stress in the farming community,” Jim Anderton said. “This is particularly so in the sheep and beef sector.

“Rural Support Trusts are getting their community facilitators out and about, talking to people abut how to handle stress, the best ways to handle family and financial pressure, and giving budgeting advice.

“And farmers themselves are taking the tough decisions − reporting back shows there are very few animal welfare issues. And there is optimism,” Jim Anderton said. “I will be seeing the situation for myself over the next three weeks but I hear that most people are expecting that the Autumn rains will come. Of course that is what we would all want. However, with all the work that is now going on, if they don’t, the sector will be better-prepared.

“That is the value of this pro-active approach − Hope for the best. Plan for the worst.“

\** John Squires has a wealth of experience working with the rural community. His background includes: scientific liaison officer (with MAF), agricultural consultant (AgNZ), rural bank manger (National Bank), and senior policy analyst (MAF). He was the MAF Policy field representative for the Waiheke FMD hoax.

• Local community activities, including activities by the Rural Support Trusts.

4\. Provide ongoing monitoring and support for the rural community with regard to feed, the impact on production, human welfare issues and animal welfare issues.

5\. Promote drought contingency planning to the rural community and emphasise a proactive, anticipatory approach to drought impact management in the affected regions.
