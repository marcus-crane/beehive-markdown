Minister for Ethnic Affairs Chris Carter said today that he was pleased that American authorities had tracked down and taken into custody wanted fugitive Nai Yin Xue.

“Today’s events bring some closure for the family of Qian Xue”, Chris Carter said.

“I think New Zealanders who became aware of the plight of this little girl after she was abandoned at Melbourne Railway Station in September last year will be relieved at this latest development.”

Chris Carter said the Chinese community would be particularly affected by the arrest of Nai Yin Xue. There was a huge outpouring of support from local Chinese New Zealanders for Qian Xue and her family when the sad circumstances were first made public.

Chris Carter also said the long and now successful hunt for Qian Xue’s father was an example of the strong cooperation between New Zealand and American police.

“I think New Zealanders will be very grateful that American authorities have helped bring a chapter of this sad case to a conclusion”, Chris Carter said.
