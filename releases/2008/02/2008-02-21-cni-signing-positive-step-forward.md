“The Terms of Agreement signed today with representatives of the iwi group, known as the Central North Island Collective is an important step forward in developing a solution to how forest lands, in their region, will be used in historical Treaty settlements.” Minister of Maori Affairs, Parekura Horomia said today.

The group members are: Ngati Tuwharetoa, Ngati Whakaue, Ngai Tuhoe, Ngati Rangitihi and Ngati Whare. Their membership totals more than 75,000.

“The Central North Island forest lands and their role in settlements have been the subject of significant debate over the last decade. The signing of the Terms of Agreement is only the first step in the journey ahead, but one that should be celebrated”

There is much serious work and discussion before us. The Crown supports as wide as possible participation in the Central North Island group which is why it is so important that the agreement today includes provision for expanding the membership of the Collective in the future.

“This signing affirms the Crown’s commitment to its relationship with Central North Island Iwi. I would like to recognise their hard work and the good faith and sincerity of all those involved. I wish them well in progressing this journey further,” Mr Horomia said.
