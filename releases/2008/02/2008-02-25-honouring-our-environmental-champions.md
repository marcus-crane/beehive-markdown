Nominations are now open for the 2008 Green Ribbon Awards, which honour New Zealand’s environmental heroes, Environment Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

“The Green Ribbon Awards recognise the outstanding contributions of individuals, organisations and businesses to sustaining, protecting and enhancing New Zealand’s environment.

“Nominations are open to all individuals, businesses and community organisations which are putting their commitment and dedication to the environment into action, and helping New Zealand to become the first truly sustainable nation in the world,” said Trevor Mallard.

“This year marks the 18th year the Green Ribbon Awards have taken place, and because New Zealand is hosting World Environment Day this year, the awards ceremony will open the start of the activities to celebrate this internationally recognised event.

“As World Environment Day focuses on climate change, the 2008 nomination categories reflect the many different areas in which New Zealanders contribute to reducing the impacts of climate change.”

The categories this year have been extended from six to nine and are:

• urban sustainability

• sustainable land use

• making a difference to household sustainability

• community action for the environment – young people

• businesses making a difference

• community action for the environment – volunteers and not-for-profit organisations

• environment in the spotlight

• innovative solutions for the environment

• lifetime commitment to the environment

“The quality of past nominations has been of an extremely high calibre. They have highlighted just how many inventive, resourceful and dedicated environmentalists we have in New Zealand,” Trevor Mallard said.

Nominations for the awards close on 7 April, and winners will be announced at a ceremony on 3 June.
