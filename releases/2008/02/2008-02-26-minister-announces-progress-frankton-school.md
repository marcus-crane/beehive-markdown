Education Minister Chris Carter has announced the proposed Frankton Primary School near Queenstown now has a board of trustees and a confirmed site.

Chris Carter also said that after evaluating all the options, including land adjacent to the Recreation Centre, he had approved the site at Lake Avenue.

“The priority for the Frankton community was to get this school underway.

Chris Carter said that although the Ministry of Education was not required to seek community approval for the site, local concerns and issues would be taken into consideration including the relocation of the playcentre currently on the site.

He thanked the Queenstown Lakes District Council for its ongoing help in exploring all the options for a new primary school in the area.

Chris Carter said he was delighted at the calibre of the five members of the local community appointed to the Frankton Primary School establishment Board of Trustees.

“The new board will aim to open the school in 2010.”

Members of the Establishment Board of Trustees are: Chris Cerecke, director of Compass Project Management Ltd and member of the Frankton Community Association; Daren Rewi, an airline ramp manager and local iwi representative; Judy Sim, a dentist and company director, previous president of the Frankton Kindergarten; John Stalker, manager of two companies and a land developer, current President of the Frankton Kindergarten; Roy Thompson, director of Frenzie Group Limited.

The establishment board will contribute to the school’s design, appoint the principal and determine school policy and governance practices. Once the school opens a new board will be elected.
