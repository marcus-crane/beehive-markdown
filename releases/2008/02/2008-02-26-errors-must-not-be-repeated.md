Minister of Health David Cunliffe says the report on the employment of Dr Roman Hasil in 2005 by Whanganui District Health Board is a litany of preventable errors that the entire health sector needs to learn from.

“People’s lives have been affected. I wish to acknowledge those women and their families and offer my sincere regrets for what they have endured,” Mr Cunliffe said.

“These events are an indictment on the surgeon and on historical practices in use at that time.

“Clearly there can be no excuse of the behaviour and practices of Dr Hasil. However, I am pleased the DHB has apologised to patients and is offering to meet with those concerned.”

Mr Cunliffe said what mattered now was ensuring that Whanganui DHB delivers the best possible health services and continues its programme of improvement, so that this type of circumstance does not reoccur.”

Since Dr Hasil was employed in 2005 the Whanganui District Health Board has been involved in two reviews of clinical practices and has since that time made a number of crucial improvements.

These include more thorough checking of references for staff, more stringent monitoring of supervision requirements and work continuing on closer collaboration within the Whanganui- MidCentral region with plans to develop a regional women’s and child health service.

Last year the Ministry of Health placed an experienced governance advisor with the Whanganui District Health Board to report on progress on a number of areas.

“I am satisfied the Board has made a number of improvements. The Board’s next steps are properly a matter for it to decide. However, I am continuing to monitor its progress closely as is the Ministry of Health.”
