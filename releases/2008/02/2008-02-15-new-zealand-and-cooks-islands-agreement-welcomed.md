Pacific Island Affairs Minister and Social Development and Employment Associate Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban has welcomed the signing of a cooperation agreement between the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) and the Cook Islands Ministry of Internal Affairs and Social Services.

The arrangement will see MSD provide a range of support to its counterpart in the Cook Islands.

“The formal agreement between the two organisations will see the sharing of information, expertise and resources.

“I’m very pleased that we are able to support our Cook Island cousins and I’m confident that the arrangement will provide real benefits to both organisations,” said Laban.
