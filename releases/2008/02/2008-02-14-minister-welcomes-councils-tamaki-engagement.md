Housing Minister Maryan Street today welcomed [Auckland City Council’s agreement in principle](http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/news/releases/20080214.asp) to continue to work with the government on plans to revitalise Tamaki.

Maryan Street [announced last week](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/supporting+tamaki+realise+its+potential) the government was working on an ambitious plan to help transform the Auckland suburbs of Pt England, Panmure and Glen Innes.

"Fifty-five per cent of homes in Tamaki are state-owned and progressively due to be modernised, creating a significant opportunity to effect more widespread changes," she said.

The Auckland City Council has been working with the government and other agencies to develop plans for the project.

"After a very constructive meeting with Auckland City Councillors and the Hon John Banks this morning, I was pleased to see the ACC later approved recommendations in respect of the Tamaki development, which included affirming its ongoing involvement.

"I look forward to working closely with the ACC, its Mayor and Councillors to advance a common vision for an exciting urban renewal project in Tamaki," Maryan Street said.
