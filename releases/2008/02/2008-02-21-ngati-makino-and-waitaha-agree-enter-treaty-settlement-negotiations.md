“Ngati Makino and Waitaha today, agreed to enter Treaty settlement negotiations with the Crown.” Minister of Maori Affairs, Parekura Horomia said today.

Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Michael Cullen, Associate Minister Mita Ririnui and Minister of Māori Affairs Parekura Horomia signed Terms of Negotiation on behalf of the Crown with representatives of Ngāti Makino and Waitaha this morning.

Ngāti Makino’s area of interest lies between Lake Rotoiti and the Bay of Plenty coast. Waitaha’s area of interest is from Tauranga harbour in the west across to Maketu in the east. The historical claims of the iwi primarily relate to the confiscation of land (raupatu), land sales to the Crown, and the operation of the Native Land Laws.

The Waitangi Tribunal recommended that the Crown prioritise negotiations with Ngāti Makino and Waitaha in 2007. These negotiations will take place in parallel to discussions underway with other Central North Island iwi regarding Crown forest land.

“These negotiations are an important contribution to the government’s goal of addressing all the historical Treaty claims in the central North Island.

“This signing affirms the Crown’s commitment to its relationship with Central North Island Iwi. I would like to recognise their hard work and the good faith of all those involve,” Mr Horomia said.
