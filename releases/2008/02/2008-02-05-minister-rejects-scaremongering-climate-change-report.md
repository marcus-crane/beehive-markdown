The Climate Change Minister has rejected a report on emissions trading commissioned by the Business Round Table and Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand (PEPANZ), that was released today.

“This report is just scaremongering from groups that have an interest in seeing greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise,” David Parker said.

“The scenarios the groups have asked their consultant to model are way out of line with government thinking on climate change.

“This report assumes the government will force New Zealanders to stop driving or using electricity by raising prices to exorbitant levels. The government has no intention of doing so.”

There is no mismatch between the goal of raising New Zealanders’ standards of living and of becoming carbon neutral, the Minister said.

“The report does not take into account the new technologies already being developed here and elsewhere which will allow us to reduce emissions while growing the economy. These include electric cars, carbon capture and storage, new solar technology, second generation biofuels, nitrogen inhibitors and many more.”

The whole world is now focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and for New Zealand companies to do business successfully in this environment we must supply low carbon goods and services or be shut out of the market, David Parker said.

“There is no alternate reality where climate change doesn’t exist, as this report tries to make out.”
