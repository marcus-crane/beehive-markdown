Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Ruth Dyson today announced the recipients of the 2008 Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Fellowships.

“The Trust gives New Zealanders the opportunity to travel abroad, conduct world-class research, and gain new insight and a broader understanding,” said Ruth Dyson.

“They are then able to bring their knowledge back home to enrich their communities.”

For 2008, the Trust has awarded $70,000 in fellowships to 15 people.

Fellows are granted up to 80 per cent of travel costs and can spend anywhere between three weeks and three months overseas.

The 2008 Fellows include:

- Ms Robin Allison of Auckland, the Development Coordinator for the Earthsong Eco-Neighbourhood project, who will travel to the United States and the United Kingdom to research the environmental and social aspects of sustainable neighbourhood and town centre regeneration projects.
- Dr Philip Townshend of Nelson, the Research Director for the Problem Gambling Foundation of New Zealand, who will travel to the United Kingdom to research strategies that are effective with internet gamblers.

Since the Trust began in 1965, there have been over 600 recipients of the awards.
