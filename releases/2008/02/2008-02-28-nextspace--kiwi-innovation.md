The virtual world has a vital role to play in New Zealand’s economic growth and transformation, says Economic Development Minister Pete Hodgson.

In Auckland to open the Nextspace Innovation Centre, Pete Hodgson said innovations in digital technology provided New Zealand companies with a solution to the perennial problem of the distance between them and their customers.

“Increasingly, knowledge sits alongside, and even ahead of, the traditional factors of production, capital and labour, in terms of its contribution to the economy. However, the key to maximising that contribution is communication; finding ways to transfer knowledge and information as quickly and effectively as possible,” Pete Hodgson said.

“By bringing together some of the key players in the academic, business, and investment communities, and by creating first a virtual and now a physical hub for the 3d graphical communications technology sector, Nextspace puts New Zealand at the forefront of this exciting industry.”

A joint initiative between the Labour-led government and leading software developer Right Hemisphere, Nextspace was established to create new products and applications based on locally-developed 3d graphical communications technology software, as well as undertake a research and development programme of its own.

Nextspace CEO Roy Davies said the organisation’s principal purpose was to provide solutions for graphics coding problems, freeing their customers up to concentrate on solving high-level, graphically-oriented, business customers.

Nextspace chairman Paddy Boyle said the government’s support had been crucial to Nextspace’s successful establishment, and he believed the venture would provide a significant return to the New Zealand economy.

“As well as the immediate benefits of our involvement in what is a multi-billion dollar industry world-wide, there are the opportunities for New Zealand companies in a whole range of fields to have immediate access to the latest thinking and product development in the 3d graphical communications technology sector, and for talented young Kiwis looking to build a career in this field to do so right here, right now.”
