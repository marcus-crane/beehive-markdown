“Today's signing of the Heads of Agreement to recognise the mana of ngā hapū o Ngāti Porou in relation to the foreshore and seabed in their rohe, is welcomed as an important step forward,” says Minister of Māori Affairs, Parekura Horomia

"This Agreement recognises the special relationship and the enduring and unbroken mana of ngā hapū o Ngāti Porou in their rohe’s takutaimoana while also ensuring that public interests and access are protected."

“This is a major achievement for both this Labour-led government and Māori. The introduction of the Foreshore and Seabed Act ignited a heated debate, but has now proved to be a solution to a long standing problem which can take us forward as a country.

“We made a commitment in 2004 to protect Māori ancestral associations and mana to the foreshore and seabed. This Heads of Agreement is a major step towards honouring that commitment.”

“This agreement affirms the Crown’s commitment to its relationship with Ngāti Porou and I would like to recognise their hard work and the good faith and sincerity of all those involved. I wish them well in concluding the final stages of the negotiations,” Mr Horomia said.
