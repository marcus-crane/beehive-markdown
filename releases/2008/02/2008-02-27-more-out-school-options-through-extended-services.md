Parents and carers will have wider choices around how to balance work and family commitments with the first four Extended Services today, says Social Development and Employment Minister Ruth Dyson.

Speaking at the launch of the extension to Neighbourhood Trust’s Out of School Care and Recreation (OSCAR) programme based at Glenmoor School in Mairehau,Christchurch, Ms Dyson said it would build on existing out of school services by providing a wider range of activities and catering for older children.

“In the past, Out of School Services have catered largely for five- to nine-year-olds. Now Extended Services will provide care for a wider age range - from children and young people aged 5 to 14. The activities provided are a result of feedback from parents, carers, children and the community.

“Extended Services are a first step towards making Out of School Services less about care and recreation and more about activity based programmes that take into account the health, education and general wellbeing of children and young people,” said Ruth Dyson.

Extended Services at Glenmoor will run:

- Healthy eating activities including cooking lessons and the development and maintenance of a vegetable garden and a worm farm
- Healthy living / physical activities including a fitness circuit and sports
- Arts, craft, music, swimming and computer tuition
- Homework assistance
- Adventure activities such as kayaking and climbing for older children.

The programme is one of the four new Extended Services being rolled out as part of the Labour-led government’s Out of School Services Action Plan, with a further 8 planned for around the country over the next three years.

The Action Plan is one of the key areas of activity of “Choices for Living, Caring and Working”, a wider government strategy that provides parents and carers with choices.
