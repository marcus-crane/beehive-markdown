The Minister of Health, David Cunliffe is concerned at claims today that suggested the money from the sale of Napier Hospital would be used to fund the Hawke’s Bay District Health Board’s operating deficits.

“I expect the funds from the sale will be used for capital development and will be invested for that purpose “Mr Cunliffe said today. He was responding to claims by National Party MPs that the cash would be siphoned off into debt financing.

“To do so would be both a breach of the Act and in defiance of written advice from previous ministers “
