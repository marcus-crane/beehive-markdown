On Monday 11 February 2008 the Hon Mita Ririnui was honoured to open an exciting new programme for medical students named Pukawakawa.

“This programme will give medical students hands on experience of how health is delivered in rural communities” Mr Ririnui said.

A key feature of this innovative programme is the partnership between Northland District Health Board, the University of Auckland and local health providers.

Pukawakawa (Northland Regional-Rural Medical Programme) has been developed to provide the students with a range of experience in a rural setting. It is hoped this programme will help address future workforce issues by encouraging students to return and work in Northland.

Twenty medical students will experience 35 weeks of clinical practice in context, working in the community.

Mr Ririnui stated “This is an exciting and rewarding time, but the challenge is not to rest on our laurels, for the programme to succeed it will require the dedication of everyone involved: educators, health professionals, the community and most importantly the students.”
