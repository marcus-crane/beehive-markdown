The Education Review Office (ERO) is carrying out a special review at Hutt Valley High School, Education Minister and Minister responsible for the ERO, Chris Carter, announced today.

The decision to bring in ERO was welcomed by the HVHS Board of Trustees and would provide independent assurance on the level of safety at the school.

“Any ERO recommendations will carry a robust assurance for parents, students, staff and the Hutt Valley community that things are working well or that action needs to be taken.”

The Ministry of Education was continuing to work closely with the school and actions taken so far included:

• The board and senior staff have met with parents of victims and responded to calls to make changes

• A “Start Safe in 08” involving parents, staff, the board and police was established to assist the school when it reopened for Term 1

• The school website has regular updates for parents and the community, it has received a large number of hits

• All complaints to the school have been individually replied to, hundreds of messages of support for the school have also been received

Publicity around an alleged incident of assault was a reminder for schools to be vigilant in identifying and dealing with issues of student behaviour.

“Every school will at some time encounter inappropriate student behaviour and all schools should take the time to look at systems and procedures for identifying and managing such behaviour, ensuring the needs of students and staff are met.”

The Ministry of Education currently provided support to schools through [Supporting Positive Behaviours](http://www.tki.org.nz/r/governance/positive_behaviours) information online; guidelines for student disciplinary procedures such as stand-downs and suspensions; and through Breaking the Cycle, the interagency protocols on dealing with suspected abuse.

“It is vital school administrators have access to these documents which provide very good guidelines,” Chris Carter said.
