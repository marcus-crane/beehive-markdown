Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today he was shocked by the attempted assassination of Timor-Leste President Jose Ramos-Horta in Dili.

Gunmen shot and seriously wounded Mr Ramos-Horta in an early-morning attack on his residence. The President has reportedly undergone emergency surgery in Dilli and is now in a stable condition.

“The shooting of President Ramos-Horta is a great shock, and of grave concern to New Zealand,” Mr Peters said.

“The attack is a tragic reminder of the continuing fragile nature of security in Timor-Leste.

“It is important that this attack should not be allowed to undermine Timor-Leste’s fledgling democracy.

“There has been significant progress there over the last year, including the successful conduct of national elections. Hopefully today’s events will not lead to renewed instability and unrest in an already volatile nation,” Mr Peters said.

New Zealand currently has a light infantry company and two helicopters (approximately 180 personnel) in Timor Leste as part of the Australian-led International Security Force, as well as 25 police serving in a United Nations policing mission.
