Another step in the Labour-led Government’s efforts to reduce costs for business took effect this morning with the release of more free data, according to Statistics Minister Darren Hughes.

“Detailed business demography data that gives information about the location, type and size of businesses is now available for free on www.stats.govt.nz, and has the potential to save businesses hundreds of dollars a year.”

The Government has funded Statistics New Zealand to progressively eliminate the costs to business and community users for access to a range of statistics and products.

“Since the Making More Information Freely Available project came in, around 250 million pieces of statistical information has been made available for free. This means that all businesses can now access data to help with their forward planning and strategic direction.”

Mr Hughes said the business demography information will particularly help businesses that provide products and services, enabling them to identify potential areas for business growth, direct their sales force, and profile market segments.

“These statistics are invaluable as they highlight areas of opportunity for services such as food outlets, hire services or cafes and restaurants.”

The ability to assist small and medium-sized businesses in this way with products that previously only bigger businesses could afford reinforced the Government’s commitment to improving the business environment in New Zealand, said Mr Hughes.
