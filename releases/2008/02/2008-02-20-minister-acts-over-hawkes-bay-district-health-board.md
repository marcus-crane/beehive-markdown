The Minister of Health, David Cunliffe has moved this afternoon to serve notice that he is considering appointing a Commissioner to run the affairs of the Hawke’s Bay District Health Board.

“I have written to the Hawke’s Bay board and asked them to comment on what I see as the deteriorating situation in the governance of this board. I will make an announcement next Wednesday on what action I propose taking when I have considered their response” said David Cunliffe.

“I am concerned at both the deteriorating financial situation at the Hawke’s Bay Board and the Board’s failure to discharge its responsibilities. My first responsibility is to people of the Bay and I must preserve their access to first class public health care”

The Minister says that if the Board can not satisfy his concerns over governance he will consider appointing a Commissioner next Wednesday.
