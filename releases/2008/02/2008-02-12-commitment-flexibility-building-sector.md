Minister for Building and Construction Shane Jones is committed to increasing flexibility and tackling regulatory costs in the industry sector, as was announced by the Prime Minister today.

He said that will help ease industry frustration with the regulatory and compliance process.

“We will work to alleviate regulatory costs by addressing design and building consent processes for starter homes,” Mr Jones said.

“The time taken to achieve consenting and construction are key factors that increase cost and directly decrease productivity. This is a significant impact that is felt by local government, architects and designers, building and construction professionals and consumers.”

The Minister is looking at efficient means to reduce delays when building, particularly in developing initiatives to assist Territorial Authorities and assist those involved in building simple, straight forward homes.

“This will give Local Government authorities the ability to focus their resources where it is really needed; at high risk or complex construction and building work,” Mr Jones said.

Consequently Minister Jones is arranging a series of meetings with sector groups over the coming weeks to hear their ideas about increasing flexibility in the building sector, and to sound out potential departmental proposals.

“It is my intention to engage with the people on the ground in the building and construction sector, as well as meet with Local Government authorities so that we can streamline the consenting and compliance process,” Mr Jones said.

He will begin by meeting with the mayors of Kaipara (Mr Neil Tiller), Whangarei (Mr Stan Semenoff) and the Far North (Mr Wayne Brown) on Thursday in Dargaville.
