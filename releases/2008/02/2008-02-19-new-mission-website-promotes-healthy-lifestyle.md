Prime Minister [Helen Clark](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/new+kids+website+-+push+play+and+eat+well) and Sports and Recreation Minister Clayton Cosgrove today launched the new Mission-On youth website, an online initiative promoting healthy lifestyles using on-line technology among five to twelve year-olds. 

The website is part of the Labour-led government’s Mission-On package of initiatives launched in 2006, to encourage children and young people to lead a healthy lifestyle through improving nutrition and exercise. 

“Today’s young people are technologically savvy, and the Mission-On website is another medium to encourage young people to keep healthy, move around and make good food choices,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

The Mission-On website features a number of interactive elements, including the ability to play games and participate in activities, create a character and see what fun things other children have done.

“With a large number of New Zealand households having access to the Internet, the website is another way to get the message across. We need all New Zealanders engaged in this mission,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

“And, if children don’t already have access to a computer at home, schools and public libraries have the facilities so they won’t miss out.”

“Mission On encourages children to take what they learn on the site into the real world, and more importantly they can network via the net and share their healthy lifestyle plan with their friends,” says Nanaia Mahuta.
