Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Judith Tizard, has expressed her deep sadness at the passing of influential New Zealand film-maker and writer, Barry Barclay.

“New Zealand's film community has lost its kaumatua. Barry Barclay worked tirelessly to bring Māori stories and Māori perspectives to our screens. He broke new ground with his creative vision and pushed the boundaries of film-making,” said Judith Tizard.

Barry Barclay developed a Māori film-making aesthetic in the landmark documentary-series, Tangata Whenua, produced with the late Michael King in 1974 about Māori life and culture. He was the first Māori director of a dramatic feature, Ngati (1987), proving a film could be made in collaboration with local communities.

“Barry broke accepted rules about television formats and film production. He constantly sought new ways of expressing the reality of the way New Zealanders – especially Māori – live their lives. He leaves behind a precious legacy of original work.”

He was not afraid to tackle contentious material, such as taonga in European museums (Te Rua), the fate of the Moriori people in the Chatham Islands (Feathers of Peace), and the destruction of local fisheries (The Kaipara Affair).

His work was highly regarded in New Zealand and overseas. His achievements were recognised with the awarding of a 2004 Arts Foundation of New Zealand Laureate, and the MNZM (Member of the Order of New Zealand) in the 2007 Queen’s Birthday Honours List, for his services to the film industry.

“Barry Barclay was a passionate and highly respected advocate for New Zealand film-making. His death is a huge loss to the New Zealand film industry and Māoridom. My sincerest condolences go out to all his colleagues, friends and whanau,” said Judith Tizard.
