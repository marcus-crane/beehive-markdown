Minister responsible for the Education Review Office, Chris Carter, and Associate Education Minister Parekura Horomia were at Hoani Waititi Marae in Auckland today to launch the new framework for reviewing Te Aho Matua kura kauapapa Māori.

“This is an exciting step for immersion education. Kura will now have a resource to support their own self-review and ERO’s processes will be more transparent,” said Mr Carter at the launch today.

ERO has worked with Te Rūnanga Nui o Ngā Kura Kaupapa Māori o Aotearoa and the Ministry of Education during the past year on refining the process for reviewing kura that operate in accordance with the principles of Te Aho Matua.

“What’s special about this work is that it demonstrates the value we place on mātauranga Māori, reo Māori and tikanga Māori.” said Mr Horomia

“ERO recognises the importance of the philosophy that guides these 60 or so kura, and is conscious of the part its reviews can play in improving education for students. “

“Kura Kaupapa Maori play a vital part in ensuring the preservation of our language and our tikanga. This new framework will ensure that our Kura are evaluated in a way that is consistent with principles akin to this special structure of learning.”, said Mr Horomia

Two ERO publications set out the process for these reviews:

A Framework for Review and Evaluation in Te Aho Matua Kura Kaupapa Māori, and Evaluation Indicators for Education Reviews in Te Aho Matua Kura Kaupapa Māori.

These complete the series ERO has already published for schools, early childhood education services and kōhanga reo. As with the others, they have been printed as working booklets so that everyone involved in a kura can have their own copies. The publications will also be on ERO’s website.
