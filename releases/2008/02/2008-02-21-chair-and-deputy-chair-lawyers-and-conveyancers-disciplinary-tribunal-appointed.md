Associate Justice Minister, Rick Barker today announced the appointment of the Chair and Deputy Chair of the new Lawyers and Conveyancers Disciplinary Tribunal to be established this year.

The Chair will be Judge Dale Clarkson and the Deputy Chair will be Mr David Mackenzie.

“The Tribunal will have an important role in increasing consumer protection to clients of lawyers and conveyancing practitioners,” Mr Barker said.

“Judge Clarkson’s extensive judicial experience and David Mackenzie’s litigation and business background will be invaluable to the establishment of this important new regulatory regime.”

Practitioner and lay members will be appointed in coming months and the new regime is expected to come into force on 1 July this year.

**Judge Dale Clarkson**

Judge Clarkson retired as a District Court judge in 2006 but continues to hold an acting warrant. She graduated with a Batchelor of Laws from Auckland University in 1978 and was admitted to the Bar in 1979. She was appointed to the Bench in 1989 and served 18 years in the Family Court. At the time of her appointment she was the youngest appointee to the Bench. Judge Clarkson has completed several mediation training courses.

**David Mackenzie**

David Mackenzie was a barrister and solicitor of the High Court until retiring from legal practice at the end of 2004. His career included both litigation and business advisory experience. He holds a Bachelor of Laws from Otago University, and a Master of Laws (with Honours) from Victoria University of Wellington. He is now an independent company director, holding positions on the boards of Alliance Group (one of New Zealand’s largest meat processors and exporters), Meta NZ (a waste minimisation and recycling company), and Lyttelton Port Company.

**Lawyers and Conveyancers Disciplinary Tribunal**

The New Zealand Lawyers and Conveyancers Disciplinary Tribunal was established by the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006 as part of a new three-tier complaints and disciplinary process for lawyers and conveyancing practitioners.

The New Zealand Law Society and the New Zealand Society of Conveyancing will establish Lawyers Standards Committees and Conveyancers Standards Committees respectively, to operate as an accessible service for the investigation and resolution of complaints about practitioners, incorporated firms, and their employees. The decisions of these Committees will be able to be reviewed by an independent Legal Complaints Review Officer.

The New Zealand Lawyers and Conveyancers Disciplinary Tribunal consisting of a chairperson, deputy chairperson, practitioners and lay members, will hear and determine disciplinary charges against practitioners referred to it by the Standards Committees or the Legal Complaints Review Officer.
