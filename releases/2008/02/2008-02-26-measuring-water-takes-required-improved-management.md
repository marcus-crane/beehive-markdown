A new requirement aimed at boosting the sustainable management of New Zealand's freshwater resource through the use of measurement devices has been approved by the government, Environment Minister Trevor Mallard and Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton announced today.

"The National Environmental Standard for Measuring Water Takes was approved by Cabinet yesterday and will now be drafted into regulation," Trevor Mallard told the National Water NZ conference in Auckland today. 

"The standard is one of a staged package of actions to improve the sustainable management of New Zealand’s freshwater resources under the Sustainable Water Programme of Action. This standard will help better water management by ensuring accurate measuring of the amount of water taken from rivers, lakes and aquifers," Trevor Mallard said. 

"Measuring actual amounts of water taken is of course critical to understanding and improving the efficiency of water use. Currently, only 31 percent of the volume of water granted to consent holders is measured and we want to see the water taken from rivers, lakes or aquifers consistently measured at source," said Trevor Mallard. 

The standard will set minimum requirements for the installation and operation of water measuring and recording devices. It will require consent holders to install and operate water measuring devices and to inform regional authorities about their water use. The standard does not apply to individual households or businesses using water from reticulated supplies, nor to small abstractions for an individual’s drinking or stock-drinking needs.

Jim Anderton said water was a vital resource for agriculture, horticulture, and silviculture.

"We can’t afford to take it for granted anymore. These steps as taken by the government today will help us to manage this precious resource more carefully, so that there is enough for everyone."
