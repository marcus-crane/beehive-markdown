A successful ad campaign promoting New Zealand in Australia is getting the go ahead for a second round of ads in autumn, Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor said today.

“Since the *What’s On* campaign was launched in August 2006, the number of Australians who visited New Zealand increased by over 9 percent. As a thank you, New Zealand is paying homage to Australia’s national colours claiming to turn New Zealand “Green and Gold” to welcome them in the autumn months,” said Mr O’Connor.

The *What’s On* campaign focuses on promoting the seasons and specific events to get Australians visiting New Zealand. It gives them more reasons to visit the regions and ideas to encourage visits out of the peak summer months.

“Australia is a vital market for New Zealand’s $8.3 billion tourism industry, providing over 38 percent of total visitors last year,” said Mr O’Connor.

Between the launch of the campaign in August 2006 and November 2007, nearly 93,000 more Australians visited New Zealand compared to the same 15 month period a year earlier.

Arrivals for those visiting on holiday were up 10 per cent over the same period. That equates to an additional 311,384 holiday days and an estimated $56.7 million in extra holiday visiting spending.

“The campaign has not only been positive for New Zealand tourism, but for regional tourism too. It has had great support from the regions and it has provided a useful platform for them to promote their own identities, whether it’s as a city, a major event or a special interest, like skiing.”

Mr O’Connor said the *What’s On* campaign coincides well with the [New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015](http://www.tourism.govt.nz/strategy/index.html).

“One of the goals in the Strategy is for New Zealand’s tourism sector to be prosperous and attract ongoing investment. To do that the industry needs to increase the number of visitors in the shoulder and off peak seasons to ensure greater utilisation of assets and facilities,” he said.

This year’s autumn *What’s On* campaign launches in Australia on February 3. To view the ads go to [www.tourismnewzealand.com](http://www.tourismnewzealand.com/tourism_info/about-us/100-pure-campaign/100-pure-campaign_home.cfm)
