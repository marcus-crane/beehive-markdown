Helen Clark made the announcement at the launch of [Earth Hour Christchurch](http://www.stuff.co.nz/thepress/0a26443.html), the campaign to get as many people and businesses as possible to turn off their lights for one hour on 29 March, to promote energy efficiency and conservation.

"Sydney held the first Earth Hour last year. It was a success, and this year at least 24 cities around the world are signed up to take part.

"Christchurch is the first New Zealand city to take part in [Earth Hour](http://www.earthhour.org/) and I am pleased that the Labour-led Government is able to support the city’s efforts," Helen Clark said.

"The grant I am announcing today, which comes from the Ministry for the Environment’s Household Sustainability Programme, and will help organisers plan and promote the event to ensure as many people as possible take part in it.

"The government is taking action on climate change on many fronts from the establishment of the [Emissions Trading Scheme](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/emissions+trading+scheme+announced) to the launch of the www.sustainability.govt.nz website which gives tips on how we can all become more sustainable.

"[Meeting the challenge of climate change](http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/) needs all levels of government, business, and community working together.

"Events like Earth Hour Christchurch are important because they raise awareness of the worldwide sustainability challenge.

"It also shows how we can all make a difference, and how, when we work together, our small actions can have a big collective impact," Helen Clark said.
