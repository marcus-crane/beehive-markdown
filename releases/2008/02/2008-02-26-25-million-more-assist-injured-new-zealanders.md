ACC is increasing the amount it pays to support some injured New Zealanders, ACC Minister Maryan Street announced today.

"From this week ACC will pay an additional $25 million a year to contracted agencies providing home-based support for injured New Zealanders and their families," said Maryan Street.

ACC funds around 70 agencies nationwide to provide a range of home-based services to about 15,000 injured people a year. Those services include personal care, childcare and home help.

"The extra funds are intended primarily to allow the agencies to increase the amount they pay the actual carers. It brings ACC's rates for home support carers up to the same level as the Ministry of Health's rates," she said.

"This ensures their pay rates are fair and will also encourage a more stable workforce, which is important to the injured people they serve."

Under the change, rates for services by contracted providers will increase per hour from: $19.98 to $22.50 for home help; $21.89 to $24.21 for personal care level 1 and childcare; from $25.34 to $28.03 for personal care level 2.

"The different rates reflect different skill level requirements and complexity of care," Maryan Street said.

"With an ageing population, longer life expectancy and a widespread preference among clients for living at home rather than in residential care, demand for home support services has been growing steadily.

"The Labour-led government has consistently worked to improve wage rates for those on lower incomes. I'm pleased ACC is now in a position to increase the amount being paid to carers working for contracted agencies."
