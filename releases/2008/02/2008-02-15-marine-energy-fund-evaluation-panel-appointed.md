An international panel of renewable energy and business experts has been appointed to evaluate applications for funding to develop marine energy in New Zealand.

The government will be making grants of up to $2 million a year for the next four years, through the Marine Energy Deployment Fund. Applications for the first funding round close at the end of February.

Energy Minister David Parker today announced the panel of five international experts:

- Henry Jeffrey, University of Edinburgh (UK) – joint author of the UK Roadmap for marine renewable energy and expert member of the peer review panel for Norwegian Energy marine energy research proposals.
- Burt Hamner, Puget Sound Tidal Power (USA) – Lead contractor for the largest tidal power feasibility study in the USA.
- PB Power, program management, engineering and construction management services (NZ/UK) – this international consultancy will be represented on the panel by New Zealand-based engineer Roumen Shipokov who will draw on their team of technical experts.
- Dr Ed Hudson, E-Dec Ltd (NZ) – Previous roles have included Director of Marlborough Electric Ltd, Deputy Chairman of the Commerce Commission and a Partner at KPMG.
- Gerry Te Kapa Coates, Wise Analysis Ltd (NZ) – Chair of the New Zealand Wind Energy Assn, board member of the NZ Centre for Advanced Engineering and Representative (board member) on Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu.

“These panelists have been selected for their knowledge and experience in marine energy generation, the New Zealand electricity sector, and evaluating emerging technology projects from a business perspective,” the Minister said.

“I am pleased with the calibre of the panel and I am confident they will make a balanced assessment of all the applications for funding.

“Marine energy is a logical step in the development of new sustainable and renewable energy sources over time,” David Parker said.

“This brings us closer to getting wave and tidal energy generating devices in the water, so we can get some practical experience of what works, and what the impact is, in the New Zealand marine environment.”
