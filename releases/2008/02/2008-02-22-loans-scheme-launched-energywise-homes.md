The Labour-led Government’s interest subsidy for insulation, clean heating and other energy efficiency measures is now available through eleven partners across the country. This initiative will mean more Kiwi families will be able to enjoy the benefits of warmer, drier houses.

Minister of Energy David Parker and Government Spokesperson for Energy Efficiency and Conservation Jeanette Fitzsimons today announced the eleven organisations entering into partnerships with the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority ([EECA](http://www.eeca.govt.nz)) to provide flexible funding packages to middle-income New Zealanders.

The first partner organisations to get underway are:

- Air Lana – Terra Lana and AirCon NZ – Nelson to South Otago, Hawkes Bay
- Community Energy Action Trust – Christchurch
- Eco Insulation – central Auckland and Wellington
- Energy Options – Eastern Bay of Plenty, Tauranga, Rotorua, Tokoroa, Taupo, Poverty Bay, Hawkes Bay, Blenheim and Picton
- EnergySmart Ltd – Hawkes Bay, Manawatu/Tararua, Kapiti Horowhenua, Wellington, Nelson, Tasman, Marlborough, South Canterbury, Otago and Southland
- Environment Canterbury – Christchurch, Kaiapoi, Rangiora, Ashburton, Timaru
- Huntly Energy Efficiency Trust – South Auckland, greater Waikato, King Country
- Insinc Home Solutions Ltd – Auckland – Bombay Hills to Whangaporoa
- J H Brewster Ltd – Papakura, Pukekohe and North Waikato
- Nelson City Council – urban Nelson
- Sustainability Trust – Wellington and Porirua City

(See attached list for further information and contact details.)

The [ENERGYWISE](http://www.energywise.govt.nz)TM funding will be available as either: 

- an interest subsidy, so homeowners who meet the criteria will be able to pay off over time the cost of energy efficiency improvements, and the government will pay the interest, up to a maximum of $1,250; or
- a grant, of 10 percent of the cost of insulation and clean heat, up to a maximum of $500.

“Already nearly 40,000 low income families have seen their homes retrofitted with insulation and other energy efficiency measures as a result of Home Grants under the ENERGYWISETM programme. We’re now extending our support to middle-income New Zealanders,” David Parker said.

The financial assistance is available to homeowners earning less than $100,000 a year (1 or 2 earners) or $140,000 a year (3 or more earners), with homes built before 1 April 1978.

“We’re putting in $23 million over four years and we aim to improve the energy efficiency of about 70,000 homes,” David Parker said.

Clean and efficient heating saves energy and reduces air pollution, delivering benefits for both the homeowner and the community.

Installing insulation means less heat escapes from the home, making it easier and cheaper to keep warm.

“Insulating old, cold and damp houses reduces asthma attacks and hospital trips for flu, especially for children. The savings in health costs, days off work and days off school repays the investment twice over,” Jeanette Fitzsimons said.

“This is part of the biggest push given to energy efficiency this country has ever seen. It is another step towards implementing the core principles in the New Zealand Energy Strategy that as a country we should invest in efficiency where this is cheaper than paying for more energy,” David Parker said.

“We were really impressed with the number and the quality of the proposals received. By teaming up with partners in this way, we can help more and more Kiwi families enjoy the benefits of healthier, more energy efficient and less polluting homes,” Jeanette Fitzsimons said.

The packages provided by partners will include an energy audit, insulation (ceiling, under-floor, and hot water cylinder insulation), other energy efficiency measures (pipe lagging, low flow shower heads, efficient lights) and clean heat (heat pumps, modern wood and wood pellet burners or gas space heating). Some partners will also offer other energy efficiency measures such as solar water heating.

Each of the partners will have their own way of delivering this support and they will be providing details to their communities as they finalise the arrangements and call for applications. To find out how to apply, contact a partner organisation in your area.
