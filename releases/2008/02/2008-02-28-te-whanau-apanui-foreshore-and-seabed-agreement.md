The government today signed a Heads of Agreement on the foreshore and seabed with representatives of the hapu that make up Eastern Bay of Plenty iwi Te Whanau a Apanui.

The Heads of Agreement is the second such agreement to be signed this month.

“This agreement marks the end of the first stage of lengthy negotiations in which both sides have explored the best way to protect the longstanding and legitimate interests of the hapū of Te Whanau a Apanui in the public foreshore and seabed,” Attorney-General Michael Cullen said.

“We have both taken the time to make sure we have a sustainable framework to protect the enduring rights of both the hapū of Te Whanau a Apanui and the wider public, now and into the future.”

The Heads of Agreement contains the substantial parts of the draft Deed of Agreement for finalisation before it is taken out to the hapu of Te Whanau a Apanui for approval. The agreement recognises and protects the interests of the hapu of Te Whanau a Apanui that arise from their enduring mana in the public foreshore and seabed in their rohe.

“The agreement reflects the customary activity carried out by members of the hapū of Te Whanau a Apanui since before the passage of both the legislation and the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. Their customary behaviour is also respected by the wider community in the region. This agreement will formalise that position.”

The provisions in the agreement are substantially the same as those agreed with neighbouring iwi Ngati Porou earlier this month. Members of both iwi have owned large land holdings contiguous to the foreshore and seabed without interruption since before the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840.
