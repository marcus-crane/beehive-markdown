“Today’s signing is an important step towards ensuring that the customary activities of Te Whānau a Apanui are acknowledged and protected for now and into the future” Minister of Maori Affairs, Parekura Horomia said today.

The Government today signed a Heads of Agreement on the foreshore and seabed with representatives of the hapū that make up Eastern Bay of Plenty iwi Te Whānau a Apanui. The signing took place at Maraenui.

The agreement recognises and protects the interests of the hapū of Te Whānau a Apanui that arise from their enduring mana in the public foreshore and seabed in their rohe, while still protecting public access.

“We made a commitment in 2004 to protect Māori ancestral associations and mana to the foreshore and seabed. This Heads of Agreement is a major step towards honouring that commitment.”

“The Foreshore and Seabed Act is a vehicle Maori can use to ensure that their rights, tikanga and history regarding their continuous use of the foreshore and seabed in their rohe are legally protected. This protection will preserve iwi traditions for the many generations who are to follow”

“It is also important that public access to the Foreshore and Seabed is guaranteed. The foreshore and seabed act has enabled us to achieve this balance of rights.

“This is the second Foreshore and Seabed agreement to be signed this month. A huge achievement for both negotiating iwi and this Labour-led Government.
