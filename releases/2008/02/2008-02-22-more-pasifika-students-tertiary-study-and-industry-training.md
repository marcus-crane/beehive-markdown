There has been strong progress towards the goals of having more Pasifika students in tertiary education and industry training, according to new reports from the Ministry of Education released today.

Commenting on the key findings, Pacific Island Affairs Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said the number of Pasifika students at bachelors-level increased in 2006 by 3.2 per cent.

"We are beginning to make some real headway on the goals set in 2000 when the Labour-led government created the Pasifika Education Plan."

"One of the priority outcomes for tertiary education for 2008-2010 is more young New Zealanders achieving qualifications at level four and above by age 25. Progress towards this achievement is illustrated by a 5 per cent increase in Pasifika students under 25 years studying at qualification level 4 from 2005 to 2006," said Laban.

New Zealand's Pasifika population with a tertiary qualification has doubled over the last ten years and study at postgraduate and doctorate level also increased among Pasifika peoples in 2006.

“The challenge ahead is to bring the proportion of Pasifika peoples holding tertiary qualifications closer to that for New Zealand’s population as a whole – nearer to 40 per cent,” Laban said.

There has also been progress for Pasifika in industry. In 2006, 12 per cent of Pasifika employees participated in industry training, while overall only 8.3 per cent of employees in the labour force participated in structured workplace training.

"It is fantastic to see that our Pacific people are increasingly involved in forms of education or training, which provide pathways towards long term, sustainable and gainful employment options.
