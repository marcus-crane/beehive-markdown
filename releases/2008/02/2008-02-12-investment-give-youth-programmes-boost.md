Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta says the Labour-led Government’s new funding package will support a sustainable-non-government sector, and enable youth services continue to provide quality programmes and services for young people. 

Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced the new funding package, worth $446 million over the next four years, and will provide full funding for contracted essential services delivered by community organisations. They will also receive regular and ongoing funding increases to reflect changes in costs and demand.

“The package contains an increase of funding for non-government organisations, through Vote: Youth Development, of $1 million for the next financial year, rising to $3.7 million by 2011/2012,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

“These increases mean that these organisations can focus on the key services they provide for our young people.”

The government has also given additional funding for mentoring programmes like Project K and Turn Your Life Around (TYLA).

“Young people will get the opportunity to gain practical work skills, and gain confidence and new strengths,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

“Community based groups and programmes provide early intervention and preventative support for often at-risk young people and give young people the opportunity to contribute to their community.

“The Labour-led Government’s decision to invest in sustainable funding for community groups and services ensures that the needs of vulnerable and at-risk youth can be met long term.

“It’s important for all people to have the best start in life. The community sector plays a key role in ensuring young people are supported and developed to reach their full potential, and this government is committed to this,” says Nanaia Mahuta.
