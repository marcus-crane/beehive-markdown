The Government is to develop a Beachheads programme in China to assist New Zealand companies wanting to do business in that country, Trade Minister Phil Goff and Economic Development Minister Pete Hodgson announced today.

The international Beachheads programme is managed by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE), and provides in-country support and advice to exporters.

China is the latest region to be covered by the programme, after the UK, the Americas, the Middle East, South East Asia, India and Japan.

The ministers announced today the appointment of David Mahon as the Chairman of the China Beachheads Advisory Board.

“David has worked in China for 25 years and has in-depth knowledge of what it takes to be successful. He has developed an extensive and influential network of contacts that will be vital in assisting the growth of New Zealand companies in China. In addition, his knowledge and understanding of the New Zealand environment and the challenges of doing business from here make him a great asset,” Mr Hodgson said.

“Mr Mahon will be recruiting additional advisors to the board who have relevant experience, extensive networks and considerable intellectual capital to share with companies seeking their advice. This will have long-term benefits for New Zealand companies as they establish and expand in the market.”

Mr Goff said China presented huge challenges – but also significant opportunities – for New Zealand businesses across many sectors.

“China is New Zealand’s third largest trading partner and fifth most profitable export market. The Beachheads programme will help companies overcome challenges of doing business in a complex market that has a population of 1.28 billion people and a growing appetite for the types of goods and services New Zealand offers.

“These are exciting times for companies wanting to do business with China. As well as the Beachheads programme, being the first developed country to negotiate a comprehensive FTA with China will present New Zealand with a unique platform for profiling our businesses in that country and for strengthening existing commercial relationships,” Mr Goff said.
