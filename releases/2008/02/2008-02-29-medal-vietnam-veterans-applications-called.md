Her Majesty The Queen has approved the extension of eligibility for the ‘New Zealand General Service Medal (NZGSM) 1992 (Warlike) with clasp Vietnam’ to those veterans who are currently eligible for the Vietnam Medal, Prime Minister Helen Clark and Defence Minister Phil Goff today announced

Helen Clark said the extension of eligibility was a key part of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Government and representatives of Vietnam veterans, the RNZRSA and the Ex-Vietnam Services Association, signed in December 2006.

“The Memorandum of Understanding addressed a number of issues relating to Vietnam veterans and their families. It also reflects public acknowledgement of the service performed by all New Zealand Vietnam veterans”, Helen Clark said.

Phil Goff said more than 3000 New Zealand Vietnam veterans will be eligible for the NZGSM with clasp ‘Vietnam’. The medal and clasp will also be available to the surviving spouse or family of eligible Vietnam veterans who are deceased.

Headquarters New Zealand Defence Force is now accepting applications from Vietnam veterans for the NZGSM with clasp ‘Vietnam’. Eligible persons should complete an official application form, and forward the form to: The Medals Office, Headquarters New Zealand Defence Force, Private Bag 905, Upper Hutt.

Veterans and surviving spouse/families of deceased veterans who are registered with Veterans’ Affairs New Zealand will be mailed an application form. Copies of this form may also be downloaded from the medal application forms page of the New Zealand Defence Force medals website: http://medals.nzdf.mil.nz/info/forms.html

A written application is required in order to establish eligibility and to ensure that the correct information is engraved on individual medals. The application includes a section where the applicant can indicate if he or she wishes to have the medal presented at Tribute ‘08 in Wellington, or delivered by courier.
