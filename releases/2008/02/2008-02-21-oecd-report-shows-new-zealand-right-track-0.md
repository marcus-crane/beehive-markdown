An OECD report on youth employment shows major new initiatives announced by the Labour-led government are in line with international best practice, Education Minister Chris Carter and Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta announced today.

The report notes the New Zealand economy is providing an unprecedented number of jobs for young New Zealanders, well ahead of other OECD countries and that the transition from school to work is relatively smooth.

It also notes that on indicators of quality, the New Zealand education system is performing well and that drop-out rates for young people are below the OECD average.

The government has already moved to reduce the number of young people granted early leaving exemptions, a major recommendation contained in the report.

“Earlier this month the government announced Schools Plus, a major new initiative to keep our young people engaged in some form of education or training until the age of 18,” Chris Carter said.

Other actions the government is taking which form a major part of the report’s recommendations include:

• Increasing participation in early childhood education through the government’s 20 hours’ free ECE for 3 and 4 year olds

• Improving pathways for students into training and tertiary education

• Extending programmes that provide a bridge between secondary school and employment such as the Gateway programme and Youth Apprenticeships scheme

• Focus on reducing early school leaving exemptions – these have fallen from 4000 students per year to just under 2000 per year in 2007 with further falls expected this year

• Requiring universities, polytechnics and other tertiary institutions to report on the number of students completing courses and qualifications

Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta said New Zealand was leading the way in working at the grass roots level with local government, non government organisations and iwi to better support young people.

“The recently announced additional funding of $446 million to the non-government sector, to deliver essential services to children, young people and their families, including a number of dedicated youth programmes that work with young people, highlights the importance of providing support for our young people in order for them to get ahead and make the right life choices.

“Our youth unemployment rate and the long term unemployment rate is well below the OECD average, and there have been substantial investments in a number of areas to ensure that our young people can make the transition from school to the work environment a lot easier.

“It is heartening to know that more young New Zealanders are finding jobs more quickly than their overseas counterparts, and this is a positive indication that we are on the right track with the work that is being done to support our young people,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
