The National party tertiary education spokesman Paul Hutchison’s latest outburst on funding of tertiary education in Southland is yet another demonstration of how ill-equipped he is to be a spokesperson, Tertiary Education Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

“Last December 110 tertiary institutions had their investment plans approved by the Tertiary Education Commission. Those plans remain unchanged.

“On Friday the Southern Institute of Technology (SIT) was advised of its latest Quality Reinvestment funding. This fund was established in 2005 to help polytechnics and wananga improve their services as they transitioned to a more quality focussed environment. Since then money has been distributed in three stages to these 23 institutions. This funding is widely known by those in the tertiary education sector and is completely separate to the investment plans. The funding is no surprise to SIT and the 22 other institutions.

“To claim that this $6.5 million for SIT is somehow connected to the December decisions is just another demonstration of how little this man understands about tertiary education.

“Dr Hutchison is either operating in pure ignorance, or if he does understand something of sector funding, his motives are just empty politicking.”
