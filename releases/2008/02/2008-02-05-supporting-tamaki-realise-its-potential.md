Housing Minister Maryan Street today announced the government is working on ambitious plans to revitalise the Auckland suburbs of Tamaki.

“Tamaki, which incorporates Pt England, Glen Innes and Panmure, has been identified as an important economic centre for Auckland in the future and an area of considerable population growth.

“Fifty-five per cent of homes in Tamaki are state-owned and are progressively due to be modernised. This presents a significant opportunity for more widespread and innovative change to support the community to realise its full potential,” Maryan Street said.

“With vision, central and local government could transform the community by working with local people to redevelop state-owned land, increasing the number of affordable homes available for first home buyers and creating more attractive neighbourhoods and open spaces. There is a very high concentration of rental housing in the area and the level of home ownership is low, at 28 per cent.

“The Labour-led government wants to increase opportunities for young families to buy their first home. At the same time we want to improve transport, education and healthcare infrastructure and services, stimulating better employment and economic opportunities.”

A Tamaki Establishment Board, comprising central and local government agencies, has been established to develop proposals, Maryan Street said.

“When we have a clearer understanding of the options, extensive community consultation will take place.

“I plan to meet with Auckland City Councillors next week to discuss the project and the involvement of all players as we proceed, while the establishment board chairman Pat Snedden will hold a similar conversation with Auckland Regional Councillors.

“Tamaki has a wonderful and vibrant community spirit and there is a great opportunity to use this project to further enhance the urban environment,” Maryan Street said.

“Housing New Zealand has already conducted six highly successful community renewal projects around the country. These projects have provided us with enough of a bedrock of knowledge to begin considering an initiative on the scale of Tamaki.

“It is important to stress the final scope and detail of the project has not been determined. I want to assure the people of Tamaki that they will play a central role in the development of these ideas and any changes to the area.”
