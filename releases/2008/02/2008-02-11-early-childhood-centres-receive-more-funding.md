Thirteen new early childhood education centres (ECE) across the country have received grants with a combined worth of $485,000 to help them start providing services, Education Minister Chris Carter announced today.

Seven existing ECE services will also expand their services by five or more child places thanks to this additional funding. In the 2007/08 financial year $1.2 million is available to eligible services, and funds are allocated four times during the year. Individual services can receive up to $30,000.

“The grants, introduced last year, are part of the Labour-led government’s commitment to achieve the goals of the ten-year strategic plan for early childhood, Pathways to the Future: Ngā Huarahi Arataki and in particular, increase participation in quality early childhood education,” said Chris Carter.

Participation in Free ECE has increased by 14,286 enrolments since it began on 1 July 2007. Nearly 79,500 three and four-year-old children are now receiving up to 20 hours Free ECE at eligible teacher-led early childhood education (ECE) services.

“The increased affordability of early childhood education is obviously being reflected in the take-up figures, Chris Carter said.

As at 1 July 2007, there were almost 20,000 more enrolments across early childhood education than in 2006; and there were 199 more ECE services operating than the year before.

“Today’s announcement of Establishment Funding is designed to help community groups meet the costs of recruiting and employing qualified staff to develop the educational programme prior to becoming licensed, and the purchase of equipment and resources. The funding is available to new services and to existing services that are increasing the number of places they offer, the Minister said.
