Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor today announced government funding of $90,000 for further development of visitor facilities at Cape Reinga.

The money, which comes from the [Tourism Facilities Grants Programme](http://www.tourism.govt.nz/funding/fnd-tfgp.html) will help fund the development and installation of site interpretation at Cape Reinga.

“The Tourism Facilities Grants Programme was set up to assist with the development of world class facility facilities,” said Mr O’Connor. “It also aims to enhance our visitors’ understanding and enjoyment of New Zealand. The new facilities at Cape Reinga will do just that.

“The powerful stories that will be told through interpretation will bring the Cape to life for over 100,000 people who visit each year. It will help our visitors understand what makes Cape Reinga so special and so significant to New Zealanders. They’ll go home with a greater understanding of our rich culture and heritage.

“This project fits perfectly with the goals of the [New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015](http://www.tourism.govt.nz/strategy/index.html) which the Prime Minister and I launched at the end of last year. The Strategy emphasises the need to provide a world class visitor experience.

“A world class visitor experience is one which shares and celebrates the unique aspects of New Zealand’s culture and heritage. It also provides visitors with a rich experience of our cultural, environmental and social values through quality interpretation and opportunities to engage. The interpretation project in Cape Reinga will provide such opportunities.

“The Strategy also emphasises the importance of providing appropriate infrastructure to meet tourism demand. Visitor arrivals in Northland are forecast to increase just over 11 percent between now and 2013 which is fantastic news for both New Zealand tourism and the Northland region,” said Mr O’Connor.

The interpretation project is part two of a wider series of Cape Reinga development initiatives including sealing of the road to the site, development of new visitor amenities and the development of a visitor centre.
