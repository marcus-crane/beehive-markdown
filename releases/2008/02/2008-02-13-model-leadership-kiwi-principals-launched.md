A new professional development initiative on leadership for the country’s 2500 school principals was launched by Education Minister Chris Carter today.

The draft Kiwi Leadership for Principals (KLP) document was presented at the Principals Professional Development Centre in Wellington this morning.

“Kiwi Leadership for Principals sets the strategic direction for principals’ professional learning. It will define what qualities, knowledge and skills are required to lead our schools into the future,” Chris Carter said.

Kiwi Leadership for Principals will feed into a national Professional Leadership Strategy. This strategy will underpin the Labour-led government’s priority for building strong professional leadership in New Zealand schools.

“New Zealand principals have an exciting opportunity to impact on the way they, and their colleagues, develop as leaders,” Chris Carter said.

The Minister emphasised that feedback was important to the development of the KLP document, and the Professional Leadership Strategy.

The KLP will impact on all aspects of professional leadership for principals – Aspiring Principals Pilot, First Time Principals Programme, LeadSpace, Principals Development Planning Centre, Principals Professional Learning Communities and the work of leadership and management advisors.

“Through the Kiwi Leadership work we want to ensure that every school has the sort of professional leadership that kids deserve, Chris Carter said.

“I am confident that Kiwi Leadership for Principals will become a vital resource for principals, school boards, and ultimately in sustaining strong leadership in schools,” said Chris Carter.
