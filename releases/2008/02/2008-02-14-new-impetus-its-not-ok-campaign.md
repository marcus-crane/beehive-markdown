The campaign aimed at changing New Zealanders’ attitudes towards family violence will be focusing on stories of positive change in the next few weeks, said Social Development and Employment Minister Ruth Dyson. \[image:32111]

A new range of television ads which will begin screening in the next week include testimonies from men who have been violent towards their partners and taken steps to turn their lives around.

"The ads show the real life impact of family violence on children, partners, family and friends," Ruth Dyson said.

"Hopefully these personal stories will inspire others to take action.

"It is appropriate to have this launch today because Valentine’s Day marks intimacy and love. This campaign is aimed at improving family and intimate relationships and offers ways to get help."

The [Campaign for Action on Family Violence](http://www.areyouok.org.nz/about_the_campaign.php), a collaborative initiative by government and non-government agencies, began raising public awareness about [family violence](http://www.nzfvc.org.nz/) with community meetings and media advertising last September.

A survey late last year showed that, out of 901 randomly selected adults, 87 per cent remembered the campaign, more than half said they had discussed the campaign with someone, and one in five reported taking action.

"The message is that family violence is not OK, but it is OK to ask for help.

"It’s heartening to see that already the campaign has touched the hearts of New Zealanders, and is making people think and encouraging us all to talk about issues we may not have previously."

"We’re already seeing a shift in the way people think about domestic violence. Our government will continue to work with communities and organisations to help build a society where people can feel safe in relationships and in their homes," said Ruth Dyson.
