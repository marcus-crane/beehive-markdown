Internal Affairs Minister, Rick Barker today declared the new Lottery Significant Projects Fund open for applications for the 2008 funding round.

"The Fund is now open and all the relevant information for potential applicants is available on the Department of Internal Affairs’ website. The Lottery Significant Projects Fund will distribute $16 million in 2008, to help complete large scale community based, capital expenditure projects with a project cost of at least $1 million," Mr Barker said.

Speaking at a function in Hawke’s Bay, Mr Barker outlined the lead-up to the design of the Lottery Significant Projects Fund.

"Today's announcement started with the establishment of the Crown's Significant Community Based Projects Fund in 2005 which had $32 million available for distribution over a four-year period. Within two years, the total amount had been allocated.

“The Fund was oversubscribed and this signalled remaining unmet demand for funding for community-based projects.

“This huge demand for assistance for large scale national and regional projects could not be met by existing Lottery funds, or other community funding sources, so I suggested to my colleagues on the Lottery Grants Board that we needed to establish a new Fund," Mr Barker said.

“The Lottery Significant Projects Fund will allocate money to help complete large projects which have significance for the wider community, the region, or the nation as a whole.

“Applicants must be able to demonstrate that their project will provide significant community benefits. Projects that are likely to be priorities for funding will be those that can show that the project is well designed, planned, managed, and sustainable and that the applicant organisation has the capability to complete the project,” Mr Barker said.

Applications for the 2008 funding year close on 1 April. Successful applicants will be advised in July 2008.
