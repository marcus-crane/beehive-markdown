Foreign Minister Winston Peters will represent New Zealand at the inauguration of South Korea’s President-elect Lee Myung-bak in Seoul on Monday.

“New Zealand has enjoyed an important and friendly relationship with South Korea since our involvement in the Korean War,” Mr Peters said.

“South Korea is now one of our leading partners in north Asia, and it is essential for New Zealand to make early contact with the new administration to identify how we can continue to work closely together.

“The President-elect’s policy agenda presents significant opportunities for New Zealand to cooperate with Korea, both regionally and bilaterally, including in enhancing the role of English across the education system. Recently, our two governments sponsored an independent feasibility study into a free trade agreement.

“The incoming government of Lee Myung-bak is also committed to an active role in the world economy, including linking cooperation with North Korea directly to the dismantlement and denuclearisation of North Korea’s nuclear capability.”

Mr Peters, who ends a bilateral visit to Zambia today, also hopes to meet semi-formally with a number of other foreign ministers while in Seoul.
