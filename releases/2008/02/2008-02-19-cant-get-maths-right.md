Fisheries Minster Jim Anderton is questioning how anyone can have confidence in the National Party’s pronouncements on the economy when their maths is so poor.

“In a release he put out late yesterday (see below) , Phil Heatley said of the Ministry of Fisheries that ’the number of staff within the Ministry has grown by a whopping 272% since 2002, from 327 to 452.’

“I recommend a bit of remedial maths to Mr Heatley,” Jim Anderton said. “As well, I’m going to puncture his ‘shock, horror’ balloon with some facts. MFish Head Office staff has increased from 155 in June 2002 to 228 in June 2007 – 73 staff – an increase of 47%.

“Over the same period other front line operational staff outside of Head Office have increased from 135 to 196 – 61 staff - an increase of 45%.

“Policy and support staff outside of Head Office reduced from 36 to 28 over the same period.

“The main reason for increases in MFish Head Office staff are as follows:

• An increase in Policy staff to meet the increased workloads in Treaty of Waitangi settlements and a wider policy work programme

• An increase of Fisheries Operations staff to work on the Fisheries Planning and Treaty of Waitangi deed of settlement obligations processes with fisheries stakeholders. This entails establishing fisheries plans for 30 key amalgamations of fish stocks

• An increase in Science staff. More than 50 new fish stocks have entered the Quota Management System since 2002 and there is an increased emphasis on managing the environmental effects of fishing and monitoring marine biodiversity

“All of which shows that, far from having ‘an obsession with fattening its head office bureaucracy’, MFish is focused on having sufficient and highly skilled staff to work with the sector in its entirety − customary, commercial and recreational − so that New Zealand can have sustainable industry far into the future,” Jim Anderton said.
