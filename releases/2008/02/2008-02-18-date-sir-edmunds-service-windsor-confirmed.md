Prime Minister Helen Clark today said Her Majesty the Queen had announced the date of the Thanksgiving Service for Sir Edmund Hillary, to be held at Windsor Castle in England in April.

“A statement from Buckingham Palace has confirmed the Service of Thanksgiving for the life of Sir Edmund will be held at 11am on Wednesday 2nd April, at St George’s Chapel,” Helen Clark said.

“The service will include the “laying up” of Sir Edmund’s Knight of the Garter banner, when it is returned to his family. Other aspects of the Service will be developed in consultation with the Hillary family. The Hillary family will also attend a private audience with Her Majesty following the Service.

“There will be an opportunity for members of the public to attend the Service. A small number of seats will be available inside the Chapel, and the public can also apply for places in the Lower Ward, or Court, of Windsor Castle to hear the Service broadcast outdoors.

"Officials from the New Zealand High Commission in London will assist Buckingham Palace officials with a ballot system for tickets. It is estimated several hundred tickets may be made available. These details will be confirmed over the next few weeks.

“The Service of Thanksgiving at Windsor Castle will be a special and rare event. These exceptional arrangements reflect the personal and historical associations of the Queen with Sir Edmund since the beginning of her reign," Helen Clark said.
