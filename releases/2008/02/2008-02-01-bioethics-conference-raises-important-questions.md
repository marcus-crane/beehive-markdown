Research, Science and Technology Minister Pete Hodgson was one of many New Zealand and international presenters who spoke today at the New Zealand Bioethics Conference in Dunedin.

“Recent advances in science and technology mean that ethics are at the forefront of discussion in New Zealand and around the world.

“We face an increasing number of choices and ethical questions in our everyday lives and taking time to address ethical concerns is important. When parliament debated the Human Tissues Act last year, MPs heard a range of perspectives on organ donation and the use of human tissues in research.

“Another topical debate sprung up recently in Europe at a biofuels conference where the environmental sustainability of biofuels was called into question.

“Although New Zealand biofuels are from sustainable sources, the ethical balance may not be so certain in other jurisdictions.

“It is our job to ensure that the public are well equipped to understand the potential risks and benefits that advances in science and technology may provide in the future. Events like today’s Bioethics Conference are central to making sure that we can make the best choices for ourselves and our families.”

The New Zealand Bioethics Conference runs from today until the 3rd of February at Otago University.
