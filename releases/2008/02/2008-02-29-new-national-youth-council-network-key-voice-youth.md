“The new National Youth Council Network will provide a key voice for youth, and highlights again the Labour-led Government’s commitment to young people,” said Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

Nanaia Mahuta today launched the government’s new initiative, the National Youth Council Network, at a youth forum in Rotorua attended by representatives from eight Youth Councils in the Bay of Plenty region.

“The forum is a great opportunity for youth council members to share the issues they’re involved in and areas they are interested in, and it’s a chance to reinforce the value of youth councils in providing a youth voice to Local Government,” said Nanaia Mahuta, who is also Minister of Local Government.

“Youth Councils are an important part of Local Government as young people are very much part of our communities and it is important their voices and interests are represented.

“The National Youth Council Network is a fantastic achievement for young people because it is something they have wanted and lobbied for so they can connect with other young people from around the country.”

Nanaia Mahuta said the Labour-led government is firmly committed to ensuring young people are encouraged to reach their potential and to be heard.

“We have set up a wide range of initiatives so youth have the opportunity to be heard both on policies affecting them, through Youth Parliament, and in their own personal lives, with the expanded PROVOKE network which challenges young people to get them thinking about what they want for their future,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“The government, through the Ministry of Youth Development is also providing funding for the running of Youth Week, which helps to celebrate our young people and their achievements.

“The National Youth Network is a further opportunity for young people to enhance their networks, with the support of government agencies.

“Young people are the leaders, workers and parents of tomorrow and we need to ensure they have an opportunity to be heard,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
