Police Minister Annette King has welcomed the Independent Police Conduct Authority report into police actions in relation to convicted murderer Graeme Burton.

“The events last January, in which Karl Kuchenbecker was murdered and four other innocent people were injured, is a tragedy that will always live with those families,” she said.

“It is absolutely vital that agencies learn what they need to do to try to prevent such tragedies occurring again.”

“I have been assured by Police Commissioner Howard Broad that New Zealand Police are already taking remedial action to change systems, and that the service will continue to monitor all the recommendations in the report.”

Ms King said she was pleased that the IPCA had recognised the “considerable courage” of police officers in confronting Burton on 6 January. “I am proud of their actions, and I am sure all their colleagues and the public are as well.”
