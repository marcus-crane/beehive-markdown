Defence Minister, Phil Goff, last night met Timor Leste President Jose Ramos Horta, who is recovering in Darwin from wounds received in the February 11 assassination attempt.

“The wounds received by President Horta were severe and while he was thinking clearly and in good spirits, it will obviously take some time for him to recuperate fully,” Phil Goff said.

“We discussed the reasons why the attack may have occurred and the need for a thorough investigation to ensure all who may have been involved are held to account.

“We also talked about the current security situation in Timor Leste and my recent visit there, as well as wider international issues.

“The President hopes to return home to Timor Leste within the next month or so but his resumption of a full work load will depend on the extent of his recovery at that point.

“I expressed to Jose on behalf of the Prime Minister and all New Zealanders our concern about what had happened to him and our best wishes for a full recovery,” Phil Goff said.
