A new set of industry standards for independent chip shop operators to improve the nutritional value of hot chips has been welcomed by Associate Health Minister Damien O’Connor.

The Chip Group, which includes food industry representatives, the National Heart Foundation, Horticulture New Zealand and the Potato Growers of New Zealand, has an overall goal to reduce the fat content of chips by 20 percent.

"The Ministry of Health has funded the Chip Group over a three year period to improve one of New Zealand's most popular treat foods,” said Mr O’Connor.

“These new standards will help shops serve up tastier and healthier chips to their customers, using recommendations by the National Heart Foundation on which oils to use.

"I recently met with the Food Industry Group (FIG) where they presented their annual report and I can see the huge strides food companies were making to create a healthier environment. This is one more step on the way to achieving this goal. Changing food environments is key to reducing the rising levels of overweight and obesity in this country.

"The Chip Group's industry standards are a world first and I want to acknowledge the important work they're undertaking to contribute to the overall goals of the Government's Healthy Eating - Healthy Action (HEHA) Strategy which aims to improve nutrition, increase physical activity and reduce obesity", says Damien O'Connor.

"Once these industry standards are implemented throughout the country, they're going to play a huge part in improving food environments. We know that hot chips are a kiwi favourite, but if we can reduce the fat content, we'll be making a big difference,” said Mr O’Connor.
