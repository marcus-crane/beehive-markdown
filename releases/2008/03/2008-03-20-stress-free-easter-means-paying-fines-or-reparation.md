Courts Minister Rick Barker is urging people to sort out their unpaid fines or reparation before they travel during the Easter holiday. He has also welcomed news that the Pay or Stay initiative has now generated over $5.6 million since it began in September 2006.

"The *Pay or Stay* initiative enables the Ministry of Justice to stop people with unpaid fines or reparation if they are travelling overseas or returning to New Zealand. This is part of Labour-led Government's drive to make it tougher for those who don’t pay their fines, and easier for those who do,” said Mr Barker.

“The sensible move is to stay out of trouble by talking to the Ministry of Justice about any outstanding fines or reparation.

“Just making the move of picking up the phone and talking could lead to a stress free holiday. People should think ahead. No one wants to get to an international airport and find they can’t leave the country because unpaid fines or reparation haven’t been sorted out.”

Mr Barker said in the last five months $2.3 million has been collected or put under payment arrangements through the *Pay or Stay* initiative.

“I’m pleased to see that people are paying their fines before travelling overseas. The success of this initiative in collecting unpaid fines and reparation for the victims of crime is evident. Pay or Stay has now generated over $5.6 million in total since it began in September 2006."

Mr Barker said people should sort out their unpaid fines or reparation by calling 0800 4 FINES.
