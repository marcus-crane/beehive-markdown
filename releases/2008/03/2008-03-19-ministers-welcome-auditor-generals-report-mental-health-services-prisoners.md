Corrections Minister Phil Goff and Health Minister David Cunliffe today welcomed a report by the Office of the Auditor General on the provision of mental health services for prisoners.

 

“The Government welcomes the report and is in the process of addressing the recommendations,” the ministers said.

 

The report, tabled in Parliament today, acknowledges that delivery of mental health care to prisoners is a ‘complex and challenging area’.

 

It states that while improvements could be made in service delivery by the Corrections Department (which is responsible for primary mental health care delivery), the Health Ministry and DHBs (specialist and forensic health care) – ‘the needs of prisoners with severe mental health issues are generally well catered for’.

 

“We recognise there is pressure on the delivery of mental health care to prisoners, particularly as prison numbers have increased,” the ministers said.  

 

“Prisoners have higher than usual mental health needs and the delivery of care can be difficult in the prison environment. This has been a challenging area over a long period of time.

 

“We are working to address the issues. As the report states: ‘\[government] agencies … have committed resources to identify gaps in services, address these gaps, and improve services overall’.

 

“More can be done, and where resources allow we will continue to work towards improving the level of mental health services in prisons with the goal that such services to inmates be equivalent to those available to the public in the wider community.”

 

Improvements underway or being considered include:

 

- New forensic mental health beds (in secure settings) funded, bringing the total to around 250 beds.
- Doubling the number of specialist drug and alcohol treatment units in prisons – to 500 places per year. There are clear links between drug and alcohol abuse and mental health. Addiction, as well as being severely debilitating for individuals, is also a leading driver of crime.
- A new programme to provide treatment for drug or alcohol-affected offenders in the community and those about to be released from prison, called First Steps.
- A recent trial of a mental health screening tool which will be used to build on existing tools that assess prisoners’ mental health and collect information. The improved tool will be used in prisons in the future.
- Extra training for Corrections officers to help them manage prisoners with mental health issues.
