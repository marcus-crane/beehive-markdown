The Labour led government is to invest $72.1 million over ten years in a major restoration programme for the most seriously degraded Te Arawa lakes – in a move welcomed by Associate Health Minister and local MP Mita Ririnui.

Prime Minister Helen Clark and Environment Minister Trevor Mallard announced the funding at Otaramarae near Rotorua today.

Hon Ririnui believes the significant funding will not only enhance the relationship and partnership between the Crown and local iwi, but also improve the valuable life source that the lakes are for tangata whenua of Te Arawa.

“The people of Te Arawa have a very special relationship with the Te Arawa lakes. They view the lakes as a taonga that has been handed down to them by their ancestors and as kaitiaki they have a strong cultural, spiritual and traditional connection to the lakes. The lakes’ existence is a major life force for Te Arawa and the history of the lakes is deeply entrenched in their whakapapa. Maintaining the health of the lakes has a key link to maintaining the health of Te Arawa whanau, hapu and iwi. ”

“Te Arawa lakes are also an economic source for the local iwi. Throughout history, Te Arawa have utilised the beauty and uniqueness of the lakes for tourism and the economic growth of their people. With the state that the Te Arawa lakes have become, their ability to promote the lakes as a pristine, natural environment has become increasingly difficult.”

“For a long time now, the concerns of the Te Arawa people about the state of the lakes have gone unheard. As kaitiaki, they have witnessed the condition of the lakes deteriorate with little or no ability to prevent it. This government is aware of the relationship Te Arawa have with all 12 lakes and we are committed to assisting the Te Arawa people to continue that relationship. Our contribution to improving the water quality of the lakes, and ensuring that we work in partnership with local government and local iwi to do this is evidence of our strong commitment and good intentions.”

The total cost of the lakes restoration programme is $144.2 million and the government has agreed to contribute 50 per cent of this. The other 50 per cent will come from Rotorua District Council and Environment Bay of Plenty. The Rotorua lakes restoration programme will focus its attention on the four most badly polluted lakes – Lakes Rotorua, Rotoiti, Okareka and Rotoehu.
