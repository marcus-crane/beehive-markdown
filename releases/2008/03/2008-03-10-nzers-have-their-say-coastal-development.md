A Board of Inquiry has been appointed to get public feedback on a new national policy statement, which will guide councils on how to manage development along our coastline.

Conservation Minister Steve Chadwick has appointed the board to carry out public consultation on a draft New Zealand Coastal Policy Statement, which will update the 1994 statement.

The document guides the management of the coastal environment under the Resource Management Act. Council planning and resource consent decisions must adhere to the policies in this statement.

Steve Chadwick says coastal development is an issue that most New Zealanders feel very strongly about, and this consultation is about making sure the guidelines reflect what communities want for the coast.

“The Labour-led government believes it’s important to protect New Zealand’s stunning coastline, and make sure that development doesn’t destroy what we love about it. This process allows every New Zealander to have their say about the new Coastal Policy Statement.”

The new Statement aims to be clearer and stronger than the 1994 document, and to address issues that have become more pressing over the past decade, such as coastal subdivision and climate change.

Examples of what the statement requires councils to do include:

• Protecting surf breaks of national importance

• Reducing impacts on endangered species; for example, Maui’s dolphin

• Working closely with local iwi to protect certain aspects of our coastline

• Principles to guide coastal subdivision; for example, to reduce ribbon developments or destruction of natural values.

The draft statement is now available at www.doc.govt.nz. The Board of Inquiry is taking written public submissions until 7 May, and public hearings will be held later this year.

Steve Chadwick says this opportunity comes along only once every 10 years, and urges everyone to have their say in what kind of development should happen along our precious coastline.

“This will make sure that the management of our coast reflects what people in our communities want.”
