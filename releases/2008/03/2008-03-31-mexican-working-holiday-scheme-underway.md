Young New Zealanders can now travel, work and study in Mexico for up to a year, thanks to a Working Holiday Scheme that came into effect today, says Foreign Minister Winston Peters.

”The scheme offers a great opportunity each year for up to 200 New Zealanders aged between 18 and 30 to enjoy the experience of living and working in Mexico for 12 months,” Mr Peters said.

“The reciprocal nature of the scheme means that a similar number of young Mexicans will also be welcome to come and experience New Zealand’s lifestyle and culture as well.

“This is Mexico’s first Working Holiday Scheme, which reflects the strength of our relationship. It also adds to New Zealand’s growing links with the nations of Latin America, and recognises the importance that personal contacts can play in developing our broader relationship with Mexico,” Mr Peters said.

The scheme was signed in Auckland last September, during the visit of Mexican President Felipe Calderón Hinojosa, the first Mexican leader to come to New Zealand.
