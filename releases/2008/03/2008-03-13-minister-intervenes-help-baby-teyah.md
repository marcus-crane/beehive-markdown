Minister of Health David Cunliffe has ensured red tape won’t stop baby Teyah receiving a potentially life saving transplant.

Mr Cunliffe who was moved by the stories in the Bay of Plenty Times, has today made inquires and ascertained that there is no legal or bureaucratic impediment to baby Teyah receiving a transplant from her 18 year old mother or any suitable donor.

“I have been assured that Teyah’s case will be assessed on exactly the same criteria as any other case involving an organ transplant.”

“It is one of the most rewarding aspects of this job to be able to pick up the phone and work with those in the health sector to make a difference.”
