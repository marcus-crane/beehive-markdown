Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta is celebrating the positive contribution made by young people.

“It is important to celebrate our young people, and encourage them to reach their full potential, because their success is crucial to our success as a nation,” said Nanaia Mahuta

“This is at the heart of the Ministry of Youth Development’s work with young people, and I’m proud to support the achievements young New Zealanders make to our communities and our country.”

The Ministry of Youth Development’s Celebrating Everyday Young New Zealanders project will profile the achievements of 12 young people from around the country as part of its Youth Week 08 celebrations starting 26 May.

“Celebrating Everyday Young New Zealanders is open to New Zealanders aged 12 to 24 years,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“This initiative promotes the many positive things young people do around the country, and I would encourage everyone to nominate a young person that has been an inspiration and made a difference by giving something back to their community in the past 12 months.

“It could be for environmental work, volunteering, entrepreneurship, mentoring, sporting/cultural success, or even a young person who has turned their life around and given something positive back to society”.

“The Labour-led government is committed to ensuring young people continue to be supported and have every opportunity to make the most of what this country has to offer,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

Nominations close on 2 May. Go to www.myd.govt.nz to nominate a young person. The 12 young people selected will attend a special event in Wellington (with a support person). The young people nominated will be profiled on the Ministry of Youth Development website and newsletter.
