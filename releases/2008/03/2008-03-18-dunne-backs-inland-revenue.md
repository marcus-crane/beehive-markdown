Revenue Minister Peter Dunne says he’s still satisfied with the performance of the Inland Revenue Department, despite the Department’s error, revealed today, in accurately accounting for provisional tax accruals during January

“I am concerned and unhappy that this has happened and I look forward to the results of the review being undertaken seeking the cause of the error and I am confident the Commissioner Bob Russell will be doing everything possible to ensure it does not happen again,” he said.
