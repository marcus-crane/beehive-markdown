Social Development and Employment Minister Ruth Dyson today welcomed the church leaders’ call to ensure that social and economic policies are compatible.

The Labour-led government has a firm commitment to supporting the most vulnerable families in New Zealand. This focus is evident across a wide range of our policies, including

- $1.6 billion investment in the Working for Families package per year
- 37,400 children now receiving child care assistance
- 20 hours Free Early Childhood Education for 3 and 4 year olds
- Some 59,500 tenants benefiting from income related rents for state housing.
- Lower medical fees including free health care for under 6year olds
- Increases in minimum wage rates

As a result of the changes we have seen steady improvement. Last year’s Social Report showed that since the mid-1990s there has been improvement in health outcomes, unemployment, market incomes and the overall population with low incomes.

From 2001 to 2008, an estimated total of 130,000 children are expected to be lifted out of poverty as a result of increasing employment, decreasing unemployment, Working for Families and other government policies.

“I am extremely proud of our record in creating jobs, lifting children out of poverty reducing reliance on benefits, and providing genuine choices for New Zealand families” said Ruth Dyson

“We acknowledge that we have not yet eliminated poverty. Achieving a just and fair society is an ongoing effort, and the Labour-led government will continue to strive towards this goal”
