Environment Minister Trevor Mallard today announced the members of a Board of Inquiry to consider Contact Energy’s proposal for a new geothermal power station at Te Mihi near Taupo.

Trevor Mallard has appointed a four-person board with Judge Gordon Whiting as the chairperson and Dr Patrick Browne, Denis Nugent and Glenice Paine as the board members.

The role of the board is to consider submissions on Contact’s applications for resource consent, to hold a public hearing and to make a final decision on its Te Mihi geothermal power station proposal.

"I am pleased to have a board chairperson and board members of such high calibre. In appointing the board members, I have considered their individual and collective expertise including technical skills about geothermal generation and their understanding of the Resource Management Act (RMA), hearing procedures and of tikanga Maori," said Trevor Mallard.

"I am confident the board members bring the appropriate skills and knowledge to this decision making process," he said.

On 22 January Trevor Mallard called in Contact’s applications for the Te Mihi proposal because of the proposal’s national significance. The call-in combines the council’s consideration and a potential Environment Court appeal process into a single consideration by a Board of Inquiry. The board will make final decisions on the application in accordance with district and regional plans.
