Civil Defence Minister, Rick Barker is currently in Canberra to attend the Australian Ministerial Council for Police and Emergency Management – Emergency Management (MCPEM-EM).

The meeting is an opportunity for Ministers responsible for emergency management from the Australian State and Federal Government and New Zealand, to meet and share information. The Minister's attendance is aimed at strengthening and reinvigorating the civil defence relationship between Australia and New Zealand.

"I see this as a valuable opportunity to enhance civil defence emergency management practice in Australia and New Zealand, as well as further strengthening the relationship between the two countries," Mr Barker said.

"Over the past two decades, disasters have increased in number and severity, requiring enhanced international cooperation and stronger international relationships.

"New Zealand's approach to international engagement on Civil Defence matters is based on three objectives; to ensure that our response capability is supported by access to international assistance, to fulfil our international obligations as a good ‘global citizen’ and to increase New Zealand’s domestic resilience and CDEM capability through increased knowledge.

"Involvement in groups such as MCPEM-EM helps the maintenance and development of relationships for information sharing and knowledge exchange, as well as furthering our other aims."

As part of the meeting Mr Barker has been invited to present a case study on New Zealand’s civil defence public education programmes, What’s the Plan Stan? and Get Ready Get Thru.

"Making information on disaster awareness and preparedness available is a key part of building resilient communities. I look forward to sharing the New Zealand experience with my Australian counterparts and gathering knowledge and experiences not available in New Zealand," Mr Barker said.
