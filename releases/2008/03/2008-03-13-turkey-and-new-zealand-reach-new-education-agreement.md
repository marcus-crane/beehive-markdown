Tertiary Education Minister Pete Hodgson today announced an agreement to promote stronger education linkages between New Zealand and Turkey.

The education cooperation arrangement, which was signed by New Zealand’s ambassador to Turkey Hamish Cooper and Turkey’s Ministry of National Education in Ankara overnight, aims to strengthen the exchange of information and cooperation between educational institutions and authorities.

“This arrangement will reinforce and deepen the friendly relations between our two countries, building on the already warm ties by further expanding our education linkages,” Pete Hodgson said.

“It is a direct outcome of high-level visits to New Zealand by Turkey’s Prime Minister in 2005 and Minister of Education in 2006 and highlights the growing reputation of New Zealand’s education system, institutions and their academic staff.

“New Zealand’s potential as an education provider complements Turkey's expanding need for good quality tertiary education for its large young population.”

The number of Turkish students studying in New Zealand has the opportunity to grow with the introduction in 2006 of the Turkish-government sponsorship programme which allows up to 100 Turkish students to be eligible for places in New Zealand tertiary education institutions.

“By building on this strong foundation of education cooperation between our two countries, we will not only strengthen our respective education systems, but also our economies and societies,” Pete Hodgson said.
