Wairarapa farmers could be amongst the hardest-hit by this summer’s drought, Jim Anderton said today.

Jim Anderton said a recent headline in a Wairarapa newspaper gave the impression that he was not concerned for local farmers.

“Farmers and others at the meetings I have addressed know that is not remotely true or accurately depicting what I said.

“While the drought may be biting hardest in Waikato, where they are not used to dry conditions, I think that farmers in Wairarapa could be amongst the hardest-hit in the country because of the cumulative effect of several years of bad weather and low prices.

“Because of this continual attack by the elements, Wairarapa farmers probably have less reserves than those in other areas, and this latest extreme dry weather is just further added insult to injury.”

He said that he had referred to a “not the end of the world” event during his explanation of how the Government’s overall Adverse Events framework operated. This was not meant to be taken as referring specifically to Wairarapa farmers’ current situation.

“This Government is well aware of just how tough people are finding it. Cabinet gets briefings every week. I want to assure people that central Government, local government, industry groups, and rural advisers are working together to do everything possible to help farming families through this.

“It’s disappointing that some people want to make political capital out of misrepresenting what’s being said and what’s going on.”

During the past week, Jim Anderton has visited farmers in Manawatu, southern Hawkes Bay, Wairarapa, and North Canterbury to see first-hand how farmers are coping with extreme dry weather.

In the past month, he has also visited farmers in Waikato and northern Southland.

“In some areas, there has been some rain, which has helped with pasture growth, but the issues haven’t gone away. Farmers need to carefully monitor their situations.”

Jim Anderton said that farmers should be in touch with local Rural Support Trust representatives and take up the help available to them through Rural Assistance payments from Work and Income.
