“My aim is to have a co-ordinated health service where Associate Ministers play a vital role in helping plan and deliver important decisions in this essential portfolio.”

Mr Cunliffe said the Associate Ministers would be responsible for policy areas ranging from men’s health, suicide prevention, Healthy Eating - Healthy Action, cardiovascular health, maternity, Maori health and problem gambling.

“Fruit in schools, Healthy Eating Healthy Action, tobacco control, drug policy, sexual health are all policies that promote good health, rather than simply sitting back and waiting for someone to become ill before acting.”

The Associate Ministers will also play a primary relationship role with liaison with a number of District Health Boards.

Mr Cunliffe said the health portfolio was one that every New Zealander came into contact with it was therefore important to have policies that worked together to provide first class services but that also enabled kiwi’s to maintain health.

Mr Cunliffe said since coming to office in 1999 the Labour-led Government had made a huge investment in health.

“By reducing the barriers to people accessing primary care we are encouraging New Zealander’s to use health services to maintain their well being.

“The large and active Ministerial team and the broad delegations that empower them will allow the public to benefit from a higher degree of ministerial involvement this crucial portfolio.”
