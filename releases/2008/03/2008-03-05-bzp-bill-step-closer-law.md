The bill which will ban BZP-based party pills became a step closer to law this evening, Associate Health Minister and Progressive Party leader Jim Anderton said today.

Jim Anderton said he was pleased the bill had made it back into the House.

“I was always confident it would make it back, and I’m optimistic about the level of support it will have in the House.

“This bill is important, as it gives out a positive message against psychoactive drugs, and that we give protection to young people from those who would exploit them.”

The bill has yet to pass through committee stages in the House and its third reading. Once it becomes law, after receiving Royal Assent, manufacturers and retailers will have seven days to stop making and selling BZP-based party pills. Consumers will have six months to use any pills they have for personal use.
