New Zealand has signed a market access agreement with Samoa as part of their bid to join the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Trade Minister Phil Goff announced today.

“New Zealand fully supports Samoa’s bid to accede to the WTO and the signing of this agreement marks a significant step in that process,” Mr Goff said.

The agreement was signed by Samoa’s Deputy Prime Minister Misa Telefoni and New Zealand’s Trade Minister Phil Goff at a ceremony in Auckland today.

“WTO rules mean that we are unable to release any specific details of the negotiation at this stage in the process. However, I can say that this agreement reflects Samoa’s level of development, their commitment to economic liberalisation and the special relationship between the two countries,” Mr Goff said

To accede to the WTO a state is required to obtain endorsement from a WTO Working Party that its trade regime is consistent with WTO rules. It must also conclude individual bilateral negotiations on the terms of their entry to the WTO with other members.

The signing took place at 1.30pm at the Langham Hotel, Symonds St, Auckland.
