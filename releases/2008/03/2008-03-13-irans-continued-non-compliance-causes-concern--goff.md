Iran’s failure to comply with UN Security Council and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) resolutions continues to concern New Zealand, Disarmament and Arms Control Minister Phil Goff said today.

“It is disappointing that Iran’s nuclear programme is still the subject of international concern more than five years after it was discovered to have undertaken undeclared nuclear activities for almost two decades,” Mr Goff said.

The UN Security Council passed its third round of sanctions against Iran in New York last week. The new round of sanctions, targeted mainly at Iran’s nuclear and missile programmes, builds on those already in place as a result of UN Security Council resolutions 1737 and 1747.

“Officials are now studying the newly imposed sanctions and will take steps to implement these measures. Regulations implementing the sanctions from previous resolutions are already in place in New Zealand.

“I am pleased that the IAEA has reported an increased level of engagement and co-operation with Iran in recent months. The news that the IAEA has resolved a number of outstanding issues is very welcome.

“But there is still more work to be done. I share the IAEA Director General’s serious concern over nuclear studies that Iran may have undertaken with a military dimension. This needs to be addressed.

“The IAEA Director General said he needs a greater understanding about these studies and implementation of an Additional Protocol, allowing broader inspective powers, before he will be able to provide credible assurances about Iran’s nuclear activities.

“I urge Iran to work with the IAEA to clarify these issues and to allow the IAEA the greatest transparency in this work. With Iran’s active co-operation, I hope that the IAEA’s continuing efforts will result in the early resolution of these matters.

“It remains New Zealand’s strong desire to see this matter resolved in a peaceful, diplomatic manner. We urge Iran to take the steps required by the Security Council and the IAEA to build confidence about the nature of its past and present nuclear activities,” Mr Goff said.
