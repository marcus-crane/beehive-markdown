Education Minister Chris Carter expressed strong support for a thorough investigation into concerns over bullying at Takapuna Grammar School.

“I am very concerned that bullying may have played a part in the tragic events detailed in media reports today and I want to reassure parents whose teens are at the school that Takapuna Grammar will be strongly encouraged to investigate those reports,” Chris Carter said.

“Every school must ensure a safe environment for its students.”

The Labour-led government has introduced a wide range of programmes to ensure student safety and further initiatives in this area would not be ruled out, the Minister said.

The Ministry of Education currently provided support to schools through Supporting Positive Behaviours information online.

The Ministry runs the “eliminating violence” programme that focuses on improving a school’s culture and approach to such issues as violence and bullying, and “non-violent crisis intervention”, a programme that introduces teachers to whole-school approaches to violence and bullying.

Other agencies, including Police and Child Youth and Family also provide services and resources for schools.

“It is vital school administrators have access to these documents which provide very good guidelines,” Chris Carter said.

“The best thing Takapuna Grammar can do now is investigate the reports of bullying and violence within the school and seek assistance to ensure the culture of the school is a positive one for all students.”
