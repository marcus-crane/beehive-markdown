Associate Minister of Health Mita Ririnui attended the launch of ‘Kidney Health New Zealand’ today as a show of support for an organisation dedicated to reducing the status of kidney disease in New Zealand.

“It is a well known fact that Maori are at high risk of kidney disease, as well as diabetes and high blood pressure, which are of course closely linked to kidney disease. With an organisation such as Kidney Health New Zealand working to educate all New Zealanders about kidney disease, their messages are having a positive impact on Maori health” said Minister Mita Ririnui.

“It is important for Maori to understand what the causes and symptoms of kidney disease are so that we can identify factors in our own lives that could be having a negative impact on our health.”

Formally known as The New Zealand Kidney Foundation, the name change to Kidney Health New Zealand was seen as a way to more accurately reflect the organisations concern – community education and screening people in the community who are at increased risk of kidney disease.

It has been identified that if kidney disease is diagnosed early enough, it is treatable; however a major barrier to early detection and treatment is that most people with early kidney disease do not know that they have it.

Minister Mita Ririnui stressed how important it is for Maori to have regular check ups with their GP’s to ensure that any issues or concerns can be dealt with at an early stage.
