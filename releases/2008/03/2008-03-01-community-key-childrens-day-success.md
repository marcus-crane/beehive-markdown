New Zealand communities are the key to the success of Children’s Day, says Social Development Minister Ruth Dyson.

"Thousands of families will celebrate [Children’s Day](http://www.childrensday.org.nz/) on Sunday, it’s a day that brings families together to have fun at events around the country, organised by community groups.

"Children's Day is a chance for us to remind ourselves how important children are and what they need for happiness in their lives. Simply spending time together can be the greatest gift that parents, children and relatives can give each other,” said Ruth Dyson.

Hundreds of [events](http://www.childrensday.org.nz/ChildrensDaySite/what/default.aspx) have been planned across the country for tomorrow, with 'new experiences' as this year’s Children’s Day theme.

"Thank you to the many organisations and people in the community who have worked hard to make their events a success and I hope everyone enjoys their day," Ruth Dyson said.

The Labour-led government is committed to supporting families through initiatives such as:

- 20 hours free Early Childhood Education,
- 14 weeks Paid Parental Leave,
- four weeks minimum annual leave,
- Working for Families,
- Well Child and B4 School checks,
- SKIP parenting programmes,
- Fruit in Schools and Mission On,
- social workers in schools, and
- Family Start.
