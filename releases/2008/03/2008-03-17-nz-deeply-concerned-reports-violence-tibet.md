Prime Minister Helen Clark today said New Zealand is deeply concerned at reports of violence and riots in Tibet and subsequently elsewhere in China.

"We want to see an end to the violence. New Zealand has long urged China to engage in meaningful dialogue with representatives of the Tibetan people as we think this is the best way to achieve a lasting resolution of problems in Tibet," Helen Clark said.

"New Zealand respects the right of people to protest peacefully. We urge the Chinese authorities to react carefully and proportionately to protest.

"New Zealand has regular discussions with China on human rights matters, including on Tibet.

"The New Zealand government takes an ongoing interest in developments in Tibet and will continue to convey its views to the Chinese authorities.

"We will continue to monitor the situation and provide advice for New Zealanders in Tibet. We encourage New Zealanders to register or update their contact details with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade," Helen Clark said.
