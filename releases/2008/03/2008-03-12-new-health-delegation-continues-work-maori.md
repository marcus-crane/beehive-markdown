“I am honoured to be part of the new health delegation and I look forward to working alongside my fellow colleagues to create a healthy environment for all New Zealanders” said associate Minister of Health Mita Ririnui at today’s launching of the new Health delegation.

Minister of Health David Cunliffe launched his new health delegation on Tuesday 11 March 2008 and among the line up was long standing Associate Minister of Health Mita Ririnui.

Minister Mita Ririnui has been an associate Minister of Health since 2004, with a particular interest in Maori health.

In his speech, Minister Ririnui outlined the successes of He Korowai Oranga; The Maori Health Strategy and Whakatataka; The Maori Health Action Plan and added that the two initiatives have paved the way for many new, innovative and positive projects in order to combat inequalities in Maori health.

“Since the implementation of He Korowai Oranga and Whakatataka, we have seen significant improvements in Maori health statistics. Life expectancy of Maori males and females has increased and more importantly, the gap between the Maori and non-Maori mortality rate has decreased”.

“He Korowai Oranga and Whakatataka have created a pathway for recent initiatives such as The Whanau Ora Assessment Tool, the research project for the Maori Oral Health Workforce and the Maori Oral Health Providers Project, to name a few. There are many more Ministry success stories and initiatives that have made and continue to make a significant difference in the way Maori health services are delivered, and received, for the betterment of all Maori.”

In closing his speech, Minister Ririnui outlined that his aim is to achieve whanau ora and mauri ora - for Maori to be supported to achieve their maximum health and well being and that he has every confidence in the new health delegation and their ability to achieve just that.
