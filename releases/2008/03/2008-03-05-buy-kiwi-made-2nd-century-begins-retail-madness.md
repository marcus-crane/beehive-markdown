Kiwi shoppers are making history as the country enters into the second century of Buy New Zealand Made campaigns.

April is ‘Buy Kiwi Mad’ month, and a retail blitz will include advertising, point of sale materials, the 20th birthday celebration for Buy New Zealand Made Campaign Ltd and a competition for shoppers seeking Kiwi made goods.

“In 1908 the first organised campaign encouraged local shoppers to buy New Zealand made goods,” says Sue Bradford, Government Spokesperson for Buy Kiwi Made. “The reasons for buying Kiwi made then are relevant today – supporting local workers and businesses and keeping our economy strong.”

Retailers are being encouraged to take part in the month-long focus on buying New Zealand made goods.

“We know from our research that around 1.3 million adult New Zealanders are usually seeking Kiwi made when they’re out shopping,” says Ms Bradford. “With retailers profiling these goods in-store, this can increase even further.”

Ms Bradford says that New Zealand has a proud history of Kiwi Made campaigns that involved government, retailers, workers, manufacturers, and manufacturing associations working together.

“Perhaps the most remarkable feat over the past 100 years was Esther James’ walk from Cape Reinga to Stewart Island. She was the first person ever recorded to do this and she did it all in New Zealand made clothes to promote Buy New Zealand Made,” said Ms Bradford.

An event at Parliament to mark the start of the April celebrations will also commemorate the arrival in Wellington of Esther James 76 years ago.
