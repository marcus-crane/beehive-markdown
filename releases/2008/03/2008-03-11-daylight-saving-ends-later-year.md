There is still three weeks of daylight saving left Internal Affairs Minister, Rick Barker said today.

Daylight saving ends three weeks later than usual this year, on 6 April, but some diaries and calendars mistakenly show this Sunday, 16 March as the finishing date.

The government reviewed and extended the period of daylight saving last year following public debate and a petition to Parliament.

Clocks now go forward an hour on the last Sunday in September (instead of the first Sunday in October) and revert to standard time on the first Sunday in April (instead of the third Sunday in March) when clocks go back an hour.

“The new period of daylight saving provides people with an extra hour of daylight during the evening in which they can enjoy the outdoors,” Mr Barker said.

“The Department of Internal Affairs is researching the public’s attitude to the extension and the impact upon electricity consumption, traffic accidents and tourism.

“Most computers should adjust their clocks automatically on 6 April rather than 16 March, but some users may have to update their PCs manually.”
