Forty-two top New Zealand doctoral students have been awarded just under $4.4 million in scholarships over the next three years, Tertiary Education Minister Pete Hodgson announced today.

“The Labour-led government is committed to providing support for research excellence and recognises that a strong research sector is essential for New Zealand’s economic and social development,” Pete Hodgson said.

“These scholarships are an important investment in New Zealand’s brightest scholars. It is the critical thinking of our researchers that gives us an opportunity to become an innovation-led country with the skills and knowledge to compete internationally.”

Top Achievers Doctoral Scholarships are awarded to students undertaking research in a variety of disciplines at a New Zealand or overseas tertiary institution. If the research is undertaken overseas the student must return to New Zealand on the completion of the scholarship for a period equal to that of the scholarship.

Some examples of the newly awarded Top Achievers Doctoral Scholarships include:

• Investigating wireless power transfer for heart assist devices

• Analysing the population of the sub-Antarctic Right Whale

• Evaluation of international tourist experiences using industry websites

• Research on the role of social studies education

• Developing models for control of deepwater floating wind turbines

• Research on sustainable river management

“This round of scholarship recipients cover many different disciplines. While some research contributes directly to product and technological innovation, other research assists us to better understand social, economic and environmental problems,” Pete Hodgson said.

The Tertiary Education Commission administers the scholarships. Visit http://www.tec.govt.nz/templates/standard.aspx?id=675 for a list of successful recipients. The next two funding rounds for Top Achiever Doctoral Scholarships close on 14 May and 10 December 2008.
