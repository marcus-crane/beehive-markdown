Abel Tasman, Nelson Lakes and Kahurangi National Parks are all larger thanks to Department of Conservation purchases the Minister of Conservation Steve Chadwick announced today.

''Our National Parks are treasures, and I am delighted that these additions will mean that New Zealanders will be able to more fully enjoy these diverse natural areas” said Steve Chadwick.

Over 900 hectares has been added to [Abel Tasman National Park](http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/PlaceProfile.aspx?id=38455) in numerous parcels, the most significant of which is an area of 790 hectares, known as Hadfields Clearing, overlooking Awaroa Inlet. The area was previously in private ownership and was surrounded by the park.

The Minister said that it was a logical addition to the park and she was pleased that it had now been formally included in the park.

“Abel Tasman National Park is unique and is internationally renowned for its scenic beauty. The extra land will mean that forest can regenerate and tui, bellbirds and pukeko will become a more common sight.”

The land added to [Nelson Lakes National Park](http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/PlaceProfile.aspx?id=38481) consists of small areas at St Arnaud and the nearby Lake Rotoiti that are indistinguishable from the surrounding park land.

An area of 38 hectares has been included in the Honeycomb Hill Caves Specially Protected Area in [Kahurangi National Park](http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/PlaceProfile.aspx?id=38413). The Minister commented that such areas were set apart in recognition of their special significance and to give the area additional protection under the National Parks Act. As its name suggests the Honeycomb Hill area protects a significant cave system and entry to the area is controlled to ensure that the fragile cave environment is protected.

The Minister noted that the addition of the area has moved the controlled access point to the road end at Nimrodel Creek.
