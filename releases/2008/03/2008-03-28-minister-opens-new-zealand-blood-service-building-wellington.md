Associate Minister of Health Mita Ririnui opened the newly refurbished New Zealand Blood Service building in Wellington on Thursday 27 March 2008.

Also present at the opening were New Zealand Blood Service management, donors and volunteers as well as Capital and Coast DHB staff members.

As Associate Minister of Health, Mita Ririnui has undertaken the responsibility of overseeing the New Zealand Blood Service and according to the minister, he is happy to have been given the appointment over such an important service to New Zealand.

“For many people, blood transfusions during emergency and major surgery are what make’s the difference between someone living or dying. It is a vital part of medical surgery and without all the blood donors who so generously give their blood, we would be greatly affected.”

According to statistics from the New Zealand Blood Service, only 4% of New Zealanders donate blood, while 80% of New Zealanders benefit from those donations through blood transfusions and the products developed from blood donation.

“It is not common knowledge that products such as tetanus injections are produced through blood donations. Most New Zealanders assume that blood donations go towards blood transfusions and as a result, think that the need for blood donation is very small. In actual fact, blood donations are needed for a variety of products.”

The newly refurbished New Zealand Blood Service building is situated on Hospital Road, Newtown, Wellington.
