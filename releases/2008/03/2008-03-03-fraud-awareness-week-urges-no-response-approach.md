Ever been promised easy money, true love, great prizes or access to a secret trust account?

“Offers that sound too good to be true can trick you into giving away your personal details, your money, or your heart, yet they never deliver what you want,” says Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard, launching Fraud Awareness Week 2008.

“Fraud Awareness Week 2008, 3-10 March, is part of an international effort to raise awareness about scams, and help New Zealanders to identify, protect themselves from, report, and stop scams.”

The overarching theme of the week is ‘Scams target you – protect yourself’.

This year the focus is on scams that seduce consumers with alluring promises and deceive or trick consumers in to giving scammers their personal details.

“Scams are designed to trick consumers into giving away their money or personal details. Avoid rip offs, simply don’t respond,” says Judith Tizard.

Every year thousands of New Zealanders are targeted by scammers. Most scams originate from outside New Zealand and once money is sent overseas it is virtually impossible to recover.

"Education and prevention strategies are the most effective ways to deal with scams and scammers. By recognising a scam for what it is and not responding, people can protect themselves, avoid loss and the scam will fail."

“There are no guaranteed get-rich-quick schemes – the only people who get rich are the scammers," Judith Tizard said.

During Fraud Awareness Week 2008 the Ministry of Consumer Affairs is launching the improved Scamwatch website, which features comprehensive and updated information about scams to help consumers protect themselves and others from being scammed.
