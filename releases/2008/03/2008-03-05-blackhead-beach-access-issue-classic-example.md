The issue of access to Blackhead beach in Hawke’s Bay is an example of an issue that the government’s proposed Walking Access Commission would help resolve, Rural Affairs Minister Damien O’Connor said today.

The issue around access to Blackhead Beach was highlighted on TVNZ’s Close Up programme last night. It follows a recent government announcement that a new agency to advise on and implement walking access policies will be established this year.

Mr O'Connor said providing access to outdoor areas is an important and complex issue which affects many New Zealanders, and the purpose of the new agency is to provide national leadership on walking access issues.

“This agency will co-ordinate the involvement of key stakeholders including local and central government, help local groups with access issues and be responsible for mediation of disputes over walking access issues,” said Mr O’Connor.

“With regard to the situation in the Hawke’s Bay, I will be endeavouring to have the legislation to establish the commission passed this year so that groups such as local hapu Ngati Kere would have a place to take their concerns to.

“I commend the parties involved in this dispute for their approach of negotiation rather than resorting to confrontational tactics. With goodwill on all sides, and the involvement of the Central Hawke’s Bay District Council, I am sure an effective solution can be reached.

“There are similar access issues to this one around the country. Once we have the Commission up and running, the frustration and misinformation that surrounds such matters can be alleviated,” said Mr O’Connor.

The new crown agency will provide national leadership, including a national strategy, and coordination of access among key stakeholders and relevant central and local government organisations.

It will also provide impartial and robust advice on access; offer local/regional leadership and coordination to help local groups with their access issues; and when necessary mediate disputes over walking access.

The agency will be monitored by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.
