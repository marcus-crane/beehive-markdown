Education Minister Chris Carter has welcomed the ratification of all the major collective employment agreements for teachers and principals in the education sector.

“The ratification of these claims is extremely good news,” Chris Carter said.

“The Labour-led government recognises the enormous importance of teachers and school leaders in ensuring our young people contribute to the wellbeing and prosperity of New Zealand.

“These major settlements are a major achievement by everyone involved to ensure 2008 gets off to a positive and settled start.”

Secondary teachers ratified their collective agreement last year, and in February primary teachers and principals, area school principals and teachers and support staff followed suit.

“2008 will be a big year for education but we can move forward knowing that all teachers and principals have pay and conditions they are happy with,” Chris Carter said.
