The photographs on display at the exhibition of Fisheries Ministry competition capture the distinctive feeling of New Zealand, Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton said today.

Jim Anderton officially opened the exhibition in Wellington and said the exhibition showed the enjoyment we take from our ocean resource and the livelihoods it sustains.

“So this is a very appropriate competition for the Fisheries Ministry to support.

“Its job is to manage our fishery so we can enjoy it now and tomorrow.

“Fishing is worth $1.2 billion a year to our economy - that’s the value to the livelihoods of individual fishing folk who depend on the ocean’s harvest for their own incomes.

“And more than that, it is a lifestyle for millions of us who enjoy catching a fish, and enjoy eating it.

“I think that’s [the excitement these photos capture.”](http://www.fish.govt.nz/en-nz/info/contactus/Media+Centre/Photo+Competition/default.htm)

Jim Anderton congratulated the overall winner Kura Paul-Burke, and the other category winners - Peter Langlands (commercial), Alan Riwaka (Customary) and Juergen Schaeke (recreational).
