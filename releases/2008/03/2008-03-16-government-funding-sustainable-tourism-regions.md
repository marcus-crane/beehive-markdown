New government funding of $840,000 is being committed to help tourism businesses in the regions improve their environmental sustainability, Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor announced today.

The Sustainable Tourism Advisers in Regions (STAR) Project is an evolution of the Sustainable Tourism Charter which was piloted in 2004. It will help up to eight regions in New Zealand fund the costs of an adviser who will work with tourism operators to reduce their business’ impact on the environment.

Mr O’Connor said the new project complements the upcoming addition of responsible tourism business requirement to Qualmark criteria which will recognise tourism businesses that can show evidence of effort to minimise their environmental impact.

“These new STAR advisers will provide a one on one service to tourism operators helping them reach the new *Qualmark* standards and will suggest ways the business can aim to achieve full marks,” said Mr O’Connor.

“Tourism businesses will be encouraged to join *Qualmark* and communicate their achievements to visitors to ensure they receive recognition for their efforts. Operators’ efforts will also reinforce our 100% Pure New Zealand image worldwide.

“This initiative contributes to one of the important outcomes in the [New Tourism Strategy 2015](http://www.nztourismstrategy.com/) which highlights the need for the tourism sector to take a leading role in protecting and enhancing New Zealand’s environment,” said Mr O’Connor.

The STAR funding is contestable, with a request for proposals to be released to regions by the Ministry of Tourism shortly.

Successful regions will have a strong commitment to managing tourism and sustainability in the region and will be expected to show how they will contribute financially to the project, to maximise results. Regions can apply jointly, and advisors may be located within RTOs, Economic Development Agencies, or any other appropriate organisation.
