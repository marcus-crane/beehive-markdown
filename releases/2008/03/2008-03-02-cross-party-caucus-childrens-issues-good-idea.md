Labour supports the call from Every Child Counts to establish a cross-party caucus to discuss issues affecting children, says Minister of Social Development, Ruth Dyson.

"The proposal to set up a co-operative group to work together to advance the interests of children is appropriate to discuss today, Children’s Day. New Zealand would be following in the steps of other countries such as the United Kingdom where parties work together on policies advancing the interests of children."

"Political co-operation over children’s issues will help ensure consistent and sustainable policies are made and our children will benefit long term as a result," said Ruth Dyson.

Every Child Counts has proposed bringing MPs together for cross-party work shortly after the 2008 general election.
