The Government today approved a $ 3.5 million investment in a new project to introduce digital x ray test imaging to improve quality and safety for the patients of the Mid Central District Health Board.

The Minister of Health, David Cunliffe says this project is a critical step towards regional cooperation between District Health Boards in the lower North Island.

”I am delighted that this is a regional approach with Capital Coast ,Whanganui and Hutt Valley all taking part .It underlines the importance I attach to more collaboration between the countries DHBs to improve safety and quality”.

The $3.5 million will be invested in new software for scanning x rays and will be funded entirely by the MidCentral District Health Board. At present the Board’s radiology records are all film based which means that there are storage issues, speed of delivery is no longer acceptable and Xrays are more easily stored and retrieved.

“I understand there are potential savings of $374,000 a year in costs once the scheme is running however I have been assured that the major benefit will be in improving clinical safety” said Mr Cunliffe .

“I am also pleased that this is an early but significant step that is needed if the District Health Board is to adopt a seamless Electronic Health Record for its patients”.

MidCentral joins with around half of the country’s DHBs who have or in the process of implementing digital X-ray. The remainder are all making plans to move to the new technology.

It is expected that the MidCentral project will be and running within a year.
