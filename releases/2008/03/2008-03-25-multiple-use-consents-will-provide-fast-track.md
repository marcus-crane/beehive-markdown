Building and Construction Minister Shane Jones says the provision of ‘multiple use’ consents has the potential to provide a “fast track” approach for big property developers and large volume builders.

“It is a proposal which I believe has the potential to achieve quite substantial efficiencies in the industry if developers and builders follow procedure and ensure the consenting process is accurately and properly conducted in the first instance,” Mr Jones said.

Multiple use consents would enable developers and large volume builders to be able to apply for one building consent for a number of identical dwellings in the same subdivision, district, region and nationwide.

“It is a fast track approach which should enhance our ability to provide starter homes to first home buyers at a quicker and more affordable rate,” Mr Jones said.

Local consent from a Building Consent Authority would still be needed for any site-specific works such as drainage and, foundations would still require separate consideration, as well as any significant variation to the design.

District Plan and resource consent issues would also need to be addressed separately.

The Department of Building and Housing will report to the Labour-led Government by 30 May 2008 on the best way to implement the ‘multiple use’ consents proposal.

“It shows this Labour-led Government is working for the future,” Mr Jones said.
