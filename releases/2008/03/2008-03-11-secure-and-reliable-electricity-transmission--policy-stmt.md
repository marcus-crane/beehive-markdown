A new National Policy Statement on Electricity Transmission will require decision makers to consider the national significance of a reliable and secure electricity supply - as well as adverse environmental effects - when they assess proposals for New Zealand's national grid, Environment Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

The policy statement, approved by Cabinet yesterday, gives guidance to local government across New Zealand for the management and future planning of the national grid. It will be formally gazetted on Thursday and will take effect 28 days later.

"The main purpose of the national policy statement is to make it explicit that electricity transmission is a matter of national significance under the Resource Management Act in order to meet the electricity needs of present and future generations of New Zealanders," Trevor Mallard said.

"An efficient and well-managed electricity supply on the national grid is vital for communities, the environment and businesses around the country. This national policy statement will ensure that there is a balanced consideration of these national benefits and the local effects of electricity transmission. 

"Previously, there was no national framework that local government could use when they had to decide on proposals for transmission lines.

"The national policy statement contains 14 policies intended to facilitate the operation, maintenance and upgrade of the existing network and any new transmission networks, while at the same time managing any adverse environmental effects of the network, and managing the adverse effects of other activities on the network.

"The policy statement is the result of a robust statutory process of public consultation under the Resource Management Act," said Trevor Mallard.

An independent Board of Inquiry, chaired by Hon Peter Salmon QC with Prue Kapua and Russell Howie as members, was appointed in 2007 to hear public views on the proposed statement and prepare recommendations. Seventy-one submissions were received and hearings were held during August 2007. The board submitted its report and recommendations to the Minister for the Environment in November 2007. The final national policy statement mirrors the recommendations of the board. The relevant cabinet paper is at [www.mfe.govt.nz](http://www.mfe.govt.nz). 

"As a key element of the New Zealand Energy Strategy, the government is also preparing a national policy statement on renewable electricity generation, covering energy produced from solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, biomass, tidal, wave and ocean current sources. We have confirmed that a board of inquiry will also be charged with its development. This work will help ensure the national significance of renewable energy is considered fully by local decision makers," Trevor Mallard said.

"These two national policy statements together will contribute to a stronger policy framework for renewable energy and the Labour-led government's goal of 90 per cent renewable energy by 2025."

Background Note: The national grid is the high voltage transmission network that carries electricity around the country. It is made up of over 12,000 km of high-voltage transmission lines and more than 170 substations. It connects power stations to substations that feed local electricity distribution networks.
