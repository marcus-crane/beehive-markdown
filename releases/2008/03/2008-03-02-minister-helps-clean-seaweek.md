Environment Minister Trevor Mallard has taken up the Seaweek challenge to clean up New Zealand beaches, and will help with a clean up at Oriental Parade beach on Monday.

"Seaweek – which includes beach clean ups around the country - is a terrific opportunity for New Zealanders to enjoy their marine environment, to think about its future, and to consider what we can do to ensure our seas stay healthy and abundant," Trevor Mallard said.

"The ocean area that New Zealand is responsible for is 15 times larger than our land area and we have a duty to care for it –for generations of kiwis to come. As well as being an integral part of our national identity, the oceans around us contain a wealth of natural biodiversity values, and has great potential for future economic opportunities," Trevor Mallard said.

"I’ll be getting sand between my toes with local school children and helping to clear up any rubbish and mess.

"I urge others to get on to the beach this week and to help keep it clean throughout the year for our communities now and into the future.

"The sustainable management of our ocean and foreshore is vitally important – it's part of the kiwi lifestyle that we are all so proud of, and it's important for our environment and international clean green reputation," Trevor Mallard said.

The government is currently working to develop new regulations for managing the environmental effects of activities in the Exclusive Economic Zone (12 nautical miles out to 200 nautical miles).

Seaweek is co-ordinated by the New Zealand Association for Environmental Education (NZAEE) with support from the Ministry for the Environment, Department of Conservation, Ministry of Fisheries, St Kilda Marine Environment Trust and NZ Geographic.
