The Labour-led Government is to provide $200,000 sponsorship for Stage Challenge school performing arts events this year, as part of its Mission-On programme which encourages healthy and active lifestyles for young New Zealanders, Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today.

Helen Clark this afternoon visited a Stage Challenge student leaders’ workshop at Unitec in Auckland, where she made the sponsorship announcement.

"The funding is provided from SPARC through the Mission-On programme. It gives sponsorship naming rights to Mission-On for the Stage Challenge and J-Rock school performing arts events in 2008," Helen Clark said.

Stage Challenge attracts secondary students, and the J-Rock competition involves primary and intermediate pupils. The events give students the opportunity to devise their own performance, through drama, dance, and design.

"The Stage Challenge philosophy fits well with the objectives of Mission-On.

"Both reinforce healthy and active lifestyle messages, such as the importance of good nutrition and regular exercise, as well as of encouraging team work, self-esteem, creativity, and the empowerment of young people. Stage Challenge is also proudly drug and alcohol-free," Helen Clark said.

"Another key reason for this new government sponsorship is our desire to see more Decile 1-3 schools able to participate in Stage Challenge. A key performance indicator in the contract is increased participation by such schools. SPARC has a right of renewal for the Mission On contract, including naming rights for 2009 and 2010.

"The Stage Challenge sponsorship is the latest in the series of the Labour-led government’s initiatives under the Mission-On campaign, including the recent launch of the Mission-On website and the Mission-On Lifestyle Ambassadors.

"The health of young New Zealanders is hugely important and we want to support and encourage them to make good choices, set goals and participate in the life of their schools and communities," Helen Clark said.
