Housing New Zealand partners with Corrections to refurbish state houses

A new partnership between Housing New Zealand and the Department of Corrections will see up to 40 state houses a year refurbished by prisoners at Springhill Corrections Facility, says Housing Minister Maryan Street.

From June this year, a third of Housing New Zealand’s house recycling programme work will take place at the Meremere prison near Hamilton. Housing New Zealand recycles, refurbishes and relocates around 120 homes each year.

“Prisoners will refurbish homes taken from sites in Auckland earmarked for new developments. Houses will be stripped, insulated, plastered, painted inside and out as well as fitted with new kitchens, vanities, tubs, shelving, aluminium joinery and curtains. Once completed, they will be moved to other parts of the North Island to mostly small rural communities,” Maryan Street said.

“The high demand for construction trades people and the on-going need for state houses provides an ideal opportunity for the two agencies to work collaboratively.

“The partnership will enable inmates to gain qualifications and skills they can use when they are released, which in turn should help address the shortage of skilled construction industry workers. The shortage of skilled tradespeople in the industry also means the initiative will not take jobs away from other New Zealanders.

“The Corporation has been recycling older houses for a number of years, following their removal from inner-city development sites. It enables Housing New Zealand to deliver quality housing to communities that may otherwise miss out. Recycled houses are used as part of its Rural Housing Programme or moved to small towns and communities throughout the country.”

Construction of the building yard where the houses will be recycled is about to begin with the first houses set to be on-site by the middle of the year. Housing New Zealand will manage the refurbishment operation, including the transportation of houses and quality checks, while Corrections will provide labour only. Around 90 prisoners are expected to be involved, Maryan Street said.
