Research, Science and Technology Minister Pete Hodgson has welcomed the announcement of government grants for research that will address important issues for children and young people.

The Foundation for Research, Science and Technology is investing $8.1 million in five independent research projects in the third round of its Building an Inclusive Society portfolio. This research contributes to improved social outcomes and achieving or sustaining an inclusive society.

“The focus of this round is helping children and young people to participate and succeed in society,” Pete Hodgson said.

One of the contracts will allow AUT University to continue its ground-breaking Pacific Island Families longitudinal study, the only one of its kind in New Zealand. It has been funded by the Foundation since it began in 2000.

Other successful contracts include the University of Auckland’s work to understand the impacts of social policies on children and young people, and Massey University’s research looking at pathways that bring children and young people into contact with various support agencies, addressing a significant gap in national knowledge.

“Most of the teams doing these projects have strong linkages and collaborations with end users of research, such as government departments and non-governmental organisations, which will ensure that the benefits of the research can be well utilised.

“The Labour-led government is committed to improving the lives of all New Zealand families, and this research will advance our understanding of significant issues facing our children and young people.”
