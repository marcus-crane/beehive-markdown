Four kaumatua who have recently passed away have been acknowledged by the Ministry of Health for their contributions to health in their community.

In honour of the commitment and services to health in their communities, the Ministry of Health has dedicated ‘Te Apa Mareikura Tohu’ to Rongo Wirepa; Ngati Porou, Whanau a Apanui, Rongowhakaata, Anne Delamere; Te Whanau a Apanui, Te Arawa, Denis Simpson; Ngati Awa, Tuhourangi and Bill Katene; Ngati Toa Rangatira.

The name of the new tohu ‘Te Apa Mareikura’ was chosen as it translates to “a distinguished group of leaders recognised at the highest level” and Associate Minister of Health Mita Ririnui says it is a privilege to have an association with the four kaumatua.

“The name Te Apa Mareikura is a fitting name for the tohu, as are the kaumātua who are represented in the tohu. They were all very passionate and dedicated to the health of their people and led a life committed to the promotion of whānau ora and mauri ora.”

Te Apa Mareikura Tohu are part of the Hauora Maori Scholarship programme introduced through Te Kete Hauora; the Maori Health Directorate of the Ministry of Health.

The essential criteria for the tohu includes:

• Involvement with community

• Effective networking with the community

• Leadership in the area of community health

• Demonstrated competencies in community health

In acknowledgement of the whānau of the four kaumātua, the Ministry of Health held a small celebration at Hau Ariki Marae, Martinborough on 14 March 2008.
