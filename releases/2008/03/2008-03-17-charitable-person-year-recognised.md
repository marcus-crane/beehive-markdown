Community and Voluntary Sector Minister, Ruth Dyson has congratulated Berill Michelsen of Nga Wahine Tamariki Punanga O Whakatu - Nelson Women’s and Children’s Refuge Services, on being named the inaugural Telecom Community Connection Charitable Person of the Year.

Berill was presented with her title at a ceremony at Parliament today.

“Berill is someone whose work has changed the lives of many New Zealanders in need and who deserves this special recognition. I am very pleased to be able to present her with this honour to mark her amazing commitment to Women’s Refuge,” said Ruth Dyson.

A member of the Women’s Refuge since the late 1970s, Berill impressed the judges with her longstanding dedication to the cause, her passion for the rights of women and children, and her willingness to take on tasks - from management roles to handling midnight crisis calls.

Berill was nominated for the award by the Nelson Refuge and chosen from amongst a group of outstanding finalists from organisations like St John, IHC and the Red Cross.
