The world’s largest ICT tradeshow, CeBIT, will once again be a great showcase for some of New Zealand’s most innovative technologies, Economic Development Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

Pete Hodgson is leading 15 New Zealand companies to a New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE)-hosted mission at CeBIT in Hannover, Germany – which last year attracted more than 6000 exhibitors from 77 countries, 480,000 visitors and 8000 journalists.

“This is the fourth year that New Zealand companies have travelled to CeBIT, and each year the standard of our presence has been praised by organisers and visitors. I’m delighted to have the opportunity to go to CeBIT this year and see the great work New Zealand technology companies are doing in what is a fiercely competitive global market,” said Pete Hodgson.

CeBIT will have a distinctive Kiwi flavour this year, with the first ever ‘New Zealand Day’ on Thursday 6 March. Created to recognise New Zealand’s inventive technologies and unique culture, New Zealand Day will include presentations from the exhibiting New Zealand companies, a panel discussion and an evening event celebrating New Zealand’s ‘Innovation through Collaboration’.

Pete Hodgson will officially open New Zealand Day, and will also be speaking at an evening event hosted by the Lower Saxony State Prime Minister, Christian Wulff.

“With New Zealand being chosen for CeBIT’s first ever national day, our companies have an even greater opportunity to demonstrate the strengths and capability of our vibrant industry. It will also be a great chance to showcase New Zealand’s culture and lifestyle to a wide audience.”

The New Zealand companies have been supported by NZTE to attend the 2008 CeBIT event. They will have a visible presence there through a New Zealand New Thinking branded pavilion and be able to take advantage of a suite of business matching services and networking opportunities at the show.

New Zealand exhibitors at CeBIT 2008 are: ARANZ Scanning, Author-it, Centruflow, Daestra New Zealand, Fronde Anywhere, Hudson Recruitment, Imarda, Immigration New Zealand, International Telematics, Massive, Next Window, Pivot, Simtrix, Starsoft and VComms.
