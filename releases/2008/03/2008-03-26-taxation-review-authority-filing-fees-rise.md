An order in council signed yesterday raises the fee for filing a notice of claim to the Taxation Review Authority to $400 from 1 April and allows the Authority to waive the fee in certain circumstances.

Current filing fees are $100 in relation to proceedings in the general jurisdiction and $50 in relation to small claims proceeding.

The Authority may waive the filing fee if satisfied that the disputant is unable to pay the fee or the proceeding concerns a matter of genuine public interest and is unlikely to be commenced or continued unless the fee is waived.

Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today that the changes resulted from a Cabinet decision in 2004 to implement a wide range of fee increases and other changes recommended by the Working Party on Civil Court Fees, which reported to the government in late 2003.

“Raising the filing fees relating to the Taxation Review Authority follows a necessary amendment to the Taxation Review Authority Act, which was effected in tax legislation that was enacted in December last year,” Mr Dunne said.
