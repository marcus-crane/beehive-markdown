Spurious claims by National Party MP David Bennett that the Labour-led Government “lacks commitment” to land transport projects in the Waikato region were today rubbished by Transport Minister Annette King.

“I am flabbergasted that David Bennett can fail to see the work, funded by the Government, that is completed, underway, or planned in the Waikato region, “ said Ms King.

“Since 1999, the Government has invested close to $1.2 billion in land transport in the Waikato region. In 2007/08 we forecast to invest a further $200 million. This is a 70 percent increase on what the National Government invested in the region in 1999, when they were in office.”

Ms King said the Government’s commitment to the Waikato region’s infrastructure is further evidenced by a $215 million funding package for the Waikato resulting from a joint officials’ group (JOG) process and announced at Budget 2006.

Recent projects completed include the Mercer to Longswamp 4-laning, the Church to Avalon 4-laning and the Longswamp to Rangiriri safety improvements. The Avalon Drive bypass is currently under construction.

“These projects speak for themselves. The National Government hardly built anything except stonewalls.”

When asked in Parliament today by her Labour colleagues Martin Gallagher MP for Hamilton West, and Sue Moroney MP, whether Land Transport New Zealand had withdrawn funding of two sections of the Waikato Expressway, Ms King said that was not the case.

She said she had been advised by Land Transport New Zealand that funding for the Hamilton and Huntly bypass had never been allocated, and in fact Land Transport New Zealand has not yet received a formal funding application for either project.

“Land Transport New Zealand has asked Transit to go back and have another look at these very high cost projects before it submits a final funding application. This is to ensure we are getting best value for significant amounts of taxpayer money.

I would have thought the National Party would support that – because they always say they want best value for the taxpayer dollar. Or is that all rhetoric?” Ms King said.
