An evaluation of the Envirolink scheme was released today by Pete Hodgson, Minister of Research, Science and Technology.

The Envirolink scheme annually distributes $1.6 million to research organisations to provide regional councils with advice and support for research on identified environmental topics and projects. It was set up following a 2004 evaluation of New Zealand’s environmental research, science and technology system, which found that connections between the science system and regional councils needed to be improved.

“Environlink is an important environmental management and local government scheme, and this evaluation found it is working well and has ushered in a new era of positive relationships between councils and science agencies,” Pete Hodgson said.

“The evaluation found that since 2005, there have been significant positive achievements for participants. The scheme is intended to increase return on investment from environmental research, science and technology, by facilitating uptake by regional councils.”

The scheme aims to support regional councils in two areas of environmental management: adapting management tools to local needs, and translating environmental science knowledge into practical advice.

“A good example of this is the advice Horizons Regional Council sought from AgResearch about future-proofing farmland. The Whole Farm Plan template that they developed is part of the council’s Sustainable Land Use Initiative, which was developed following the flooding in the lower North Island in early 2004.

“The overall message is that Envirolink is successfully achieving increased local government engagement in environmental research.”
