The Multi-Party Working Group on Family Violence is giving its full backing to this year’s Children’s Day.

Thousands of families will take part in events across New Zealand on Sunday March 2nd to see children celebrated, nurtured and treasured by all.

“Children’s Day provides a focus for giving time, praise and encouragement and highlights the importance of valuing children,” said Social Development Minister Ruth Dyson, Chair of the Multi-Party Working Group on Family Violence.

In 2005 the Police recorded 56,380 family violence incidents at which around 65,000 children were present. Partner abuse and child abuse are linked – child abuse cannot be prevented without addressing the violence that goes on between adults in New Zealand families.

“The Multi-Party Working Group supports the community groups and organisations involved in making the day a success, as part of its shared commitment to working together for the well-being of children and families,” said Ruth Dyson.

The Multi-Party Working Group on Family Violence is chaired by Social Development Minister Ruth Dyson and consists of the following Members of Parliament:

- Parekura Horomia, Minister of Maori Affairs,
- Steve Chadwick, Minister of Women’s Affairs, Chairperson of the Open Hearing into the Prevention of Violence against Women and Children
- Jim Anderton, Progressive Party
- Sue Bradford, Green Party
- Heather Roy, ACT Party
- Barbara Stewart, NZ First Party
- Tariana Turia, Maori Party
- Judy Turner, United Future Party

National Party members withdrew from the group in September 2006 and were invited to rejoin in August 2007 but the invitation was declined.

The Group provides an opportunity for political leaders, regardless of allegiance, to send the same message – that New Zealand’s rates of family violence are unacceptable.
