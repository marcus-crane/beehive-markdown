A four-page snapshot of the Maaori tourism sector has been released by Associate Tourism Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

The Maaori Tourism Sector Profile report gives operators the ability to take a ‘big picture’ view of the unique position Maaori tourism holds in the tourism sector.

While Rotorua keeps its reputation as the ‘capital’ of Maaori tourism, with 86 per cent or 396,000 international visitors seeking a unique Maaori experience in the region for the 2005/2006 period, the publication has also identified a growing trend towards other popular spots including Auckland and Canterbury.

“Our indigenous culture is unique to Aotearoa, and this has been shown by the number of visitors who come here to experience Maaori culture,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

“Tourism is an opportunity to share the culture with local and international visitors, so it’s important that it is supported so it can reach its potential.”

Nanaia Mahuta says the publication highlights the Labour-led government’s commitment to providing support for the development of quality Maaori tourism

“The New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015 was launched at the end of 2007 and advocates strongly for the continual building of Maori tourism. The demand for an authentic Maaori product is increasing and there is huge potential to develop the sector,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

The report gives an overview of the size and sector trends, as well as the participation levels of international and domestic visitors. The publication is part of the Ministry’s Tourism Analysis programme which has seen the release of similar snapshot reports on the accommodation and domestic tourism sectors.

“New Zealand delivers a world class visitor experience and the Maaori tourism sector plays a crucial role in the industry because it does offer a unique point of difference,” says Nanaia Mahuta.
