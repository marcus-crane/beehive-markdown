There is no silver bullet solution to the current problems facing the meat and wool sector, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said today.

Jim Anderton told the Meat and Wool NZ annual meeting in Palmerston North that market conditions, the drought, increased environmental scrutiny, and structural challenges were all difficult for sheep and beef farmers.

He said the drought was causing severe damage to farmers’ livelihoods around New Zealand. The Government was working with farmers and industry groups to make sure everything possible was being done to help the sector cope.

Jim Anderton warned sheep and beef farmers that they would eventually face the same environmental scrutiny that dairy farmers faced now.

“It would be a good idea to move earlier rather than later.

“There is some urgency to this. The sheep and beef sector is behind the pace. Community desire for change will only increase over time.

“Your monitor farms have an important role in demonstrating farming practices that can be both profitable for farmers and environmentally sound. The sector needs to be more pro-active about the results of these monitor farms and what you have learned from them.

“I get to see best practice -there are great examples through the sustainable farming fund. We need to make sure more farmers see them too.”

Jim Anderton said he was very encouraged that the meat industry was working together to address some of the longer term issues facing the meat sector.

“I am committed to working with the industry to find a way forward. If either the meat or wool industry decides a so-called mega-merger is the right way to go, then I will be supportive of that.

“But I want to emphasise that a decision on the right structure is up to you. It has to be bankable. The government - at least on my watch - will not be writing out a cheque to pay for industry restructuring.

“New Zealand’s farming community has combined equity of around $45 billion. It therefore should be able to raise capital for restructuring in its own right. If the proposals it comes up with are sound, they will be bankable and you won’t have a problem accessing the capital you need. If they’re not sound, you shouldn’t do it - and neither should the government!”

He said any proposal should be based around a clearly articulated industry strategy.

“Simply changing the structure of the meat industry is unlikely to provide for the long-term sustainable profitability that we all desire. There is a lot more to do.”

Jim Anderton congratulated Meat and Wool NZ on its pledged support to the NZ Fast Forward innovation initiative.

“Fast Forward represents a $700 million commitment by the government to research, development and innovation… the largest single investment in innovation in our history. Including earnings from interest the government’s spend could be as much as $1 billion over the 10 to 15-year term of the plan. This significant Government investment is backed by an equivalent amount of industry funding and we are therefore talking about a $2 billion research and development increase in our most important industry sectors.”

He said the fund would help us to innovate and add value at every step in the chain from the farm gate to the consumer plate.

“New Zealand Fast Forward will shape the development of the pastoral and food sector for decades.

“I believe the long term outlook for the primary sectors is very favourable.

“I want to assure you that I am committed to continuing to work in partnership with the industry to produce the innovation and industry structures we need.”
