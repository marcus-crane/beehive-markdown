Infrastructure businesses like electricity lines companies and airports will gain improved incentives to innovate and invest while giving consumers protection from excessive prices and poor quality, under a Bill amending the Commerce Act introduced to Parliament today.

Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel and Energy Minister David Parker said the [Commerce Amendment Bill](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2008/0201-1/latest/DLM1194512.html) is the culmination of a 22-month review of the price control provisions of the Commerce Act. It amalgamates Parts 4 and 4a of the Act which apply to sectors where there is little or no competition or prospect of competition, such as electricity lines, gas pipelines and now airports. Sectors like this are regulated in all OECD countries.

The Bill introduces a purpose statement specifically for this section of the Act to give clearer guidance to the Courts and the regulator that the aim of regulation is to promote investment.

The main changes are:

- for the first time, a clear emphasis on the importance of incentives for **regulated businesses to invest**
- a requirement for the [**Commerce Commission**](http://www.comcom.govt.nz/) **to clearly set out the regulatory rules** (called input methodologies) applying to these businesses, and to complete this work by 30 June 2010. These rules will be subject to merits review by the High Court. Clearly specifying the rules will greatly improve **certainty and predictability** for businesses and improve business confidence;
- allowing fit-for-purpose regulation, such as information disclosure and a negotiate/arbitrate regime, as **alternatives to full price control**;
- a much simpler and more **predictable regime for electricity lines businesses:**
  
  - removing the threat of relatively heavy-handed regulation for minor breaches of thresholds, and
  - with time limits for Commission decisions;
- a more appropriate regime of **information disclosure** for small locally consumer-owned electricity lines businesses where the customers are essentially the owners of the business. This will **lower their compliance costs** and result in **savings to consumers**;
- an enhanced regime for gas pipelines which enables them to propose a price path to the Commission;
- amore robust information disclosure regime (compared to the [Airport Authorities Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1966/0051/latest/DLM379824.html?search=ts_act_airport%20authorities&sr=1)) for the Auckland, Christchurch and Wellington international airports, with monitoring by the Commerce Commission.

The Bill also includes some tidying up relating to the clearance or authorisation of business mergers, the most significant of which is a new provision to enforce undertakings that are made by parties to the proposed merger.

"We have undertaken extensive consultation with interested parties in developing this Bill, and most stakeholders have warmly welcomed the proposed improvements in certainty and in regulatory processes," Lianne Dalziel said.

"Overall, most regulated businesses should face lower compliance costs because of greater certainty about the rules, and better designed regulatory processes."

David Parker said the Bill represents a particular win for consumer-owned electricity lines companies which were previously subject to onerous and costly rules.

"Now they will only have to disclose information to the Commerce Commission, rather than meet the more demanding requirements faced by commercial electricity lines companies. This is because they're owned by their customers who are therefore less likely to require protection from excessive prices."

"The Bill will be referred to the Commerce Committee for consideration, and I hope that it will be possible to have it passed before the election," Lianne Dalziel said.
