“Maori Television has been a huge success since its launch in 2004. The launch of their second channel – *Te Reo*- is another step in this success,” Minister of Maori Affairs, Parekura Horomia said today.

[*Te Reo*](http://www.tereo.tv/) will better serve the needs of fluent speakers, Māori language learners and full immersion Māori language households.

“In last year’s Budget, we invested $20.1 million in operating funding and $3 million in capital funding for MTS’s Digital Strategy and the establishment of the new channel on the Freeview platform was one component of that Strategy.”

“This is proof of the government’s long term commitment to the success of Maori Broadcasting, and the overall development of Maori in Aotearoa.”

“Broadcasting impacts significantly on individuals, communities, and the wider society. Thus Māori language broadcasting’s support for the increased use of te reo and its extraordinary potential to influence all New Zealanders to value te reo can be all-encompassing.”

“I applaud [Māori Television](http://www.maoritelevision.com/) for being there to accept the challenge of portraying te reo as a living language and for providing a vehicle for the better communication of our collective Maori voice."
