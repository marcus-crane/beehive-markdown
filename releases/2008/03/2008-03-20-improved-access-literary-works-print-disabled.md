Associate Commerce Minister Judith Tizard today announced that new regulations affecting the Copyright Act will provide people who have a print disability greater access to literary and dramatic works.

The Correspondence School Te Kura ā-Tuhi will be able to make copies or adaptations of published literary or dramatic works as their students’ special needs require, a move Judith Tizard says is essential to improve educational facilities for the print disabled.

“The School will be able to modify publications to provide works in Braille or other accessible format without breaching copyright” she said.

The Correspondence School’s role is to provide educational services to students whose learning needs cannot be met by the local provider alone. The Correspondence School is the main provider in New Zealand in this regard and as such requires access to works in a variety of formats.

The amendment to the existing regulations means the Correspondence School becomes the sixth body entitled to do this along with the Christian Ministries with Disabled Trust, New Zealand Radio for the Print Disabled Incorporated, the Royal New Zealand Foundation of the Blind, the University of Auckland and the Wellington Braille Club Incorporated.
