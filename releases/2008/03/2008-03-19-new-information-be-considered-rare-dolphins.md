New scientific information on Hector’s and Maui’s dolphins will be considered as part of a threat management plan on how to protect these dolphins, Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton and Conservation Minister Steve Chadwick said today.

The ministers said that new information has become available since the Government consulted with stakeholders on the plan in September and October last year.

Jim Anderton said the Government would seek comment from stakeholders on the new information over the next four weeks.

“The good news is that there will be more information for the Ministers of Fisheries and Conservation to consider when making their decisions. However, due to the consultation period, it will take another six weeks to get the information and stakeholder comments in front of the Ministers.”

Steve Chadwick said a lot of people were interested in the welfare of these dolphins, and had a stake in the waters that they live in.

“We want to make the threat management plan as transparent as possible, which means making all of the relevant information that Ministers will consider, available for people to comment on.”

The threat management plan attracted 2475 submissions late last year.

MFish and the Department of Conservation will continue to monitor compliance with existing set-net restrictions that are in place to protect Hector’s and Maui’s dolphins.

If a fishing-related incident occurred that required urgent action, the Minister of Fisheries has powers under the Fisheries Act to take action if necessary.
