Exercise Ruaumoko, New Zealand’s biggest ever civil defence emergency management exercise (CDEM), ended this evening.

The Minister of Civil Defence, Rick Barker said that thousands of staff from hundreds of organisations had been involved in planning how the country would respond to a volcanic eruption in Auckland.

“While a detailed report on the exercise will not be completed for some weeks, I can say that the co-operation I have seen between organisations and the work they have done together leaves me sure that Auckland is now better prepared for an emergency," Mr Barker said.

“Through the exercise we have produced common standard operating processes, response plans, evacuation plans, public information and other documents that are the blueprint for responding to an actual eruption should there ever be one.

“The exercise has also led to the wide range of organisations that would be involved if such an event occurred testing how they communicate and work together at local, regional and national levels.

“However, I am also sure that there is no room for complacency.

“We do not hold national exercises like Ruaumoko very often but everyone involved does need to keep reviewing and testing their own preparedness and responses.

“Individuals, households and work places all have roles to play too. If they are not prepared, then the response from civil defence agencies cannot be as effective," Mr Barker said.

The Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management and the Earthquake Commission have public education campaigns. National information is advertised and is also available on websites www.getthru.govt.nz, www.civildefence.govt.nz, and www.eqc.govt.nz

People can also contact the civil defence offices at their local district, city and regional councils for local and regional information.
