Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta said children and young people will benefit from the announcement of government grants for research that will address key issues for New Zealand’s youth.

Nanaia Mahuta welcomed the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology’s announcement that it is investing $8.1 million in five independent research projects.

“I'm pleased the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology has emphasised the importance of research for children and young people,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

Auckland University, Victoria University, AUT University and Massey University will receive funding to support their social research projects, which will focus on social issues affecting young New Zealanders. The research aims to help children and young people take part and are successful in today’s society.

“The more we understand about what it takes for young people to make successful transitions in life, and how we can help them build on their strengths, the better our chances of providing key support for young people in our society,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“I am encouraged that two of the research projects are focussed on Maaori and Pacific youth as there is an urgent need to invest in their success. More so, the recognition of culture and identity issues is a significant and contributing factor in that success.”

Nanaia Mahuta said the multi-million dollar investment highlights the need for youth focussed research.

“The Ministry of Youth Development has been encouraging greater investment in youth focussed research and young people taking part in research projects, and I look forward to the research findings and how they might contribute to future policy.

“This highlights the Labour-led government’s commitment to children and young people because we are committed to ensuring young people have every opportunity to be heard, and to reach their potential,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
