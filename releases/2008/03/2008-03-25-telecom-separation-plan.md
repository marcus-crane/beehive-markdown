Communications and Information Technology Minister David Cunliffe has today received Telecom New Zealand’s revised Separation Plan.

“Telecom NZ has provided me with its revised Separation Plan, which I will now review in terms of the Notice of Requirements I issued on 29 February 2008 and my Determination,” said Mr Cunliffe.

The Minister will not be seeking submissions on Telecom’s revised undertakings.

“In accordance with the Telecommunications Act 2001, I expect to be able to announce my decision to accept or reject Telecom’s undertakings by the Separation Day of 31 March 2008.
