“There is still time to make your views known about how we should deal with dogs in our communities,” says Local Government Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

Nanaia Mahuta says dog owners and those who are not can make their views known.

“Dogs are part of our rural and urban life. Well controlled dogs can work for us, provide companionship and can be an important and well loved part of our families,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

“Uncontrolled dogs however, can be a risk to people and a neighbourhood problem. It is important that dog owners are responsible for their dogs and that people’s safety around dogs is not compromised. “

Nanaia Mahuta says dog safety needs four key requirements;

“Dog safety requires good law, effective enforcement, community support for enforcement and responsible dog ownership,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

“Late last year I released a discussion paper outlining some options to improve dog control and public safety around dogs. Submissions will be received until 31 March, so there is still time for people to look at the discussion paper and make a submission.”

Options include licensing owners, banning certain breeds because of their reputation, mandatory de-sexing of dogs in some circumstances, probationary ownership, dog containment and the destruction of dogs classified as dangerous.

The discussion document Improving Public Safety Under the Dog Control Act 1996, Policy Options is on the Department of Internal Affairs website [www.dia.govt.nz/dogcontrol](http://www.dia.govt.nz/dogcontrol).
