New Zealand is a small nation of four million people located a very long way from Afghanistan. But we have, since 2001, made a contribution to its security stabilization and development. Despite the security challenges we face elsewhere, particularly in our own Pacific neighbourhood, we have led the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Bamiyan Province. We contribute military staff and liaison officers to ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) and UNAMA (United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan). We have deployed our special forces on three occasions, and also contributed air transport and other assets. In recent weeks the New Zealand government has rolled over its commitment to the leadership of the PRT in Bamiyan for a further year - until September 2010. We made those commitments because we have not forgotten that the genesis of this conflict lies in the actions of terrorists who pay no heed to the norms and values of decent, civilized societies. We have not forgotten that we all have a stake in finding solutions to the threat of international terrorism. That is why we are here today.

There has been progress over the past seven years, including in education, health and other fields. But we still face some critical challenges. 

The insurgency has proven resilient. Deep-seated problems persist with governance, human rights, development, justice, corruption, and narcotics. We are pleased to note the tone of realism in the review recently undertaken by the new United States administration, and we appreciate the willingness of the administration to consult with contributors in relation to that review. We need a clear picture of the end-state that our efforts are intended to achieve. We need the right balance between security stabilization on one hand, and development and diplomacy on the other. And we need both to be underpinned by sound, credible, effective government. There must be a serious and genuine attempt to engage those who are prepared to work within the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan rather than attacking it from without.

Afghanistan's neighbours, especially Pakistan, have important roles to play and need encouragement and assistance to do so. We congratulate the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan on setting up, with ISAF, a joint Border Control Centre at the Khyber Pass. This is exactly the sort of cooperation that needs to exist between these two countries.

New Zealand is undertaking a review of our contribution to Afghanistan which will take into account the critical issues discussed here today. We will be looking at what we have achieved in Bamiyan and further afield, and at what we may be able to do in the future. 

A concerted international and regional effort is required and we need to work together. New Zealand is committed to playing its part.
