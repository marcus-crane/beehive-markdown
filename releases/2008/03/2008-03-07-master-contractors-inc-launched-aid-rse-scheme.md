Associate Immigration Minister Shane Jones today launched New Zealand Master Contractors Inc, an initiative to set standards for the horticulture and viticulture industry.

Speaking at the launch at the Trinity Hills vineyard in Hastings, Mr Jones said the new body would help improve workplace practices and culture and would help provide a sustainable working environment for New Zealand and immigrant workers.

Mr Jones commended those within the industry who had worked hard for two years to get to the point of the launch.

“You represent those in your industry who take a long-term view.”

“It is in the interests of all to raise standards. Most importantly, it is in the interests of the horticulture industry to have raised standards to protect the value of your investment, because a lot of money and time can be wasted through poor work practices and poor workplace culture.”

“This initiative is a major contribution to the effective implementation of the Recognised Season Employer (RSE) policy introduced last April to promote stability of labour supply in the horticulture and viticulture industries.”

There were many benefits of New Zealand Master Contractors Inc. They included:

• Improved co-operation amongst contractors

• Increased productivity

• Improved career opportunities, and

• Improved communication and co-ordination

• Standard setting that government and growers can rely on.

The initiative was a great example of a working partnership between government and industry, he said.
