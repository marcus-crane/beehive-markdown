Centenary celebrations for the Buy Kiwi Made campaign kick-off at Parliament on Wednesday with the official start of April’s ‘Buy Kiwi Mad’ month.

“Retailers have really come on board with this promotion, which celebrates the past 100 years of buying New Zealand made and looks forward to the next 100,” says Ms Bradford, Government Spokesperson for Buy Kiwi Made.

“Kiwis have always been passionate about homegrown goods. Buy Kiwi campaigns have included everything from specially-painted locomotives, postage marks, a nationwide walk, street parades, and seaside demonstrations; to today's high-tech television production and multi-media campaign.”

Ms Bradford intends to pay specific tribute to one of the most dramatic buy Kiwi campaigns in the last 100 years; the feat of Esther James, architect, inventor and fashion-model, who was the first person recorded as walking the length of New Zealand. “Esther James walked 1600 miles through New Zealand towns and communities, wearing Kiwi made clothes to focus the nation’s attention on the value of buying Kiwi made,” she says.

Ms Bradford will commemorate Esther James’ arrival at Parliament on April 2 76 years ago, while wearing a replica outfit that has been recreated using today’s materials and techniques.

The Buy New Zealand Made Campaign Ltd, with its kiwi in a triangle logo, also celebrates its 20th birthday this year with a consumer competition as part of the Buy Kiwi Mad month.
