Environment Minister Trevor Mallard today welcomed the start of a pilot scheme for an energy advice helpline providing free, independent professional advice for people wanting to discuss their home energy needs.

The 0800 helpline (0800 388 588) and associated resources were funded by a $125,000 grant from the government's Sustainable Management Fund. It is being piloted in Wellington City, Lower Hutt, Waikanae and Kapiti Coast and will provide impartial, tailored and free advice and information about sustainable energy options (including energy efficiency) to households to help them reduce their energy consumption. The scheme is being run by the Energy Efficiency Community Network.

"This is a valuable project because it raises peoples’ awareness of the various energy options available to them. It will help people recognise the importance of energy efficiency and conservation and the small steps households can take to be more energywise. Being energy efficient is good for the back pocket and can also be a healthy option," Trevor Mallard said.

The project was granted funding to assist with the establishment of national energy advice resources aimed at the community level, including an 0800 advice line, standard energy auditing tools and information packs.

Energy advisers have had a three-day training workshop, designed to provide core training for the pilot, and two levels of information resources are being established to support the centres. They encompass generic information including basic technical information regarding energy efficiency, insulation, heating and renewable energy technologies, as well as current policies operating at a national level. The information resources will also include individualised information focusing on special local knowledge such as local authority rules, local tariffs, prices from energy companies and specific projects operating in local areas.

The free phone number, 0800 388 588, will be operational from today (Monday 31 March).

"The government's Household Sustainability programme and sustainability website (www.sustainability.govt.nz) also has advice on a range of eco-friendly actions. It encourages all New Zealanders to take steps towards becoming sustainable including supporting sustainable businesses and products. Everyone can sign up on the website to take a new step towards sustainability that fits in with their lifestyle," Trevor Mallard said.
