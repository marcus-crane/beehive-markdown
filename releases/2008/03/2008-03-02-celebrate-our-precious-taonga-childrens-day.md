"Today is Childrens' Day, and it is an important day for Kiwi parents to celebrate how important our children are," says Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

Thousands of people have attended hundreds of events planned around the country by local community groups, schools and councils.

"This year's theme is 'new experiences' and it is a wonderful opportunity for mums and dads to spend time with their children, because each child is unique and special," says Nanaia Mahuta.

The first Childrens' Day was held in 2000 and has since become a regular event on the nation's calendar, overseen by a group made up of government and non-government agencies, including Rotary, the Office of the Children's Commissioner, the Families' Commission and Te Puni Kokiri.

Nanaia Mahuta said the Labour-led government is committed to families and young people.

"We know strong families equal strong communities. Our job is to keep supporting New Zealanders and ensure all our families can succeed," said Nanaia Mahuta.

"The Labour-led government continues to invest in the best start to life, through numerous programmes, and providing support to help parents.

"I think the most important message we parents can send our children is to let them know how much they are loved, and that we're there to encourage, support and listen to what they have to say," says Nanaia Mahuta.

"We all live busy lives but giving time to a child is a priceless gift and one they will treasure. Our rangatahi are our future and it's important that they know how valuable and precious they are in our families and within our communities."
