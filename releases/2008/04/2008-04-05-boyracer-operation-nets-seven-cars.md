Courts Minister, Rick Barker has today announced the outcome of a joint operation between Police and Ministry of Justice, aimed at boyracers and collecting outstanding fines.

The operation in Lower Hutt on 3 April saw Bailiffs seize seven cars for warrants for outstanding fines of over $20,000.

"This Government has made it tougher for those who don’t pay their fines, and easier for those who do. Joint operations like this one highlight just how hard we hare making it, and the 7 people who lost their ride on Thursday night will attest to that," Mr Barker said

"One driver paid off the fines owed in full ($430), while the other drivers all had their vehicles seized and will need to make arrangements to pay their fines."

The Minister joined Court Bailiffs and Police to observe the operation and commented on the cooperation between agencies.

"I am always pleased to be able to get out with Collections Bailiffs and see what they are doing on a day to day basis.

"It has become increasingly clear that in many cases the people the Court is interested in, are also of interest to the Police. By working together we make it clear to those with outstanding fines or reparation that they will be found and that they will be made to pay.

"Courts staff and Police regularly carry out operations targeting boy racers, drink drivers and others with unpaid fines. It was pleasing to see first hand the way the two teams worked together.

"The message has to get through that unpaid fines will not go away. Seizing a car is one of the strongest steps we can take and the message was certainly delivered loud and clear on Thursday," Mr Barker said.
