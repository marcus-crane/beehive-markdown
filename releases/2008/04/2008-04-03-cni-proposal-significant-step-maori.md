“The Central North Island forest lands and their role in settlements have been the subject of significant debate over the last decade. This proposal is yet another step in the journey ahead, a step that should be celebrated by all.” Minister of Maori Affairs, Parekura Horomia said today.

Today, Ministers received a proposal from Central North Island Iwi for the use of the Crown forest lands in the Central North Island in historical settlements, at Waihi Marae in Turangi.

“Putting together this proposal has been a big step in the economic development of Central North Island iwi. The proposal puts forward a co-operative approach to economic development for iwi with more than 110,000 members, a chance to build on common strengths”

The forestry industry has been important to Central North Island Maori for a long time. If the proposal receives strong support from the members of the CNI Collective it has the potential to give iwi a much greater ownership stake in forestry industry.

“I would like to congratulate the Collective members for developing a proposal with such potential. Over the next few weeks we will be discussing the fine detail of the proposal with the Collective. If a Deed of Settlement is agreed it will be used in a consultation and ratification process to determine the strength of support for the proposal among iwi members in the CNI.”

“I look forward to completing our work programme and am optimistic that we can reach a good conclusion in the coming weeks.” Mr Horomia said.
