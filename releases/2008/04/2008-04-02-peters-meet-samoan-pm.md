Foreign Minister Winston Peters will meet with Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Lupesoliai Malielegaoi in Apia on Thursday (Friday NZT) for the latest round of annual Joint Ministerial Consultations.

Associate Immigration Minister Shane Jones will also attend the talks.

“Annual consultations began three years ago with the aim of building on the 1962 Treaty of Friendship, which created a unique partnership between New Zealand and Samoa,” Mr Peters said.

“Relations between our two countries have developed significantly since the Treaty was signed, and annual talks ensure that the strength and value of the relationship is reflected in regular contact at Ministerial level.

“Samoa is one of our closest neighbours in the Pacific, and we greatly value the chance to exchange views on a wide range of bilateral and regional issues in a way that can only serve to bring our two countries even closer together,” Mr Peters said.
