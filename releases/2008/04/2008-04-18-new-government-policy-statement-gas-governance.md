Energy Minister David Parker today released the Government’s revised and updated Government Policy Statement (‘GPS’) on Gas Governance.

 The GPS has been revised and updated to be consistent with the New Zealand Energy Strategy and New Zealand Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy, as well as to reflect general changes that have taken place since the last GPS was released in October 2004.

 “Finalising an updated GPS on Gas Governance is one of the many steps the Labour-led government is taking to implement and progress the New Zealand Energy Strategy and the New Zealand Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy since they were launched in October last year,” David Parker said.

 The GPS on Gas Governance sets out the objectives and desired outcomes for consumers, retail arrangements, the wholesaling of gas, infrastructure access, contingency management and other gas matters the government wants Gas Industry Co., as the approved industry body, to pursue and report against. 

 New outcomes have been added in relation to contractual arrangements between gas retailers and small consumers, gas metering, critical contingency management and compliance and dispute resolution processes.  The Government has also requested advice from Gas Industry Co. on the extent to which policies to enhance the direct use of gas in industrial, commercial and residential applications would mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and the likely costs of implementing those policies.

 “Finalising the updated GPS for Gas Governance included the input of a wide range of stakeholders.  Their input has been important to ensure the GPS is relevant and reflects current understandings,” said Mr Parker.
