Health Minister David Cunliffe is delighted at the recruitment of two Paediatric Oncologists for the child cancer service at Wellington Hospital.

“This is great news for the children and parents of the Wellington region who face cancer,” Mr Cunliffe said.

He said that last year he had made it clear to the Board and the former Chairwoman that something had to be done and done quickly.”

Since then we have had a new chair and a crown monitor appointed and now we have recruited two doctors for the Child Cancer service.

“I note that both are considered top appointments and one, Dr Christian Kratz is acknowledged as an international leader in child leukaemia.”

“I look forward to the full resumption at Capital and Coast paediatric oncology services.”
