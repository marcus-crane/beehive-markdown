Education Minister Chris Carter today expressed his profound sympathy for Elim Christian College and its community after the tragic loss of life at Tongariro National Park.

“This has been a shocking event and my thoughts are with the families of these young people who have so sadly lost their lives and with school staff, students and the wider school community,” Chris Carter said.

The Minister will visit the school today and speak with the principal on what support government agencies can provide.

The Ministry of Education’s Trauma Incident Team went into the school at 3.30 this morning and will continue to work with students and teachers for as long as necessary.

“The loss of these young people will be strongly felt by the school and its community but I know they are all pulling together to support each other through this very difficult time.”
