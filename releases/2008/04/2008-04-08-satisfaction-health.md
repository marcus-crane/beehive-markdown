In the first ever survey of New Zealander’s satisfaction with their public services, Health comes out a winner says Health Minister David Cunliffe.

The Public Satisfaction with Service Quality 2007: “The Kiwis Count Survey” which uses Canadian methodology rates public satisfaction with all New Zealand public services as equal to the Canadian public sector.

“Health is one of the top performers in the first all of Government survey when it comes to competency of staff and being treated fairly.Health also scores very well when it comes to measuring whether consumers felt their individual circumstances were being taken into account and whether people felt they were getting good value for their tax dollar.”

Mr Cunliffe said Health also scored above the satisfaction figure of 68 per cent for the entire New Zealand public service.

“Importantly it also shows that people believe their tax dollars are being spent wisely with health receiving the highest rating of all public services for value for money.

The national average of those who believed their tax dollars were spent wisely was 55 percent across the services. However, Health received a 70 percent approval rating for good value for tax dollars spent.

“This shows as far as the health consumer is concerned our Health system is perceived as efficient, caring and value for money. While there is always room for improvement this shows that National’s constant yapping about system failure and wastage do not match the real-life experience of most ordinary New Zealanders.”
