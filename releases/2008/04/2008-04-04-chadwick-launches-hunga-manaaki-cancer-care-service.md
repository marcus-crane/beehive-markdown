Associate Health Minister Steve Chadwick today launches the [Hunga Manaaki cancer care service](http://www.lakesdhb.govt.nz/Article.aspx?ID=4641) pilot programme in Rotorua.

The hospital-based cancer support service is aimed at reducing inequalities faced by Maori cancer sufferers in Rotorua. This pilot programme, one of three nationally, also aims to evaluate whether community-level support services for Maori cancer patients and their whanau can be effective in increasing uptake of cancer treatment services by this group.

"Maori are 18 percent more likely to be diagnosed with cancer than non-Maori, but nearly twice as likely to die from the condition. That is why these pilot programmes are so important - they will assist in reducing these numbers and providing a better and more culturally appropriate service for Maori."

"Being able to access health services and the support services that make the cancer journey a little bit easier, can have a real impact on health outcomes," said Steve Chadwick.

"Having assistance to use the many services available will improve quality of life for both cancer patients and their whanau. That's what this programme aims to do.”

The total cost of the three-year Hunga Manaaki community cancer service is $444,240. The other two pilot projects are:

• Tamaki PHO pilot which is also a community-level cancer support service aimed at reducing inequalities faced by Maori with respect to cancer in South Auckland and

• The West Coast PHO pilot which is a community-level cancer support service aimed at reducing inequalities faced by the rural community on the West Coast with respect to cancer.

All three pilots will be independently evaluated.

“I am pleased to see that the specific issues that arise for Maori with cancer in our community are to be addressed by this dynamic project.”
