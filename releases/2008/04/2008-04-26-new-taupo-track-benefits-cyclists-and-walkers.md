Conservation Minister Steve Chadwick today opened a new mountain bike track near Taupo which will run from Whakaipo Bay to Kinloch.

 

Known as the ‘W2K’, the track was funded and developed by a local community group, Bike Taupo. 

 

“I congratulate Bike Taupo for their ambitious vision and determination. They are a superb example of what a supportive, involved and committed community group can achieve,” Steve Chadwick said.

 

Bike Taupo is a cycling advocacy group who promote cycling as a healthy**, environmentally friendly and convenient form of transport.  The group is working towards Taupo becoming the most cycle-friendly town in New Zealand.** 

 

**The group relies on volunteers and sponsorship and was runner-up in the 2007 Trustpower National Community Awards, which celebrates volunteers and their considerable work in communities.**

 

**“I would like to thank Bike Taupo for their tremendous efforts – their group demonstrates the passion that is at the heart of many achievements carried out by ordinary everyday New Zealanders.”**

 

**The W2K track is a shared cycle and walking track that, once completed, will cover 20km.**

 

“This Labour-led government’s Healthy Eating Healthy Action programme encourages people to enjoy physical activity as part of their lifestyle, so it is wonderful to open this facility for cyclists and walkers.”
