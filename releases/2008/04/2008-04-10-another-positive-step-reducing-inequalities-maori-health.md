“The implementation of the Maori Health Advisory Committee will provide yet another layer of understanding the specific and the often complex cultural needs of Maori to our ever improving health services” said Associate Health Minister Mita Ririnui at the launching of the Maori Health Advisory Committee of The Royal Australasian College of Paediatricians today.

The Maori Health Advisory Committee will provide advice and expertise to the Royal Australasian College of Paediatricians for physicians and paediatricians on cultural competency in an aim to advance the reduction of inequalities and disparities in Maori health.

“There are already many kaupapa Maori health services operating within our communities who are working well with our people, and are improving the health status of Maori.”

“The opportunity to have specialists with knowledge and understanding of te reo, whanaungatanga, whakapapa and rangatiratanga working within the health sector can only have a positive impact on Maori health. It is very exciting and I am very pleased that The Royal Australasian College of Paediatricians have taken this significant step.”

Launched today at Te Papa Tongarewa, along with New Zealand representatives of the College, the official ceremony was also attended by a group of Australian physicians and Australian representatives.

The Maori Health Advisory Committee is chaired by Dr. Leo Buchanan, a senior paediatrician for the Royal Australasian College of Paediatricians. The committee will receive an official title within the coming months.
