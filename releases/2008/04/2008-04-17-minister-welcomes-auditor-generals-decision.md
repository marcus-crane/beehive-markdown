Health Minister David Cunliffe today welcomed the decision by the Auditor- General not to investigate the affairs of the former Hawke’s Bay District Health Board any further. 

“After an earlier Auditor- General Office report in 2007 and an independent review panel report for the Director General of Health , it is time for the Commissioner Sir John Anderson and his team to be allowed to get on with the job of turning this District Health Board around.“

“It is important to note that the independent review panel report published last month found that the former Board did not even meet basic tests of good governance .“

“I think that the failures over the conflicts of interest inside the former Board have now been thoroughly investigated .I am confident that Sir John Anderson is now ensuring Hawke’s Bay Health services get a fresh start.”

“In addition the Ministry of Health is ensuring the panel’s recommendations are being considered and implemented in all DHBs.” said David Cunliffe.

“I am also pleased that the Auditor General’s office is going to work with the Ministry of Health in line with those recommendations and support their implementation”.
