Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Ruth Dyson is reminding the public of the changes to tax rules on charitable giving which came into effect 1 April.

“These changes will be a real boost to those organisations and the communities they work with,” said Ruth Dyson.

By removing rebate thresholds, the Labour-led government is providing incentives for the public to donate more.

New Zealanders are already generous with time, money and in-kind donations. In 2006, New Zealanders donated over $356 million to charities and other non-profit organisations. This tax change is a way for the government to support and encourage that generosity.

“This can only be good news for charities and other non-profit organisations.

“These organisations provide valuable services and support in a wide range of areas including education, social services, and health. This is yet another way that the Labour-led government is helping to deliver the best possible outcomes to individuals, families and communities.”
