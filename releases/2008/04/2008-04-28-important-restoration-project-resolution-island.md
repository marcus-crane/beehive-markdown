A 19th century conservationist will soon have his dream realised when work starts on the removal of all stoats from Resolution Island in Fiordland National Park, Conservation Minister Steve Chadwick said today.

“One hundred years after Richard Henry, New Zealand’s first conservation officer, left Resolution Island, the Department of Conservation (DOC) is laying 2500 traps, in a bid to fulfil the wildlife ranger’s vision,” Steve Chadwick said.

“With stoat eradication on Secretary Island nearing completion, this provides two substantial life-rafts for Fiordland’s threatened species to establish healthy populations.”

In 2004 the Labour-led government announced $7 million to restore Secretary and Resolution islands in Fiordland, two of New Zealand’s largest off-shore islands.

The massive eradication programme – a key step in the restoration of Resolution Island, will start in July following positioning of the traps.

Stoat eradication from an island this size will provide protection to many species vulnerable to introduced predators. Based on previous experience of island eradications, it is anticipated that the vast majority of stoats will be removed within the first few weeks of trapping.

“This is another significant step in helping to ensure the survival of New Zealand’s precious and unique birds.  People will soon be able to enjoy the islands as they once were, before the arrival of stoats.

“Richard Henry led the way for us – these island eradication programmes are modern examples of the conservation work he pioneered.”
