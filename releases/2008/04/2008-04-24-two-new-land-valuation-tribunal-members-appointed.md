**Background on Land Valuation Tribunals**

Under section 19(2) of the Land Valuation Proceedings Act 1948, Land Valuation Tribunals are constituted at a number of locations around the country.  There are currently 19 tribunals. 

Each tribunal consists of a District Court Judge, appointed as the Chairperson of the Tribunal; and 2 other members, one or both of whom shall be valuers registered under the Valuers Act 1948.

Tasked with determining the value of land under a number of Acts, Land Valuation Tribunals hear a range of expert evidence regarding valuation.  The function of the valuer-members is to bring critical analysis to the evidence and enable the Tribunal to make a decision based in sound valuation practice. Members are appointed by the Governor-General for a term not exceeding six years, and are eligible for reappointment.
