Canterbury’s leadership in some areas of environmental sustainability is an example for other provinces to follow, Environment Minister Trevor Mallard said today at the Living Here sustainable partnership forum in Christchurch.

"In February, I visited Untouched World to personally congratulate it for being the first fashion company in the world to gain permission from UNESCO to carry the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development logo," Trevor Mallard said.

"Awards such as this are helping Canterbury develop a reputation for embracing environmental sustainability. Christchurch is also the only New Zealand city which officially participated in the hugely successful Earth Hour which encouraged everyone to turn off their lights for an hour. Normal electricity usage in Christchurch was reduced by over 12 per cent in that designated hour.

"This Labour-led government wants to make New Zealand a world leader of smart, innovative responses to environmental issues and to have our businesses recognised for taking sustainable actions.

"Educating our business sector about sustainable practices they can implement within their organisation is a step towards this, which is why the Labour-led government is proud to support initiatives such as this forum.

"Sustainability is one of the most important issues facing modern society and business in particular. Consumers are more informed and aware of the damage being done to our environment and ways we can help prevent it. The growing number of people that place a premium on buying sustainable products is having a real impact on the market.

"The government's Household Sustainability programme and sustainability website ([www.sustainability.govt.nz](http://www.sustainability.govt.nz)) encourage all New Zealanders to take steps towards becoming sustainable including supporting sustainable businesses and products. Everyone can sign up on the website to take a new step towards sustainability that fits in with their lifestyle. The website also has advice on a range of eco-friendly actions," Trevor Mallard said.

The day long Canterbury Living Here sustainable partnership forum – led by Environment Canterbury – brought together a range of businesses, community groups and environmental educators to share information, build partnerships and take action against climate change.
