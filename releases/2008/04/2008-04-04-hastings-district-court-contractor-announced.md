Courts Minister, Rick Barker today announced that Argon Construction Limited has been awarded the construction contract to build the Hastings courthouse.

“I am pleased to advise the appointment of Argon Construction to carry out the project which involves the construction of a brand new courthouse which will include a list court, a family court, a multi-use court, a 150m2 jury capable court, a mediation room and a hearing room,” Mr Barker said.

“This project is part of the government's wider building programme aimed at delivering first class justice services to New Zealanders.

"Argon have a history of working in Hawke's Bay and are the contactors behind a number of projects, including the iconic Villa Maria winery and Cape Kidnappers lodge.

“The new 3450m2 courthouse will be located on an adjoining site to the existing courthouse and will include five new judges chamber’s and dedicated spaces for justices of the peace and coroners.

“Extensive site works and landscaping will also be carried out as part of the redevelopment.

“The new spacious and modern courthouse has been designed to meet the needs of the local community now and in the future. It will have significantly more space than is currently provided in the Hastings courthouse. It will have advanced security systems and will be capable of supporting the latest technology including video conferencing and evidence recording services,” Mr Barker said.

Construction on the project is scheduled to begin this month and is expected to be completed by August 2009.
