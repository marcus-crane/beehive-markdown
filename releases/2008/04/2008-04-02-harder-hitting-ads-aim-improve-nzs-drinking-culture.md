New harder hitting television advertisements showing the harm that can be caused by binge drinking were launched today by Associate Health Minister Damien O’Connor.

The three ads, which screen from this Sunday, form part of the Alcohol Advisory Council of New Zealand’s (ALAC’s) ongoing programme designed to change New Zealand’s unhealthy drinking culture.

Mr O’Connor said the ads may be shocking and a step up from ALAC’s previous binge drinking ads but the sad reality is the things they demonstrate are happening every week in New Zealand.

"I know a lot of people will be shocked by these ads but we make no apologies. This is the reality of alcohol abuse.

“We are seeing too many examples of the harm that alcohol abuse can cause. New Zealand's drinking culture must change so that drunkenness is no longer socially acceptable. These new ads are part of a broad programme to help bring about this change.”

Mr O’Connor said the Labour-led government is committed to combating this issue.

“As we all know, crime, particularly violence, is often fuelled by alcohol. Police are taking an increasingly tough stance on policing alcohol breaches and we are also attempting to change attitudes and behaviour around excessive drinking.

“We want these ads to make people think about the harm they can cause their friends, family and themselves through poor choices they make due to excessive drinking.

“We hope people will reflect on the messages contained in the ads and relate them to their own perspectives and experiences, in turn changing harmful drinking habits,” said Mr O’Connor.
