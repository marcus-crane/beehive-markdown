Health Minister David Cunliffe and Associate Health Minister Steve Chadwick are pleased to announce that a Family Violence Death Review Committee is to be established, with the aim of reducing family violence and family violence deaths.

Cabinet has approved funding of $1.33 million until 2010 for the Committee, which will report to the Health Minister, and Associate Health Minister who has specific responsibility for family violence.

“The overarching goal of the Committee will be to contribute to the prevention of family violence and family violence deaths,” said David Cunliffe.

“It is a serious problem and one New Zealand as a whole needs to come together to address.

“This Committee will be charged with identifying the contributing factors to family violence deaths. They will also recommend any changes to policy or services which may assist with the prevention of family violence.”

The Committee will identify trends, provide information to researchers, review circumstances surrounding deaths, conduct specific reviews of clusters/subgroups of family violence deaths and participate in local family violence death reviews.

"This is a problem which manifests itself across all areas of New Zealand society, and as such, we need all New Zealanders to take responsibility for it,” Steve Chadwick said.

The Committee will be made up of eight members, and nominations for inaugural members have been called for.
