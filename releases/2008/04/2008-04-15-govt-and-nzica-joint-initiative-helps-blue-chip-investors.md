Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel today announced that the Companies Office is collaborating with the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (NZICA) to provide a freephone number to connect Blue Chip investors with chartered accountants who will give individual investors one hour's free advice.

"Many investors who've been caught up in the Blue Chip liquidations feel they don't know who they can trust or where they can go for good advice. This initiative involves a professional body stepping up to the plate and partnering with government to offer assistance. The response from [NZICA](http://www.nzica.com//AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home1) members has been overwhelming, with more than 230 members already offering assistance.

"I congratulate the NZICA members who have made this very generous offer to help people in financial distress."

The [Companies Office](http://www.companies.govt.nz/cms) has set up a freephone service that will be able to match callers to an NZICA member in their region who has volunteered to provide an hour's consultation on their Blue Chip situation at no charge.

"Investors' circumstances are different. Some have more urgent needs than others. This initiative enables people to get some initial professional guidance specific to their individual situation," Lianne Dalziel said. If investors wished to engage the NZICA member for further advice it would be on a regular commercial basis as agreed between the client and the accountant.

Many investors will have already sought independent advice and will not need to call the freephone number, Lianne Dalziel said.

"At this stage the initiative is aimed only at investors of any of the Blue Chip companies that are now in liquidation, and particularly at those people who are in serious straits and in need of immediate financial advice."

The freephone number was an initiative of the Commerce Minister in consultation with Blue Chip Liquidator Jeff Meltzer and NZICA. Investors seeking help should call freephone 0508 197 510 during office hours, although the service will be available this evening (15 April) until 7.30pm.
