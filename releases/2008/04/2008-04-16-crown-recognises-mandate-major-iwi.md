The Crown has recognised the mandate of Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Porou to represent Ngāti Porou in the negotiation of all their historical Treaty of Waitangi claims, Treaty Negotiations Minister Michael Cullen announced today.

The recognition follows careful consideration of Ngāti Porou’s mandating process, submissions received in response to public notification, and consideration of the views expressed by submitters.

“I would like to congratulate Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Porou on the thorough processes they have used to demonstrate the strength of their support,” Dr Cullen said.

“In addition to numerous hui, the Rūnanga ran a postal ballot in which the vast majority of several thousand valid votes were in support of their mandate. This gives the Rūnanga a strong position in which to begin negotiations.

“As part of the public notification and submissions process, the Crown received 35 submissions regarding the Rūnanga’s mandate.

“A number of themes came through these submissions, which I believe are being addressed as we work towards negotiations. The Crown recognises the importance to many people of having their histories told. I am keen to explore ways this can be achieved through negotiations with the Rūnanga.”

Ngāti Porou joins an increasing number of iwi entering into settlement negotiations, and will shortly begin discussions over the Terms of Negotiation.

The Crown recently signed Terms of Negotiation with Ngāti Makino and Waitaha, and is in the process of developing them with Ngāi Tuhoe.
