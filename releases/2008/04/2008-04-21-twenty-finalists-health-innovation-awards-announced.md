Twenty finalists have been chosen out of nearly 130 entrants in the New Zealand Health Innovation Awards.

Maori and Pacific peoples, people with emphysema, and spinal cord injury patients are among those benefiting from clever thinking by the 20 Health Innovation Awards finalists announced today.

The 2008 New Zealand Health Innovation Awards (HIA) recognise individuals and organisations developing new and innovative approaches to delivering better health services.

Minister of Health David Cunliffe said innovations included a healthy lifestyle nursing service for Maori and Pacific peoples in Hawke’s Bay, a new ventilation system for people with emphysema and other respiratory diseases in Canterbury and helping those with a spinal cord injury express their sexuality.

 Five finalists are from the Auckland region, five from Wellington, three from Waikato, two from Canterbury, two from Hawke’s Bay, two from the West Coast and one from Timaru.

“The New Zealand Health Innovation Awards are gaining momentum because people recognise we showcase the cutting edge developments within our health services,” Mr Cunliffe said.

“This year we’ve had nearly 130 entries. This shows once again that New Zealanders excel when it comes to thinking up unique, workable solutions.”

 ACC Minister Maryann Street said  "I am pleased ACC is working with the Ministry of Health to celebrate original thinking and use this energy and creativity to improve the health and rehabilitation of New Zealanders."

The HIA, a joint endeavour of the Ministry of Health and the Accident Compensation Corporation, were started in 2003. In 2008, there are eight categories.

This year’s HIA winners will be announced at the HIA expo and gala dinner held on October 16 at the Wellington Town Hall.

 The complete list of finalists is attached. Further information about the HIA is
