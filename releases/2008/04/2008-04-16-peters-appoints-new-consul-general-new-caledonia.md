New Zealand’s next Consul-General to New Caledonia will be career diplomat Simon Draper, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

Mr Draper will also be accredited to French Polynesia, and Wallis and Futuna.

“New Zealand and the French Pacific Territories share a significant trading relationship,” Mr Peters said.

“We have also been working closely in a number of important areas such as conservation, scientific research and health,” Mr Peters said.

Mr Draper joined the Foreign Ministry in 1991. He has previously been posted to Korea and Italy, and is currently director of the Office of the Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

He takes up his appointment in August, replacing Eleanor Thomson, who returns to Wellington.
