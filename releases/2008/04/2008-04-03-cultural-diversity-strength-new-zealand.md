New Zealand First Deputy Leader Peter Brown’s comments today on latest statistics on the Asian population in New Zealand are a nonsense, Minister for Ethnic Affairs Chris Carter said.

Speaking from Viet Nam, where Mr Carter is leading an education mission to secure business for New Zealand education providers, Mr Carter said it was disappointing that while so many Kiwis embraced and enjoyed the many cultures and cultural events of different ethnic groups, Mr Brown remained out of touch with multicultural New Zealand.

“For instance, Chinese New Zealanders have been in this country since the gold rush days.

They have worked hard to contribute both economically and culturally, and I for one really value that," Chris Carter said.

“The New Zealand Chinese community has an extremely low crime rate, and Chinese language students are a major contributor to New Zealand’s economy”.

Mr Carter said that New Zealand immigration policies were designed to ensure we get the best people for New Zealand, and that other countries were increasingly following our approach.

“It is important we promote unity, not division, and value all members of our communities and their contribution to our national identity.”
