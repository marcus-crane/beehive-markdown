Minister of Health, Mr David Cunliffe said he was disappointed at the lack of progress in today’s talks on the Junior Doctor’s pay claims.

 

“I support the view that a broad based approach is needed to find a sustainable clear long-term pathway for improving conditions for junior doctors”.

 

“I am advised that RDA claims are still well out of line with other settlements in the health sector”,

 

“I call on both sides to reconsider their positions and to recommence discussions in advance of the planned strike” said Mr Cunliffe
