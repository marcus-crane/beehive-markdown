ANZAC Day is a day where New Zealand as a nation commemorates the courage and sacrifice of veterans of all conflicts, says Pacific Island Affairs Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

 “Today we honour the fallen and those who never returned to their homes and families, and remember the service and sacrifice of those who returned, although often not unscathed.

 “It is also very important to commemorate and remember our Pacific people who have served in various campaigns around the world.

 “Soldiers from the Cook Islands, Niue, Samoa, Tonga and Fiji served with the Maori Pioneer Battalion in World War One, many fighting in the Battle of the Somme.  Pacific soldiers from the Cook Islands and Niue also served in D-Company of the 28th Maori Battalion during World War Two.

 “Today we honour these Pacific men and all other veterans, and reflect on the sacrifices of those who fought for our country,” Laban said.
