Eleven special environmental events and projects around the country have been awarded grants so far as part of the lead-up to New Zealand's first ever hosting of World Environment Day on June 5, Environment Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

"It is great to see communities, organisations and individuals getting behind World Environment Day 2008 and helping to make New Zealand’s hosting of the event a memorable one," Trevor Mallard said.

"This is the first time New Zealand has hosted the United Nations Environment Programme event since its establishment in 1972 – and Wellington is the host city. The World Environment Day theme this year is ‘Working Towards a Low Carbon Economy’. As well as a formal programme, community events around the country are also being planned.

"A number of events throughout New Zealand have already been confirmed and planning is underway for these over the next two months. The first round of funding sees grants totalling around $171,000 going out. A second round of funding for more community events will follow shortly.

"The community events to be funded so far include a Weed Swap – where the public can swap weeds for native plants in Wellington’s Civic Square; a celebratory expo/auction and promotion of sustainable transport by Environment Canterbury in Christchurch; a community-wide tree planting project in Raglan; and a carbon crusade in Hamilton where people run or walk a 4km circuit, each planting trees about 2km in.

"In addition to this, Conservation Volunteers New Zealand will be arranging for non-traditional volunteers (i.e. travellers, backpackers and corporate staff volunteers) to implement a range of practical conservation projects and activities in Auckland, Wellington, West Coast, Punakaiki and Hokitika," Trevor Mallard said.

"The interest that councils, business, communities, interest groups and schools have displayed in World Environment Day 2008 highlights New Zealand’s increasing focus on the importance of the environment and stimulating eco-friendly actions. I encourage more people to get on board to mark this important internationally recognised annual event,” said Trevor Mallard.

This will be done by providing opportunities to view the unique biodiversity associated with wetlands (lakes and peat bogs), show the benefits to agriculture, demonstrating the ability of soaks, gullies and riparian margins to filter catchment runoff and convert nitrate to gaseous forms of nitrogen. Speakers will address these issues and participants will be transported by public transport.
