The Mauao Historic Vesting Bill is reaching the last leg of its journey to delivering the Mauao Historic Reserve back to Tauranga Moana iwi.

 

“Mauao is an important taonga to te iwi o Tauranga Moana and I am pleased that the Bill has progressed through the Maori Select Committee with its full support” said Minister of State Mita Ririnui in regards to the Mauao Historic Vesting Bills second reading in the House yesterday.

 

When submissions were made in regards to the Mauao Vesting Bill in Tauranga earlier in the year, submitters gave overwhelming support of the Bill but did express some concern around some of its wording and the way in which the Crown’s ongoing role was explained.

 

After the submissions hearing, Minister Ririnui sought council with the Maori Affairs Select Committee to make amendments. These amendments were presented to the House during the second reading.

 

The House heard yesterday that the key changes to the Bill were the deletion of clause 7 and the inclusion of its intent in a new clause 8.

 

According to the Minister, the fee simple estate will transfer to the trustees – Mauao Trust on behalf of Tauranga Moana iwi – who will hold the title; protect and preserve the mauri of Mauao; and facilitate the maintenance of the natural, physical and cultural integrity of Mauao under their Trust Deed.

 

The existing management by the Tauranga City Council will continue, as appointed by the Minister of Conservation under Reserves Act to manage, control and administer the reserve.

 

Tauranga Moana iwi and the Council have recently signed a memorandum of understanding which also provides for a new relationship with the Mauao Trust and the involvement of the trustees in the governance and management of Mauao.
