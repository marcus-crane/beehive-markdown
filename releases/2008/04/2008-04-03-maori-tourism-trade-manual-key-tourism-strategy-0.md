A new manual showcasing 100 Maori tourism businesses will set a quality benchmark for the future of Maori Tourism, says Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor.

Damien O’Connor this week launched the New Zealand Maori Tourism Trade Manual 2008-2009, which showcases Maori businesses with proven track records in delivering quality and authentic products.

Damien O’Connor says Maori tourism priorities and Maori cultural values are included throughout the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015.

“The Strategy is underpinned by two key values – kaitiakitanga (guardianship) and manaakitanga (hospitality).

“Welcoming our visitors with mutual respect and sharing our knowledge, stories and beliefs in the spirit of kaitiakitanga (guardianship) and manaakitanga (hospitality) will ensure the experience offered by local Maori businesses is world class and will benefit our visitors and our communities,” says Damien O’Connor.

Associate Tourism Minister Nanaia Mahuta says the new Maori Tourism Trade Manual is a milestone and establishes the unique point of difference Maaori contribute to Aotearoa/New Zealand Tourism.

“This manual is an entrée to high quality Maaori tourism products and experiences that profile the special character of culture and values unique to Maaori people,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

A recent ‘sector profile’ on Maori Tourism released by the Ministry of Tourism, estimates that around one in five (455 000) of all adult international tourists to New Zealand visited a Maori cultural tourism experience in 2006.

“When statistics suggest visitor numbers at that level, it tells us that Maaori tourism continues to grow an added value to the New Zealand tourism industry,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

“The future of Maaori tourism looks bright and I look forward to many more operators and visitors benefiting from this Maaori tourism trade manual.”
