Legislation that updates New Zealand's copyright law to ensure that we keep up to speed with recent advances in digital technology passed its third and final reading in the House today by a vote of 111 to 10, announced the Associate Commerce Minister Judith Tizard.

“The Copyright (New Technologies) Amendment Bill forms part of the Labour-led government’s wide-ranging reform of [intellectual property law in general](http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/StandardSummary____14644.aspx),” said Judith Tizard.

This work supports the government’s goals of promoting innovation, creativity and economic growth, meeting the needs of business, providing greater clarity and certainty over the scope and enforcement of intellectual property rights, taking account of international practice, and complying with New Zealand’s international obligations.

“A robust, up to date intellectual property rights regime is an essential part of an innovative, growing economy,” said Judith Tizard.

The Bill will update and clarify how copyright applies to new technologies in today’s digital environment, promote a modern legal framework that guides the protection and use of copyright material, ensure the effective operation of the Act in the face of emerging technologies, and ensure that the Copyright Act remains fair and effective in the face of emerging needs of a dynamic and technology-supporting economy.

“The Bill will maintain the balance between protection, access and use already established in the original Act,” said Judith Tizard.
