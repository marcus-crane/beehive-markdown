Changes to the information notice that motor vehicle traders must provide to consumers, when selling used cars, were announced today by Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard.

“After reviewing whether the current Supplier Information Notice (SIN) regulations are meeting the needs of consumers and the motor industry, government has approved changes to improve the information on the notice,” said Judith Tizard.

From 1 July 2008 motor vehicle traders will need to complete and display the new Consumer Information Notice (CIN) when they are selling a used motor vehicle.  The CIN will replace the current Supplier Information Notice (SIN).

“The renaming the supplier information notice, to Consumer Information Notice, highlights the fact that the information is meant for the consumer’s consideration.  The changes will also make it easier for traders to complete the form.”

The new CIN will provide clearer information to consumers about the year a car was first registered in New Zealand on the motor vehicle register.  The cash price must include the on road costs of the vehicle and it will be easier to see if there is any security interest over the vehicle.

Information will now also be provided on whether the vehicle has a radio receiver capable of receiving broadcasts in the range of 88 to 108 MHz without the use of a band expander.

Another change is that now both motor vehicle traders and consumers will be required to sign the CIN.  This serves to draw attention to the information provided to consumers.

Consumer rights information on the back of the CIN has been revised to make it more readable.  Information has been rearranged to bring attention to things consumers need to consider before the vehicle is purchased.  Post sale advice is now also offered.

“Buying a car is often one of the biggest purchases a consumer will make.  They need accurate and easily understood information to help with their purchasing decisions.”

“The Labour-led government wants to make sure that the best information is provided to help consumers making vehicle purchases.  These changes will help them with this,” said Judith Tizard.

The changes follow extensive consultation, over the last two years, on improving the operation of the Motor Vehicle Sales Act and its associated regulations.

“The improvements announced today are an example of government consulting with industry and consumers to make sure legislation is kept up-to-date and relevant,” said Judith Tizard.

The CIN requirements are set out in the new Consumer Information Standards (Used Motor Vehicles) Regulations 2008.
