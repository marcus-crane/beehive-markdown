Justice Minister Annette King has announced appointments to a new Criminal Justice Advisory Board that will advise justice sector ministers on further improvements to the criminal justice system.

The board will be chaired by former Secretary for Justice David Oughton. The other members of the board will be Margaret Eames, Nigel Hampton QC, Judge Margaret Lee, Major Campbell Roberts, Valery Sim and Lynette Stewart (brief biographical details attached).

Ms King says the board is being established in response to a report by Ombudsman Mel Smith, Investigation into issues involving the administration of criminal justice, which he presented to Prime Minister Helen Clark on 30 November 2007. In his report Mr Smith called for the restoration of public and political confidence in the criminal justice sector, and a more rational and informed public debate about the criminal justice system.

“Establishing a Criminal Justice Advisory Board is the most effective response to the Ombudsman’s underlying concerns”, Ms King said.

The Board will:

- Help develop greater public consensus on what issues are important in terms of bolstering confidence in the criminal justice system
- Give justice sector ministers high level informal advice about issues facing the criminal justice system;
  
  bring a range of perspectives on further improvements to the criminal justice system
- Provide a sounding board for justice sector ministers to have an ongoing discussion about criminal justice priorities
- Help facilitate constructive community dialogue about criminal justice issues and solutions.

“The appointees are all highly respected people who reflect the diversity of the community, and who will bring a range of skills and perspectives to the board. I look forward to working with the board and the fresh approach it will bring to criminal justice issues.”
