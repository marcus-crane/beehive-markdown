Justice Minister Annette King says the Government is drafting a Legal Services Amendment Bill to ensure victims do not face any additional stress during the processing of legal aid grants.

 Speaking at a Sensible Sentencing Trust forum in Wellington today, Ms King said the Bill will ensure that victims of crime (those affected by an alleged or committed offence) involved in Coronial Inquests and Parole Board hearings will not be subject to financial eligibility tests, or need to repay legal aid grants when they need to be represented by a lawyer.

 “The Bill will also enable the Legal Services Agency to write off legal aid debt for victims at the time legal aid is granted.”

 “I intend to introduce this new Bill in May and I hope that it will be passed soon after.”
