[![The types of RCDs affected by the recall ](/sites/default/files/styles/embed_medium/public/images/RCD%20recall.jpg?itok=9XJ0z-5J)](/media/283)

Associate Energy Minister Harry Duynhoven is alerting people who have bought two specific types of PDL POWERGUARD branded Residual Current Devices (RCDs) to note a voluntary recall which has taken place over recent weeks.

“The faulty RCDs may not provide protection against fire or electric shock, which could result in serious harm or fatality if a faulty electrical appliance is connected to them,” Harry Duynhoven said.

The RCDs were sold throughout New Zealand between March 2007 and January 2008 and affects RCDs with the Batch Code 0507 and branded:

- PDL POWERGUARD Vertical Switched Socket - PDL Cat: 691RCD30WH
  
  and
- PDL POWERGUARD Rewireable Cord-set - PDL Cat: 955RW; 953/15; 954; 955; 955/10; NT955BULK; 956.

Homeowners should check the batch code on all PDL RCDs that have been purchased or installed in the last 12 months.

“If you find the 0507 batch code you should stop using the RCD immediately. Even if it appears to operate correctly, don’t use it. Call the free phone number 0800 735 326.

“I am concerned that people who may have bought these faulty RCDs are still not aware of the recall despite the considerable advertising to date,” Harry Duynhoven said.

The products from the 0507 batch code will be replaced free of charge by contacting:

- Free Phone: 0800 735 326 between 8.00am and 8.00pm
- Free Fax: 0800 739 939
- E-mail: [rcdsafety@nz.schneider-electric.com](mailto:rcdsafety@nz.schneider-electric.com)

“RCDs are important electrical safety devices and this particular recall shouldn't detract from their general use by homeowners.

“However people using RCDs should test them regularly by plugging in a small electric appliance and pressing the test button. If the appliance turns off, the RCD is working. If it stays on, get the RCD checked by a licensed electrical worker. Make sure you press reset once the test is complete.

“This simple test could save your life,” said Harry Duynhoven today.
