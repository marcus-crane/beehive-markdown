The New Zealand Workplace Health & Safety awards winners and finalists announced last night are great role models for all organisations, showing how investment in health and safety makes good business sense, Labour Minister Trevor Mallard says.

Trevor Mallard today congratulated the finalists and winners of awards who were announced last night as part of the 2008 Safeguard National Health and Safety Conference. (for list of winners and finalists see [www.safeguard.co.nz](http://www.safeguard.co.nz))

"All the finalists are inspiring examples of employers working hard to keep New Zealand workers safe. I urge all organisations to follow their lead. The top honour for best overall contribution to improving Workplace Health and Safety went to Paewai Mullins Shearing, a family-owned shearing business based in Dannevirke. A fundamental concern for workers’ welfare shines through this company at every level of its operations. Other examples include category winner Manukau City Council which reduced violence against library staff by about 80 per cent, finalist Mainzeal which helped reduce staff knife cuts and skin irritation by introducing new gloves to its building sites, and Dunedin firm Naylor Love which invested in protection eyewear, reducing staff eye injuries by 60 per cent in six months.

"These examples are not just statistics. They’re about reducing injuries to working New Zealanders. And investment in health and safety not only saves lives but it makes good business sense.

"In our current economic climate you can’t talk about health and safety in business without talking about its impact on productivity. Too often health and safety is viewed as a compliance cost. I would argue that health and safety is simply about good business."

The government was working to provide better information to employers regarding health and safety, through implementing last year’s Quality Regulation review. For example, recent work had been done on managing health and safety in contracts. Draft contracting guidelines had been developed providing a "good practice" framework to help principals meet their duties for contractor safety. Workshops with industry should generate further ideas.

"This investment in health and safety – whether time, money or energy – is part of this country’s productivity drive and should be treated as an indicator of success. In practice, it’s a pretty simple formula where employers involve and support their workers - building a positive safety culture, and integrating health and safety across all levels. Research backs this. A Canadian study shows a fascinating correlation between injury rate and how long firms remain in business. Firms which survived longer had lower injury rates than those which lasted only one year," Trevor Mallard said.
