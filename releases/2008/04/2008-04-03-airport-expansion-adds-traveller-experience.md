Customs and Associate Tourism Minister Nanaia Mahuta says Auckland Airport’s new arrival hall will add to the tourist experience.

“This new facility and layout will provide space for greater service to manage passenger processing flows and improved border agency efficiencies,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

Nanaia Mahuta opened the 3A development, which features a greater number of booths, a distinct Aotearoa – New Zealand feel to the arrivals hall and improved duty free shopping.

“With Customs sharing the facilities with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and Immigration, these agencies will be able to work together to achieve maximum efficiency for processing passengers, which will contribute to the overall satisfaction of the traveller experience,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

“Auckland Airport is currently ranked third in the world by an international Airport Service Quality Awards survey, which is a wonderful achievement.

“This is only part of an extensive project that will include a second pier and screening area.

“Customs and other border agencies are mindful that implicit in its operational efficiencies, and risk profiling activities, they are the first point of contact for visitors coming to Aotearoa New Zealand. The new design and layout should ensure all these objectives are achieved,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

“As we look to the Rugby World Cup in 2011, the new airport redevelopment is a step towards our effort to respond to ever increasing passenger flows.

“I want to commend the project team, border agencies, Auckland Airport Limited and contractors for working so hard to get this first phase completed.”
