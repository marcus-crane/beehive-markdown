Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta says young New Zealanders will continue to benefit from the Labour-led government’s policies on KiwiSaver and youth rates, which came into effect on 1 April.

 

“There’s great news for a lot of young people. It’s fantastic to note that some 113,084 young people aged under -25 are now enrolled in KiwiSaver,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

 

“When you’ve got over 75,000 young workers aged between18-24, and an additional 37,000 aged under 18-years-old signed up as KiwiSavers, it is a positive sign that young people are planning for their future.

 

“And it will continue to get better for them, because as of 1 April, young working KiwiSavers can also benefit from employer contributions,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

 

Nanaia Mahuta says the additional changes which came into effect on 1 April with the abolition of the youth rate, is also good news for young New Zealand workers.

 

“This means young people will no longer be paid the youth rate, but will move instead to the full adult minimum wage or to a new entrant rate for three months.

 

“The new entrants wage recognises that often 16 and 17-year-olds do the same work as adults and respects the value of the work young people do,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

 

Nanaia Mahuta says the Labour-led government is committed to a programme that will celebrate young people and encourage them to reach their potential.

 

“We’ve expanded workplace training for young people, supported and expanded the Youth Transition Service with an extra $7.9 million to provide at risk youth with career planning and job-seeking help,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

 

“The government’s $446 million funding packages for non-government organisations will also enable youth services to continue to provide quality programmes and services for young people.

 

“This highlights again the Labour-led government cares about youth, and supporting these forward looking initiatives is making a difference in the lives of young New Zealanders,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
