Two new snapshots of the museum and nature-based tourism sectors will prove useful for tourism operators, Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor said today.

Mr O’Connor said the booklets highlight the government's commitment to providing support to the tourism industry and give operators the ability to take a big picture view of two important components of the tourism industry.

“We know that operators are flat out running their businesses and there is little time for them to get their head around research. The profiles offer operators of nature-based attractions or museums a clear and concise picture of their industry, as well as giving them some hard facts,” said Mr O’Connor.

The four page booklets give an overview of the size and trend of the two sectors, providing information on international and domestic visitor numbers, where visitors came from and what activities and attractions they experienced during their stay.

“The [New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015](http://www.tourism.govt.nz/strategy/index.html) highlights the need for us to ensure our tourism sector is prosperous and attracts ongoing investment. Having access to information like these snapshots makes it easier for operators to identify trends and adjust their products, marketing and strategies to keep up with a sector that is forever changing,” said Mr O’Connor.

“New Zealand's natural environment is the country's number one drawcard for international visitors. Nearly three quarters of international visitors to New Zealand participate in at least one nature based activity on their visit. Around one-in-five domestic travellers participate in nature-based tourism activities.

“Over a quarter of international visitors visit at least one museum. This compares to 2 percent of domestic travellers. Nearly half of all international visitors to Wellington visit a museum. This is heavily influenced by the popularity of Te Papa as a visitor attraction,” said Mr O’Connor.

The publications are part of the Ministry's Tourism Analysis programme which has seen the release of similar snapshot reports on the accommodation sector, domestic tourism and Maori tourism.
