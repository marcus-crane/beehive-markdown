Education Minister Chris Carter says his visit to Viet Nam this week helped strengthen ties between the two countries and won a high degree of praise for New Zealand’s education system.

The Viet Nam News, the national English language daily newspaper, [covered a meeting between the Minister and Vietnamese President Nguyen Minh Triet,](http://vietnamnews.vnagency.com.vn/showarticle.php?num=01EDU020408) where the President said New Zealand’s education system provided English language students with an excellent environment in which to learn English.

During the meeting, Chris Carter offered New Zealand expertise to Viet Nam to help improve the training of English teachers and to provide help with Master’s and PhD programmes.

“President Triet’s visit to New Zealand last September was an important milestone in consolidating the friendship between our two countries,” Chris Carter said.

“During this visit, the educational ties between our two countries have been further strengthened and the quality of education New Zealand has to offer has been widely praised.

“That is very positive for the future of our English language teaching sector and the fact the president’s remarks were covered on the front page of the national English daily is a big boost to New Zealand’s profile as a high quality education provider.”
