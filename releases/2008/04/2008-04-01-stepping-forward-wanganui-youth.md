“The Stepping Forward Wanganui Youth Forum 2008 is a wonderful chance to celebrate the experiences of young people,” said Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

Nanaia Mahuta is in Wanganui today for the first day of a two day conference involving 150 young people from around the region. The forum gives young people an opportunity to voice their views, ideas and hopes for their community.

“Ensuring children and young people are given every opportunity to reach their potential is important. Young people do not exist in isolation, they need the support, understanding and inspiration of their communities” said Nanaia Mahuta.

Workshops on cultural awareness, sexual health, legal rights, careers and drugs alcohol have been planned for the participants, highlighting the programmes available to support youth initiatives.

The participants will also hear from guest speakers Marcus Akuhata-Brown and Wanganui Mayor Michael Laws, and local principals and teachers.

Stepping Forward Youth Forum 2008 is the latest initiative in the Wanganui District Council’s ‘Make It, Take It’ project which is funded through the Ministry of Youth Development’s Youth Development Partnership Fund.

“The Make It, Take It project is a great opportunity for the young people of Wanganui to take responsibility in the development of the resources available for them,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“It is providing opportunities for young people to gain experience in a range of areas like event management, hospitality, business management and construction, and will hopefully set them on the path to their chosen career.

The Youth Development Partnership Fund provides an opportunity for the Ministry of Youth Development, local councils and young people to work together to provide projects for local youth.

Nanaia Mahuta said the Labour led Government is committed to ensuring young people have every opportunity to be heard, and the chance to develop their talents.

“It’s important to celebrate our young people, and encourage them to reach their full potential, and the Youth Development Partnership Fund is one of the ways where we can support projects that encourage young people to get involved in their communities,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
