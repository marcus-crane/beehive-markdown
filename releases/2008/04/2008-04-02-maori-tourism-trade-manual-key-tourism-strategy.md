A new manual showcasing 100 Maori tourism businesses will set a quality benchmark for the future of Maori Tourism, Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor said today.

The Minister was speaking at the launch of the *New Zealand Maori Tourism Trade Manual 2008-2009*, which showcases Maori businesses with proven track records in delivering quality and authentic products.

Mr O’Connor said Maori tourism priorities and Maori cultural values are included throughout the [New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015](http://www.tourism.govt.nz/strategy/index.html).

“The Strategy is underpinned by two key values – kaitiakitanga (guardianship) and manaakitanga (hospitality).

“Welcoming our visitors with mutual respect and sharing our knowledge, stories and beliefs in the spirit of kaitiakitanga (guardianship) and manaakitanga (hospitality) will ensure the experience offered by local Maori businesses is world class and will benefit our visitors and our communities,” said Mr O’Connor.

A recent ‘sector profile’ on Maori Tourism released by the Ministry of Tourism, estimates that around one in five (455,000) of all adult international tourists to New Zealand visited a Maori cultural tourism experience in 2006.

“These statistics show just how high a demand there is for our Maori tourism product.

“We need to ensure the tourism industry, both locally and internationally, is aware of the depth and quality of the Maori tourism product and the Manual will highlight the unique point of difference Maori tourism offers,” said Mr O’Connor.
