State Owned Enterprises Minister Trevor Mallard today announced that Taurewa Station near National Park in the central North Island would be given further protection by the Crown until ownership issues are resolved.

"Taurewa Station will join a group of nine other Landcorp properties that are already covered by the Protected Land Agreement that state-owned Landcorp and the Crown signed last September. This move reflects the commitment of the Crown to protecting Taurewa Station from sale until such time as ownership issues are resolved.

"It also provides assurance to local hapu that Taurewa will not be sold, and signals the Crown’s commitment to resolving complex and sensitive land ownership issues. The inclusion of the station within the agreement does not prejudice the offer-back process under the Public Works Act, which will continue," Trevor Mallard said.

Landcorp will receive compensation for Taurewa Station at the market value of $13.208 million in the form of deferred dividends. Once Taurewa Station is included under the Protected Land Agreement, Landcorp will continue to farm the property as usual, and will continue to protect its conservation and other natural values.

**Background:** The Protected Land Agreement began last September, at the same time as the Labour-led government announced a new process for the sale of all Crown-owned land to ensure national interests including heritage, cultural, local and recreational values are better protected when Crown land is put up for sale.
