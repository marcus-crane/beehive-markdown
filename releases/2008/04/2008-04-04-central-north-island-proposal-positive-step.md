The proposal from the Central North Island Iwi Collective is a positive step forward in the innovative process to settle many of the remaining historical claims in the region, Treaty Negotiations Minister Michael Cullen said today.

The Crown has received a proposal from Collective for the use of Crown Forest lands as commercial redress at a ceremony in Little Waihi today.

“This has been an iwi-initiated process that has required a great deal of energy and innovative thinking over the past few months,” Dr Cullen said.

“The proposal we have received today looks to be close to what the Crown can ultimately agree to. We still have some work to do to come together completely, but the Collective should be proud of their work to date.

“I congratulate the Collective for their determination to develop a proposal that can be considered by the Crown. I am impressed with the initiative and seriousness which the collective has demonstrated in this process.

“The Crown will now consider the proposal, including the level of support from iwi. We will report back to the Collective as soon as possible and I hope to have more to say in the weeks ahead.”

The proposal was developed under Terms of Agreement signed by the Collective and the Crown on 22 February.

Since the terms were signed Te Pumautanga o Te Arawa agreed to work with the Collective to develop the settlement proposal. As a result the proposal is the work of almost all the iwi of the Central North Island region with interests in the forest lands.
