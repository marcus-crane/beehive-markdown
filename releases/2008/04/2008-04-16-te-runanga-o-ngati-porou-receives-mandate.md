Associate Minister of Treaty Negotiations Mita Ririnui signed documents today to officially recognise Te Runanga o Ngati Porou status as the mandated authority to operate on behalf of Ngati Porou in their treaty settlement negotiations.

The announcement of the signing means that Ngati Porou is the newest iwi to be given the opportunity to pull up a chair to the Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations table.

“We are happy to announce that Te Runanga o Ngati Porou have been given the green light to commence the negotiation on behalf of Ngati Porou for their historical treaty claims. They have worked long and hard to get to this stage and it is a milestone that they should be proud of” said Associate Minister of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Mita Ririnui.

Te Runanga of Ngati Porou sought mandated authority from te iwi o Ngati Porou and underwent the arduous task of running information hui as well as a postal ballot to obtain a majority vote from their iwi members and registered beneficiaries. Careful consideration was then given to the Runanga mandating process and 35 submissions received in response to public notification and the views expressed by submitters.

“Ngati Porou boasts the largest iwi member population, many of whom are urbanised, so the level of consultation required to obtain a mandate would have been extremely time consuming.”

It is expected that Te Runanga o Ngati Porou will begin discussions over the Terms of Negotiations soon.
