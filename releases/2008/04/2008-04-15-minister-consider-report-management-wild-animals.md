The Ministerial panel on deer, chamois, tahr and wild pigs have presented their report on options for managing these species to Conservation Minister Steve Chadwick and UnitedFuture Leader Hon Peter Dunne.

“I’m heartened to learn that the main area of agreement is on the importance of the conservation of New Zealand’s unique native species and ecosystems, and I note that the majority of the Panel does not recommend legislative change. The challenge now is how we use the existing tools to better manage deer, chamois, tahr and wild pigs,” Steve Chadwick said.

In July 2007 then Conservation Minister Chris Carter appointed a panel, as part of a confidence and supply agreement with UnitedFuture, to investigate options for the management of deer, chamois, tahr and wild pigs in New Zealand.

“The panel received more than 4000 submissions – that’s a tremendous response. I welcome and appreciate the excellent work the panel has done.

“I look forward to considering the panel’s recommendations, will discuss the report with Peter Dunne, my colleagues and stakeholders, and intend to announce the government’s initial decisions within the next two months.”

Identified options:

1\. Better representation and accommodation of deer, chamois, tahr and wild pig interests within the existing policy and planning framework.

2\. Establishment of a Wild Animal Control Advisory Committee to improve wild animal advice and policy.

3\. Establishment of a Big Game Hunting Council to co-ordinate and foster hunting and farming interests in deer, chamois, tahr and wild pigs.
