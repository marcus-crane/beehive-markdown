Land and water conservation, climate change, and sustainability are the focus of seven national projects and 32 regional projects which are set to receive grants under the Sustainable Management Fund, Environment Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

"The objectives of the Sustainable Management Fund are to make a positive difference to the environment by funding projects that support the Government’s environment and sustainability priorities; encourage pro-active partnerships; and promote community action," Trevor Mallard said.

"The Labour-led government is pleased to back our commitments to sustainability and carbon neutrality by supporting projects like this because we know that even small eco-friendly actions count. These projects encourage wide community involvement and promote practical action to produce long-term environmental benefits," Trevor Mallard said.

In the 2008/2009 funding round, 39 projects have provisional approval for funding. Of these there are seven national projects and one is a South Island wide project, as follows:

• The Energy Efficiency Community Network’s ‘Sustainable Energy Advice Centre Network’ pilot, which has been approved for further funding this year, having received support to the tune of $125,000 last year. Provisional funding of $155,000 has been approved for the second stage of the project, which will build on the work carried out in establishing Sustainable Energy Advice Centres.

• The 2020 Communications Trust’s ‘eDay 2008’ project. In 2005/2006 $42,000 was provided to raise public awareness of the environmental risks of dumping electronic waste (e-waste) in landfills. Provisional funding of $200,000 in 2008/2009 has been approved for the organisation to build the local capacity and develop skills in handling e-waste.

• The Sir Peter Blake Trust’s ‘Care for our Coast’ programme, which is set to receive $51,500 to encourage communities to care for their local beach, estuary, lake or river. The Trust has piloted this scheme with the Spirit of Adventure Trust and various schools and the plan is to increase the participation of young people.

• Genera Limited is set to receive funding for the first time for a project that aims to demonstrate that Generated Phosphine is a safe, viable alternative to methyl bromide for removing quarantine pests on key exports. Funding of $122,500 has been provisionally approved for this.

• The Trees for Survival Charitable Trust’s ‘Trees for Survival Expansion’ project, which has been granted funding of $40,000 to expand the Trees for Survival programme involving children growing trees on 'at risk' land.

• Dune Restoration Trust of New Zealand’s ‘Empowering Coastal Communities to Adapt to Climate Change’ project which aims to provide local coastal communities with an adaptive approach to help mitigate the effects of sea level rise and increased storm activity is set to receive $67,500.

• The Youth Hostel Association of New Zealand’s ‘Green Footprint’ project has been approved for $27,000 in funding. This project will extend the existing successful Green Footprint project into four other New Zealand locations.

• The Environmental Education for Resource Sustainability Trust will expand a ‘paper4trees’ project in schools around the South Island. $231,000 in funding over three years will be used to expand the project which received funding of $58,000 last year to encourage paper and cardboard recycling in schools around the North Island.

Under the last project, schools around the South Island will be visited and asked to join the project. In return for establishing recycling bins, they will be rewarded with native trees to plant. To date, in the North Island, there has been a 95 per cent uptake from schools visited.

"This is an outstanding result, and it will be good to see this success replicated throughout South Island schools. Recycling with kids is a great way to develop awareness and understanding for our environment. We are delighted to be supporting such a valuable project that promotes practical action to produce long-term environmental benefits," Trevor Mallard said.

The Sustainable Management Fund is a contestable fund. The 39 projects were provisionally approved for funding subject to the development of an acceptable project plan, with final approvals to be decided by about June.

The fund sits alongside other initiatives by the Labour-led government to promote sustainability, including the proposed Emissions Trading Scheme, and household and business sustainability programmes.
