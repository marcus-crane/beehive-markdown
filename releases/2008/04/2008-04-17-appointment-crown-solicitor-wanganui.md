The Attorney-General, the Hon Dr Michael Cullen, announced today the appointment of Lance Clifford Rowe as Crown Solicitor at Wanganui. 

Mr Rowe was admitted in 1989 and, following a period with Treadwell Gordon in Wanganui, he joined his current firm Armstrong Barton as an associate in October 1994, becoming a partner in that firm in 1997.

Mr Rowe has considerable experience of the criminal law. Since 1994 he has specialised in criminal litigation regularly conducting jury trials in both the District and High Court, and as a Youth Court advocate. 

He has acted as lead counsel for the defence in respect of a number of homicide trials and made regular appearances in the Court of Appeal. He has also appeared before the Employment Tribunal, Mental Health Review Tribunal, Accident Compensation Review Tribunal and Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal in addition to significant work in the Youth Court since 1993. 

Mr Rowe takes over from Mr Andrew Cameron who has resigned from his position as Crown Solicitor at Wanganui.
