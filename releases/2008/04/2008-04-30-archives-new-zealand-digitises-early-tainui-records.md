Some 850 images of Waikato -Tainui land confiscation records dating back from the 1830s to the early 1900s have been digitised in a project to help make archives more accessible, the Minister responsible for Archives New Zealand Judith Tizard said today.

“A CD of all the images will be presented to Waikato -Tainui this evening as part of a ceremony marking the beginning of their anniversary to celebrate 150 years of Kiingitanga,” she said.

“Today is a significant day to make the presentation because it is a day to reflect and acknowledge those who have passed on, many of whom have been remembered in the records captured on this CD.

“The CD is an important legacy for Waikato - Tainui people as it gives them the records of their past at their fingertips.  The wider community will also be able to learn and understand from it.”

The valuable records include letters written by King Taawhiao and Major Wiremu Te Wheoro, whakapapa charts and photographs of Tainui tuupuna as well as correspondence between Governor Grey and King Tawhiao and his father King Matutaera Potatau. Original publications from the time and a variety of land confiscation petitions signed by many rangatira from different iwi are also included.

The digitisation project is the culmination of a year’s work between Archives New Zealand and Waikato - Tainui and is the pilot for other projects to improve access to information for iwi, hapū and the wider community.

“This is a significant milestone for Archives New Zealand as the organisation continues to understand and meet the needs of people who do not live near one of its four repositories in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.

“Archives New Zealand has a mandate to be part of this country’s digital transformation, to improve its access to records for people throughout the country and to be responsive to Māori.  This CD is a major step in this direction.”

Archives New Zealand Chief Executive Dianne Macaskill will make the presentation.
