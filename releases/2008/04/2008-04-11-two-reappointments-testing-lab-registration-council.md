Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel has reappointed Miriam Dean, QC and Nigel Cann as members of the [Testing Laboratory Registration Council](http://www.ianz.govt.nz/publications2/pdfs/IA2_Council.pdf) for three-year terms.

The Council is responsible for accrediting testing and calibration laboratories and inspection bodies.

"Both Miriam Dean and Nigel Cann have made a significant contribution to the Council's important role in ensuring that New Zealand has a sound conformity assessment infrastructure that supports innovation and facilitates trade and I am delighted their membership will continue," Lianne Dalziel said.

Following a review of New Zealand’s standards and conformity assessment infrastructure completed in May 2007, the Council’s governance and technical advice structures will be separated. Continuity of board membership will be useful as the Council prepares for the changes, which are expected to be implemented later this year, Lianne Dalziel said.
