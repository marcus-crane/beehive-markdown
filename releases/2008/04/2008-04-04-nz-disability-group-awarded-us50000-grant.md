The Disabled Persons Assembly (DPA) has been awarded a US $50,000 grant as part of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt International Disability Award, announced Disability Issues Minister Ruth Dyson today.

The prestigious Roosevelt Award has been won by the New Zealand Government in recognition of the progress made in advancing the participation of disabled people across New Zealand society. The US $50,000 grant, which is part of the Award, is given to an outstanding non-government disability organisation selected by the winning country.

“Twenty four New Zealand disability organisations applied for the grant, including consumer advocacy groups and service providers, at both regional and national levels. I want to congratulate all those who applied, the standard was very high and some wonderful projects were proposed.”

DPA’s application for the grant was supported by People First and CCS Disability Action. “It’s great to see disabled people and service providers working together and supporting each other to make a more inclusive society,” said Ruth Dyson.

DPA will use the funding to promote the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as a major ongoing event in the lives of New Zealanders, and to create a diversity action programme, using disabled people as teachers.

The Franklin Delano Roosevelt International Disability Award will be formally presented to the New Zealand Government in a ceremony at the United Nations in May.

In the spirit of partnership with disabled people, our government is also funding a member of DPA to travel to New York to participate in the Award ceremony and accept the Roosevelt grant.
