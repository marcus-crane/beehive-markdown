Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta said today’s Maori Reference Group Whanaau Hui in Ngaruawahia, is a step in the right direction.

“This hui is the first of its kind and I welcome the effort that is going into sending a clear message we want homes within our communities free of violence and safe for families,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

The two-day summit, which begins at Turangawaewae Marae this afternoon, will bring 120 Maaori leaders together to discuss the issues and solutions Maaori need to put in place, to tackle issues of family violence.

The Maori Reference Group, made up of community and agency leaders, was established in 2006 to advise the Taskforce for Action on Violence within Families on Maaori issues.

Nanaia Mahuta said the key theme for the hui will send a clear message, we need to all take action to make a difference.

“The theme is ‘E tu! Taking Action’ and it is crucial for us to move forward. We know that too many of our women and tamariki are being beaten, abused and killed – many at the hands of their own whanaau, said Nanaia Mahuta.

“The first step is for everyone to know that family violence is not okay. Violence in all forms, whether physical or verbal, has no place in our whanaau and culture,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“The next step is it’s okay to ask for help and that’s where our community response is key.”

Nanaia Mahuta said the Labour-led government is committed to supporting the work being done in the community to address the issue of family violence.

“We have invested in the training and support for people working to prevent family violence in Maaori communities and will continue to do this,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“Support services like Family Start, Women’s Refuge, Strengthening families and budgeting support can help reduce stress factors that can trigger violent actions

“This Labour-led government recently announced an extension to Pathway to Partnership programme, with $446 million of additional funding for community organisations with existing contracts to provide essential services for families.

“The Taskforce’s ‘It’s Not OK Campaign’ supports local communities in changing their attitudes and behaviours on family violence.

“The real change has to occur in our homes, and in our families. If we all take action we can all make a difference,” says Nanaia Mahuta.
