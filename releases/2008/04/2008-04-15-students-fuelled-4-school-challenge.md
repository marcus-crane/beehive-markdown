Education Minister Chris Carter has today heard from Wellington students about their plans to get fellow students eating better and doing better at school as part of the Fuelled 4 School challenge.

Fuelled 4 School is part of Mission On, a youth lifestyle campaign aimed at improving the eating habits and physical activity levels of young New Zealanders.

“Research shows us that health promotion is more likely to succeed where students themselves have ownership over the solutions,” Chris Carter said.

“Fuelled 4 School encourages intermediate and secondary school students to develop their own plans to combat nutrition issues among their peers.”

The initial phase of the programme is a pilot that was officially launched today at Bishop Viard College, Porirua, where student leaders presented their Action Plans to the Minister.

“The school I am at today is one of the 50 schools nationwide who were selected to take part in this exciting new initiative designed to encourage healthier eating and more exercise as a method to improve educational achievement.

“In February this year, each Fuelled 4 School lead student received a toolkit with a range of resources to help them develop an ‘Action Plan’.

“I’ve been impressed with the depth of thought that’s gone into the plans I’ve seen today, and am confident we can look forward to some positive steps towards better nutrition in our schools in the near future”, Chris Carter said.

While at Bishop Viard College the Minister also officially launched the [Fuelled 4 School website](http://www.fuelled4school.co.nz). He then joined chef tutor John Hancock to help student chefs make fruit smoothies, hand out ‘smart snacks’ and Fuelled 4 School water bottles.
