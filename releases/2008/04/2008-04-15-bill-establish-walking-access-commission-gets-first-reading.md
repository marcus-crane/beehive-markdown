Securing public access to New Zealand’s great outdoors is the object of a Bill introduced into Parliament today by Rural Affairs Minister Damien O’Connor.

The Walking Access Bill creates a Walking Access Commission to advise on and implement walking access policies. The Bill replaces the New Zealand Walkways Act 1990.

“Providing access to outdoor areas is an important and complex issue which affects many New Zealanders, and the purpose of the new agency is to provide national leadership on walking access issues.

“The need for such an organisation has arisen through public concern about the availability of walking access to the outdoors, especially access around the coast, around lakes and along rivers.

“The Walking Access Panel was charged with finding a consensus amongst stakeholder groups on walking access issues and consulted widely on this issue. The Bill closely reflects recommendations made to me by the Panel last year.

“The Bill is one of the measures this Labour-led government has initiated to reflect the importance of preserving access to and enjoyment of the great outdoors that is so important to our national identity. The Bill is part of a wider vision for the preservation of the heritage of all New Zealanders,” said Mr O’Connor.

A code of conduct, mapping database and national access strategy will be among the first tasks for the organisation. Funding will also be sought for a contestable fund, to be managed by the new agency, to assist with the establishment of new walking access,” said Mr O’Connor.

The new crown agency will provide national leadership, including a national strategy, and coordination of access among key stakeholders and relevant central and local government organisations. It will also provide impartial and robust advice on access; offer local/regional leadership and coordination to help local groups with their access issues; and when necessary mediate disputes over walking access.

The agency will be monitored by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.
