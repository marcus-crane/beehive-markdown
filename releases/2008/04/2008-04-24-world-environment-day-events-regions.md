More than 100 school and community projects around the country will mark New Zealand's hosting of World Environment Day on June 5 and receive government funding, Environment Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.            

"Events to celebrate World Environment Day are coming to regions around the country with some help from government funding. It is great to see local communities taking such enthusiastic interest in New Zealand's hosting of this international event by organising their own local projects," Trevor Mallard said.

Funding was made available to assist organisations, groups, schools and early childhood education centres who wished to undertake an event or activity during the week of World Environment Day (2 to 8 June 2008). Trevor Mallard announced the successful applicants from the first funding round on 2 April. The second and final funding round has now closed and successful applicants have been approved.

"The projects and events will receive support through a $1 million government fund in the lead-up to June 5 when we will mark the first time New Zealand has ever hosted this important international United Nations event," Trevor Mallard said.

"Word Environment Day is an opportunity to bring the world’s communities together to find new ways to protect our environment and form stronger networks to support and build on the work that is already underway. Various sectors in New Zealand have introduced innovations towards combating climate change, and this is our chance to share them internationally.

"It is also a great opportunity for New Zealanders to showcase the positive things we are doing nationally, regionally and internationally to promote sustainability and reduce the impacts of climate change.

"The interest that councils, business, communities and schools have displayed in World Environment Day 2008 highlights New Zealand’s increasing focus on our commitment to looking after the environment in a sustainable way. Even small steps for sustainability, when undertaken by many, can make a big difference.

"We are proud to host World Environment Day. The government is committed to working towards a carbon neutral New Zealand and sustainable development through various different initiatives, including the proposed Emissions Trading Scheme, as well as household and business sustainability programmes.

 "I encourage all New Zealanders to get on board to mark this important internationally recognised annual event," Trevor Mallard said.
