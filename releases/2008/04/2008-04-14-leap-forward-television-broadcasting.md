The advent of high definition television delivered by the new Freeview digital terrestrial service is a significant event in New Zealand broadcasting, Prime Minister Helen Clark said today.

Helen Clark officially launched the digital terrestrial service in Wellington tonight.

"This is cutting edge technology and high definition is still a rarity internationally. The rollout of Freeview HD puts New Zealand at the top of the list, alongside the United States, France, Japan, the United Kingdom and Australia," Helen Clark said.

"High definition, with its crystal clear pictures, is the latest desirable broadcasting feature worldwide. In terms of visual experience, the last advance this dramatic in New Zealand would have been the switch to colour television in 1974.

"New Zealand was a late starter in the process of transition to digital technology. Now we’re leapfrogging to the front of the pack. That is exactly where we want to be, reflecting our identity as a technologically advanced, creative and innovative society.

"The Labour-led Government has supported Freeview as a dual satellite/terrestrial service to ensure all New Zealanders can have access to quality free-to-air digital television no matter where they live. We provided access to radio spectrum as well as $25 million (GST excl) to Freeview over five years to help with simulcasting in both digital and analogue," Helen Clark said.

Broadcasting Minister Trevor Mallard said the government contribution, as well as the $79 million in government funding for TVNZ's digital channels, reflected the government's commitment to supporting these important developments.

Freeview’s satellite service began in May last year and more than 100,000 New Zealanders have purchased a Freeview receiver (set top box), exceeding initial projections of 30,000 for the first year of Freeview.

Trevor Mallard joined Helen Clark in congratulating Freeview and its members, state-owned Kordia, the Ministry for Culture and Heritage and the Ministry of Economic Development for a positive government/industry partnership.
