State Services Minister David Parker today announced the appointment of Iain Rennie to the position of State Services Commissioner.  Mr Rennie will take up his appointment on 1 July 2008.

 “Mr Rennie was recommended for appointment unanimously by a panel which comprised Rt Hon Jim Bolger, Dame Margaret Bazley, Hon Stan Rodger and myself,” David Parker said.

 Mr Rennie is currently the Deputy State Services Commissioner, a position he has held since February 2007.  He will replace the present State Services Commissioner, Dr Mark Prebble who will retire from the Public Service at the end of June.

 “Mr Rennie will bring to the role the required depth of judgement across a range of government areas coupled with a real understanding of the detail of government processes,” David Parker said.

 “The State Services Commissioner must have a thorough understanding of New Zealand’s constitution and government system, and how these work.  He must also have the ability to perform important statutory and constitutional roles with wisdom, integrity, consistency and courage.

 “In his Public Service career to date, Mr Rennie has shown that he has these characteristics in abundance.  He has been tested in a number of situations and he has performed well.  Additionally he brings a wide range of experiences to the role of State Services Commissioner including experience in appointing and managing Public Service chief executives and in contributing to a number of key government policy areas.”

 A career public servant, Mr Rennie has held positions at the Treasury, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and in the State Services Commission.  He holds a Bachelor of Arts (Hons) First Class in Economics and a Bachelor of Arts majoring in Economics and History from Victoria University of Wellington.  He has also completed an Oxford Strategic Leadership Programme from Templeton College, University of Oxford, United Kingdom.
