A year after introducing significant enhancements to the way in which proposals for changing regulation are presented to Cabinet, the government has released an independent report on how the system is bedding in.

Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel says the report is a result of an independent monitoring process put in place to provide information to departments on the quality of their regulatory impact analysis. The study assessed the extent to which 8 Regulatory Impact Analyses (RIAs) complied with the government’s guidelines and the effectiveness of 12 Regulatory Impacts Statements (RISs) as communication tools for decision-makers.

"The report finds that consultation is generally well done, that close attention is paid to submissions and that changes are made to proposals as a result. The report also found that the statements themselves are generally well written using plain language," Lianne Dalziel said.

"Departments willingly took part in the study so they can identify how they can do better and as expected with any new regime, there is room for improvement. I'm pleased that the report found that both analysts and managers strongly support steps to improve the quality of advice and policy development process. This was a core aim of the changes we made to the RIA regime last year as part of the Quality Regulation Review."

The main areas for improvement were problem definition, describing the scale of the issue, analysis of costs and benefits, and risk assessment but the report also noted that the final regulatory impact statement did not always do justice to the quality of the underlying analysis, Lianne Dalziel said.

"This report is an educative one, and is part of the system of checks, balances and incentives being put in place to support both departmental compliance with the new regime and continuous improvement. The challenge for all departments is to use this information to lift their game and continuously improve the quality of information provided to decision-makers about regulatory proposals.”
