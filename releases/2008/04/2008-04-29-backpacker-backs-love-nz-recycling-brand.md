The tourism industry is to be congratulated for committing to recycling facilities to help New Zealand maintain its ‘clean and green’ reputation overseas, Environment Minister Trevor Mallard and Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor said today at the launch of *Love NZ – Recycle with* care at the YHA Wellington City.

 YHA Wellington City will pilot the use of the *Love NZ – Recycle with care* brand for the Youth Hostel Association New Zealand.

 The brand was developed to clearly mark recycling facilities for the government's *Recycling in Public Places Initiative.* It will help demonstrate the Youth Hostel Association’s, and New Zealand’s, green credentials to overseas visitors. 

 "It is fantastic that our initiative is now being picked up by businesses. This is exactly what we were hoping for when we started the initiative. I encourage other businesses to get involved through their local council with the opening of the next funding round," Trevor Mallard said.

 "Without a commitment to sustainability, the needs of environmentally friendly tourists in New Zealand will not be met. It is good to see the tourism sector has committed to taking a leadership role in protecting and enhancing the environment.”

 "Many backpackers are environmentally conscious. Having recycling facilities in backpacker accommodation around the country will meet their expectations to do the right thing for the environment. I would like to congratulate the Youth Hostel Association for setting an example for others to follow," Trevor Mallard said.

 Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor said the recycling initiative will not only help protect the environment, one of the areas of focus in the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015, but it will also enhance our image as a clean green, 100% Pure New Zealand.

 "One of the key goals in the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015 is to ensure environmental sustainability. Not only will initiatives such as this one protect our environment, they will also contribute to our ultimate goal for the sector – sustainable tourism. We must continue to be at the leading edge of sustainable business practice," said Mr O’Connor.

 The Labour-led government’s *Recycling in Public Places* *Initiative* was launched as a key project to improve New Zealand’s sustainability. It is a partnership between central and local government. It aims to have 600 recycling bins installed in tourist areas throughout New Zealand by 2010.

 A second funding round has now opened for local councils to apply for funding to install recycling bins in public places. This round of funding will see up to 210 bins in place by June 2009. 

 Application forms can be downloaded from [www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/waste](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/waste).  Applications close on 13 June 2008.

 *Love NZ – Recycle with care* recycling bins have recently been established in Kaikoura, the Far North and Wellington and more are underway. Evaluation of the bins will start this month.
