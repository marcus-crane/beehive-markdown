The latest annual greenhouse gas inventory report shows New Zealand’s emissions rose less than one per cent between 2005 and 2006.

 The Ministry for the Environment inventory collects information on New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions to provide a snapshot of emissions by sector, as well as the removal of greenhouse gases by sinks (e.g. trees). The inventory includes data from 1990 to 2006 inclusive.

 Climate Change Minister David Parker says that the increase of less a percent is an improvement on the previous year’s increase of 3 percent.

 While small, the increase of 0.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide reinforces the need for the government to add to its growing stock of climate friendly policies, Mr Parker says.

 “The figures validate the actions the Labour-led government is taking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and verifies the need for further initiatives to alter New Zealand’s current path.

 “We have already announced our Energy Strategy to promote renewable energy resources like wind and geothermal, and our proposed Emissions Trading Scheme is in the process of being examined by a Select Committee.

 “The Emissions Trading Scheme is a way of creating incentives for industry, businesses and households to reduce emissions, and will help us meet our Kyoto commitments.”

 The report says the causes of increasing emissions include the expansion of dairy farming, more cars and trucks on the road and an increase in demand for electricity.

The 2008 Inventory, covering the period of 1990-2006 inclusive, reported total greenhouse gas emissions in 2006 were 77.9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2-e). This is an increase of 15.9 Mt CO2-e (26 per cent) over the 1990 level of 61.9 Mt CO2-e.

 New Zealand’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory 2008 has been submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change secretariat. The submission of the Inventory is now a requirement to continue carbon-trading.

New Zealand was among the first of a handful of countries granted trading rights late last year.

 A summary of the inventory information is available on the MfE website: [http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/climate/greenhouse-gas-inventory-overview-apr08/index.html](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/climate/greenhouse-gas-inventory-overview-apr08/index.html)
