“Ensuring young people have access to good information is important and a key priority for this government” says Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

 “The Urge/Whakamanawa website provides health information young people can trust in a language they relate to”. 

 

Nanaia Mahuta today welcomed the youth website, which has been re-developed and now provides more information to support young people.

 

Popular with teachers, parents and youth workers, the website includes sections on alcohol, drugs, relationships and sexuality, and provides a nationwide directory of support services.

 

Urge/Whakamanawa was first developed eight years ago as an interagency initiative which included the Ministry of Youth Affairs, Ministry of Health, and the Alcohol Advisory Council, and managed by the Youthline counseling service since 2002.

 

The website was re-developed following an evaluation last year that found Urge/Whakamanawa helpful and easy to understand, and provided ideas for improvements for the site.

 

“The Ministry of Youth Development is pleased to have been involved with this valuable resource since its inception,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

 

“The changes made during this redevelopment will ensure it continues to remain relevant and useful to young people and those who work with young people

 

Nanaia Mahuta says the changes are part of the Labour led government’s commitment to young people.

 

“Every young person in Aotearoa/New Zealand deserves an opportunity to reach their potential, and to be provided with the right information so they can make sound life choices,” says Nanaia Mahuta

 

“The Urge website is a direct example of young people’s voices being heard, and this highlights again the fact this Labour-led government cares for our youth.”
