Communications and Information Technology Minister David Cunliffe has welcomed a draft report from the [Telecommunications Carriers Forum](http://www.tcf.org.nz/content/default.html) (TCF) on reforming the [Telecommunications Service Obligation](http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/StandardSummary____296.aspx) (TSO).

The report investigates the effectiveness of the TSO for local telephone service which is currently under review. It calls for the service to be future proofed and redefined.

“The TSO framework is a key element of the government’s telecommunications strategy and it is important for the delivery of basic rural and regional telecommunications services.

“As the TCF have highlighted, the obligations must be meet both future and current needs. We are committed to delivering an improved TSO framework.

“The TCF report provides useful input into the TSO discussion. It is important that we get input from a wide range of stakeholders to ensure TSO maintains its integrity and original purpose of social equity. I’m also keen for industry to take ownership of any solutions for reforming the TSO.

“I am looking forward to receiving the Forum’s recommendations on the TSO. We are committed to updating the TSO and finding a workable solution to benefit those most in need.”

**Background**

**TSO**

Telecommunications Service Obligations (TSO) are requirements for the supply of certain telecommunications services under the TSO regulatory framework to meet government social objectives. The are currently two TSO instruments - Local residential telephone service (local service TSO ) and telecommunications relay service.

**TSO Review**

The government is conducting a fundamental review of the Local Service TSO to ensure the TSO continues to meet government objectives. A discussion document was released in August 2007 for public consultation which identified key issues to be addressed.

The review is focused on considering how the Local Service TSO could be improved and is based on the continuing the entitlement of residential users to free local calling.
