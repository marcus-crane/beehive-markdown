New Zealand is to deploy a Royal New Zealand Navy frigate to the Gulf region next week, Defence Minister Phil Goff announced today.

“HMNZS Te Mana will sail from Devonport on 7 April and from early May will work with international coalition maritime forces stationed in the Persian Gulf. The deployment is part of New Zealand’s commitment to help maintain security in the region,” Mr Goff said.

“The five-month deployment is part of New Zealand’s contribution to the international campaign against terrorism.

“Te Mana will patrol the waters of the Persian Gulf, monitoring shipping activity to promote the free-flow of commerce, protect infrastructure and counter terrorism, piracy and drugs, arms and people smuggling. The New Zealand Defence Force will be operating at all times under the appropriate international law, in particular the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

“The deployment does not involve operations associated with the conflict in Iraq.

“Te Mana will deploy with a 175-strong ships company, a Sea Sprite helicopter and a shore-based support group.

“It is the third time one or more New Zealand frigates have deployed to the Gulf region. Both Te Kaha and Te Mana went in 2003 and Te Mana was deployed in 2004,” Mr Goff said.
