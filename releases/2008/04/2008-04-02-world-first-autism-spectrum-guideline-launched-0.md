Minister of Education Chris Carter and Minister of Health David Cunliffe today launched a comprehensive Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline making New Zealand world leaders in this area.

Mr Cunliffe said World Autism Awareness Day was the perfect occasion for New Zealand to release its groundbreaking guidelines that aim to improve available support and services for those living with these disorders.

Minister of Education Chris Carter was unable to attend today’s launch but said the guideline provided an opportunity to build relationships across sectors to make a difference in the lives of people with by ASD.

“This Guideline is a key tool that will provide support to families and schools.

“It is a resource for schools to make sure they have access to information so that students with ASD receive the help they need,” Mr Carter said.

“The Guideline puts New Zealand at the forefront of information on ASD and will help helping people with ASD, their families, whanau, and service/support providers make sense of the wealth of research that’s out there,” Mr Cunliffe said.

The NZ Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline is a joint project of the Ministries of Health and Education and is based on overseas and New Zealand evidence, experience and practice.

“It’s about getting better at recognising, treating and managing ASD and identifying gaps in services”

“We have allocated $18.16 million over four years to implement the recommendations of the new guideline.”

Mr Cunliffe encouraged parents and individuals with ASD to use the information in the guideline to get the best advice, support and care available.''

"I expect that health professionals, educators and support agencies will use the guideline to help them provide the best evidence informed care and support for people with ASD and their families.”

The guidelines are one of the first of its kind that cover the whole of life as well as health, education, disability, Maori and Pacific perspectives

”It takes us forward into the future where I hope people with ASD will be better supported as they make significant contributions to their own families, communities, and New Zealand.”

Autism Spectrum Disorder is a life-long developmental impairment that can affect the way a person communicates, their social interaction and behaviour.

It covers a range of conditions, including Aspergers Syndrome, and the difficulties experienced vary from person to person.
