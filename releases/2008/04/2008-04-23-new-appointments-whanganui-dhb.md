The Minister of Health, David Cunliffe said today he had appointed two Crown Monitors, a deputy chair and a new member to the Whanganui District Health Board.

“The Crown Monitors, Mr Phillip Meyer and Dr Robert Logan, will report regularly to me on the Board’s progress.  I have also appointed a deputy chair and a new member to the Board.”

“This is a Board that has had difficulties in the past and Mr Meyer and Dr Logan are able to contribute a wealth of business, clinical and governance experience. This will assist in improving the Board and DHB’s performance and ensure a well-functioning and integrated Board going forward”said Mr Cunliffe.

“The new deputy chair will be Mr Ormond Stock. As well as being an existing Board member, he is also a Mid-Central DHB Board member.  This will drive the increased collaboration and the move to shared services between the two DHBs.“

“The new Board member is Ms Nancy Tuaine who is of the Te Atihaunui a Paparangi (Whanganui) Iwi and has an established background as the manager of the Whanganui River Maori Trust Board.  In addition to her role as a manager, Ms Tuaine has extensive experience in health and social services projects and I have taken into account the strong representations of local Iwi that have been made to me in support of her appointment,” said Mr Cunliffe.

“Philip Meyer is a very experienced and able investment banker and company director.  He has extensive experience in governance in both New Zealand and Australia. Dr Logan is the Chief Medical Advisor and Medical Advisor Planning and Funding at the Hutt Valley DHB.  He has extensive clinical and clinical governance experience. “

**Questions and Answers:**

 **1. Who appoints a Crown monitor?**

If the Minister of Health considers it is desirable to do so for the purpose of assisting in improving the performance of a DHB, he or she may, under section 30 of the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000, appoint one or more persons to act as Crown monitors at any DHB.

 **2. What is the role of a Crown monitor?**

The functions of the Crown monitor are to observe the decision-making processes and the decisions of the board; assist the board in understanding the policies and wishes of the Government so they can be appropriately reflected in board decisions and advise the Minister of any matters relating to the DHB, the board or its performance.

 **3. Who does the Crown monitor report to?**

The Crown monitor reports directly to the Minister of Health.

**4. Can a Crown monitor appoint or dismiss board members?**

No, however, the monitor advises the Minister on the performance of the board they are monitoring.

 **5. Can the board appoint a new chief executive when a Crown monitor is in place?**

The appointment of a Crown monitor does not prevent a DHB from appointing a new chief executive.

**6. How long will the Crown monitor be in place for at Capital and Coast DHB?**

A Crown monitor can be in place for as long as the Minister of Health determines. The terms and conditions of the monitor's appointment are agreed between the Minister and the monitor.

**7. Has a Crown monitor ever been appointed to any DHB board?**

Since DHBs were established in 2001, the Minister of Health has appointed a Crown monitor to Capital Coast DHB and has replaced the board of Hawkes Bay DHB with a commissioner.

Since 2001, previous Ministers of Health have appointed or agreed to the appointment of board advisors.  A board advisor performs a similar function as a Crown monitor but is appointed by agreement and not under legislation.
