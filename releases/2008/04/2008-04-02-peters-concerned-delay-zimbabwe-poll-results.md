Foreign Minister Winston Peters today expressed his concern over ongoing delays in the release of official results from Zimbabwe’s election.

Presidential, parliamentary and local elections were held on Saturday 29 March, but so far around a quarter of the results have still to be announced, and the result of the presidential election remains unknown.

“Zimbabwe has an appalling track record in the conduct of elections,” Mr Peters said.

“The delays are raising understandable fears among Zimbabweans, and amongst the international community, that the Mugabe regime is not prepared to respect the results of these elections.

“There have already been worrying shortcomings in the build-up to the elections; in particular a lack of respect by the Mugabe regime for the civil and political rights of opposition groups.

“It is important that the results are made public without further delay. The people of Zimbabwe have so far conducted themselves with patience and restraint over the election period. They deserve to have the opinions they have expressed at the polls reflected accurately,” Mr Peters said.
