State of the art projection equipment will be used tonight to illuminate the full front facade of Parliament with a programme of tumbling poppies, floating petals and Peter Jackson's restoration of the historic film Heroes of Gallipoli.

Poppies on Parliament is organised by the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services Association (RSA), and marks the Launch of the 2008 RSA Poppy Appeal.

"Since the first NZ Poppy Day in 1922 the RSA poppy has truly become a national icon. It is the recognised symbol of the RSA and its endeavours to care for war veterans as well as remember those who did not return. Poppies on Parliament is a great way of remembering and highlighting the work the RSA carries out on behalf of veterans and their families," Veterans Affairs Minister, Rick Barker said.

"It is particularly exciting that this year the RSA has received permission from the Australian War Memorial to show the only footage ever taken at Gallipoli in 1915, Peter Jackson's restoration of the historic film Heroes of Gallipoli. There will also be performances and readings by local school children."

Mr Barker will 'switch on' the projections at 7.15pm tonight on the steps of Parliament.

"Tonight's launch is significant event and one which I think will capture the publics' imagination. However of equal importance is getting behind the RSA's Poppy Day Appeal, and giving generously to support the welfare work of the RSA.

"Visiting your local RSA and talking with those who served is also a great way of remembering and it is always welcomed by the Association and the veterans themselves,” Mr Barker said.

The RSA National President, Robin Klitscher will present Mr Barker with the first poppy of 2008.

“The RSA is most grateful for the public’s support of the Poppy Appeal. The Poppy provides the means for every New Zealander to remember on ANZAC Day and at the same time to support our veterans and their families all year round,” Robin Klitscher said.

Poppy Day 2008 is Friday, 18 April — YOUR WAY TO REMEMBER.
