A new eco advice booklet is available off the internet from today to help the 91 per cent of New Zealanders who have said they want to know more about how they can protect the environment, Environment Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

"The booklet, 25 easy steps towards sustainability, is aimed at New Zealand households and available off [www.sustainability.govt.nz](http://www.sustainability.govt.nz) from today," Trevor Mallard said.

Recent research found that 63 per cent of people would like learn more about the things they could do to help the environment and a further 28 per cent reported actively looking for information.

"Every step makes a difference and the more of us that take these steps, the bigger the difference we can all make. We know the majority of New Zealanders say they would like to do more to help the environment, but don’t know where to go for practical information on the things they could do," Trevor Mallard said.

"This booklet meets that demand. It also makes it easier for New Zealanders to participate in the ‘What’s Your Next Step?’ Sustainability Challenge on [www.sustainability.govt.nz](http://www.sustainability.govt.nz) by providing them with information in an accessible and engaging way, and giving them ideas for their action plans.

"The booklet is designed to complement existing information provided on

[www.sustainability.govt.nz](http://www.sustainability.govt.nz). It covers five topics — rubbish, water, energy, building, and transport. It features case studies of Kiwis who have already benefited by taking some of these steps.

"One such case study highlights Ralph and Ali Hogan of Wellington. The Hogans managed to significantly cut the amount of rubbish they produce by recycling and composting all they could and making careful choices when shopping. Six months on, they still had not filled a single council rubbish bag."

To use as little paper as possible, the booklet is available electronically to download, read onscreen, and share with friends. It can be downloaded free from [www.sustainability.govt.nz](http://www.sustainability.govt.nz).
