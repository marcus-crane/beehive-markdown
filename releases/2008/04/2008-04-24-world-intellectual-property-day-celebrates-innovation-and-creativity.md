World Intellectual Property Day is an initiative of the World Intellectual Property Organization and is celebrated annually on April 26. The day focuses on the importance of human innovation and creativity and celebrates the important role that intellectual property (IP) plays in our daily lives.

 

“The Labour-led government recognises the importance of intellectual property and has undertaken a wide-ranging reform of intellectual property law in general,” says Associate Commerce Minister Judith Tizard. 

 

Most recently, the Copyright (New Technologies) Amendment Act updated New Zealand's copyright law to ensure that we keep up to speed with recent advances in digital technology, such as the format shifting of music to portable devices like ipods and mp3 players.

 

“A robust, up to date intellectual property rights regime is an essential part of an innovative, growing economy. It is especially important for creative workers who need to be respected - and paid - for what they do,” says Judith Tizard.

 

On 16 April, Yang Gan, who was a Year 13 student at Hutt International Boys’ School last year, was the focus of a Ministerial celebration that promoted intellectual property by recognising the innovation and creativity of enterprising young New Zealanders.

 

“Yang Gan and two of his fellow students demonstrated the flair and creativity that drives our intellectual property regime,” says Judith Tizard.

 

The 2008 ‘Intellectual Property Respecting Creativity Design Competition’ will offer another opportunity for students to demonstrate their creativity and work towards completing their NCEA studies.

 

They can develop design work, a short film, soundtrack or article for a copyright and intellectual property campaign aimed at the under-18 age group. Visual art and design, music, media studies, technology, graphics and English students can develop their entries as part of study towards assessment of relevant achievement standards and unit standards.

 

The competition is administered by the Ministry of Education with the support of the Ministry for Economic Development and the Copyright Council of New Zealand. It is open to all Y11-13 students this year and closes on 28 October 2008.
