Think again.

That’s the message to the ARC from Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton over its  proposed ban on aquaculture across the entire Auckland region.

The proposed ARC plan won’t allow aquaculture anywhere on the entire Auckland coastline.

“Getting the location for aquaculture right is very important. But a blunt ban on aquaculture anywhere is unjustified,” Jim Anderton says.

“Those of us who have spent many enjoyable years on the Auckland coast, in places like the Firth of Thames, know that there are opportunities for well managed aquaculture development.

“I recognise popular sailing areas in the Hauraki Gulf or right in front of suburban housing are not appropriate places for aquaculture development. At the same time it is simply not true that there is nowhere along the Auckland region’s coastline where appropriate aquaculture development could be placed.

“Aquaculture businesses in Auckland can provide jobs and earn export dollars for New Zealand.

“I hope Auckland will enter the ARC’s consultation process with a view to considering the benefits that well-located aquaculture could bring.

“Global demand for seafood is rising very quickly, and if we are not going to empty out our oceans, rising demand needs to be met from clean and sustainable aquaculture. New Zealand can be a global leader.

“Some of the most promising aquaculture busineses in New Zealand are Maori owned. The ARC’s proposed ban could shut out an industry with potential to provide significant investment.”
