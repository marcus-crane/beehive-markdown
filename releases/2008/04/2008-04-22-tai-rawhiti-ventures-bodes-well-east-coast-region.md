“The launch of Tai Rawhiti Ventures will provide a huge advantage for the Tairawhiti region,” Associate Tourism Minister Nanaia Mahuta said

 

Nanaia Mahuta today launched the latest Maori tourism operator and says the venture bodes well for the East Coast region.

 

“A lot of work has gone into ensuring that Tai Rawhiti Ventures becomes a reality, and like other Maori Regional Tourism Organisations (MRTO) this has been an effort that has involved whanau, hapu, marae, iwi and the wider community within the Tairawhiti region,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

 

“There are increasing opportunities for Maori tourism, especially with the focus on a ‘home grown’ brand, where visitors get a genuine experience providing a unique point of difference, not on offer anywhere else.”

 

Nanaia Mahuta said the new venture will also highlight the region’s potential and allow it to take ownership of what it has to offer.

 

“The Tairawhiti region has huge eco-cultural tourism potential which as yet has been under-developed and I am confident Tai Rawhiti Ventures will work hard to provide visitors with access to a quality indigenous eco-cultural product, which is what visitors seem to want more of,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

 

A recent ‘sector profile’ on Maori Tourism released by the Ministry of Tourism, estimates that almost 600,000 tourists visited a Maori cultural tourism experience in 2006. That same profile tells us that visitors tend to go to Rotorua, Northland, Auckland and Wellington for that experience.

 

“Businesses like Tai Rawhiti Ventures can add to Maori Cultural tourism and encourage visitors to go “off the beaten track” to experience something a little different.

 

“It’s really important for Maaori tourism operators in Te Tairawhiti to package their products in a way that really highlights the region, its culture and rich diverse experiences,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
