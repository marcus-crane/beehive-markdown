Transit NZ project engineer Hannah Hayde chats with Hutt South and Rongotai MPs Trevor Mallard and Annette King at the State Highway Two Dowse to Petone upgrade project today.

Work on the $60m project is now one fifth complete, with present work focused on the Dowse and Korokoro Interchanges.

The project will greatly improve traffic flows and safety on the State Highway and also provide a new route into Lower Hutt City
