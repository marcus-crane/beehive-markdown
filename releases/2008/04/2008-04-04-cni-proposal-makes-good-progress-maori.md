“The development of the proposal that has been established by Central North Island Iwi has shown that Maori are able to come together despite our differences, to seek a result for our common good” says Associate Minister of Treaty Negotiations Mita Ririnui.

The Central North Island iwi (CNI Collective) have held meetings over the last three months to nut out the division of the central north island forests, in particular the Kaingaroa forest, where all iwi of the CNI Collective have historical interests in lands and forests. These meetings have led to today’s proceedings and the presentation of their proposal for the Crown to begin looking at a hand over.

“It has been an honour to be involved with iwi in this issue over the last three months. I have been very impressed by the determined and painstaking way in which we have discussed this issue and then put together the proposal we have before us today.”

“If we can continue with this positive momentum, reaching an agreement on a final form of this proposal over the next few weeks we will also be agreeing to much closer long term co-operation between the iwi of the region with interests in these forests. Our stake in the success of the forestry industry will grow dramatically.”

“Maori have shown the rest of Aotearoa of our ability to co-operate in managing our stake in the seafood industry, of which we are now a major player. There is every indication through the recent work of the CNI Cooperative that we can also become major players in the forestry industry.”

The proposal tabled today has given the Crown and iwi a benchmark to start working towards and has set the whole process in a positive stead for the near future.
