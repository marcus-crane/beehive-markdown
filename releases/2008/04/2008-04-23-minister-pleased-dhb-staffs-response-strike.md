The Health Minister, David Cunliffe has commended the way District Health Board staff have responded during the two day Junior Doctors’ strike.

He has expressed his thanks to Senior Doctors, Nurses, Medical Professionals and all other hospital staff who have assisted at all the country’s hospitals allowing them to function with a maximum focus on public safety with the least possible disruption.

“The way this inconvenience to other medical staff and our patients is being handled is inspiring.”

The Minister has criticised an attack on DHB chief negotiator David Meates by National’s Tony Ryall. “It is difficult to see what Mr Ryall hopes to achieve by publicly attacking a health official.”

“Mr Meates has been in the health sector for 15 years and is the chair of the National DHB CEOs’ Group.  He was brought in to finalise the pay talks with Senior Doctors when they became stalled .He is highly professional and I have been comfortable with his approach to the negotiations” said Mr Cunliffe.

“I am calling on both sides to take a long term constructive approach that  addresses  the needed  workforce reforms in a way that is sustainable, which does not impact on patients and other staff and is in line with other recent settlements in the public health care profession.”
