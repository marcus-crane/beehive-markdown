A Strategy and Five-year Action Plan to support carers is a major step towards valuing their immense contribution, says Social Development Minister Ruth Dyson.

The New Zealand Carers’ Strategy, launched in Parliament today by Ruth Dyson, is supported by a Five-year Action Plan to begin addressing some of the issues that impact on the nearly 420,000 New Zealanders who assist friends and family members who need help with everyday living because of ill health, disability or old age.

During extensive consultation, carers said they needed help in learning how to protect their own health and wellbeing, getting better access to breaks and support that enables them to balance their caring role and employment

The Carers’ Strategy is a joint initiative between the Government and the New Zealand Carers’ Alliance, a network of 45 non-governmental organisations.

“The Action Plan will help to deliver a vision for carers over the next five years where their roles are better recognised and valued. It will offer them more choices and a stronger voice in issues that affect them,’’ said Ruth Dyson.

“This strategy is an important first step in acknowledging carers and the very real difference they make in people’s lives. Improving support for informal carers is important for developing strong healthy families and meeting future challenges of providing care.’’
