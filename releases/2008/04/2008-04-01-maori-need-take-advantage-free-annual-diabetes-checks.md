Associate Minister of Health, Mita Ririnui today urged Maori to take full advantage of the free annual diabetes checks; part of The Get Checked programme, stating it can help minimise the harm caused by diabetes.

“Diabetes is a major health issue for Maori and we all need to take advantage of the free annual check ups to improve Maori health outcomes and quality of life of people diagnosed with diabetes.”

Present at the at the meeting of Parliamentarians for Diabetes of the Western Pacific Region (part of 7th International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Western Pacific Congress), Minister Ririnui was given the opportunity to hear of global initiatives aimed at diabetes care, prevention and a possible cure.

“Early detection and the maintenance of appropriate care for people with diabetes is the way for us to truly improve Maori health and we all have a responsibility to make sure we look after ourselves and have regular health checks, not just for us, but for our whanau.”

The Get Checked programme gives people with diagnosed diabetes an opportunity to check with their GP or nurse at least once a year to insure that their treatment and care plans have been updated, if required.

Although the number of people accessing The Get Checked programme continues to increase Maori participation has not been as high relative to the diabetes prevalence amongst Maori.

Maori have 2-3 times the chance of developing diabetes, tend to develop diabetes 10 years earlier and develop complications at a younger age than other New Zealanders.

Renal failure and kidney disease are also more common in Maori than in other New Zealanders and have a strong link to diabetes.
