New aquaculture space of 803 hectares has been approved for industry development Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton announced today.

The new aquaculture areas are in Golden Bay, Tasman Bay and the Kaipara Harbour.

“These new aquaculture areas will bring jobs and a boost to the local economy in these regions,” Jim Anderton says.

“Aquaculture in New Zealand has almost limitless potential. It employs over two and half thousand people and turns over a million dollars a day. **The ambition is to create an industry worth $3 million a day to New Zealand in under twenty years.**

“If we want to create an economy strong enough to care for New Zealanders, then we need strong industries where we have a competitive advantage. New Zealand aquaculture is well poised to benefit from rapidly growing global demand for seafood products.”

The Ministry of Fisheries carried out an in-depth assessment of the impact of the new aquaculture areas before approving them. The assessment covered the impact on the environment and fish stocks in the area as well as commercial, customary and recreational fishing.

Jim Anderton says aquaculture must be in the right place and sustainable in order to enjoy community support.

“Each of these new areas has had to meet a high environmental standard and undergo a rigorous assessment of its impact on the environment and fisheries.”
