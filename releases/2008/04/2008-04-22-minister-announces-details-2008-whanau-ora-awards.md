Associate Minister of Health Mita Ririnui announced today details of the 2008 Whanau Ora Awards and urged Maori health providers to consider taking part.

The Whanau Ora Awards showcase the professionalism and commitment of top Maori health providers working to help Maori families achieve maximum health and wellbeing.

Minister Ririnui said planning for the biennial event had already begun and he was delighted to announce the Whanau Ora Awards would take place on 12 September 2008.

“The Whanau Ora Awards aim to promote Maori health providers’ successful and innovative models of service delivery or initiatives that increase whanau health and wellbeing, by building on the strengths and assets of whanau and Maori communities.”

“What the past two Whanau Ora Awards have shown us is there is huge commitment, innovation and excellence in the Maori health sector, with providers passionate about helping our people enhance their wellness and wellbeing.”

“Its time for us to celebrate Maori health providers’ achievements and Id like to urge all Maori health providers – from small through to large – to start planning now to be part of this exciting event.”

Registrations of interest documents for the award will be released on May 19 and will close on June 6.
