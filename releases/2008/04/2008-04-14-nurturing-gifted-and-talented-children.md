“Our gifted and talented children are found in all communities and in all parts of the country and we need to make sure they have the best educational opportunities possible.”

The book was developed through extensive consultation with parents, Maori and Pasifika communities and educators with input from the National Gifted Advisory Group and Ministry of Education.

“This is comprehensive resource answers many questions parents have about working with schools to nurture their gifted children, and emphasises strengthening the collaborative culture between schools, families and communities”, Mr Carter said.

Nurturing Gifted and Talented Children: A Parent–Teacher Partnership will be distributed to schools, early childhood education centres and libraries and is available on www.tki.org.nz and www.teamup.co.nz.
