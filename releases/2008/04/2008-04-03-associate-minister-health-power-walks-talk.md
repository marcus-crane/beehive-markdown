Standing by his own advice when it comes to taking care of ourselves, Associate Minister of Health Mita Ririnui says he tries as much as possible to lead a healthy life style by eating the right food and exercising regularly.

“I power walk for an hour everyday, I enjoy kayaking, mountain biking and Im not a stranger to hard work. I get out in my whanau orchard and do a lot of mucking in when I have the time. I also try really hard to watch what I eat” says Mita Ririnui.

His comments about standing by his own advice come after attending the meeting of Parliamentarians for Diabetes of the Western Pacific Region (part of 7th International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Western Pacific Congress).

It is a known fact that Maori are highly represented in New Zealand statistics on diabetes, kidney failure and high blood pressure. Healthy eating and regular exercise are a key to minimising the chances of contracting any of these often debilitating and life threatening illnesses.

“It wouldn’t be right for me to preach to others about living healthy lifestyles if I wasn’t doing so myself. I enjoy exercising and do so regularly. My son is 17 years old and he is determined to out do me in the number of press ups I can do. So far he hasn’t got there but he will keep trying!”

Hon Mita Ririnui’s son made his school 1st XV rugby team when he was 15 years old and the Minister says that although there is a little bit of healthy father-son rivalry, he has become a personal trainer of sorts for his son.

“I enjoy getting out there and having a run around with my whanau. It’s a lot of fun and in a lot of ways it has made us a lot stronger by spending that quality time together.”
