Minister of Māori Affairs and Associate Education Minister, Parekura Horomia, along with Minister of Education, Chris Carter today launched Ka Hikitia – Managing for Success, a major strategy to transform education so that ‘Māori enjoy education success as Māori.’

The strategy sets out priorities, goals, actions, targets and outcomes for Māori students for the next five years, draws together evidence of successful approaches to Māori education, and shows how to turn these into future success.

“It also reflects the views, experiences and perspectives of whānau, iwi and Māori groups and represents a major shift in thinking.  It prompts us to shift our thinking away from deficit, dysfunction and problems and look at potential and opportunities and build on success,” says Minister Horomia.

“We urgently need to step up our performance for and with Māori and ensure the education system delivers successful outcomes for all students,” says Minister Horomia.

“We have a sound evidence base showing what makes the most difference for and with Māori students, including professional learning and capability of educators, responsible and accountable professional leadership, high-quality Māori language education, family, whānau and iwi engagement in education and government agencies working together,” he says.

“We are developing ways to do this right now, and Ka Hikitia – Managing for Success will ensure such evidence and knowledge is widely known, understood and used.  We will improve access to what we know is making a difference for and with Māori students.”

“The government is committed to making sure every child in New Zealand gets access to high-quality education.  This is essential if we want the 21st century skills to build a strong economy and compete in an increasingly global and diverse community,” says Minister Carter.

“Ka Hikitia – Managing for Success is relevant to everyone within the education sector.  We are looking for ownership, leadership and accountability – recognising it is the system that needs changing and not the individuals who struggle to succeed within it.”

Ka Hikitia – Managing for Success is also integral to the newly launched School Plus.  Both share a strong emphasis on ensuring young people have the opportunities they need to gain the skills, knowledge and experience to succeed.

Next month, the strategy’s launch and implementation will also be formally acknowledged in a community forum hosted by Ngāti Whakaue in Rotorua.  For background information on the development of Ka Hikitia – Managing for Success and the consultation process leading up to the launch of the strategy, visit [http://kahikitia.minedu.govt.nz](http://kahikitia.minedu.govt.nz).
