New Zealand Daylight Saving will end on Sunday 6 April 2008 when 3.00am becomes 2.00am.

Internal Affairs Minister, Rick Barker today issued the reminder as daylight savings was extended by three weeks this year

"The government reviewed and extended the period of daylight saving last year following public debate and a petition to Parliament. The period now runs from the last Sunday in September to the first Sunday in April," Mr Barker said.

"People may find it convenient to put their clocks back by one hour before going to bed on Saturday 5 April.

"As well as changing clocks, the end of Daylight Saving is an opportune time for people to check their household emergency plans and survival kits and home smoke alarms," Mr Barker said.

The Department of Internal Affairs will be researching the public’s attitude to the extension and monitoring the impact upon electricity consumption, traffic accidents and tourism.
