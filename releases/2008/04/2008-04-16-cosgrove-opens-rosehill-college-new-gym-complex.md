Minister for Sport and Recreation Clayton Cosgrove officially opened a new $2.75 million gymnastic complex at Rosehill College in Papakura, Auckland today.

“Ten years ago Rosehill’s Board of Trustees wisely recognised that the school’s two old gyms needed replacing and it has taken a lot of time and effort working through various designs and options, and fund raising to get this new complex built,” said Mr Cosgrove.

“I congratulate the Board and the school on their vision and commitment. Rosehill College can be extremely proud of its achievement in continuing to provide an environment which will play an important role in getting their students active and involved in sport and recreation. It will be a wonderful asset for the school and the wider community for years to come.”

The complex includes a large gymnasium, a fitness centre with weight training facilities, two classrooms, \`a kitchen and offices for the physical education and sport staff. Major funding has been provided through a Ministry of Education grant, private donation and support from the ASB Community Trust.

“This is a very well thought out and versatile facility. It is multi-functional and students will be able to use it for physical education, lunchtime recreation and as a training facility. It means that Rosehill College can now host home games for more sports such as basketball, netball, and indoor football,” says Mr Cosgrove.

The Minister acknowledged in his speech two people who were instrumental in getting the Rosehill Sports Centre built, the two previous Chairs of the Rosehill Board of Trustees, Peter Goldsmith and Des Searle.

Peter Goldsmith has had a long history supporting the Papakura community and Des Searle contributed to the design and quality of this venue.
