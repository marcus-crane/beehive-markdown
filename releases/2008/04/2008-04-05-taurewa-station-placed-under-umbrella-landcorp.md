Minister of State Mita Ririnui welcomed a new protection that has been put in place for Taurewa Station near central North Islands National Park.

Mita Ririnui stated that the Government's decision to add Taurewa Station to the other nine Landcorp properties covered by the Protected Land Agreement will offer further protection to the station and will ease concerns of local iwi until sensitive land ownership issues surrounding the station can be resolved.

State Owned Enterprises Minister announced the move on Saturday 5 April 2008.

“Placing the Taurewa Station under the agreement is insurance to local hapu that the government is aware of their concerns and that we are committed to ensuring their interests are heard. We have no intention to sell it until the complex issues surrounding the ownership of the land are sorted out,” Mita Ririnui said.

The decision means Taurewa Station will be covered by the Protected Land Agreement that the state-owned Landcorp and the Crown signed last September. Taurewa Station will continue to be farmed and will also have continued conservation and other natural values protected. At any time in the future Taurewa Station can also be used under public policy for recreation, heritage sites or a possible treaty settlement.

“This is a safe way of holding on to Taurewa Station, maintaining its productivity and keeping the window of opportunity for the future of the station open to all those who have interests.”

Landcorp will receive compensation for Taurewa Station at the market value of $13.208 million in the form of deferred dividends.
