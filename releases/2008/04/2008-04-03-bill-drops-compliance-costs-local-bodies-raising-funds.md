Local authorities will incur lower compliance costs when raising money to fund big infrastructure projects under a government Bill passed in Parliament today.

Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel said the new rules will make it easier for local authorities to use debt securities to fund borrowing for long-term capital projects. Local authorities will be able to rely more on information reported under the Local Government Act 2002, removing duplicated costs for information disclosure that they had under the Securities Act 1978. The changes do this by simplifying disclosure requirements through an investment statement and exempting local authorities from having to produce a full prospectus signed by all councillors.

"Capital projects can impose enormous costs on our communities. This legislation eases that burden by reducing the cost of access to an alternative source of capital and will lead to more competitive pricing for local authorities' debt.

"And, although it exempts local authorities from producing a full prospectus, it still ensures investors will receive full, accurate and timely disclosure of information. This will be done through additional information that will have to be included in an investment statement and through reliance on other reporting already being done by local authorities under the Local Government Act," Lianne Dalziel said.

"The availability of local authority securities on the retail market will give investors new options for expanding their portfolios and will give residents new ways of being involved in the development of their community by investing in its infrastructure.

"Providing alternatives to the current funding options for local bodies will boost regional and local development by making it easier to spread across generations the cost of upgrading the expensive but essential services that all communities rely on such as our roads, water supply or sewerage. Access to a well maintained regional infrastructure will help New Zealand business grow and will support innovation and entrepreneurialism aso this is good news at both a local and national level," Lianne Dalziel said.

The new legislation will contribute to promoting confidence in the financial markets as part of the broad policy objective of the Securities Act which it amends, Lianne Dalziel said.
