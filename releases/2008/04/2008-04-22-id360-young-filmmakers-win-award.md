“Young people are an integral part of Kiwi society, and fostering an understanding of diversity and embracing differences between people will ensure both today and tomorrow’s generations are more accepting of each other’s differences,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

 

Nanaia Mahuta last night announced the winners of ID360 Short Film Competition at an Awards ceremony in Wellington.

 

Auckland filmmakers Thomas King and Carl Naus won both the grand prize and the 16-18 age category for their film No Kiwi Restaurants. The budding videographers described their film as “an introspective look at five very different immigrants and the idea of being a Kiwi in modern society.”

 

Judge David Rea praised No Kiwi Restaurants and said it challenged the stereotypes.

 

“It’s a sophisticated short film, moving beyond the simple tolerance to embracing and celebrating the rich dimensions of diversity through each individual’s experiences, and displays a high level of understanding of film making,” said David Rea.

 

Nanaia Mahuta said the competition highlighted the passion young New Zealanders had for telling their stories.

 

“Congratulations to all the winners of ID360 Short Film Competition. Young people in New Zealand have produced fantastic films that reflect the diversity of cultures and ethnicities in New Zealand,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

 

Short films by the 15 finalists from across New Zealand were posted on the ID360 website where they competed for the People’s Choice Award. Over 5000 votes were cast between 27 March and 11 April. New Plymouth brothers Matt and Josh Girvan collected 1096 votes for their film Play which centred on the brother’s love of unicyling, to win the People’s Choice Award.

 

Sand and Ice-Cream by Finn Stichbury won the 12-15 age category. Sand and Ice-Cream used the kiwi band The Brunettes as a soundtrack to help explored traditions of kiwi childhood.

 

 

The winner of the 19- 24 age category was Wellington based filmmaker Jesse Taylor Smith for his film “A Small Film About a Stranger”. Filmed in and around Wellington on Super 8 the film is a dainty, thoughtful, stylistic back-to-front film about being alive and coming of age, told through sounds and images by strangers.

 

 

The competition was a Ministry of Youth Development initiative, with the theme being ‘Identity and Diversity’.
