Maori DHB members from throughout the country gathered in Wellington yesterday for a training hui to develop networking and governance skills.

The training hui, Te Matawhanui, has been running for the last 5 years and it is considered an integral part of the induction process for Maori DHB members into their role in the public health sector.

Associate Minister of Health Mita Ririnui says the training session is important as it allows the new and re-elected DHB members to meet and develop relationships and understandings about their roles.

“Te Matawhanui provides a great opportunity for Maori DHB members to meet and share experiences and best practices, as well as discuss issues. Maori are also natural net-workers, we are able to meet others, build a rapport and use those relationships at a later date to help and to ask for help. These are all very important aspects for the role of a DHB member.”

The aim of Te Matawhanui is to build Maori governors who have the expertise and confidence to operate within Pakeha methodology and kaupapa Maori – a skill that is not always easy to synchronise between the two environments.

“Like any political environment, Maori DHB members will at times find it difficult to service the priorities of their DHB and the needs of local iwi – and in many cases their own iwi. Te Matawhanui training sessions will enable DHB members to enhance and/or develop their governance skills to allow them to do this.”
