A new Chair, Deputy Chair and member have been appointed to the Pacific Business Trust (PBT) Board, Pacific Island Affairs Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.

 PBT provides opportunities to assist Pacific people start and develop successful businesses, which are vital for developing a strong economic base for Pacific peoples in New Zealand. 

 "I am pleased to announce that current Deputy Chair, Hamish Crooks, has been appointed Chair of PBT until the end of his term in December 2009, and current board member Sitiveni Mavoa has been appointed Deputy Chair.

 "Earlier this year, PBT appointed new Chief Executive Richard Reid.  Continuity of Board membership with Hamish and Sitiveni's leadership will be of assistance during this transitional period," Laban said.

 Dr Fotu Fisi'iahi has also been appointed to the Board for a three year term, bringing his knowledge and experience in working with developing Pacific businesses through his work in the Tongan community.

 "Our Labour-led government is committed to lifting the economic potential and prosperity of Pacific people in New Zealand through the *Pacific Economic Action Plan* and the *Pacific Women's Economic Development Plan*.  PBT has an important role to play in the implementation of these plans, providing pathways to develop sustainable and exciting business opportunities," Laban said.
