Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Judith Tizard has announced the appointment of Errol Clark to the board of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust.

Errol Clark, from Wellington, is a financier and merchant banker with a strong interest in art collection and patronage.

He is currently Chair of the International Capital Corporation Board and a Patron of the New Zealand International Arts Festival. 

Mr Clark is a sponsor of the Clark Collection Scholarship which each year enables a New Zealand arts and heritage worker to study historic art collections at the prestigious Attingham Trust Summer School in England.

Judith Tizard said she was delighted Mr Clark had agreed to bring his experience as a financier and heritage advocate to the Trust Board.

 ”The board’s governance role will be strengthened by Errol Clark’s considerable business expertise, enthusiasm for and knowledge of the cultural sector”, she said.

The Historic Places Trust Board has six government appointees and three positions elected by Trust subscribing members. It promotes the identification, protection, preservation, and conservation of New Zealand’s historical and cultural heritage.
