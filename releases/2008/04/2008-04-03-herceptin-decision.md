Health Minister David Cunliffe and Associate Health Minister Steve

Chadwick said they respected the decision of the High Court regarding

Herceptin.

“This has been a very difficult and emotional case for all involved and it

is now time for parties to consider the very lengthy decision that has been

released today.”

That decision will be earnestly scrutinised by all involved and until such

time as parties have had an opportunity to fully consider it we will not be

making any further comment.”
