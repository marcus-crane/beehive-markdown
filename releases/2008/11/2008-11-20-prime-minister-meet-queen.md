Prime Minister John Key will have an Audience with The Queen at Buckingham Palace on November 25.

"It will be a great privilege to be received by Her Majesty," says Mr Key.

Mr Key says Her Majesty The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh will also make a special visit to the Tourism New Zealand inflatable rugby ball and meet the All Blacks in London on the same day.

"This is a wonderful gesture of goodwill and support to New Zealand by Her Majesty, and we are honoured and delighted."

The ball will be erected at Potters Field Park, adjacent to the Tower Bridge, London. A feature of the ball is a 10-minute audio-visual presentation which transforms the interior of the ball and takes the audience on a virtual journey from the depths of the ocean to beaches, volcanoes, lush bush walks, and rugby games.

"Hosting the Rugby World Cup in 2011 is a major opportunity for New Zealand.  The rugby ball is an important part of that promotion."

The visit to London will also provide an early chance for Mr Key to call on British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Conservative Opposition Leader David Cameron. Both have already congratulated him following the election victory. He will also meet the London Mayor, Boris Johnson.

"New Zealand has a particularly close relationship with the United Kingdom, and it is a valued partner for New Zealand in Europe and on the international scene. I look forward to further developing New Zealand's excellent relations with the British Government," says Mr Key.
