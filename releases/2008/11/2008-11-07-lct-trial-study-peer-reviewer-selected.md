One of the most respected researchers in the field of xenotransplantantion has been asked to undertake the peer review of the safety of Living Cells Technologies pig cell trial.

The Minister of Health, David Cunliffe has written to the researcher, who is based overseas, asking him to undertake the review by December the 5th.

"I am satisfied that the reviews of the [LCT](/release/living+cell+technologies+trial+approved) application undertaken by New Zealand expert committees, such as the [GTAC](http://www.hrc.govt.nz/root/pages_regulatory/Gene_Technology_Advisory_Committee.html) and [NHC](http://www.nhc.health.govt.nz/), were robust and have identified and managed the risks associated with xenotransplantation.  However I have taken the additional step of seeking an international peer review of the trial's before it can proceed.

"Those safety controls stem from the National Health Committee's study that was published last month and my own review of the evidence.

"I have asked that the final report of the peer review should be undertaken rapidly so this should not unduly delay the start of the LCT study.  LCT has already informed me it will not be in a position to begin the trial until early next year."

The peer review process will require the researcher to review the safety of the study protocol and advise whether any additional controls over and above those already placed on the study by New Zealand expert committees are required.
