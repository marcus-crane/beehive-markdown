The quarterly [Household Labour Force Survey](http://www.stats.govt.nz/products-and-services/media-releases/household-labour-force-survey/household-labour-force-survey-sep08-mr.htm%20%20) released today emphasises that now more than ever, New Zealand needs a trusted leader with a clear vision says Employment Spokesperson Ruth Dyson.

"The world economy is in a state of turmoil affecting people all over the globe, and New Zealanders need the government to implement a comprehensive plan to promote and protect kiwi jobs," said Ruth Dyson.

New Zealand's strong economic performance over the last nine years means that we are in a good position to weather the storm. High levels of labour market participation continue and the number of jobs has continued to grow with 21,000 more people employed over the last year. The [Labour Force Participation Rate](http://www.stats.govt.nz/products-and-services/hot-off-the-press/household-labour-force-survey/household-labour-force-survey-sep08-hotp.htm) is the highest ever recorded.

"There is, however, no cause for complacency. New Zealand's unemployment rate has risen from 3.9% to 4.2%. Although this rate remains considerably lower than the OECD average of 6%, it equates to an increase of 6,000 in the number of people who are unemployed this quarter. Any loss of jobs is devastating to both individuals and families and we will offer assistance and support to those affected.

To combat the severity of the world economic downturn, Prime Minister Helen Clark [has outlined](http://www.labour08.co.nz/news/Promoting+and+protecting+Kiwi+jobs) a plan to further **stimulate the economy** by creating and protecting jobs. The plan would:

- bring forward the $1 billion home efficiency fund, retrofitting older houses with a labour intensive programme that will **provide jobs** throughout New Zealand.
- provide an enhanced **Financial Assistance** Rate of funding for regions so local authorities can bring forward projects such as road maintenance and **create further jobs**.
- bring forward the roll out of **superfast broadband** to create jobs in regions that require economic stimulus.
