Legislation to clamp down on criminal gangs and drug traders is to be one of the priorities on the new government's 100-day plan, says Police Minister Judith Collins.

In her opening address to the National Chemical Diversion Congress in Wellington today, Ms Collins said; "My disgust on this subject is not directed at the vulnerable people caught up in the spiral which leads them to crime, it's directed at people who make money out of other people's misery.

"These people are targeting our children. It is past time that these criminals were targeted instead.

"While police are already doing much to curb this menace to our community, we need to do more to make the risks real to people who would embark on this path."

The Minister said there needs to be a comprehensive approach from government and the community.

"Collectively we must use every tool to find these people and strip them of their assets that are the proceeds of their crime."

Ms Collins told the audience that the more countries connect at this forum the better as international evidence shows there are higher levels of success when there is strong inter-agency cooperation.

The Illicit Drug Strategy to 2010 focuses on a three-pronged approach; reducing supply, reducing demand, and reducing harm.
