Prime Minister John Key leaves today for Apec in Lima, Peru, to attend the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) Leader's Summit.

"The summit is vitally important for New Zealand to attend during these times of global economic uncertainty," says Mr Key.

"I expect the priorities for discussion by the leaders will include the economic crisis, the WTO Doha Round negotiations, and Apec's regional economic integration agenda, which includes the concept of a free trade agreement in the Asia-Pacific region.

"Following last weekend's G20 Summit in Washington DC, Apec is an important opportunity for leaders from the Asia-Pacific region to reinforce their commitment to tackling the global financial situation.

"I believe part of that task includes giving renewed commitment to concluding the Doha Round of trade talks.

"A range of other important regional issues will also be discussed, including promotion of corporate social responsibility and better co-operation on disaster preparedness and management.

"Apec is a forum which promotes closer trade and economic relationships in the region and makes it easier for members to trade with and invest in each other's economies.

"Attending Apec provides an important opportunity to meet the leaders of the region's economies with which New Zealand has vitally important relationships. For New Zealand, 14 of our top 20 export markets are Apec members, including the three largest economies in the world - the United States, Japan and China.

"Close co-operation with other Apec economies is vital to New Zealand's future prosperity."
