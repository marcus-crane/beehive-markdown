Foreign Minister Murray McCully today condemned the series of terrorist attacks that occurred overnight in Mumbai, India.

"These coordinated attacks were a cowardly attempt to cause widespread, indiscriminate casualties among innocent civilians," Mr McCully said.

"It is understood as many as 80 people have been killed and many hundreds have been injured in the attacks, several of which occurred in places frequented by foreigners.

"Every effort is being made account for New Zealanders who may have been in Mumbai, and our High Commission in New Delhi is urgently seeking information on any New Zealanders that may have been caught up in the attacks. 

"At this point we have no reports of any New Zealand casualties, but High Commission staff are continuing to check with local authorities as more information comes through. Our staff are also in the process of contacting New Zealanders for whom they have contact details."

There are 47 New Zealanders in Mumbai who have registered their presence with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade on [www.safetravel.govt.nz](http://www.safetravel.govt.nz/).

Mr McCully said any New Zealanders who were concerned about family members in Mumbai should initially try to make contact with them directly.

"If you are unable to make contact and have concerns for the wellbeing of relatives, you can call the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade on 04 439 8000 and ask to speak to a consular officer.

"At this point, New Zealanders are advised against all tourist and non essential travel to Mumbai, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade's travel advisory is being revised to reflect that view," Mr McCully said.
