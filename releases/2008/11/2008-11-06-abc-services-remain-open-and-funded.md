New Zealand's 166 ABC early childhood education services will remain open and funded despite the Australian parent-company entering voluntary administration says Education Minister Chris Carter.

"The Ministry of Education will meet with ABC New Zealand tomorrow to clarify the implications of this announcement for New Zealand.

"The ministry will also discuss ways to ensure children can continue to attend ABC New Zealand centres."

Chris Carter said the Ministry of Education website homepage will be regularly updated with information on ABC as it comes to hand.

"The message to parents and teachers at the moment is that all New Zealand ABC services remain open as usual," said Chris Carter.
