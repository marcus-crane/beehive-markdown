New Zealand's next Consul General to Sao Paulo will be career diplomat Mary-Anne Crompton, Acting Foreign Minister Helen Clark announced today.

"Our intention to increase the level of New Zealand's representation in Sao Paulo was signalled during the recent visit to New Zealand by Foreign Minister Celso Amorim. New Zealand is keen to boost our relations with Brazil, reflecting Brazil's importance as an emerging economic and political superpower.

"Sao Paulo is the economic and financial centre of Brazil. Expanding our diplomatic presence in Sao Paulo will help promote New Zealand's interests in Brazil, complementing the work of the New Zealand Embassy in Brasilia.

"New Zealand business interests are growing in Brazil, particularly in the agribusiness, tourism, education, and telecommunications services sectors," Helen Clark said.

New Zealand's Consulate-General in Sao Paulo was opened in 1999 and is currently headed by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise. New Zealand's Embassy in Brasilia was opened in 2001.

Mary-Anne Crompton will take up the position in mid 2009. She is currently Consul-General in New Zealand's Permanent Mission in Geneva, and has served in Moscow, Vanuatu, Honiara, Rome and Port Moresby since joining the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in 1980.
