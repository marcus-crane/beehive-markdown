Prime Minister John Key today expressed the sympathies of all New Zealanders to the families, friends and colleagues of those killed in the Air New Zealand Airbus A320 aircraft crash in the Mediterranean.

"It was with enormous sadness I learnt this morning that a leased Air New Zealand aircraft crashed in the Mediterranean with five New Zealanders aboard.

"I have been in touch with Air New Zealand chief executive Rob Fyfe to confirm that the New Zealand Government is prepared to offer any and all assistance required in the immediate aftermath of this tragedy."

So far, Government agencies are sending:

\- Two officials from the New Zealand Embassy in Paris to provide on-the-ground assistance as required.

\- Transport Accident Investigation Commission Deputy Chief Investigator of Accidents, Ken Matthews, to support the French investigation into the crash.

\- Two Police disaster victim identification staff to France to assist with identification.

"I note that today is also the 29th anniversary of the Erebus disaster. I'm sure that the thoughts of all New Zealanders are with the families, friends, and colleagues of those killed in the crash today."
