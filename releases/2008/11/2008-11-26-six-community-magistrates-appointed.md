Justice Minister Simon Power today announced that the Governor-General has appointed six new Community Magistrates for the Waikato/Bay of Plenty region.

Community Magistrates are judicial officers who hear and determine a range of cases at the lower end of the criminal summary jurisdiction, such as theft, disorderly behaviour, and driving-related charges.

"The Ministry of Justice recognises the value of Community Magistrates, and the new appointees will enhance the current complement," says Mr Power.

The six new Community Magistrates are: Jack Best, Sherida Cooper, Susan Margaret Hovell, Lesley Kaye Jensen, Ngaire Mascelle, and Kathryn Munro Wilson.

"These new Community Magistrates were selected based on their experience and education, their involvement in the community, and their awareness of the rights of others and of the diversity of New Zealand's society."

The Community Magistrates pilot started in Waikato/Bay of Plenty in 1999, and aimed to improve access to justice and the level of service provided to communities through increased community involvement in the justice system.

In 2007, a comparison of four larger Community Magistrates courts to similar-size courts that do not use Community Magistrates, found that the courts that do use them performed significantly better with regard to case disposal and timeliness.

 he Community Magistrates scheme became a permanent feature of the justice system in March 2008 and operates only in Waikato/Bay of Plenty.

The Ministry is reviewing options for expanding the use of Community Magistrates as part of broader work on reducing pressures on the courts system.
