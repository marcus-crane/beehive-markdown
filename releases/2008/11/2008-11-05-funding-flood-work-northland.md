Building and Construction Minister Shane Jones and Civil Defence Minister Rick Barker today announced that the government has approved a $500,000 contribution to a joint fund (with the Northland Regional Council NRC, Far North District Council FNDC, and homeowners) to relocate or raise homes in and around flood-prone Kaeo.

"It is very pleasing that my colleague Rick Barker has secured this funding and that cabinet gave it the green light yesterday," Mr Jones said.

"This decision should be applauded by all in the North because it provides much needed certainty to the affected residents at Kaeo and Matangirau, the Northland Regional Council (NRC) and the Far North District Council (FNDC) about the government's commitment to the region. The Territorial authorities will lead the work.

"My heart went out to those who were so badly affected during the two floods last year. I heard of their plight, I went and spoke with them and now I am happy to have delivered a result which will give them the assurance they have been seeking," the Northland Labour List MP said.

The half-a-million funding comes on the back of $141,000 of funding approved last month to support remedial flood risk management work which has been completed, or is still underway around Kaeo.

Minister Jones said he was convinced of the need to help raise or relocate homes after visiting Kaeo last year and inspecting first-hand the flooding problems there.

"Issues around raising or relocating affected housing in Kaeo and other areas in the Far North have been an ongoing concern, particularly the potential inability of some home owners to fund this work," Mr Jones said.

"Cabinet has agreed to provide funding of $500,000 from Vote Emergency Management. I am pleased for the people of Kaeo," Mr Barker said.

The $500,000 funding is a one quarter contribution to the combined costs which will be shared equally between the government, NRC, FNDC and homeowners to relocate or raise houses in and around Kaeo.
