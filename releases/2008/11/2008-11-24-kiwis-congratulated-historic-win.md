The Acting Prime Minister, Bill English, is congratulating the Kiwis on winning last night's 2008 Rugby League World Cup.

"The Kiwis demonstrated total commitment and showed that a strong desire to win can beat a seemingly unbeatable opponent."

The Kiwis beat the Kangaroos 34-20 in Brisbane last night - something no New Zealand league team has done in 12 previous World Cup competitions in the past 54 years.

"Thousands of New Zealanders shared the Kiwis' delight at the unexpected taking of the World Cup from Australia.

"They are deserving world champions."
