Representatives of Ngati Rangitihi have signed a Deed of Accession at Parliament that formalises the iwi as a member of the Central North Island Forests Land Collective, Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Dr Cullen said today.

"Ngati Rangitihi's membership to the CNI Collective marks the last significant milestone in securing support and participation of all eight iwi, following the proposal they approached me with only a year ago," Dr Cullen said.

The CNI Collective settlement involves the transfer of the central North Island Crown forests land, worth $196 million and associated accumulated rentals of approximately $223 million to the eight iwi groups that make up the Central North island Forest Iwi Collective.

These iwi now include Ngai Tuhoe, Ngati Whare, Ngati Tuwharetoa, Ngati Manawa, Ngati Whakaue, Ngati Raukawa, the affiliate Te Arawa iwi and Ngati Rangitihi. Together they have more than 100,000 members.

"This is the largest single settlement that has been completed by the Crown and iwi, and will provide a solid base for the economic and social development for the people of the Central North Island," Dr Cullen said.

The Crown forest lands in the Central North Island total more than 176,000 ha and include the following forests: Kaingaroa, Waimihia, Crater, Horohoro, Pureora South, Taurewa, and Whakarewarewa. These forests are owned by the holders of Crown Forest Licenses.

The settlement vests all this land in a Trust Holding Company, CNI Iwi Holdings Limited. The Collective proportion of the assets held by the Trust is 86.7% by value. The Crown retains the remainder for use in settling other historical claims to the Crown licensed forest land in the region. After six years any residual land will be transferred to the Collective.

"Including Ngati Rangitihi now, the CNI Collective iwi will carry on with the task of managing and allocating this major asset, and negotiating their individual comprehensive historical settlements. The Crown is committed to doing it all it can to assist the members of the Collective in these tasks," Dr Cullen said.
