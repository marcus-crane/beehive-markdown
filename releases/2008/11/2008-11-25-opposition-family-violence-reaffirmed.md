Women's Affairs Minister Pansy Wong has urged people to reaffirm their opposition to violence against women by wearing a white ribbon this week.

In New Zealand, most violence by men against women takes place in the home. The statistics for the year July 2007-June 2008 show that 8,909 men were apprehended by police for serious assaults on women. Only about a third of assaults are actually reported.

White Ribbon Day - today, 25 November - is the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and this year 500,000 ribbons are being distributed throughout New Zealand.

Pansy Wong says White Ribbon Day first came about as a way for men to express their opposition to violence against women.

"Wearing a white ribbon and getting involved in the White Ribbon Day events are immediate actions we can all take to show that violence against women is unacceptable and must stop."

Pansy Wong also welcomes the introduction of legislation by the Minister of Justice that will give police the ability to introduce on-the-spot protection orders to help at-risk women and their families.

The main aim of the campaign this year is to acknowledge the many men willing to show leadership and commitment to promoting safe, healthy relationships with families. It also encourages men to speak out and report incidents of violence they are aware of or suspect.
