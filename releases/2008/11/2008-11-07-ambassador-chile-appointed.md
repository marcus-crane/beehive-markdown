"Chile is one of New Zealand's longest standing friends in Latin America," Helen Clark said.

"There are wide-ranging contacts between the two governments; business, especially agribusiness; and education and research institutes; and links are being built between New Zealand's and Chile's youth and indigenous peoples.

"Our relationship with Chile has deepened since the launch of the New Zealand Government's Latin American Strategy in 2000, and since the signing of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement by Chile, New Zealand, Singapore, and Brunei in 2006.

"This FTA was New Zealand's first with a Latin American partner, and it serves as a bridge between Asia, Oceania and Latin America.

"We work closely with Chile in a wide range of international forums on the environment, fisheries, Antarctica, disarmament, UN issues, and trade policy, Helen Clark said.

Rosemary Paterson will also be accredited as Ambassador to Colombia and Peru.

New Zealand has a longstanding relationship with Peru and works closely with it on a number of international issues, including APEC which Peru is hosting this year.

Ms Paterson was most recently Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade's Consular Division, and had had previous postings in Ottawa, Singapore and Bonn.

She takes up her appointment in early June, replacing Nigel Fyfe, who is returning to Wellington.
