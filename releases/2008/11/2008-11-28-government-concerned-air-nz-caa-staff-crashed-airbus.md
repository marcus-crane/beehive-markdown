Transport Minister Steven Joyce says the Government is getting regular updates, and seeking briefings from officials, in the wake of the A320 Airbus crash in France, near the border with Spain.

"The Government is getting briefings from Air New Zealand and the Civil Aviation Authority. 

"Obviously the New Zealand Government has grave concerns and is being updated on developments."

Mr Joyce says it is premature at this stage to comment on what shape any investigation might take, although he fully expects New Zealand agencies to play a part.

"But our thoughts right now are with the families, friends, and colleagues of those who were on board."
