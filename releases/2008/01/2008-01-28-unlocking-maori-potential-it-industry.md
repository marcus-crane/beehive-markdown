Minister for Maori Affairs, Parekura Horomia, today launched the EDS Maori scholarship programme and announced that the Ministry of Maori Affairs, Te Puni Kokiri will match EDS’s contribution dollar for dollar.

EDS New Zealand in partnership with the Maori Education Trust are funding 5 new scholarships for Maori rangatahi studying at an NZQA tertiary institution in an IT or business related field.

"Not only are EDS providing financial support to rangatahi studying IT related subjects but they are also providing them with hands on industry experience through paid work placement during the holidays. "

EDS New Zealand is a subsidiary of EDS Corporation, the world's largest IT outsourcing company, based in Plano, Texas. Employing approximately 117,000 people, EDS Corporation supports more than 35,000 business and government clients in 60 countries around the world.

"Maori have an opportunity to work towards carving out their own place in this new technological era by getting involved in an industry right at its heart. "

"The partnership between the public service and a corporate organisation is also a new and exciting arrangement. Both groups have come together with a shared vision of increasing the presence of Maori in the IT workforce. "

"The Labour-led Government recognises how important it is to get behind our rangatahi who want to pursue a career in the IT industry. That is why Te Puni Kokiri are providing financial support to match the contribution being made by EDS, and therefore doubling the number of available scholarships to 10 over the next three years."
