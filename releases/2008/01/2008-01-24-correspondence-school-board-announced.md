Education Minister Chris Carter today announced the reappointment of the current board of trustees of The Correspondence School (TCS) from April 2008 through to September 2009.

Chris Carter said from 2009 representatives from the school’s community will be invited to be considered for board membership.

“The current board of TCS has governed the school in a highly competent manner. The financial management of the school has been very good, and the general high quality of leadership was recently highlighted in an Education Review Office review.

“I have made the decision to continue with the current board members so that they can complete the organisational changes recently commenced.

“By early 2009, I expect the school to be in a position to call for board membership from its parent and wider stakeholder community. The new board will be appointed in September 2009 from a representative pool of candidates with the specific skills that the school’s unique role requires.”

Chris Carter said the size and complexity of TCS made it a difficult task for an elected board. The appointment process proposed will ensure the school’s board had the right mix of talents and representation to effectively run the school, which has 5500 pupils scattered around New Zealand.

Chris Carter said appointment from a representative pool of nominees is likely to be used to fill any vacancies that arise during the term of the current board.
