Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor today commended Christchurch International Airport Ltd for being the first airport company in the southern hemisphere to be certified carbon neutral.

The company received carbon neutral certification through Landcare Research’s carboNZero programme this afternoon.

“This is a great example of a New Zealand business utilising the opportunity to display cutting-edge leadership in carbon-conscious behaviour,” said Mr O’Connor.

“As New Zealand’s second largest airport, Christchurch provides a gateway to the South Island for nearly 2 million international visitors per year. It is great to see they are showing leadership in this area. CIAL should be commended for showcasing New Zealand's carbon neutrality aspirations,” said Mr O’Connor.

Mr O’Connor said the airport company’s hard work in reducing and offsetting greenhouse gas emissions generated from airport operations is not only good news for the environment but for the tourism industry also.

“One of the goals in the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015 is to ensure environmental sustainability which includes focusing on mitigating carbon emissions. It is, after all, our natural environment and the associated selection of outdoor activities that make our country such a major attraction for visitors.

“The visitors we seek to attract are conscious of their environmental footprint. It is vital we consider the environmental motivations and expectations of our visitors and deliver superb environmental management throughout the industry. This includes going the extra mile to prove our sustainability credentials and our 100% Pure New Zealand image,” said Mr O’Connor.
