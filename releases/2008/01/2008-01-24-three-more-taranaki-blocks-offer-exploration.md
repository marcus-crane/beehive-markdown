Three more blocks are to be opened up for oil and gas exploration in Taranaki, Associate Energy Minister Harry Duynhoven announced today.

The addition means a total of 12 blocks are on offer as part of the Onshore Taranaki Basin Blocks offer, which opened for bidding last November.

“I’m pleased to be able to extend the area for exploration, with the addition of these blocks which were not available at the time of the initial offer,” Harry Duynhoven said.

“The Labour-led government is promoting economic growth both in Taranaki and on a national scale by encouraging domestic and international investment in the energy sector.

“Through Crown Minerals, we have provided technical data which has encouraged investors, some of whom are new to New Zealand, to examine the Onshore Taranaki Blocks Offer in closer detail.”

Details of the Onshore Taranaki Blocks Offer and Supplemental Blocks Offer Notice including location maps, terms and conditions, and free technical data, can be obtained from the [Crown Minerals website.](http://www.crownminerals.govt.nz/)
