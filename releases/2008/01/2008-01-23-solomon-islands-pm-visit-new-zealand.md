Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that the new Solomon Islands’ Prime Minister, Dr Derek Sikua will make an official visit to New Zealand from Thursday 24 to Saturday 26 January.

“Helen Clark said that it was significant that Dr Sikua had chosen to visit New Zealand as part of his first official visit offshore.

“New Zealand has strong links to Solomon Islands, which is our largest bilateral aid partner. New Zealand provides some NZ$31 million a year to Solomon Islands as part of our overseas development assistance programme.

“As well, close to one hundred New Zealanders, including New Zealand Defence Force and police personnel, are currently working in Solomon Islands with the Regional Assistance Mission there.

“Dr Sikua’s visit provides a useful opportunity to discuss both the relationship between our two countries and regional issues,” Helen Clark said.

Dr Sikua became Prime Minister of Solomon Islands on 20 December 2007. He will be accompanied to New Zealand by the Solomon Islands Minister of Foreign Affairs and senior government officials.

Dr Sikua is visiting Papua New Guinea and Australia en route to New Zealand.
