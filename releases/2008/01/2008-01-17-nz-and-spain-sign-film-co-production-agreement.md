New Zealand and Spain have signed a film co-production agreement to help develop screen industry partnerships between the two countries, Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark announced today.

The agreement was signed by Government Minister Chris Carter and Spanish Minister of Culture César Antonio Molina, in a ceremony at the Spanish Ministry of Culture in Madrid today.

"International film agreements give our screen industry better access to a wider pool of creative and financial resources. They provide economic and cultural benefits for the partnership countries and promote the development of diverse local screen industries," Helen Clark said.

"We have seen several excellent New Zealand co-production films in recent years, and we are looking forward to more to come, such as the New Zealand-France co-production of The Vintner’s Luck. This new agreement with Spain will provide further opportunities for our filmmakers to develop interesting and ambitious international co-production projects", Helen Clark said.

Co-production agreements enable approved joint film projects to gain official co-production status. This enhances their access to cultural funding and incentives in line with those available for ‘national’ films in each country. Official co-production films are defined broadly to include television and other screen productions.

Governments also facilitate, within existing regulations, temporary immigration and importation of equipment for the reciprocal producer.

"The Labour-led Government has been working hard to expand our pool of international co-production agreements. Last year we signed an agreement with Ireland, and are hoping to progress agreements with India, South Korea, China, and South Africa over the coming year."

New Zealand currently has agreements operating with Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Germany, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. Each agreement is jointly administered by the [New Zealand Film Commission](http://www.nzfilm.co.nz/) and an equivalent organisation in the other country.
