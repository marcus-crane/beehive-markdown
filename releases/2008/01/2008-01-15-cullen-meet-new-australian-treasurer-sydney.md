Finance Minister Michael Cullen will meet with Australia’s new Treasurer Wayne Swan in Sydney on Thursday.

"Australia is by far New Zealand’s most important economic partner," Dr Cullen said.

"If we want to continually strengthen that partnership, we need to continue to build strong trans-Tasman relationships, including at senior levels in government.

“I am pleased to be meeting with Wayne Swan early in his term as Treasurer and at the start of a new year.”

Thursday’s informal meeting follows Prime Minister Helen Clark’s meeting with her new Australian counterpart Kevin Rudd in December.
