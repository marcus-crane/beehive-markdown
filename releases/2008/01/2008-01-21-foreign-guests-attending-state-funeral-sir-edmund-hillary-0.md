Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that many representatives of other nations and associates of Sir Edmund Hillary from around the world will be attending the State Funeral tomorrow.

"Special guests are arriving in Auckland to represent the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Australia, Canada, India, Ireland, Nepal, Russia and Tonga," Helen Clark said.

"In addition, there will be very strong representation from diplomatic missions to New Zealand based in Wellington, and also representation from Canberra.

"As well, representatives of the Sherpa community of Nepal, international members and supporters of the Himalayan Trust, and members of the 1953 Everest Expedition will attend the funeral service in Auckland tomorrow.

"Sir Ed’s achievements, and his humanity, impressed and touched so many people around the globe. It is an honour for New Zealand to host the representatives of foreign governments, alongside those of the Sherpa community, the 1953 Expedition, and of the philanthropists who have long supported the Himalayan Trust," Helen Clark said.
