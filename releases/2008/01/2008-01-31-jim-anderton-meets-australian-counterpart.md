Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton leaves for Sydney today to meet with his Australian counterpart Tony Burke.

The visit will be the first time the two ministers have met, and will be an important opportunity to discuss issues of mutual concern, Jim Anderton said.

Issues on the agenda include drought conditions both countries are experiencing, proposed emissions trading schemes, wider climate change issues, greater co-operation in South Pacific fisheries management, and biosecurity issues such as equine influenza affecting horses in Australia and New Zealand apple exports to Australia.

“I plan to bring Tony Burke up to speed on New Zealand’s perspective on apple fireblight, and how we have been forced to ask the World Trade Organisation to convene a disputes panel to hear our case. It’s possible for the Australian Government to halt that WTO process by coming up with a better import health standard that will enable our exports to be economic, at the same time as protecting their own industry from disease.”

Jim Anderton returns to New Zealand tomorrow, Friday February 1.
