Communications and Information Technology Minister David Cunliffe is now considering submissions on Telecom’s Amended Separation Plan. Submissions closed on 25 January.

“The submissions have raised some significant issues that I will be giving serious and careful consideration to before making my decision,” Mr Cunliffe said.

“Most submitters have acknowledged that Telecom’s Amended Separation Plan is a significant improvement on Telecom’s original plan, while raising a number of potentially significant outstanding issues.”

“While I am conscious of the need to progress the operational separation process as quickly as possible, I am carefully considering all options available to me. Accordingly, at this stage I am not ruling out any options, including potential rejection of the Amended Plan.”

The Minister called for submissions on 24 December 2007 after receiving Telecom’s Amended Separation Plan on 21 December.
