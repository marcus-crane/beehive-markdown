New Zealanders are better off under the enhanced rates rebate scheme, Local Government Minister Nanaia Mahuta said today.

Some $40 million has been paid out in rates rebates to 88,900 households so far, compared with nearly $50 million for the whole of 2006-2007.

Households are now getting, on average, a rates rebate of $449, which is more than twice the $165 they would have received before changes to the scheme came into effect on 1 July 2006.

"The improved rates rebates scheme has been very successful, and it is making a real difference for many New Zealand households. Before the changes were made, some 4200 households received around $700,000 in rates rebates in the 2005-06 rating year,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“The changes made by the Labour led-government meant that in 2006-07 more than 111,700 households benefited through $49.99 million being paid out in rates rebates.”

The key changes made to the rates rebates scheme in July 2006 included an increase in the maximum rebate from $200 to $500, a greater increase in the income threshold allowing more people to be eligible for a full rebate, and an increase in the additional income allowance for each dependent, from $156 to $500.

“The Labour-led government is committed to ensuring that we deliver greater benefits to ratepayers. Targeted assistance in areas of need can have widespread benefit. We have done this in a number of other areas, including Environment protection, Culture and Recreation, and Roading.”

"I would encourage all those who think they may be eligible for a rates rebate and haven't yet applied to check with their local council," Nanaia Mahuta said.

Application forms are available from local councils and on the rates rebates website: [www.ratesrebates.govt.nz](http://www.ratesrebates.govt.nz).
