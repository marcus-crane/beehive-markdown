Deputy Prime Minister Dr Michael Cullen has today backed calls from West Coast Tasman MP Damien O’Connor for a satisfactory solution to the controversy surrounding Greymouth’s WWI Memorial Pillars.

Damien O’Connor has called for the Mawhera Incorporation to work with the Grey District Council to achieve a solution as soon as possible.

“Although Mawhera Chair Maika Mason has not been in contact, I am sure he is now aware of the controversy,” Dr Cullen said.

“I urge him to get in touch with Grey District Mayor Tony Kokshoorn in order to identify a way through this problem.

“The Labour-led government is willing to assist in any sensible solution that sees these historic pillars protected for the benefit of the Greymouth community.”
