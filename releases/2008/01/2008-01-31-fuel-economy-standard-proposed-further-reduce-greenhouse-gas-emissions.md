Another step towards New Zealand becoming a sustainable nation has been taken with the release of a discussion document on a Vehicle Fuel Economy Standard for all new and used light vehicles entering the fleet, Associate Transport Minister Judith Tizard has announced.

The proposals aim at setting an appropriate standard to improve the fuel economy of vehicles entering New Zealand and in doing so will reduce both harmful emissions and New Zealanders’ use of fuel. The discussion document seeks public feedback on a range of implementation options that would apply to all new and used passenger and light goods vehicles being introduced to the New Zealand fleet.

“The light vehicle fleet makes up 93 per cent of New Zealand's total vehicle fleet. In 2005, road transport represented 16 per cent of New Zealand’s total greenhouse gas emissions,” said Judith Tizard.

The proposed standard is one of a range of Government initiatives, including the Emissions Trading Scheme and the fuel economy (star-rating) labelling scheme, that aim to deliver fuel economy and emission improvements while ensuring vehicle choice and availability is maintained for consumers. The fuel economy standard should influence importers and consumers to buy vehicles with better fuel economy.

“This will also help us to achieve our New Zealand Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy emissions target of 170g of CO2/km by 2015 for light vehicles entering the fleet.”

"The current average fuel economy of light vehicles entering New Zealand is about 210g of CO2 /km. Without further intervention, such as this proposed standard, we can expect this figure to fall well short of our target.”

“This Standard will contribute to a reduction in CO2 emissions, and help move us closer to a sustainable transport system for all New Zealanders. Further, by purchasing more fuel efficient vehicles, and driving and maintaining them well, New Zealanders will benefit from reduced running costs.”

The full discussion document and submission forms are available on the Ministry of Transport’s website [www.transport.govt.nz.](http://www.transport.govt.nz.) Submissions close on 28 March 2008.

#### Fuel Economy Standard: Questions and Answers

**What is the Vehicle Fuel Economy Standard?**

The vehicle fuel economy standard will be a standard that applies to vehicles, both new and used, that are introduced to the New Zealand fleet each year. The standard will not be a minimum standard, in that it will not ban the introduction of vehicles that do not meet the standard. Rather it is intended to encourage greater numbers of vehicles that meet the standard, and discourage vehicles that do not meet the standard. Depending on the implementation option chosen after the consultation process, vehicles being introduced to the fleet will either be subject to a charge per vehicle that does not meet the standard, or will be required to meet an average, across the fleet of vehicles being introduced that year, that complies with the standard.

**How will the standard be measured?**

The standard will be measured in grams of CO2/km. Vehicle fuel economy ratings, as supplied by manufacturers, are often expressed in terms of litres/100km. These ratings can be converted to grams of CO2/km. 

All vehicles should have a fuel economy value attributed to them by the manufacturer, which will have been tested either to European or Japanese standards. The standard is proposed to start at a level that is consistent with the current averages for European and Japanese tested vehicles entering New Zealand. The standard will step down over time until the year 2015 when it will be equivalent to 170g of CO2/km for vehicles tested to the European drive cycle test. A standard for post-2015 will be considered at a later date.

**Which vehicles will the standard apply to?** 

The standard will apply to all passenger and light goods vehicles, i.e. vehicles of 3.5 tonnes or less, being introduced to the New Zealand fleet, whether they are new or used vehicles. It will not apply to cycles, mopeds or motorcycles, or heavy trucks. The only other exemption being proposed is for military purpose vehicles. 

**What are the options?**

We are considering three options for implementing the standard:

- tradable credits scheme - importers are given a tradable certificate or credit for each vehicle that is better than the fuel economy standard. Importers who fail to achieve a compliant annual average would be required to pay a penalty
- vehicle levy scheme - each vehicle entering the fleet is assessed against the fuel economy standard and a charge is paid for every vehicle that does not meet or better the standard
- industry code of compliance - companies sign-up to an industry code of compliance administered by an industry representative group. Penalties would be based on the expected carbon footprint for vehicles that do not meet the standard.

**Who will have to ensure the standard is met?**

The vehicle importers or applicants for vehicle certification i.e. applicants for certification that their vehicles meet New Zealand standards must ensure that these vehicles meet the new standard and that they can therefore enter the New Zealand vehicle fleet.

**What will happen if the standard is not met?**

Under the tradable credit option above, if the standard is not met a penalty could be imposed on the importer. Alternatively, importers could be banned from bringing in vehicles that do not comply with the standard unless they have the requisite number of appropriate credits available from prior imports or from trading with others.

Under the vehicle levy scheme option above, a charge could be payable for each vehicle that does not meet the standard.

Under the Industry Code option above, a penalty will be payable, and if CO2 reductions are not made, industry code members will be transferred into a regulatory regime i.e. either tradable credits or vehicle levy scheme.

**Does the standard recognise biofuels or electric vehicles?**

The standard is likely to recognise these vehicles. It is proposed that the percentage blend of biofuel a vehicle can accept will be a factor in determining what overall CO2 rating the vehicle receives. Plug-in hybrid and full electric vehicles are proposed to have a CO2 value of 75g of CO2/km attributed to them, to account for the carbon footprint from the electricity source. 75g is a much lower value than most petrol or diesel fuelled vehicles can currently attain, and therefore should encourage more electric vehicles in New Zealand.

**What is the difference between the Japanese and the European fuel economy tests?**

The European fuel economy test is carried out with the vehicle’s engine cold at the start of the test, whereas the Japanese fuel economy test is carried out when the vehicle engine is already warm. A warm engine tends to use less fuel than a cold engine; therefore for the same vehicle the Japanese fuel economy test will almost always return a lower value than the European fuel economy test. While there are other technical differences between the two tests, the cold start associated with the European test is the most important difference.

**Why is the Government considering a Fuel Economy Standard?**

The light vehicle fleet comprises 93 percent of the total vehicle fleet and therefore contributes to a significant proportion of the CO2 emissions from road transport. In 2005, road transport represents approximately 16 percent of New Zealand’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Improving the fuel economy of the vehicles entering this country will contribute to efforts to reduce our CO2 emissions, and will help ensure a sustainable transport system for New Zealand. The standard will be supported by a broad range of other government measures, such as the emissions trading scheme, and the fuel economy (star-rating) labelling scheme for vehicles. 

The Government, in the New Zealand Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy (NZEECS), has announced a target of 170g of CO2/km by 2015 for light vehicles entering the fleet. Our current average is about 210g of CO2/km. Without further intervention we can expect the average emissions intensity of light vehicles entering the fleet to be 190g of CO2/km by 2015. The ‘fuel economy standard’ will enable us to achieve the NZEECS target.

**Will new legislation be required?**

Regulations or a Land Transport Rule will be required to implement this standard.

**How can the public have their say?**

You can send your submission to fuel.economy@transport.govt.nz, or fill in the submission form online at www.transport.govt.nz, or send your written submission to: Vehicle Fuel Economy Standard Project, Land Transport Environment & Safety Group, Ministry of Transport, PO Box 3175, Wellington.

**What is the impact on greenhouse gas emissions in New Zealand?**

It is expected that achieving this standard for 2015 of 170g of CO2/km for light vehicles entering the fleet will result in approximately a 10.5 percent reduction in the average CO2 emissions intensity of vehicles entering the fleet by 2015, and approximately a 3.5 percent total reduction in CO2 emissions from the light vehicle fleet, in service, for the period 2008 to 2025.

The expected cumulative benefits of achieving by 2015 a 170g average of CO2/km for light vehicles entering the fleet are:

- a saving of 600 kilotonnes of CO2 by 2015 or 4,658 kilotonnes of CO2 by 2025
- a saving of 251 million litres of fuel by 2015 and 1,926 million litres of fuel by 2025
- an $8 million or 1 percent Kyoto compliance cost reduction by 2015 (at present value)
- a $44 million or 2.9 percent Kyoto compliance cost reduction by 2025 (at present value)
- a saving of $176 million or 1 percent in fuel costs by 2015 or $1,085 million or 3.1 percent in fuel costs by 2025 (excluding taxes, and at present value)
- an associated health impact, in terms of reduced harmful emissions from reduced fuel consumption, of an estimated social cost reduction of $35 million by 2015 and $225 million by 2025.

**Do other countries have a similar standard?**

Many other countries have set targets for fuel economy or CO2 emissions intensity of vehicles. These targets are not directly comparable to New Zealand’s target as our target applies to all vehicles, both private and commercial, that are 3.5 tonnes or less. Other countries apply different targets to weight classes or to private and commercial vehicles. Some examples:

- Australia Has set a voluntary target of 222g of CO2/km as the average across its new vehicle (up to 3.5 tonnes) fleet by 2010.
- European Union Had a different voluntary target for private fleet and light commercial fleet, but has not achieved enough progress.  Now working to implement a new mandatory standard of 125gCO2/km for passenger vehicles (up to 8 seats) and 160gCO2/km for goods vehicles (3.75 tonnes or less) by 2015. Current average is approximately 160gCO2/km for passenger vehicles.
- United States of America (California) About to implement a new regime and has set a target of 127g of CO2/km for vehicles (by manufacturer) of less than 1.7 tonnes for 2016. California’s target for vehicles of between 1.7 and 4.5 tonnes is 208g of CO2/km by 2016.

**Will vehicles cost more money?**

The standard is intended to encourage us to choose our vehicles more wisely, and to encourage us to purchase the most CO2 friendly vehicle for our needs.

Vehicles with larger engines are likely to become more expensive and potentially harder to source. The impact on the price and availability of vehicles with smaller engines is not easy to predict. The intention of the standard is that importers are encouraged to supply vehicles with better fuel economy, which are often smaller. The exact response of the vehicle industry is unknown; the price of these vehicles to consumers may go down as a result of this standard.

**Will the fuel economy standard help New Zealand meet its Kyoto Protocol obligations?**

Yes. The implementation of the fuel economy standard is intended to reduce our use of fossil fuels. The expected cumulative benefit of achieving by 2015 a 170g average of CO2/km for light vehicles entering the fleet is an $8million or 1 percent Kyoto compliance cost reduction by 2015, and a $44million or 2.9 percent Kyoto compliance cost reduction by 2025.

**Are there other benefits of the fuel economy standard?**

The benefits of a regulated fuel economy standard to improve the fuel economy and CO2 emissions intensity of vehicles entering the fleet go beyond helping to alleviate climate change. The reduction of our reliance on non-renewable fuel is particularly important in the face of a fluctuating, and potentially increasing world oil price. Health benefits will accrue from the reduction of fuel consumption and its associated harmful emissions.

Moving to a regulated fuel economy standard sends messages to consumers, importers and the international community that New Zealand is committed to reducing CO2 and its role as a signatory to the Kyoto protocol. In addition, New Zealand needs to keep up with international advances in vehicle technology that improves the fuel economy of vehicles. This standard demonstrates that New Zealand is working to reduce CO2 emissions as well as offsetting our emissions. It contributes to a cleaner and more sustainable New Zealand.

Why is the government not introducing a standard for the heavy transport fleet (trucks and buses)?

A fuel economy standard for heavy vehicle is not proposed at present because there is no information available about the fuel economy of heavy vehicles. In addition very heavy vehicles, those that exceed 12 tonnes, are generally custom made. Any fuel economy test regime would be very expensive because it would need to be carried out on every vehicle. There are no other jurisdictions considering fuel economy standards for heavy vehicles at present.
