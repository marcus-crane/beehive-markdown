The government has exceeded its target of 14,000 Modern Apprentices by the end of 2008 with more than a year to spare, Minister for Maori Affairs Parekura Horomia said today and this has been particularly good news for young Maori.

The September quarter statistics show a total of 14,411 Modern Apprentices, of whom 10,534 are still in training and 3877 have successfully completed their apprenticeships. Amongst them over 1,500 are Maori.

“Our future lies in the strength of our whanau and families, and I am proud of each of our young people who has either completed their apprenticeships or are still engaged,” said Parekura Horomia.

“Each apprenticeship becomes the pathway for a more secure future for a young Maori to take their place in Aotearoa’s economic transformation.”

“We launched the Modern Apprenticeships programme in 2000 and set about rebuilding trade training in New Zealand. We went on to set the 14,000 goal and we have achieved that ahead of schedule.”
