Justice Minister Annette King says she is alarmed that the Legal Services Agency has asked the widow of Karl Kuchenbecker to repay up to $19,000 granted in legal aid for the inquest into his death.

Mr Kuchenbecker was murdered by Graeme Burton on January 6 last year.

“If the legal aid system is producing this sort of result for victims, it has to be changed urgently,” she says.

“I have already spoken to the Secretary for Justice and asked for an urgent report that will examine what changes are needed to ensure that victims are treated in a caring and compassionate way.”

Ms King says that a Select Committee of Parliament recently presented the Government with a report on victims’ rights.

“The Government is required to respond within three months. Work is already underway to address the recommendations within the report, and this includes work on legal aid for victims of crime.

“I am determined that 2008 will be the year in which victims’ rights are properly addressed.”
