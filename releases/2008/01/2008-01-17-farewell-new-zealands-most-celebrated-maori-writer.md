“Hone Tuwhare was a legendary poet whose works weaved together both Maori and English literature in an unique and memorable way.” Minister for Maori Affairs, Parekura Horomia said today as he paid tribute to the late Hone Tuwhare.

He was a distinguished poet, playwright, and writer of short fiction. His first volume of poems No Ordinary Sun gained him numerous acclaims and was the first book of poetry by a Maori writer in english.

This collection also marked Tuwhare’s passionate interest in political issues.

“Hone’s death will be felt deeply by his whanau, friends and all who enjoyed the works of this lyrical genius. The contribution he made to New Zealand literature is priceless. My thoughts are with his whanau and close friends at this sad time,” Parekura Horomia said.
