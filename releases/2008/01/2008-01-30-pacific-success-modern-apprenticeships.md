The Labour-led government has exceeded its target of 14,000 Modern Apprentices by the end of 2008 with more than a year to spare, Pacific Island Affairs Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said today, and this has been particularly good news for young Pacific people.

The September quarter statistics show a total of 14,411 Modern Apprentices, of whom 10,534 are still in training and 3877 have successfully completed their apprenticeships.

"It is particularly pleasing that Pacific peoples make up over three per cent of those involved in the Modern Apprenticeships pathway, and the number of Pacific peoples engaging in workplace training has increased 17 per cent in the last year to 8,835 Industry Trainees, creating the skills needed to transform New Zealand’s economy and steer our Pacific communities into the future," Laban said.

The Pacific population is growing faster than the New Zealand average population and will be a considerable larger proportion of the New Zealand working age population in the future.

Last year the Labour-led government launched the Pacific Economic Action Plan and the Pacific Women's Economic Development Plan aimed at lifting the economic potential and prosperity of Pacific people in New Zealand over the next decade. The plans focus on key areas for development including education; workforce development; creative, emerging, and growth industries; entrepreneurial culture and leadership.

"A highly skilled and versatile Pacific workforce is a goal of the plans, which have a specific objective to increase Pacific participation in Modern Apprenticeship training programmes to at least six per cent, and particularly increase participation of Pacific women.

"The statistics show we are making sure that Pacific people are well equipped to fully contribute to, and share in, the future economic success of New Zealand," Laban said.

"I am proud of each of our Pacific young people who has either completed or are still engaged in their apprenticeships and industry training, and would encourage others to explore and utilise these opportunities."
