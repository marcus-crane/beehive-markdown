State Services Minister David Parker today paid tribute to State Services Commissioner Mark Prebble for his long and distinguished service to the public sector.

The Commissioner has announced that he intends to retire at the end of June.

“Dr Prebble has served in several of the public service’s most senior roles, including as the head of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet,” David Parker said.

“His long and varied service, under both Labour and National-led governments, is testament to his competence and professionalism.

“On behalf of the government, I thank him for his dedication and commitment to the public service, and wish him all the best for the future,” David Parker said.
