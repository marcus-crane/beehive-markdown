Prime Minister Helen Clark says New Zealand’s efforts to adapt to the global impact of climate change have been recognised with the [United Nations Environment Programme “Champions of the Earth” award](http://www.unep.org/champions/).

The UNEP has awarded the prize to Helen Clark and six other figures from regions around the world, in recognition of the government’s promotion of sustainability initiatives.

The UNEP [said](http://www.unep.org/champions/Winners/winners2008/clark.asp) that “three major policy initiatives….are blazing new trails for sustainability and the fight against climate change: the Emissions Trading Scheme; the Energy Strategy; and the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy.”

Helen Clark said the Champion of the Earth Award was an honour.

“For New Zealand to become a truly sustainable nation, it requires government, business, and community to each take special responsibilities and pursue a common interest,” Helen Clark said.

“It is clearly the responsibility of government to give leadership. It reflects our belief that pursuing sustainability is not only the right thing to do, but is also a strategic investment in New Zealand’s overall future.

“Further sustainability initiatives will be unveiled by the government this year. We also look forward to [hosting World Environment Day](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/withyou/wed/index.html) on June 5, which will focus on opportunities for countries, companies and communities to ‘kick the carbon habit’ and make the transition to a low carbon economy and lifestyle,” Helen Clark said.
