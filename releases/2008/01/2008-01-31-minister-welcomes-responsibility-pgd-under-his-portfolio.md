Building and Construction Minister Shane Jones today takes over administrative responsibility for the 2006 Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers (PGD) Act.

The transfer is about administrative rationalisation and a logical move because the functions of the PGD Board relate closely to the other functions carried out by the Department of Building and Housing and the Minister for Building and Construction.

The transfer has been planned for some time (Cabinet made its decision in April 2006),

and the timing is appropriate with the change from the 1976 Act to the 2006 Act with little change initially expected to be seen from the industry point of view.

This complements the Minister’s responsibilities for Electrical Workers, Licensed Building Practitioners, Chartered Professional Engineers, Engineering Associates and Architects.

Mr Jones said he is looking forward to meeting with representatives from the PGD industry, and receiving feedback.

“I welcome these additional responsibilities and I look forward to meeting with the board and discussing the relevant issues Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers face,” Mr Jones said.

He said he is aware that there is some concern within the industry about recent increases for registration fees decided by the PGD Board before Christmas from $85 to $155 per licence from April this year.

“In addition there are still a number of outstanding issues to be addressed from the independent report published last year (Hazel Armstrong report, 2006),” Mr Jones said.

The Minister will also consider board appointments around the middle of the year and will be looking carefully to the board to ensure that the best skills and governance ability are available to move the industry forward.
