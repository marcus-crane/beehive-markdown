Tourism Minister and West Coast Tasman MP Damien O’Connor said he is disappointed that [didymo](http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/didymo) has made it in to the Arahura River.

Live cells of the freshwater weed were discovered last week during routine checks done by the Department of Conservation.

“This is extremely disappointing not only for tourists and locals who use the river but for everyone on the West Coast.

“The Arahura River is known for its great swimming spots and excellent whitebaiting, fishing, kayaking and rafting opportunities. It also has significant cultural importance to Maori.

“This latest find reinforces the need for all water users to take measures to prevent the spread of didymo. This is a microscopic organism so [checking, cleaning and drying](http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/pest-and-disease-response/pests-and-diseases-watchlist/didymosphenia-geminata/cleaning) all boats, kayaks, fishing gear and any other equipment after use is hugely important.”

Mr O’Connor said the Labour-led government has invested $13.3 million over the next four years on a long term management plan for didymo.

“The Ministry of Tourism, the Tourism Industry Association and Tourism New Zealand are working closely with MAF Biosecurity New Zealand on this issue,” he said.
