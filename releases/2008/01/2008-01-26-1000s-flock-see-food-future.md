A travelling exhibition providing an insight into the future of food has attracted over 5400 New Zealanders during the first three weeks of its nationwide tour, Research, Science and Technology Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

The Future Food Roadshow gives people a chance to see how New Zealand science is increasing our knowledge of the food we produce, export and eat, and is aimed at encouraging discussion and debate around the decisions New Zealanders face in deciding the future of food.

“The choices we make about food in the future will be very important, both because of the impact food has on the quality of our lives, and the central role food plays in our economy,” Pete Hodgson said.

“In the future our foods may be significantly different: some foods might include nutrients they don't traditionally contain, like muffins enriched with omega-3, or fruits with increased levels of vitamins. The Roadshow encourages people to think about these issues and help them make informed decisions.

“Food is important to New Zealand – it is essential to our health and central to our economy. After all, New Zealand is primarily a food exporter, and the biggest dairy trading nation in the world, so it is important that we explore and understand the information and choices that are available.”

The Future Food Roadshow, which is funded by the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology, includes a mixture of high-quality video, interactive plasma touch screens and static displays and examples of New Zealand research.

The Roadshow started its tour in December in Timaru, and will visit a range of South Island centres through to the end of February. The North Island leg of the tour starts in Whangarei on 2 March and concludes in Palmerston North on 12 October.
