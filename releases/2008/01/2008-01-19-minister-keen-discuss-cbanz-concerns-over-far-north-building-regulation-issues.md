The Minister for Building and Construction, Shane Jones, says he welcomes the

concerns voiced by the Bay of Islands/Far North Certified Builders Association (CBANZ) President Gordon Salt over excessive industry regulation.

“It is important that we hear from the very people that these regulations and compliance tends to affect most. I read Mr Salt’s comments and criticism with a great deal of interest (Bay Chronicle) and I welcome the opportunity to discuss these matters as soon as is possible with him and his colleagues,” the Minister says.

“I understand the frustration surrounding the regulatory and compliance processes and while I am not a fan of excessive regulation; safety and health concerns in the industry have to be given priority.

“It appears Mr Salt is speaking out on behalf of those in the industry at the grassroots who are frustrated by levels of compliance and regulation.”

Mr Jones says he has already accepted invitations to meet with Northland groups within the Building and Construction industry; as well as Far North Mayor Wayne Brown and Whangarei Mayor Stan Semenoff.

“I intend to host several public meetings very early in the year with builders, merchants, unions and organisations, as well as arranging for the department personnel to meet with the mayors of Northland and their staff,” Mr Jones says.

“The meetings will be designed to listen to all their concerns, including their fears over double glazing in the Northland; and to articulate accurately the department’s position, and how best we can find solutions for all the issues.”

The Minister says he hopes that those who have concerns will take up the opportunity to make their views know to him when these public meetings take place soon.
