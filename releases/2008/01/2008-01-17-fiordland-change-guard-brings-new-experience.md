Fisherman Jeremy (Jerry) Excell has been appointed to a four year term as a Fiordland Marine Guardian, replacing long serving member John Steffens, Environment Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

The Guardians are appointed to advise management agencies and ministers on the management of the Fiordland Marine Area and to ensure that the spirit of goodwill and co-operation that exists among Fiordland stakeholders is retained.

"Jerry Excell is now part of a group that, because of their first hand understanding of the needs of the many different users of Fiordland, are helping protect our most precious unique marine environment for future generations to use and enjoy," Trevor Mallard said.

“Mr Excell brings over 16 years of local knowledge and, being a fisherman, he is very much the eyes and ears of Fiordland. His experience as a commercial fisherman and his involvement in the CRA8 (Rock Lobster) Management Committee makes him a great addition to the team.

"I commend the outstanding work of John Steffans, and the passion he has shown for the community and the Fiordland Marine Guardians' vision.

"John has given so much to the area and has been a rock for the Guardians right from the outset back in the mid 1990s. While his formal input will be missed, I hope he continues to be involved.

"John is a past chair of the Guardians of Fiordland and has been instrumental in helping them achieve the status and results they deserve. He led the process that resulted in the formation of the first two Fiordland marine reserves, Milford Sound (Piopiotahi), and The Gut (Te Awaatu Channel)," Trevor Mallard said.

Over the next year biosecurity will remain a top issue for the [Fiordland Marine Guardians](http://www.fmg.org.nz/), as will contributing to the Department of Conservation’s work to develop a management plan for [Doubtful Sound Bottlenose Dolphin](http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/podcover.aspx?id=33245).
