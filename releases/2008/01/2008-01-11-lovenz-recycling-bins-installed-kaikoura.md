Kaikoura's first 'LoveNZ' recycling bins which encourage recycling in public places were unveiled today by Environment Minister Trevor Mallard.

Kaikoura is one of the first four regions in New Zealand to receive government support to set up recycling bins in public places as part of a trial of the government's Recycling in Public Places initiative.

The initiative aims to establish 600 recycling bins in public places throughout New Zealand by 2010. The government has allocated $4.6 million to install and service these bins.

"When it comes to improving waste management and resource recovery Kaikoura is a leader in the field, which makes it an obvious choice to help central government trial the Recycling in Public Places Initiative," Trevor Mallard said.

"Behaving in a sustainable way is not only good for the environment –it also saves us money and helps to keep us healthy. This Labour-led government believes New Zealand could be the first truly sustainable nation, but we need everyones help. Recycling in public places is an easy way we can all contribute to sustainability, as well as keeping our community clean and attractive to tourists.

“Overseas visitors expect to find recycling facilities in New Zealand. Recent research among this group has showed that [almost 80 per cent of respondents expect to recycle at tourism activities](http://www.tourismnewzealand.com/tourism_info/latest-news/international-visitors-find-green-satisfaction.cfm). With an estimated one million visitors each year, Kaikoura is an obvious choice to trial recycling in public places."

"The Kaikoura District Council was the first local authority in the world, and Kaikoura the second community in the world, to achieve Green Globe certification in recognition of its commitment to protecting the environment and working towards sustainability for residents and visitors.

"Kaikoura's commitment to becoming 'plastic bag free' is also very much in line with the challenge the government recently has laid down to all New Zealanders to contribute to sustainability: 'What's your next step?'

Everyone can play a part by taking a step towards sustainability which works for their lifestyle. The aim of this challenge is to have as many steps as possible registered on the new online Sustainability Portal (www.sustainability.govt.nz) in the run-up to New Zealand hosting World Environment Day on June 5.

Other councils trialling the Recycling in Public Places initiative are the Far North District Council, Wellington City Council and Christchurch City Council. The new recycling bins are in addition to existing recycling facilities in Kaikoura's town centre.
