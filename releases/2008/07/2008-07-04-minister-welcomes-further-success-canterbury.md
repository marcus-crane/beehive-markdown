Today Minister for Social Development Ruth Dyson welcomed the launch of the Ministry of Social Development 2008/2009 Regional Plan for Canterbury.

“The Ministry has produced a plan that focuses on what has been achieved in the past year for the people of Canterbury. This also outlines the Ministry’s priorities for the year ahead. You only need to walk in to the Linwood Community Link or take part in the Pumanawa Atawhai/ Nurturing Potential Adventure Therapy Programme in the Selwyn district, to see some of the results of last year’s regional plan,” said Ms Dyson.

The plan is one of 11 being rolled out across New Zealand and sets out each region’s specific needs and development opportunities for the Ministry.

“Canterbury is a diverse region; we have 460,000 people living within an 800km boundary. Our population is relatively young and yet we still face the nationwide issue of an ageing population. Our economy is largely made up of manufacturing, agriculture and business services. We have low unemployment and yet manufacturing remains under pressure due to the high value of the New Zealand dollar," said Ms Dyson.

“The Regional plan aims to address many of these issues by the Government, its agencies, and community groups continuing to work together, so that positive change can be made to the lives of all Cantabrians.

"The plan outlines 5 key priorities for Canterbury; support children to give them the best start in life; help young people reach their full potential; enable independence; support families and whanau to be safe and resilient; and strengthen communities.

“This plan has Cantabrians at its core. This is important because we know that strong people build strong families, and that strong families build strong communities and regions,” said Ms Dyson.
