High-technology businesses, renewable energy, future foods, health delivery, environmental sustainability, and great cities and towns are key opportunities for new science for the foreseeable future, according to Minister of Research Science and Technology Pete Hodgson.

The Government’s Agenda for Research, Science and Technology (the Agenda) which sets the direction of public investment in research, science and technology (RS&T) for the next decade was launched today.

“There is an unprecedented need for new science in New Zealand, not just for discovery, but for its contribution to New Zealand’s future. The Agenda reaffirms the importance of building on the country’s already remarkable RS&T strengths and applying them to today’s needs,” Pete Hodgson said.

“The Agenda signals extra attention to accelerating research for renewable energy. Renewable energy is essential for us to become a low-carbon country, there is no other way; we need good science and development to help harness New Zealand’s plentiful resources of renewable energy – wind, solar, geothermal, biomass and marine.

“This year’s budget allocated to RS&T, a further $205 million over four years to sustain our science base and start to focus on the areas in the Agenda that government wants to actively promote. These will allow us to improve the delivery of heath services, make our towns and cities better and develop future foods for global markets,” he said.

The Agenda is clear about what our unique opportunities and challenges are in New Zealand. This will direct how we engage globally and this will build our science brand internationally, he said.

The Agenda was developed by the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology, with input from research organisations, government agencies and business.
