State Services Minister David Parker today announced the appointment of John Ombler to the position of Deputy State Services Commissioner. He will hold the position from 1 July 2008 to 31 March 2009. 

“It is expected that a permanent appointee will be ready to take up office by 31 March 2009. A temporary appointment will allow time for Iain Rennie, the State Services Commissioner, to consider the future priorities of the Deputy State Services Commissioner,” David Parker said.

Mr Ombler is currently the Deputy Commissioner, Corporate Services at the State Services Commission, a position he has held since June 2007.

Mr Ombler has been in the Public Service for 33 years, eleven of which have been in senior management positions.

Prior to joining the State Services Commission, Mr Ombler spent 20 years in the Department of Conservation in various roles.
