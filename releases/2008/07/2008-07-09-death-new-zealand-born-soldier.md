Defence Minister Phil Goff extended the New Zealand Government’s sympathy and condolences to the family of Signaller Sean McCarthy, killed in Afghanistan yesterday while serving with the Australian Defence Force.

“Our thoughts and sympathy are with Sean’s family and friends and his colleagues in the Australian Defence Force,” Phil Goff said.

“The tragedy of a young man aged 25 losing his life while serving with international forces in Afghanistan is a reminder of the costs that our contribution to seeking to secure peace and stability in that country involves.

“The decision to become involved in Afghanistan after the terrorist attacks of 9/11 was not taken lightly. We understand that deployment of our troops anywhere can involve risks to the lives of our soldiers, in defence of our country and the values that we uphold.

“On behalf of the New Zealand Defence Force in particular, we express our sympathies and pay tribute to the life of Sean McCarthy, who died in the service of our countries,” Phil Goff said.
