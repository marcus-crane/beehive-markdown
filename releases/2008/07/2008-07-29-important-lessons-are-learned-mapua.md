Environment Minister Trevor Mallard says lessons have been learned during the successful clean-up of New Zealand’s most contaminated site.

The Parliamentary Environment Commissioner (PCE) today released a report on the de-contamination of the former Fruitgrowers Chemical Company plant on the banks of the Mapua Estuary near Nelson.

The site has been successfully de-contaminated and Tasman District Council plans to allow residential and recreational development when the all-clear is given by a site auditor.

“I will be considering the PCE report’s recommendations along with two further reports that have not yet been completed, a health report and a final auditor’s report,” Trevor Mallard said.

“Those reports will be considered together once they are completed.”
