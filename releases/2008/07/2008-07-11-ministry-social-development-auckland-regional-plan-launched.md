Helping young people and giving children the best possible start in life are two key aims of the 2008/09 Ministry of Social Development Auckland Regional Plan being launched today by Ruth Dyson, Minister for Social Development and Employment.

The regional plan is one of 11 being rolled out across New Zealand.  The plans set out each region’s issues and development opportunities and how the Ministry is responding to these.

"The Ministry’s aim is to help New Zealanders live better lives and this year’s plan outlines five key priority areas for work in Auckland; giving children the best start in life, helping young people achieve their potential, enabling people to live independent lives, supporting families and whänau to be safe and resilient and strengthening communities," said Ms Dyson.

“A feature of the progress made with last year’s Regional Plan has been the expansion of the multi-agency Auckland Youth Support Network. The Youth Support Network initially began in Counties Manukau and has now been extended to the wider Auckland region.  This work is so important in addressing the issue of youth gangs and improving outcomes for young people.

“A highlight of last year’s plan is that over the last five years the number of people aged between 18 and 64 years receiving the Unemployment Benefit in Auckland reduced from 31,554 in March 2003 to 5,879 in March 2008.

“Another highlight was the Early Years package, featuring the introduction of the Early Years Service Hubs, and includes Teenage Parent Co-ordinators and an extension to Family Start,” said Ms Dyson.
