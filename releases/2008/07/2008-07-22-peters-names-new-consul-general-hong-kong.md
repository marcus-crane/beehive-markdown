New Zealand’s next Consul-General to Hong Kong will be career diplomat Adele Bryant, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

“New Zealand and Hong Kong have a strong and constructive relationship supported by close business, education and cultural links," said Mr Peters.

“Hong Kong is an important trading partner and source of investment and tourism for New Zealand as well as providing a gateway into China."

Ms Bryant will move to Hong Kong from her current role as Deputy Head of Mission at the New Zealand Embassy in Rome. She has been with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade since 1989 and held previous postings in Vanuatu and Malaysia.

The New Zealand Consul-General in Hong Kong also has consular jurisdiction for Macao.

Ms Bryant will take up her appointment in November, replacing Julian Ludbrook, who returns to Wellington.
