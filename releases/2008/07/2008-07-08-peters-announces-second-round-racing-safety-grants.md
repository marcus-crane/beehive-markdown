Fifteen race course projects have been given a total of $425,000 in the latest round of safety grants, Racing Minister Winston Peters announced today. 

The grants form the second round of the Racing Safety Development Fund, which offers up to $1 million each year to match dollar-for-dollar contributions from racing clubs for projects that enhance the safety and quality of racecourse facilities

“Racecourse health and safety issues are wide-ranging, and this is reflected in the projects that have received grants in its first year,” Mr Peters said.

“The successful projects range from installing modern and safe running rails at a number of tracks, to significant grandstand structural repairs, safer horse stabling facilities, and single-level greyhound kennels.

"A total of 27 projects have received grants in the fund’s inaugural year, and this number is expected to increase in the second year.

“Racing clubs need to be proactive in addressing their safety issues and the Fund is there to support them to do so.

"The Waikato Racing Club and the Whangarei Racing Club are examples of proactive clubs -- both provided excellent applications in each funding round, and both have been successful.

“Racing clubs should be looking at the health and safety hazards at their racecourses now, and planning how they can address them. They will then be ready to submit an application when the next round of funding opens at the start of the new racing season," Mr Peters said.

Application forms for the 2008/09 year will be sent to clubs by 1 August.
