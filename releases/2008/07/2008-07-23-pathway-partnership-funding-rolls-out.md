Pathway to Partnership funding is underway with the first of many additional payments going out to community groups this week.

"Over 850 community groups providing social services to children, young people and families are receiving a 3.4% inflation adjustment, totalling more than $6 million," said Social Development and Employment Minister Ruth Dyson.

“The government has committed to providing annual adjustments for inflation every year from now on. This is one part of our strategy to move all essential social services to full funding by 2012, and make that change sustainable”.

Today the government is also announcing that cost pressure payments made last year, originally intended as one off payments, will be brought into providers’ ongoing funding for this and future years,  a move that will give community groups an additional $3 million in 2008/09.

All the funding increases for this year are expected to be agreed with providers and payments made by the end of September.

"By 2012, Pathway to Partnership will move essential social services delivered by community organisations to full funding. It will give community organisations more certainty, and more ability to plan ahead and to attract and retain qualified staff," said Ms Dyson.

Ruth Dyson will today meet one such organisation, the Mother of Divine Mercy, an Auckland-based provider of services to families who have experienced domestic violence. The organisation will receive a funding increase in 2008/09 of more than $110,000. Their funding will continue to increase each year until they reach full funding in 2011/12.

‘’Organisations like Mother of Divine Mercy are being recognised for the vital services and support they provide.  This extra funding will make a real difference for these groups as they work to improve the lives of families,’’ said Ms Dyson.

Once this year’s funding is finalised, discussions will continue with community groups to determine their pathway to full funding by 2012.
