A special tribunal has been appointed to consider an application to amend the Kawarau Water Conservation Order, Associate Environment Minister Nanaia Mahuta announced today.

“The tribunal will consider an application by Fish and Game to change the Kawarau Water Conservation Order to prohibit damming or diversion of water on the Nevis River,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“Members Richard Fowler (Chair), Carolyn Burns and Rauru Kirikiri have been selected on the basis of their individual skills and experience and their skills as a collective. I wish them well with their work.”

Water Conservation Orders are set up to recognise and sustain waters that are considered to be outstanding as a habitat or fishery, or for scenic, scientific or recreational values.

The Kawarau Water Conservation Order was passed in 1997. It protects the wild and scenic characteristics of the Nevis River but does not prohibit damming of the Nevis River. 

Once the special tribunal has met, the public will be invited to make submissions on the application. The special tribunal will then hold a hearing and report back to the Minister with recommendations about whether the Kawarau Water Conservation Order should be amended or not.

The findings of the special tribunal can be appealed to the Environment Court.
