The Minister of Health Hon David Cunliffe and the Associate Minister of Health Hon Mita Ririnui today launched Te Puāwaiwhero, the second Māori Mental health and Addiction National Strategic Framework today.

“This sets out a path for Māori mental health and addiction services for the next seven year. This will see a much greater emphasis on making front line services responsive to Maori and improving early access to services, “ said Minister Cunliffe.

“There is a critical need for this framework as three in every five Māori will experience mental illness sometime in their life and one in three Māori will have a substance abuse disorder. This has a huge impact on Māori whanau, hapu, iwi and the wider community”

“Te Puāwaiwhero which has been developed in partnership with DHBs will strengthen the health workforce and services for Māori with a striking emphasis on primary healthcare and the needs of Māori “said Minister Ririnui.

“Te Rau Hinengaro, the New Zealand mental Health Survey, shows that Māori experiencing alcohol and other drug issues and Māori with mental illness access less care than others. It is our aim to turn this around”.

“A plan is only as good as its implementation and this plan is now a living document. The core team that wrote this document will be visiting the country’s DHBs over the year and talking to them about achieving health equity for Māori,” said Minister Ririnui.
