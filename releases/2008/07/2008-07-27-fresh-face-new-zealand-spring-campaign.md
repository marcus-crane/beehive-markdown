The ‘What’s On’ campaign is entering its third year and as a new round of ads kicks off for spring it’s time to reflect on some healthy visitor growth from our largest market, Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor announced today.

Launched in August 2006, Tourism New Zealand’s ‘What’s On’ campaign has seen Australian holiday days during spring (September, October, November) increase by 12.8 percent, or 135,000 total days per annum since it was first shown in Australia.

“Australia is a vital market for New Zealand’s $8.3 billion tourism industry, providing over 38 per cent of total visitors last year,” said Mr O’Connor.

“On Friday I welcomed figures showing Australians are leading the way when it comes to spending in New Zealand. In the year to March 2008 Australians spent $1.7 billion, up 17 percent from the year before.

“With growth flattening from some of our long-haul markets, it is even more important that we continue to innovate and adapt the What’s On campaign in Australia.

“An important part of increasing yield in the tourism industry is encouraging a greater number of visits in the shoulder season and the ‘What’s On’ campaign has been central in spreading this message in Australia.”

Television personalities Petra Bagust and Robbie Magasiva, who front the campaign, are putting on fresh faces for spring, with two new television commercials telling Australians that New Zealand is fresh, new and waiting to welcome visitors at this time of year. Six additional ads will showcase key regions in New Zealand.

Three regional tourism organisations – Destination Rotorua, Postively Wellington Tourism and Christchurch & Canterbury Tourism – have invested in an online component of the campaign, which will capture attention with interactive advertising on popular Australian websites.

The spring ‘What’s On’ campaign will run through until the end of September.
