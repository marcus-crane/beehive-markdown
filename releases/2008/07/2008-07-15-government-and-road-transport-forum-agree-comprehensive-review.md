Transport Minister Annette King and Road Transport Forum chief executive Tony Friedlander say a comprehensive review of the model for allocating the costs of maintaining roads and building new ones, and for reviewing the way these charges are collected, will provide greater certainty in the future.

 Ms King met Mr Friedlander and members of the RTF board and Ministry of Transport acting chief executive Wayne Donnelly today.

 Ms King said the outcome of the independent review of the cost allocation model, and the method of collecting the diesel component of these costs, would be completed early next year and would feed into a wider review involving the way the land transport sector is funded in the future.

 “The independent review will fully involve stakeholders from the transport sector generally. The wider review will involve a much broader range of stakeholders,” Ms King said.

 The Ministry of Transport will discuss terms of reference for the independent review with stakeholders over the next few days.
