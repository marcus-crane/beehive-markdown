“Today is a momentous occasion for improving Ngai Tūhoe and Crown relationships” says Associate Minister of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Mita Ririnui.

Over 500 people with Ngai Tūhoe affiliations travelled to Parliament to witness the signing of Ngai Tūhoe treaty claim Terms of Negotiation with the Crown this morning.

“It is widely accepted that despite horrific dealings with Ngai Tūhoe people in the past by the crown, Ngai Tūhoe people are still deeply entrenched in their tikanga and reo, unlike many other iwi who suffered significant blows from colonialism and Christianity.”

“However, Ngai Tūhoe people have suffered great travesty and injustice through land confiscation, the deprivation of basic welfare and other mal-treatment at the hands of the Crown of the day.”

“The signing today acknowledges the suffering inflicted on Ngai Tūhoe as well as the Crowns willingness to improve relationships with Ngai Tūhoe people as a positive step into the future.”

The next milestone for Ngai Tūhoe is the signing of the Agreement in Principle. Given the serious and tragic historical events between Ngai Tūhoe and the Crown, it is expected that this claim will take time to work through but all parties are committed to reaching a mutual and satisfying settlement.
