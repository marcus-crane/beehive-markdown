Strong partnerships and addressing seasonal labour shortages are key priorities for the Ministry of Social Development said Associate Minister for Social Development Mahara Okeroa in launching the Ministry’s 2008/09 Nelson, Marlborough and West Coast Regional Plan today.

One of 11 plans being rolled out across the country it draws together the activities of all of the Ministry’s service lines within the Nelson, Marlborough and West Coast region.  These include Child, Youth and Family, Work and Income, Family and Community Services, the Ministry of Youth Development, StudyLink, Integrity Services and Senior Services.

“Home to more than 161,000 people, in the past five years 1,800 people in the region have moved off unemployment-related benefits and into work.  As at March 2008 only 324 people in the area relied on an Unemployment Benefit. 

“With a strong focus on primary industries in the economy, one of the Ministry’s key projects aims to address the ongoing labour shortage in Marlborough.  

“Other important work will focus on increasing participation in early childhood education, ensuring young people in the region are connected with training, education or employment, and partnering with communities to address housing issues. 

“The Ministry has ambitious goals to improve the lives of all people in the region and the Government is committed to supporting their work with communities to achieve this,” said Mahara Okeroa.
