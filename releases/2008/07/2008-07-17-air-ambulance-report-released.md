Ministers welcome Air Ambulance Report 

The Minister of Health David Cunliffe and the Minister for ACC Maryan Street are supporting a set of recommendations from the Air Ambulance Reference Group, but they say much more work is needed before any changes should be made.

The Group has released a report into air ambulance services in New Zealand, which includes proposals as to how services can be maintained and improved.

"The Ministry of Health and ACC have already started work in developing an overarching strategic direction for the ambulance sector. Many of the Reference Group's proposals will be considered as part of the development of a wider ambulance strategy," said David Cunliffe.

One of the main recommendations from the Reference Group is the development of a lead Crown Funder for air ambulance services, with the possibility of expanding into road ambulances and inter-hospital transfers.

"The Ministry of Health and ACC have already commissioned and considered independent advice on the formation of a single funder for all emergency ambulances. Again, this will need to be looked at in light of a wider strategy, which is expected to be released shortly."

Maryan Street says ACC officials have started work on implementing some of the report's recommendations.

"The review of the ambulance standard has been completed already - The Ambulance and Paramedical Services standard NZS8156:2008 was published in May 2008. A large amount of work is now needed to investigate the feasibility of the rest of the report's recommendations.”
