Associate Environment and Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta is pleased to announce the 14 schools which have received grants under the New Zealand Glass Environmental Fund to carry out environmental projects.

 A total of $22,346 has been granted for the 2008 round of the fund, which was established by glass bottle manufacturer O-I New Zealand in 1983.

 The money will go towards marine studies, recycling initiatives, composting and creating vegetable gardens, with the aim of raising young peoples’ awareness of the importance of taking care of the environment.

 “Our young people will be playing central roles in the future, so we need to build on their enthusiasm for environmental issues, and help them develop a mature and responsible attitude to the environment and a commitment to practical action,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 “That is exactly what this Fund is intended to do. It is very encouraging to see so many schools take such an active interest in teaching students how to better care for our environment.”

 Fund secretary and O-I Environmental Affairs Adviser Penny Garland says the company is proud of the 25th anniversary milestone for the Fund. 

 “Schools are still responding well and this shows the commitment that schools are making to environmental education,” said Penny Garland.

 Nanaia Mahuta said the Labour-led government is supportive of such initiatives, which aims is to encourage community involvement in environmental projects, in partnership with regional councils, the Department of Conservation, NGOs, and parents, and by creating awareness of the simple steps that can be taken to become more sustainable.

 “O-I New Zealand established the Fund to encourage young peoples’ understanding of the steps that can be taken to protect the environment, and I would like to acknowledge the company’s huge contribution and support,” said Nanaia Mahuta said.
