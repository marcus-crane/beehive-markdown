Applications for the next round of allocations to develop carbon footprinting capabilities in the land-based primary sectors are being called for, Agriculture and Forestry Minister Jim Anderton said today.

He said the second round of funding would allocate $500,000 to enable primary industries to further develop expertise in measuring and managing GHG emissions across their supply chains.

“It will also build on the knowledge gained in the 2007/2008 GHG footprinting projects in the wine, kiwifruit, forestry, dairy and lamb sectors.”

“The early projects are already having significant paybacks for those sectors involved. It is enabling the sectors to identify where their GHG emissions are - from ‘farm to fork’, and opportunities to make reductions. It’s a win-win result because reducing emissions can also reduce costs and increase productivity,” he says.

“Many New Zealand producers are now at the international forefront in developing carbon footprinting expertise. It’s about being a leader -no other country is developing this breadth of know-how across the entire primary sector through coordinated government, industry and research efforts.

ZESPRI’s Branding and Marketing Director Lauchie McLean says their work builds on their existing programmes to reduce environmental impacts.

“This is becoming more critical as interest in greenhouse emissions is increasing from both our consumers and our retail customers,” McLean says.

“The research completed to date is helping generate discussion amongst industry participants and encouraging a collaborative approach in identifying the areas that will deliver the best economic, social and environmental opportunities. World class science, such as this piece of work, will enable ZESPRI to continue to take a proactive leadership approach,” he adds.

Fonterra’s General Manager Sustainable Production John Hutchings says their programme has helped Fonterra understand the carbon embedded in every input and output of their supply chain.

“This will assist Fonterra in deciding where best to invest to further strip carbon from that supply chain,” he said.

Jim Anderton said interest in the carbon footprint of products from international retailers and global companies was increasing.

“From Tesco’s approach of carbon labelling products on the supermarket shelf, to Wal-Mart’s information requirements and exclusion of poorer performers, carbon footprinting is fast becoming just another requirement for doing business.”

This is the second round of government funding available for carbon footprinting projects, a key action under the New Zealand Greenhouse Gas Footprinting Strategy which is a collaborative initiative developed between government, industry and research institutions at the end of 2007.

The closing date for funding applications is 19 September 2008.
