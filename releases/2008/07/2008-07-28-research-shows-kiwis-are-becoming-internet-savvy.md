Internet use is a regular and important part of life for the majority of New Zealanders according the to latest World Internet Project New Zealand (WIPNZ) survey released by AUT, Communications and Information Technology Minister David Cunliffe and National Library Minister Judith Tizard said today.

“Computer literacy has grown exponentially and New Zealanders are clearly becoming huge users of the digital world, whether it’s for doing business online, creating content, or socialising through social network sites,” said David Cunliffe.

“The Labour-led government has demonstrated clear leadership to enhance New Zealand’s digital infrastructure and content and this survey shows we are heading in the right direction, and catching up with the best.

“It is pleasing to see that the survey shows the majority of New Zealand internet users have a broadband connection at home, however, the uptake of fast and affordable broadband in rural areas and across all ethnic communities, remains a priority for the Labour-led government," said Judith Tizard.

The findings of the survey link strongly with New Zealand’s Digital Strategy and Digital Content Strategy.  In particular, access to affordable broadband, building a digitally skilled and capable population, and increasing the creative potential of our content.

“A digitally inclusive society is critical to our economic, social and cultural development and programmes like the Aotearoa People’s Network, which provides free access to broadband Internet services through public libraries, allows New Zealanders of all ages and from all communities to benefit from, and experience digital content," said Judith Tizard.

“The survey shows that digital technology is transforming our lives.  It confirms the need for government, communities and business to continue to work collaboratively to achieve our digital potential as a nation,” said David Cunliffe.

Next month the government will launch the Digital Strategy 2.0 which will provide a national vision for the next steps in New Zealand’s digital development.
