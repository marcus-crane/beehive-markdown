Environment Minister Trevor Mallard has appointed a four-person board which will lead public consultation on the proposed National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management.

Judge David Sheppard has been appointed as chairperson and Kevin Prime, Jenni Vernon and Dr Jon Harding as board members.

"In appointing the board, I have selected a chairperson with strong judicial skills and extensive experience of legal procedures. I have also placed a strong emphasis on tikanga Maori expertise, and planning experience in relation to the Resource Management Act and freshwater ecology. The board has technical expertise and experience to correspond with the high level of public interest and importance placed on freshwater management," Trevor Mallard said.

The role of the board is to notify the proposed national policy statement, call for submissions, hold public hearings, and make recommendations to the Environment Minister on the proposed statement.

"The board has an important task ahead of them and I have every confidence they will lead a fair and thorough process," Trevor Mallard said.
