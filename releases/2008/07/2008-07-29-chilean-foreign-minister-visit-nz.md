Chile’s Foreign Minister, Alejandro Foxley, will visit New Zealand on Thursday and Friday this week, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today. 

“Education will be a primary focus of Mr Foxley’s visit. An arrangement will be signed allowing scholarship students from Chile to study here, funded by Chile’s Bicentennial Fund for Human Capital Development," Mr Peters said.

”The visit is also an opportunity to discuss common perspectives on a range of issues in areas such as human rights, fisheries, whaling and disarmament.

”Chile and New Zealand, as well as Singapore and Brunei, are members of the Trans Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement, known as P4, which has provided a valuable framework for trade and economic engagement with Chile.

“The agri-technology sector has been a particular focus for New Zealand businesses looking for opportunities in Chile.

"The P4 countries, together with the United States, are also currently engaged in negotiations on investment and financial services.

“Chile is one of our closest partners in Latin America, and Mr Foxley’s visit reflects the deepening of the relationship in recent years,” Mr Peters said.
