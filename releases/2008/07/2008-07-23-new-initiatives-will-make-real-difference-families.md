The Minister for Social Development and Employment, Ruth Dyson, said today that the launch of the service charter, an enhanced complaints process, and the opening of a new South Auckland office, demonstrate Child, Youth and Family’s commitment to meeting the needs of clients and communities.

Minister Dyson was speaking at the official opening of the Clendon office, the first of six Child, Youth and Family offices that will open across greater Auckland over the next 18 months. 

“The opening of this office gives Child, Youth and Family a strong presence in a key community in South Auckland, helping it to provide the services and support that will meet the needs of families in this area," said Ms Dyson.

“This office will deliver the community focused, partnership approach that is at the heart of Child, Youth and Family’s work.  I know that we get better outcomes when communities, government and NGO agencies work together to support families.  The new office also reduces the distance families need to travel for services and provides a welcoming, child and family friendly environment. 

“The service charter reflects Child, Youth and Family’s commitment to providing an excellent service for these families and children, and lets them know what to expect.

“Within any organisation there will be times when clients don’t feel happy with the service they’ve received. The new complaints process is about putting things right for these people and learning from complaints. In the first instance, clients are encouraged to talk to their local office about their concerns and it is hoped that the majority of complaints can be resolved at this point. If no remedy can be found, then clients can then ask to have their complaint reviewed by the new Chief Executive’s Advisory Panel.

“The three-person panel is made up of respected community members and is independent of Child, Youth and Family. The Advisory Panel will review all the information and make recommendations to the Chief Executive of the Ministry of Social Development," said Ms Dyson.
