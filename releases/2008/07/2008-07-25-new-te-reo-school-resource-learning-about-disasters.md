More than 300 Maori immersion and bilingual schools began receiving New Zealand’s first Te Reo civil defence teaching resource, *Kia Takatu* this week.

*Kia Takatu* aims to teach students how to prepare for disasters and emergencies, and give them the skills to act in a safe manner. 

Civil Defence Minister Rick Barker, said that the resource is designed to be used in Maori language immersion and bi-lingual schools, and can also be used at home and in the community. 

"It is a great way for schoolchildren to learn about the hazards that we have here in New Zealand and to learn about what to do to be better prepared, while at the same time helping develop Te Reo skills,” Mr Barker said.

"Teachers began asking for a resource in Te Reo after the Ministry developed its *What’s the Plan Stan* teaching resource for schools."

*Kia Takatu* was developed by the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management with the help of a working group of representatives from the Maori community.  It is specifically targeted at children aged from eight to 12.  *Kia Takatu* comprises a handbook for teachers, a CD-Rom, and an audio CD for children to listen to disaster stories in Te Reo Maori. 

The stories on the CD provide a Maori-world view of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunami, floods and storms.  Each story concludes with information on what to do before, during and after a disaster. The audio CD is suitable for younger listeners as well as the target audience of 8-12 year olds. 

The resource can also be accessed from the [www.whatstheplanstan.govt.nz](http://www.whatstheplanstan.govt.nz/) website.

*Kia Takatu* is based on the *What’s the Plan Stan* English language resource. The English language resource comprises a handbook, CD-Rom and a dedicated website.  It was sent out to all primary and intermediate schools in early 2006.

The website of the Ministry’s *Get Ready Get Thru* public education campaign, [www.getthru.govt.nz,](http://www.getthru.govt.nz/) was translated into Te Reo last year.
