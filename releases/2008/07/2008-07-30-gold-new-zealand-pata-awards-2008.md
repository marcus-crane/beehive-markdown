Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor today congratulated Tourism New Zealand on its recent awards for its innovative marketing and public relations campaigns in the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) Gold Awards.

The Giant Rugby Ball erected in Paris during the 2007 Rugby World Cup was awarded the ‘Marketing Media – Public Relations’ award; and Tourism New Zealand’s Youngest Country campaign, launched late last year, won the ‘Marketing - Primary Government Destination’ category.

The two projects were chosen out of a total of 258 entries from 108 different travel and tourism organisations from the Asia-Pacific region.

Mr O’Connor said the awards recognise the high degree of creativity and excellence shown by Tourism New Zealand in its development and management of these campaigns.

“The Rugby Ball project in particular, which was seen by almost 138 million people worldwide, was a huge success for New Zealand and a credit to both Tourism New Zealand and its New Zealand agency partners,” said Mr O’Connor.

“The Youngest Country campaign has re-energised the 100% Pure New Zealand brand and raised it to another level in our key markets. By using a variety of new media and interactive technology, it is taking New Zealand’s message to people when, where and how they want it.”

The Youngest Country campaign was launched in 2007 in a new era of Tourism New Zealand’s highly successful 100% Pure New Zealand campaign. Its message focuses on New Zealand as the youngest country on earth.

Though led by Tourism New Zealand, the Giant Rugby Ball project is a cross-government initiative, involving New Zealand Trade & Enterprise, the Department of Labour, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Ministry of Culture and Heritage.

It is set to appear again in London in November of this year, to coincide with the All Blacks Grand Slam Tour. The ball will host the International Rugby Board’s announcement of the Rugby World Cup 2011 Pool Allocation Draw on 1 December.
