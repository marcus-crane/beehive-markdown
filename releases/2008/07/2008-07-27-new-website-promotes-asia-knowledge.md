The new educational website ‘Asia Knowledge’ was launched today at Wadestown School in Wellington by Education and Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter. 

Asia Knowledge, which was developed in conjunction with the Asia New Zealand Foundation, seeks to develop children’s knowledge and interest in one of the most diverse, innovative and fast-growing regions of the world.

“With 60 per cent of the world’s population living in Asia, 37 per cent of the world’s GDP being produced in that region, and China, Japan and India representing some of the world’s biggest economies – Asia is a critical region for all New Zealanders.”

“By improving resources about Asia, schools are providing students with greater learning opportunities and fostering an interest in Asian languages and cultures,” Chris Carter said.

“The 21st Century has already been described by international observers as ‘Asia’s century’.

“This is the world that today’s young people will be living in. For them to thrive and contribute to our own economic and social wellbeing, they need to be aware of the relationships that link us to the rest of the world, especially Asia.

“This new resource for schools will encourage students to think globally and deepen their understanding of Asia.

“A key objective of the New Zealand curriculum is to ensure students are equipped to succeed in a changing economic and social environment. Part of achieving this goal means offering students opportunities to learn about Asia,” said Chris Carter.
