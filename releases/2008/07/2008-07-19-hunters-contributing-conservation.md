Conservation Minister Steve Chadwick last night thanked members of the New Zealand Deerstalkers’ Association (NZDA) for their contribution to conservation.

"Recreational hunters are working with the Department of Conservation (DOC) in a number of ways to advance conservation efforts throughout the country and I would like thank you for the role you play," Steve Chadwick told members at the NZDA’s Annual Conference and AGM in Rotorua.

"I am pleased to hear of the many examples of DOC and hunters working together, such as hunters maintaining huts, collecting litter, controlling weeds, fire-fighting and working on conservation projects.

"DOC also provides hunting information, including advising hunters of new opportunities in the new conservation parks, and has sponsored hunting competitions to encourage recreational hunting on conservation land."

Steve Chadwick told the Conference that she had asked DOC to reduce hunting permit requirements as far as possible within current laws, and that she was working towards reducing the overall legislative requirements. She went on to say she had instructed the Department to ensure that recreational hunting opportunities of tahr are maximised, as well as asking DOC to carry out a review of the use of deer repellent.

"DOC will undertake a careful review of deer repellent to determine whether wider use is appropriate. This review will need to consider the considerable cost of deer repellent and the need to ensure that increased use of repellent does not detract from the biodiversity protection achieved through possum control.

"I encourage hunters to have a say in how public conservation land is managed by taking part in the reviews of conservation management strategies and plans, and national park management plans that are occurring across the country.

"Free access to recreational hunting opportunities has long been a part of this country’s national identity and hunters are an important part of the outdoor recreation sector in New Zealand."

Steve Chadwick also commented on some of the findings of the Ministerial panel on deer, chamois, tahr and wild pigs and said she expected to announce the government’s decisions shortly.
