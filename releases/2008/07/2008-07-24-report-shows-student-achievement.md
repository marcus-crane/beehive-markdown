School leaver data released today by Education Minister Chris Carter shows that more students are leaving school with higher qualifications.

The annual Ministry of Education School Leavers Statistics show that 66 per cent of students leaving secondary school in 2007 achieved level 2 NCEA or above, up from 60 per cent in 2006.

“Since level 2 NCEA was introduced in 2003, more students are leaving school with the qualifications they need and fewer are being left behind,” Chris Carter said.

The proportion of students gaining little or no formal attainment halved, from 11 percent in 2006 to 5 percent last year.

“I remain concerned that too many young New Zealanders are leaving school without the qualifications or skills they need to succeed in a 21st century society.

“Future generations of students will benefit directly from Schools Plus, giving them more opportunities to build on their strengths and stay connected to education for longer.

Chris Carter said that the report makes encouraging reading and will provide useful information on school leaver attainment.

Other key findings in the report are that:

• more students in all ethnicities achieved NCEA level 2 or above, with Maori making proportionately the biggest gains, followed by Pasifika and European/Pakeha students

• for the first time, more than half of Pasifika students achieved level 2 NCEA or above

• the rate of Maori students leaving school with little or no formal attainment more than halved.

“When every young New Zealander experiences educational success it not only benefits them but also contributes to building a stronger economy and society,” Chris Carter said.
