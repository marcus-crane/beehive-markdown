The Minister of Health David Cunliffe says that the Resident Doctors Commission announced today is an exciting new initiative for New Zealand’s junior doctors and a great opportunity for junior doctors to be involved in their future. 

“Today I call on all Junior Doctors -- whether they are members of the RDA or not -- to participate in the RMO Workforce Commission and engage in a process that will bring about exciting changes to the current career pathway. This is a crucial pathway for resident doctors to engage and effect some reform in their sector.” 

“There are workforce and systems issues that must be effectively addressed to ensure a sustainable and strategic approach for the good of the Health system and the health of all New Zealanders,” said Mr Cunliffe. 

“An attractive career pathway that provides a sound training environment, ongoing professional learning and competitive terms and conditions for all Health professionals are on the government’s agenda and the Commission will play an important part in ensuring that.” 

“We need a long term constructive approach that addresses the needs for the workforce in a way that is sustainable, and which looks not only at what the system needs to ensure the consistent delivery of high quality health care services but also looks at the professional training needs of junior doctors.” 

“The idea of a Commission was first proposed to the Resident Doctors Association in April in the context of the junior doctors’ pay claims negotiations but the issues that need to be addressed go way beyond pay rates to look at training and support career development and retention issues. Junior doctors should benefit from this broader discussion, whatever the current state of the RDA pay talks,” said Mr Cunliffe.

The Director General of Health, Stephen McKernan plans to consult on the terms of reference by the end of the month.
