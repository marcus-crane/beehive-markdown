Eighteen councils have been successful in the latest government funding round to set up recycling facilities in busy urban areas and tourist hot spots, Environment Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

"The government has allocated $4.6 million until 2010 to establish about 600 public recycling bins throughout New Zealand. The initiative started in November 2007 and more than 150 bins are already in place in areas from Northland to Christchurch," Trevor Mallard said.

For 2008/2009, up to $1.5 million of funding is available for the Ministry for the Environment to run the project in collaboration with councils.

Councils can apply for support to help with the purchase, installation, maintenance and promotion of the bins subject to final contract negotiations.

"More and more councils are keen to get on board with this [Recycling in Public Places Initiative](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/withyou/funding/recycling-public-places/index.html) and it’s proving to be a great success as the distinctive Love NZ bins appear around the country," Trevor Mallard said.

"The Labour-led government believes New Zealand could become truly sustainable and recycling is one of the easiest things everybody can do to minimise waste going to landfill, a key tool in the fight against global warming.

"Household recycling is progressing well, but New Zealand needs more facilities to encourage recycling of waste when people are out and about.

"This funding is helping to create a network of recycling facilities across the country to help improve visitor experiences and support New Zealand’s clean green reputation," Trevor Mallard said.

- Auckland City Council (on behalf of five councils in the Auckland region)
- Auckland Regional Council
- Buller District Council
