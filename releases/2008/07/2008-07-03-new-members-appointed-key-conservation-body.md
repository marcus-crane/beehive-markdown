Conservation Minister Steve Chadwick today announced new appointments to the New Zealand Conservation Authority (NZCA).

“The Authority plays a pivotal role in how we manage our conservation land and resources, and I am delighted to have such a broad range of highly experienced people on board for that purpose,” Steve Chadwick said.

The NZCA oversees the policies that govern how the public conservation estate is managed.

“I am very pleased that Don Ross has agreed to become the chairperson. Don is already familiar with conservation challenges and the Department of Conservation’s work, having just last year retired as the chief executive of the NZ Landcare Trust.”

Bringing new perspectives are Mike Browne, businessman and former mountain guide from Fox Glacier; Bob McDowall a freshwater fisheries scientist from Christchurch; East Coast environmental consultant Louise Savage; former mayor Yvonne Sharp from Kerikeri, and mountaineer and lawyer Brian Stephenson from Auckland.

Several current members are appointed for a fourth term. They are Christchurch based tourism and recreation consultant Kay Booth,  Bay of Plenty orchardist and conservationist Linda Conning, Ngai Tahu nominee Charles Crofts, President of Local Government NZ Basil Morrison, Wellington legal consultant John Nankervis, Northland environmental manager Hally Toia, and Waana Davis.

“I thank the outgoing members of the Authority for their hard work – Kerry Marshall, Wendy Nelson, Robyn Jebson, Michael Crozier, David Chandler and Barbara Arnold – they have all made invaluable contributions to the Authority.

“I look forward to hearing the Authority’s views on the big challenges facing us going forward, as we seek to work with other sectors and contribute to a sustainable future for all New Zealanders.”
