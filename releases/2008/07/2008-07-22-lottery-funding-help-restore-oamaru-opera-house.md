A grant of up to $3.7 million from the Lottery Significant Projects Fund will allow Waitaki District Council to complete the restoration and refurbishment of the Oamaru Opera House, and the original Council Chambers, Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker announced today.

"These historic structures are linked to the civic and artistic life of the town of Oamaru, and the whole Waitaki District. They are a point of pride for local people and the restoration work will ensure that future generations have buildings which reflect their heritage," Mr Barker said. 

"Once the refurbishment is complete, the Opera House will provide a centre for the district’s performing arts community, as well as function and meeting room facilities. The buildings also have national significance as part of a network of performance art touring venues.

"Since opening in 1907 the Opera House has served Oamaru. Now the surrounding communities and the Waitaki District Council have come together to serve the Opera House.  They have contributed to a process of consultation, undertaken fundraising, and have worked hard to keep the Opera House viable, functional and well maintained.

"The Waitaki District Council has contributed funding of $3 million and local efforts have raised an additional $260,000, but the project would not have been able to be completed without assistance from Lottery funding. The total restoration and refurbishment project will cost over $10 million."

The Lottery Significant Projects Fund provides opportunities for the development of projects that are of benefit at the wider community, regional or national level. The Fund is for projects that have received funding from other sources, including from the community, but are still unable to raise sufficient money to complete the project.

"The precursor to the Lottery Significant Projects Fund was the Significant Community Based Projects Fund. Prime Minister Helen Clark identified large numbers of worthwhile projects, of both a regional and national significance that just needed that last piece of funding to get to the finish line and the Crown fund was established in 2005.

"When this fund expired it was clear that there was still a strong demand for funding of this kind and the Lottery Significant Projects Fund was set up," Mr Barker said.

Funding is for capital expenditure to completion of projects costing at least $1 million in total. Projects must contribute to one or more of the outcome areas of arts, culture and heritage, sport and recreation, conservation and the environment, visitor services and tourism and economic development.

The New Zealand Lottery Grants Board has allocated $16 million for distribution to significant projects in 2008/09.  Lottery funds come from the profits of the NZ Lotteries Commission.  The Lottery Grants Board is an independent decision making body.  It sets policy and allocates funds to be distributed by Distribution Committees.
