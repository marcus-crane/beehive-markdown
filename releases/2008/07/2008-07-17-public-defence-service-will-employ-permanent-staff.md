Justice Minister Annette King has authorised the Legal Services Agency (LSA) to employ permanent salaried staff to provide the Public Defence Service (PDS) legal services piloted in Manukau and Auckland courts since May 2004. 

 

The decision to authorise the employment of permanent staff represents the first stage of making the pilot permanent.

 

Ms King said that in the pilot the LSA employed legal professionals to work alongside private practitioners, the first time that a mixed private-public model of legal aid service delivery had been trialled in New Zealand. “The PDS provides criminal legal aid and duty solicitor services at two of our highest volume courts. It employs 28 staff and handles approximately 2,400 criminal cases a year.” 

 

A final independent evaluation report on the pilot was tabled in Parliament today, she said.  “The report shows that there has been no unusual change in the pattern of private lawyers leaving or beginning practice in the pilot areas, with nearly 100 new lawyers entering the market, and also indicates that the PDS is having a positive impact on the justice system.

 

“PDS cases are generally shorter and have less likelihood of jury trials, depositions hearings and defended hearings, thus speeding the delivery of justice, for victims as well, and reducing pressure on the Courts.” 

  

Ms King said she is satisfied that the criteria set out in the Legal Services Act 2000  --- that the pilot will maintain or improve delivery quality of the relevant service, and that it will not prevent people from accessing private lawyers or deny lawyers the opportunity to offer services to potential clients --- have been met.

 

“The PDS provides high quality legal services and has represented good value for money during the pilot period”, Ms King said. “This is a credit to staff commitment and hard work.”

 

The LSA is now required to consult on the potential locations of the permanent service, she said. Consultation will begin in Auckland and Manukau with representatives of local lawyers, stakeholders and the community, and when it is completed, the LSA will recommend sites for the permanent service.
