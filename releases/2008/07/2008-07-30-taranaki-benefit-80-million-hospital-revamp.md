Minister of Health David Cunliffe today signed off on an $80 million revamp of Taranaki Base Hospital that will include two new surgical theatres and increase the number of hospital beds.

Stage one of the proposal will see a new combined theatre, ambulatory service and inpatient ward block, that will be funded from $43 million of government equity and the remainder from Taranaki DHB.

“This is an exciting new project that will benefit the people of the Taranaki region for many years to come,” Mr Cunliffe said.

Associate Minister of Health Mita Ririnui holds the delegation to the Taranaki District Health Board and is also delighted with the news that the proposed development for the Taranaki Base Hospital will go ahead.

“As with other DHB’s throughout the country, the Taranaki DHB boundary covers a large geographical area and a large proportion of that is rural. It is important to ensure that the Taranaki Base Hospital is well equipped and prepared to deliver all the necessary services required by the people living in their area to prevent transferring patients to larger cities such as Auckland, Waikato and Wellington wherever possible” said Minister Ririnui.

Mr Cunliffe said the decision to approve the redevelopment of Taranaki Base Hospital was part of the largest hospital building and redevelopment campaign that New Zealand could remember with over $1.5 billion committed so far.

“New Zealanders from Kaitaia to the deep south have benefited from this government’s massive investment in hospital infrastructure.”

Seven new hospitals have been built since 2000. Eight hospital campuses have had major refurbishments or been significantly redeveloped since 2000. In addition, ten specialist facilities have been built, three redevelopment projects are almost complete and a further four major capital projects for hospital redevelopments have been approved and are underway.

"The capital program of the last nine years has been very comprehensive. It has kept pace with demographic pressure in Auckland and the Bay of Plenty, substantially rebuilt New Zealand’s provincial hospitals and provided a network of modern mental health facilities around the country, Mr Cunliffe said
