A proposed National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management that aims to set up a stronger regime for the protection and enhancement of New Zealand's rivers, lakes and waterways has been released by Environment Minister Trevor Mallard today. 

Public consultation on the proposed statement will be formally announced soon by an independent Board of Inquiry which will run the consultation process and formally call for and consider submissions on the proposal.

"We need to improve the way freshwater is managed in New Zealand. The proposed national policy statement identifies water quality and the need to manage increasing demands for freshwater as matters of national significance. New Zealand's water is not a limitless resource. Our government recognises it needs protecting and sustainable management, and that we must step up our actions to stop its degradation in rural and urban areas," Trevor Mallard said.

"Fresh water has economic, social and cultural importance to New Zealanders. That is why the proposed statement has been developed to take into consideration recreational aspirations, such as being able to swim in rivers and lakes. It also addresses cultural values, such as reflecting tangata whenua interests in freshwater management. And it looks at economic considerations such as the role of water in agriculture and the need to protect New Zealand's "clean green" reputation and brand for the sake of our exports offshore.

"The proposed statement will guide and direct councils to manage freshwater better. This includes having concrete plans and rules in place to address competing demands for water, water contamination and in some areas declining water supply. Cleaning up our waterways on a practical level can not always be done quickly and will require a lot of work and persistent and dedicated changes in behaviour. This is why we have proposed in this policy statement that our freshwater resource meets the needs and aspirations of New Zealanders in a generation – by 2035.

"I recognise that various groups and communities have competing demands and standpoints in relation to how we manage our freshwater resources. The aim of this proposed policy statement is to find a balanced approach to freshwater management. The statement also incorporates mechanisms to involve iwi and hapu in freshwater management.

"I would urge people to get involved in putting in submissions to the Board of Inquiry once it announces the start of the formal consultation."
