Housing Minister Maryan Street and Mana MP Luamanuvao Winnie Laban hosted a community meeting on housing in Porirua last night, providing an opportunity for the local community to engage on issues of importance to them.

"In order to meet people’s housing needs and expectations for the future, it makes sense to work with our local communities to identify the issues and arrive at solutions together," Maryan Street said.

Issues discussed at the meeting, attended by nearly 200 people, were wide ranging covering state housing, engagement with Housing New Zealand Corporation (HNZC) and government initiatives to help more families into home ownership.

"As a way of increasing their engagement with tenants, I’m pleased to announce HNZC will be introducing tenant education workshops in the Wellington Hutt Valley region. Community members identified a need for this at last night’s meeting, so it’s great planning for the workshops is already underway.

“The workshops will target new tenants, providing information on the rights and obligations of both tenants and landlords, and will be offered in languages other than English," said Maryan Street said.

"As a large provider of housing in Porirua, owning and maintaining around 2739 properties, HNZC have an important role in connecting with our community.

"The Community Renewal Project is evidence of this, where HNZC is partnering with Porirua City Council, iwi, schools and residents on measures like street makeovers and increasing household energy efficiency - leading to strong, vibrant and healthy neighbourhoods," Winnie Laban said.

Prior to attending the community meeting Maryan Street visited a local state house resident living in one of over 1400 homes in Porirua that has had an energy efficient retrofit as part of the government's state house insulation programme.

"Through significant funding in Budget 2008 this programme has been fast tracked. It is making a real difference to tenants, providing them with warmer, drier and healthier places to live," Maryan Street said.

"As a local community, we are working together on housing issues to make positive steps towards change and it is fantastic to see this making an impact on people’s lives," Winnie Laban said.
