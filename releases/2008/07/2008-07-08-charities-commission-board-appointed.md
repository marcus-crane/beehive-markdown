Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Ruth Dyson, is pleased to announce the appointments to the Board of the Charities Commission.

There are three reappointments and one new appointment.  They are:

- Sid Ashton – Chair;

- Patricia McKelvey – newly appointed Board Member.

The other members of the Board, whose terms go through to 2010, are:

- Ian Calder and Frank Claridge – Board Members.

"The job of those on the commission is to promote public trust, transparency and confidence in our charitable sector and I am confident that the right people have been appointed for the task at hand," said Ms Dyson.

Established in 2005, the Charities Commission is an autonomous Crown entity.  It has a number of functions that are intended to promote public trust and confidence in the sector including establishing and maintaining a charities’ register.  The current focus of the organisation is registering charitable entities.  A future focus for the Charities Commission will be on developing other functions, including its education role and strategic relationship with government partners.

The Board of the Charities Commission is appointed by the Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, as Responsible Minister for the Charities Commission.  The reappointments and new appointment are all for a term of three years, from 7 July 2008 to 6 July 2011.
