“The signing of the Terms of Negotiation is a significant milestone for both Ngai Tūhoe and the Crown. It signals a genuine desire of Ngai Tūhoe and the Crown to sit down together and find an appropriate way forward for recognising and addressing those claims.” Minister of Maori Affairs., Parekura Horomia said today.

“In signing the Terms of Negotiation, the Crown recognises that it has failed to fulfil its Treaty obligations to Ngai Tūhoe.  Ngai Tuhoe history is one of great resilience, strength, and pride.  But it is also a tragic history; a history of state violence, confiscation of land, and neglect of basic welfare.”

“As the result of Crown action Ngai Tuhoe have at times suffered poverty, famine, and significant isolation.  This history was vividly explained at the Waitangi Tribunal Te Urewera hearings.”

“We now move to the formal negotiations stage, and the hard work begins – negotiating a settlement package that meets the interests of both Ngai Tūhoe and the Crown. “

“Given the seriousness of these issues, discussions will take time.  But both parties are committed to achieving an Agreement in Principle within a year of this signing, which is an ambitious, but achievable task ahead of us.”

 “I congratulate Ngai Tuhoe in reaching this point in the settlement process and look forward to seeing them progress through the process ”
