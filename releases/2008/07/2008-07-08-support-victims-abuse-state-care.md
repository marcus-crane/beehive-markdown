Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker today announced the appointment of Judge Carolyn Henwood as Chair to the confidential Listening and Assistance Service, and released its terms of reference.

The Service is based on the Confidential Forum for Former In-Patients of Psychiatric Hospitals, established in 2004 to provide an opportunity for former in-patients to speak about their experiences. 

“Given the success of the Confidential Forum, the government decided to extend the listening and assistance services of the forum to all people who allege abuse or neglect or have concerns about their time in state care in the health, child welfare or residential special education sector prior to 1992,” Mr Barker said. 

“This date was chosen as it reflects the time by which these sectors had modernised their standards and improved mechanisms to manage complaints.” 

Once the Service is operating, it will:

- provide the opportunity for participants, along with their families if participants wish, to talk about their concerns and/or experiences with a panel of suitably qualified people
- help participants and their families identify their needs and get assistance to access services on a non-preferential basis compared to other members of the public
- enable participants to access information held about them by the State, in an environment where they can ask questions and seek corrections to the information held
- assist participants to come to terms with their experience and achieve closure, as far as it is reasonable, within the context of the Service.

The Service is not intended to determine liability or the truth of participants’ experiences or stories, nor provide for the payment of compensation. 

“I am very pleased that Judge Henwood has accepted the position of Chair of the Service.  Judge Henwood is a member of the New Zealand Parole Board and has over 20 years experience as a District Court and Youth Court Judge.  The mediation and negotiation skills that Judge Henwood has developed throughout her career will be of great assistance to help participants talk about their concerns or experience in State care,” Mr Barker said.

The Service will be established over the coming months.  Once it is up and running, information will be provided about how those wishing to take part in the Service can do so.
