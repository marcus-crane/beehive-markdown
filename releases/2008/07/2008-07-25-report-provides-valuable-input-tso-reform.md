Communications and Information Technology Minister David Cunliffe has welcomed a final report from the Telecommunications Carriers Forum (TCF) on reforming the Telecommunications Service Obligation (TSO).

The report which was released today presents a collective view from the telecommunications industry on how local service TSO could be reformed.

"The success of new TSO arrangements is dependent on establishing common ground in the industry.

“The TCF’s report provides some valuable input into the policy development for reforming the Local Service TSO. I will be considering the TCF’s recommendations along with a range of other factors and submissions in determining the best way forward for the TSO.

"As I have already indicated, I wish to bring the policy development phase of the TSO review to a firm conclusion during this term of government. I look forward to the continued participation of the TCF in the TSO review process."

**Background**

**TSO**

Telecommunications Service Obligations (TSO) are requirements for the supply of certain telecommunications services under the TSO regulatory framework to meet government social objectives. There are currently two TSO instruments - local residential telephone service (local service TSO) and telecommunications relay service.

**TSO Review**

The government is conducting a fundamental review of the Local Service TSO to ensure the TSO continues to meet government objectives. A discussion document was released in August 2007 for public consultation which identified key issues to be addressed.

The review is focused on considering how the Local Service TSO could be improved and is based on continuing the entitlement of residential users to free local calling.
