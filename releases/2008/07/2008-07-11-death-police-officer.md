Acting Minister of Police Phil Goff said: "Our hearts go out to the family of Sergeant Derek Wootton, the police officer who died in the line of duty, and to his friends and his colleagues in the New Zealand Police Force. We extend to them our condolences and deepest sympathy.

"His death reminds us that every day anywhere in New Zealand, men and women of the New Zealand Police Force may have to put their lives at risk on our behalf.

"The memorial wall at Police College in Porirua, containing 26 names, is evidence of the sacrifice made by members of the Police in maintaining the safety and security of all of us."
