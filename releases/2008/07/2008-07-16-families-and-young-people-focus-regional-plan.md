Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta says helping families and young people in the Taranaki, King Country and Wanganui regions is a priority for the Ministry of Social Development.

 

Nanaia Mahuta today shared highlights of the Ministry’s work over the past year and outline its priorities for the year ahead at the launch of the Ministry of Social Development’s regional plan.  The plan sets out what the Ministry is doing to support communities.

 

“We have seen significant achievements being made in reducing regional unemployment.  It is a positive sign when you see that in New Plymouth recently, no young people aged under20 years receiving an unemployment-related benefit. Perhaps more significant is zero youth unemployment sustained by Te Kuiti/Otorohanga for more than two years,” Nanaia Mahuta says.  

 

“Having young people involved in positive activities is important and will go a long way towards helping them to fulfil their potential and to make a valuable contribution within their communities.

 

 “Through the provision of the right services at the right time, many more young people are making successful transitions from school to employment, training and education.”

 

Another highlight of the 2007-2008 year has been the implementation of the Integrated Service Response programme.  This identifies families with multiple and complex needs, providing services for their circumstances.

 

“Success depends on agencies, groups and individuals working and achieving together and these initiatives are good examples of this,” Minister Mahuta says.

 

The Taranaki King Country Wanganui plan addresses five priorities in the coming year: Giving children the best start in life, helping young people to achieve their potential, enabling people to live independent lives, supporting families and whanau to be safe and resilient  The regional plan is one of 11 being launched across New Zealand this month.
