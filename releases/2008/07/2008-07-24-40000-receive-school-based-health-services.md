More than 40,000 secondary school students will have better access to health services due to an initiative launched today by Associate Health Minister Steve Chadwick.

“Over the next four years $17.2 million will be spent to improve the health of students in low decile schools,” Steve Chadwick says.

The funding will result in services in all decile one, two and three secondary schools, in teen parent units, and in alternative education facilities.  

“This programme is part of the Labour-led government’s commitment to providing all New Zealanders with affordable access to primary health care, and builds on the significant gains already made through reducing the cost of primary health care.

“We know that healthy students are more likely to participate, learn and achieve well at school.  We also know that it works better to bring health services to young people, rather than hoping they will go to existing services when they need to.

"Youth health services need to be youth-friendly, accessible, confidential, and they need to be provided by people who are responsive to the needs of young people. So it makes good sense to provide these services in schools, and the evidence tells us that school-based health services improve young people's access to care.

“Being embarrassed, or perceiving a service as not being youth-focused, stops some young people from getting the health care and advice they need, and we must accept that.”

School-based services will differ depending on each school’s needs, are expected to be mainly nurse-led, may include regular GP clinics, and will be developed in consultation between the school, primary health organisations and the District Health Board.

“We already have a foundation of services within schools.  While some schools have comprehensive student health services, others have none, and this initiative will see nationally consistent access to health care available to our young people with the greatest need.

 "By investing in youth health services we are investing in the future of all New Zealanders.”

**Additional information:**

**How is this initiative being funded?**

Budget 2008 provided new funding of $17.2 million over four years for increasing youth access to health services.

**Which schools are eligible for these services?**

All decile 1-3 secondary schools, Teen Parent Units and Alternative Education settings.  Where an intermediate is attached to a decile 1-3 secondary school, students will also have access to school-based services.

**What will the services look like?**

It is expected that the services will be mainly led by nurses, and may involve nurses being placed in schools on a full-time basis.  It may also include GPs in schools for set times during the week to hold GP clinics.

The services will be different for each school, and will be developed based on the needs of the students.  The Ministry and the local DHB will work with the school, students and primary health organisation to develop health services best suited to their needs.

**What kinds of services will be provided?**

It is expected that the services will be able to provide the kinds of health care and advice that young people need. This could include for example, advice on exercise and healthy eating, sexual and reproductive health, stress and mental health, as well as advice on general health care.

**What is new about these services?**

This is the first time that there will be direct investment across the country in school-based health services from the Ministry of Health.

A number of DHBs and primary health organisations are supporting the provision of health services in schools in their regions. However, models vary widely across the country – some schools have comprehensive student health services, some have visits from public health nurses and GPs, while other schools have no school-based health care.  The Ministry of Health will work with DHBs to develop consistent access to school-based health care for young people.

**What will these services achieve?**

Students who are healthy are more likely to be successful in schools and achieve better educational outcomes.  Unresolved health issues can have a significant impact on a students’ ability to learn and participate in the classroom and if left unaddressed can lead to more serious issues.

**How do we know that health services will improve educational outcomes?**

Research published in the NZ Medical Journal shows that accessible and appropriate health services have the potential to improve educational outcomes by improving students’ physical and mental health.  This means teachers have more time to spend on education issues because they are confident their students’ health and social needs are being attended to and students themselves are more ready to learn.

A 2000-2007 pilot of health services in a number of Counties Manukau schools found that there was less disruptive behaviour in the classroom and fewer stand-down and exclusions than before the health services were in schools. 

**When will the first services begin?**

Services will be phased in over three years – starting with decile 1 schools, Teen Parent Units and Alternative Education settings in the 2008/09 year.  Support will then be extended to decile 2 secondary schools in 2009/10 and decile 3 secondary schools in 2010/11.

Timing for implementation of services during the 2008/09 year will largely depend on the readiness of the schools and whether they already have health services on site.

**Why is it for decile 1-3 schools?**

Prioritising students in decile 1-3 schools means we are placing the services where there is the highest need.  Inequalities in health exist between socioeconomic groups.  These inequalities are not random: in all countries, socially disadvantaged have poorer health, greater exposure to health risks, and lesser access to high-quality health services than their more advantaged counterparts.

**How much will each school or DHB receive?**

The Ministry of Health will work with DHBs to finalise funding agreements.  The level of funding provided to DHBs will be based on the number of decile 1-3 schools in their regions, and funding for individuals schools will depend on factors such as the number of students on the school roll.
