Former Youth Parliament representative Alicia Gainsford has been appointed as the Youth Representative on the Road Safety Trust Board, Transport Minister Annette King announced today.

 Ms Gainsford, originally from Christchurch, is currently studying at Otago University. Last year she was selected to be part of the Youth Parliament and was actively involved in the Youth Parliament’s Transport Select Committee. At the 2007 New Zealand Transport Forum, Miss Gainsford was part of a group of young people who participated in a forum discussion on issues concerning younger drivers. 

 “The Government is strongly committed to improving road safety in New Zealand for all road users.  Tragically, young people in New Zealand continue to be over represented in the road toll.  We want to work with our young people and hear their ideas for improving road safety in New Zealand. I am delighted that Alicia has agreed to join the Trust Board,”  Ms King said.  

 Ms Gainsford has experience as a peer tutor and mentor.  In 2004 she was selected by the Christchurch City Council to travel to Japan to represent Christchurch youth.

 “It is really encouraging that young people, such as Alicia, are so enthusiastic and committed to the improvement of road safety. I believe her ability to network and engage effectively with her peers about road safety issues will help to progress the important work of the Trust,” Ms King said.

 Road Safety Trust Chair, Yvonne Sharp said Miss Gainford’s appointment to the Board will provide an important youth perspective.

  “We recognise the importance of the youth voice and will welcome the dimension Alicia’s contribution will make to the Trust,” she said.

 Ms Gainsford’s appointment is for three years from 1 July 2008.

The Road Safety Trust funds community safety initiatives, research and study awards, training, education, private sector technological developments beneficial to road safety, and any other specific projects that the Trustees consider are likely to contribute to improved safety on roads.

 Further information on the work of the Road Safety Trust is available on the Trust’s website [http://www.roadsafety.govt.nz](http://www.roadsafety.govt.nz/).
