Local Government Minister Nanaia Mahuta has today welcomed the release of the Local Government Commission Summary report on the Local Government Act 2002 and the Local Electoral Act 2001.

“It finds that both Acts are fundamentally sound and assist in achieving their legislative and policy purpose,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

 “It is good to see these favourable findings, together with recommendations to improve practice across the sector and gain clarity in legislative intent.”

The Local Government Act 2002 required the Commission to carry out the review after the 2007 local body elections, and they have made a number of recommendations.

“The Commission’s principal recommendation for the Local Government Act centre around the development of good practice, and for the Local Electoral Act, on some legislative amendments,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“It’s good to note the Commission agrees with the importance of preparing long-term council community plans and I note it is not seeking changes in the timing and auditing of these plans under the current Local Government Act.”

The Commission was happy with the provisions for local authority decision-making requirements, and the way local authorities worked to report on community outcomes.

It also called for an independent audit of the effectiveness of local authority engagement with Maori.

The Commission saw no need for changes under the Local Electoral Act to the ability for people to choose between the Single Transferable Vote or First Past the Post, electoral expense limits and the establishment of Maori wards.  The Commission wanted more work done around the possible introduction of electronic voting in local elections.

“I look forward to receiving the Commission’s full report at the end of the month,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
