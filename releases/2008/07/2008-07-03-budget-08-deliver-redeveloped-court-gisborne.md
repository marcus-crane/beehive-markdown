Courts Minister Rick Barker has announced today that Budget 08 has provided funding for the redevelopment of the Gisborne courthouse. The announcement came during a visit to the Gisborne courthouse by the Minister and Labour MP Moana Mackey.

"Funding in this year's Budget will allow for major redevelopment of the Gisborne courthouse and will pull together all the region's court functions under one roof,” Mr Barker said.

"This is great news for the people of Gisborne and part of the government's wider building programme aimed at delivering first class justice services for all New Zealanders.

"$10.6 million has been allocated for this project which will include a new family and youth court.

"Since 1999, 41 court building projects have been completed up and down the country. This includes 5 new Courthouses and 28 refurbishments.

"Courthouses are a point of civic pride for local communities and it is important that they reflect the level of importance that we as New Zealanders place on the administration of justice."

Locally based MP Moana Mackey also welcomed the news saying that staff and court users in Gisborne and the East Coast deserve a new, modern facility.

"I am really pleased that Budget 08 is going to deliver a redeveloped courthouse in Gisborne. This funding will make a huge difference for the people who are involved professionally with the court and the wider community," Moana Mackey said.

At this stage the timeframe for construction is still being finalised. Concept plans will be developed that meet the needs of local court users and the community, then a tender for construction will be called next year.
