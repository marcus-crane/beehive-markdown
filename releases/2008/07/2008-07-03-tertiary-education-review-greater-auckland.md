Today Pete Hodgson Minister for Tertiary Education announced a Review of Tertiary Education across the Auckland region to identify the contribution of tertiary education sector to the development of Auckland as a globally competitive city.

“Auckland is New Zealand’s major centre of population growth and home to a range of diverse and vibrant communities. Having access to high quality tertiary education is vital in order to support Auckland to meet the significant challenges and opportunities it faces, particularly in Counties Manukau and Waitakere,” Pete Hodgson said.

“Auckland already has a range of tertiary providers offering high-quality, relevant provision and they have an integral role both in the review and the implementation of the outcomes. I have asked the Tertiary Education Commission to develop a framework within which it can make the right investment decisions to deliver for Auckland beyond 2010,” he said.

The review was announced at the launch of AUT’s new university campus in Counties Manukau.

The review will work closely with the Government Urban and Economic Development Office for Auckland (GUEDO).

Pete Hodgson has asked the Tertiary Education Commission to commence the review immediately and to report back to Cabinet by 31 July 2009.
