Sport and Recreation Minister Clayton Cosgrove has today welcomed the announcement of the new committee to undertake an independent review of New Zealand Rugby League (NZRL).

The eight member committee to be chaired by Sir John Anderson has been jointly appointed by the NZRL and Crown agency Sport and Recreation New Zealand (SPARC).

Mr Cosgrove said he fully supports the intent and purpose of the review.

“Rugby League is a bedrock sport in New Zealand and has a long and proud history. It is vital then that its administration is as strong and vibrant as possible to ensure it encourages growth at the grassroots level and maintains its status in our sporting landscape.”

The review is being undertaken following concerns expressed by the government about the health and stability of rugby league in New Zealand.  SPARC and the NZRL agreed an independent review would be a positive step to ensure any changes to the sports administration were constructive, sustainable and would take rugby league in the best possible direction.

“I applaud the NZRL in working with SPARC to look to improve and strengthen the administration of the game. The quality of the review committee announced will help achieve that aim,” Mr Cosgrove said.

The review committee will commence work in August and it is expected to present its findings in November to the NZRL Board and the government.

The committee members - who come from a variety of legal, sporting and business backgrounds - are; Sir John Anderson KBE (Chair), Howie Tamati, Don Mackinnon, Wayne Scurrah, Elizabeth Coutts, Graeme Sole, Cameron McGregor, and Peter Wilson.
