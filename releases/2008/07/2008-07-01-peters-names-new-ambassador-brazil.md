New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Brazil will be career diplomat Mark Trainor, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

 

“The relationship between New Zealand and Brazil has advanced significantly in the past few years on all fronts, particularly since our embassy in Brasilia was opened by Prime Minister Helen Clark in 2001,” Mr Peters said.

 

 “This reflects the importance the government accords Brazil and the surrounding region through its Latin America Strategy.

 

“We now have large numbers of Brazilian students coming to New Zealand to study and New Zealand companies are increasingly active in Brazil through investments and licensing arrangements.

 

“Brazil is an emerging major power, and a leading player in the World Trade Organization and United Nations.  We co-operate closely in those forums on such issues as trade liberalisation, the environment, nuclear disarmament, and human rights, and we are both active members of the Cairns Group of agriculture exporting countries,” Mr Peters said.

 

Mr Trainor is currently deputy director of the trade negotiations division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and has previously been posted to Manila, Geneva and Tokyo. He takes up his appointment in December, replacing Alison Mann who is returning to Wellington.
