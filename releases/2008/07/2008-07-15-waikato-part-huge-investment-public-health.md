Prime Minister Helen Clark and Health Minister David Cunliffe today attended the [official opening](http://www.waikatodhb.govt.nz/news/pageid/2145840479/Official_opening_for_new_hospital_buildings) of the first facilities to be completed at Waikato Hospital as part of the Waikato District Health Board’s $215 million redevelopment programme.

“The investment in these new facilities at Waikato Hospital is one of 32 major building projects in the public health system begun or completed by the Labour-led Government, with more on the way,” Helen Clark said.

Helen Clark said that the Government is very committed to continuing to invest in the facilities, staff, and services of the public health system.

"More than **$1.5 billion has been invested in major capital projects in the public health system since 1999**. Major projects approved in the nine years prior to 1999 amounted to less than one-third of the investment we have since made in this area.

“**Seven new hospitals** have been built since 2000. Eight hospital campuses have had major refurbishments or been significantly redeveloped since 2000.

“In addition, **ten specialist facilities** have been built; three more redevelopment projects are almost complete; and a further four major capital projects for hospital redevelopments have been approved and are underway.

“The Waikato DHB is responsible for planning, funding, and providing health and disability support services for more than 350,000 people. It has an annual turnover of $915 million and employs more than 5,000 people.

“These are big numbers. But at the heart of the public health system is one person – the patient, and one objective – providing the best possible service,” Helen Clark said.

David Cunliffe said that Hutt Valley DHB had [recently gained approval](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/hutt+valley+dhb+redevelopment+gets+go+ahead) for a plan to spend more than $80 million redeveloping its Accident and Emergency Department and theatres.

“The Government’s investment in new facilities and refurbishment has benefited patients from Kaitaia to Bluff and almost every region in between.

"Since 1999 the capital programme for the public health system has been very comprehensive. It is dealing with demographic pressures in Auckland and the Bay of Plenty, substantially rebuilding a number of regional hospitals, and also providing a network of modern mental health facilities around the country,” David Cunliffe said.
