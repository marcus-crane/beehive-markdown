The release of an updated SuperGold Card directory, which will be delivered to more than half a million senior New Zealanders, has been welcomed by Associate Senior Citizens Minister Winston Peters today

"The new directory contains more than 850 business partners offering a variety of discounts across a wide range of goods and services," said Mr Peters.

"The increase in businesses that have joined the programme since it was launched in August last year is impressive. Almost 5,000 business outlets throughout New Zealand are now offering SuperGold Card discounts.

“SuperGold Card holders should check their directories and support the range of businesses in their area that are on board with the programme.

"Some major businesses have joined the programme, such as Westpac, New World and New Zealand Post, so that New Zealand’s SuperGold Card offers more for seniors than similar cards in several Australian states,” Mr Peters said.

The card provides discounts on a wide range of everyday goods and services, as well as access to central and local government entitlements previously received through a Super Card or a Community Services Card.

Budget 2008 has provided $72 million over four years to provide free off-peak travel for SuperGold Card holders on public transport, and $18 million over four years to fund a significant increase in the subsidy for hearing aids from 1 October.

Land Transport New Zealand is working with regional councils to deliver the free off-peak public transport concession and more details on launch dates will be released as they become available.
