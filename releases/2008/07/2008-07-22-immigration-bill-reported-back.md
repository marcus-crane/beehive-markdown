Minister of Immigration Clayton Cosgrove says today’s reporting back of the Immigration Bill by the Transport and Industrial Relations Committee marks another important milestone in the modernising of New Zealand’s immigration laws.

The government’s Immigration Bill is the biggest rewrite of immigration law for two decades, and it will replace the outdated, inflexible Immigration Act 1987.

Mr Cosgrove said the Bill provides the framework for a modern immigration system.

“People are moving around the world at unprecedented levels; as tourists, students, workers or permanent migrants. This provides challenges and opportunities for New Zealand.

“New Zealand has to stay in the race with modern immigration legislation which allows us to build a modern immigration system, and that can protect our borders from the people that may be a risk.

"It provides the right balance between allowing us to choose the migrants we want and need – and protecting our national interests, and ensuring that we can protect our borders. It also enables us to successfully fulfil our immigration-related international obligations.”

Ninety written submissions were received on the Bill. The Committee also heard 67 oral submissions.

“It is important to get this feedback from the public, interest groups and those with either professional or personal experience in immigration. The submitters have all made a valuable contribution to the Bill by participating,” Mr Cosgrove said.

The Committee has made several changes to the Bill, in order to reflect key concerns from submitters and stakeholders.

The key changes relate to the:

- classified information system,
- refugee and protection system, and
- the detention and monitoring system.

Mr Cosgrove said these changes are supported by the government as they will make the immigration system more efficient and effective. “With this Bill, immigration will continue to make its essential contribution to New Zealand’s economy and continue to enrich us as a society,” Mr Cosgrove said.

“I would like to thank the Committee for its hard work and everyone who has been engaged in the Immigration Act review over the past three and a half years, including those who took the effort to make submissions. The government will continue to progress the new legislation in the comprehensive and consultative manner it has to date.”
