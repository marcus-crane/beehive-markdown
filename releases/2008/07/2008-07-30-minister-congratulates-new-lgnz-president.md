Local Government Minister Nanaia Mahuta today congratulates new Local Government New Zealand President, Hastings Mayor Lawrence Yule.

“Local Government New Zealand has an important relationship with central government and I am confident Lawrence Yule will ensure this strong relationship continues,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

Lawrence Yule was voted President at the Local Government New Zealand conference in Rotorua today.  He will replace Basil Morrison, who was in the role for eight years.

“Lawrence Yule has a lot of experience in local body politics as Mayor of Hastings District Council since 2001, and the leadership he has taken on various boards will help him in his new role,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“He has been particularly active as provincial sector chair and member of the National Council of Local Government, with special responsibility for the transport portfolio.

“Local Government New Zealand is facing challenging times and the leadership he provides will be crucial.”

Wellington Mayor Kerry Prendergast will continue in her role as Vice President.

“The continuity which Kerry Prendergast brings is important as Local Government New Zealand looks to the future,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“Local government plays a major role in ensuring we progress towards achieving better outcomes for our communities and country, and Lawrence Yule and Kerry Prendergast will ensure we do this.  I congratulate them.” Nanaia Mahuta said.
