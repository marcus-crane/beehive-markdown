New Zealand is to work with the United States to promote the use of cleaner and more efficient sources of energy in island nations and territories, Energy Minister David Parker announced today.

The New Zealand Government, the United States Federal Government and the State Government of Hawaii have signed a new initiative, the International Partnership for Energy Development in Island Nations (EDIN).

EDIN will provide significant opportunities for New Zealand to engage with the US, and other future EDIN partners, on renewable energy research and development, government policy, and the commercial deployment of renewable energy technology, David Parker said.

“This recognises New Zealand’s role as a world leader in renewable energy development, as evidenced by our goal of reaching 90 percent renewable electricity by 2025.

“This partnership will further enhance our environmental reputation and create business opportunities for New Zealanders with expertise and experience in this field.

“The EDIN Partnership will allow us to share our renewable energy and energy efficiency know-how, and to benefit from the considerable deployment capabilities of the US in the area of renewable energy and energy efficiency technology.”

Additional nations will be invited to join the partnership as it gets established.

“There will be the potential for us to share the renewable energy outcomes of EDIN with our Pacific Island neighbours further down the track,” David Parker said.

Terms of reference for the partnership were signed in the Bahamas this morning by the US Department of Energy’s Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Andy Karsner, and New Zealand’s Ambassador to the US, Roy Ferguson.
