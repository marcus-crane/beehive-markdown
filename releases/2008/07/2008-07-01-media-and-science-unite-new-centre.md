An open and strong relationship between the media and science is important for New Zealand to benefit from both public and private investment in the science system, Minister of Research, Science and Technology, Pete Hodgson said today.

Speaking at the new Science Media Centre’s launch in Auckland, Pete Hodgson said that by bringing journalists and scientists together, the Centre would aim to improve communications so that journalists could come to their own conclusions based on sound scientific research and the input of the scientific community.

“No matter how great an idea, it is of little value if people aren’t aware of it and don’t pick it up and use it, and the media have a key role to play in that process,” he said.

“More important though, is the central role the media have in encouraging and shaping the debates that will result from the opportunities and challenges science will inevitably create.”

The Centre is being operated by the Royal Society of New Zealand which won an open tender to run the Centre independent from government.

It will provide a “front door” into the science sector for members of the media who are interested in developing links into the sector or who have less experience of incorporating a scientific aspect into their work.
