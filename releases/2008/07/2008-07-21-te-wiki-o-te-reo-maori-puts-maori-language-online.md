"Maori Language Week is an entire week dedicated to celebrating the beauty of one our most paramount taonga tuku iho –Te reo Maori. The launch of the I-Papakupu builds on efforts to ensure that Te Reo remains a living language within digitalised times" Minister of Maori Affairs, Parekura Horomia said today.

Tonight’s launch of the I-Papakupu is an exciting prelude to the launch of the Papakupu proper later this year. The hard copy Papakupu will include 25,000 word entries with definitions including synonyms, passives and nominals.

I-Papapkupu is a free electronic interface of the first Maori monolingual dictionary that has been developed by Te Taura Whiri over several years.

The dictionary will provide a permanent record of the Maori language described and defined through Maori eyes. It also captures the knowledge and wisdom of our kaumatua and describes the Māori language in its own, culturally authentic terms, as defined by leading Māori linguists and scholars.

This has been a significant undertaking for Te Taura Whiri, and the finished product represents an important resource in the revitalisation of the Māori language.

The theme of Maori Language Week 2008 is ‘Te Reo I te Kainga’. The challenge for all of us is to take the knowledge contained in the dictionary and use it among our whanau.

The dictionary is now available online on Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori’s website [www.koreromaori.co.nz](http://www.koreromaori.co.nz/). Print copies of the dictionary will be available from retail outlets in September 2008.
