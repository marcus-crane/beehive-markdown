Conservation Minister Steve Chadwick has appointed Environment Court Commissioner Kathryn Edmonds to the Board of Inquiry on the Proposed New Zealand Coastal Policy Statement.

“I am pleased to announce the appointment of Kathryn Edmonds to the Board, following Auckland planning consultant David Hill’s resignation due to pre-existing work commitments,” Steve Chadwick said.

The Board was appointed in February to carry out public consultation on the Proposed New Zealand Coastal Policy Statement 2008 which will guide councils’ management of work and development on the New Zealand’s coast. The Board received 538 submissions on the draft Statement and is due to begin hearings next month and report to the Minister in December.

“Kathryn has more than 30 years’ experience in resource management and planning and will make an excellent contribution to the Board.

“I am sorry to lose David, but understand that the extended hearing timeframes now being scheduled and his other work commitments mean he is unable to continue. I thank him for his contribution over the past few months.

“The Board’s work is crucial in ensuring that New Zealanders’ views about development of our coasts are included in the new Statement, so that New Zealand’s beautiful coastline is best protected.”

The Board of Inquiry is chaired by Alternate Environment Judge Shonagh Kenderdine. Other members are iwi authority chief executive Rikirangi Gage and former Nelson MP and Mayor Philip Woollaston.
