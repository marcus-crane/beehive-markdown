Trade Minister Phil Goff announced today that Indonesia has lifted a temporary suspension of New Zealand meat imports which was put in place last week due to Indonesia concerns over labelling and halal certification.

“New Zealand’s meat trade with Indonesia is valued at over $90 million a year and I welcome the resumption of New Zealand’s important meat trade to that country,” Mr Goff said.

“Indonesia’s response in relation to New Zealand’s strong representations on this issue is a reflection of an overall positive trade relationship.

“In a meeting this afternoon with a senior Indonesian trade delegation I made clear my expectation that any concerns Indonesia may have should be worked out between officials.

“I expressed concern that the ban was imposed without notice and without prior dialogue.

“However, I am confident that New Zealand can resolve any legitimate concerns which may exist.  

“In a period when food security and food safety are being considered by policy makers around the world, high quality food imports are vital.

“Ongoing suspension of the meat trade would have been damaging both to New Zealand exporters and Indonesian consumers.

“The swift removal of the suspension reflects our constructive trade relationship overall and I welcome the helpful response from Indonesia,” Phil Goff said.
