**Background on the Securities Commission**

The Securities Commission, which is established under the Securities Act 1978, is an independent Crown entity. The Commission is New Zealand’s main regulator of investments. The Commission’s work contributes to strengthening investor confidence and fostering capital investment in New Zealand by promoting the efficiency and integrity of our securities markets through cost-effective regulation. The Governor-General, on the recommendation of the Minister of Commerce, appoints the ten members of the Commission.

**Background on the Takeovers Panel**

The Takeovers Panel, established under the Takeovers Act 1993, is an independent Crown entity under the Crown Entities Act 2004. As regulator of the corporate takeovers market, the Panel has an important role in ensuring transparent and equitable takeover processes, reducing transaction costs for domestic and international investors and increasing confidence in the integrity of the New Zealand corporate takeovers market. The Governor-General, on the recommendation of the Minister, appoints the members of the Panel, which consists of between five and eleven members. One of the positions on the Panel is filled by a member of the Australian Takeovers Panel in a reciprocal trans-Tasman arrangement. Under these arrangements the Chairman of the New Zealand Panel, David Jones, is a member of the Australian Panel.
