“By putting children, young people, families and communities at the centre of all we do we will always strive to help New Zealanders live better lives” said Mahara Okeroa, Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment, at the launch of the Ministry of Social Development Southern Regional Plan 2008/2009 today. 

 “In the last 12 months, the Southern Region has been successful in meeting many of its unique challenges. For example the establishment of a Youth Transition Steering Group which improves collaboration between government agencies in the Region has resulted in more young people moving seamlessly from school to further education, training and/or work.” Mahara Okeroa said 

“While it is always a positive experience to reflect on the successes of the previous year, it is equally important to look towards what else we can achieve.  

“The Southern Regional Plan sets out five key priorities that over the next year the Ministry of Social Development will focus on in partnership with other organisations. 

“By working in partnership we are acknowledging the need for solutions which are not a one size fits all approach” he said.  

The plan’s key priorities centre around giving children the best start in life, helping young people achieve their potential, enabling people to live independent lives, supporting families and whanau to be safe and resilient, and strengthening communities.   

This year the Southern Regional Plan is supported by a national multi-year $446 million Pathway to Partnership Plan aimed at strengthening community-based family, child and youth focused services.  The Pathway to Partnership Programme will ensure that community organisations will get the support they need to deliver effective, high quality and accessible services to children and families. 

“Building successful lives starts when we value people, families and communities, and the Southern Regional Plan sets out how we will achieve this in the coming year”   Regional Commissioner for Social Development John Allen said.  

The Southern Regional Plan is a whole of Ministry approach and draws together the activities of all the Ministry’s business units.   The business units that form the Ministry of Social Development are Work and Income, Family and Community Services, the Ministry of Youth Development, Study Link, Benefit Integrity, Senior Services, and Child, Youth and Family.
