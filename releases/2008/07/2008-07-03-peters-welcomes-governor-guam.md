Governor Felix P Camacho will outline business opportunities for New Zealand companies in Guam during his visit here, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today.

Governor Camacho, who arrives today for a six-day visit, will also discuss the deepening relationship between New Zealand and the United States in the Pacific, including in Guam and Micronesia.

“New Zealand companies travelled to Guam last October on a successful trade mission to discuss opportunities associated with the large-scale expansion of the United States military base there," said Mr Peters.

“The visit by Governor Camacho and key officials will consolidate the links made on the mission and assist New Zealand businesses to pursue contract opportunities.

"From 2010 the United States will move 8000 marines and their families to Guam from Okinawa in Japan in a $US15 billion five-year operation.  New Zealand companies will not be able to bid for military contracts but hope to benefit by tendering for public sector and private works projects.

“Guam’s population of 163,000 people will grow by 25 per cent during the expansion, and New Zealand is well placed to support business opportunities, and to assist the Government of Guam in environmental and sustainability challenges posed by the rapid development,’’ Mr Peters said.

Governor Camacho will visit Tauranga, accompanied by Mr Peters, as well as businesses in Auckland and Rotorua, and will take part on a business forum at Auckland University’s business school, hosted by the New Zealand Pacific Business Council.
