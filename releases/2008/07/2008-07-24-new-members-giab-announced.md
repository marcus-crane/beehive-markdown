Twelve new members representing some of New Zealand’s leading businesses and research organisations have been appointed to the government’s Growth and Innovation Advisory Board, Economic Development Minister Pete Hodgson announced today. 

The board provides independent advice to the government.

Pete Hodgson said the new appointments, and the reappointment of eight existing members including re-appointed chair Stephen Tindall, are intended to increase the Board’s influence, so that it could take a more strategic, over-arching approach to economic growth and productivity issues.

“The board plays a valuable role in bringing together key decision makers and thinkers in government and business, and is already a very important source of advice to the government on growth and innovation issues. I believe that there is scope for increasing its influence – especially in enhancing the dialogue between business and government on key strategic issues facing the New Zealand economy,” said Pete Hodgson.

“Those reappointed, combined with the new members bring a wealth of experience and skills across a wide range of fields, as well as excellent national and international networks,” he said.

The new board meets for the first time on July 24.

A full list of the new and re-appointments and brief biographies is appended.
