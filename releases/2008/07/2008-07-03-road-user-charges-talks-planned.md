Following discussions with the Road Transport Forum late today, Transport Minister Annette King has asked acting Transport Secretary Wayne Donnelly to convene and chair a working party including industry members to examine the formula to set Road User Charges (RUC) for heavy vehicles.

 “There is no doubt that there is dispute on both sides of the argument as to the accuracy of the formula used to set RUC charges,” she said.

 Ms King has also asked Mr Donnelly to speed up policy work to enable legislation to be taken to Cabinet for introduction this year which would amend the Road User Charges Act.

 Road Transport Chief Executive Tony Friedlander and Ms King have agreed to meet soon with Mr Donnelly and discuss the details of the working party and what it will examine.

 “All road users must pay their fair share towards maintaining our roads, building new roads and improving passenger transport.

 “What I want to be sure of – and I am sure Mr Friedlander and his members want to be sure of - is that the formula for setting RUC delivers that fairness.”
