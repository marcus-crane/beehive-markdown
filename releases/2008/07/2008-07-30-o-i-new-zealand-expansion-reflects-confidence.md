Economic Development Minister Pete Hodgson today welcomed United States-based glass manufacturer Owens-Illinois Inc (O-I) announcement today to invest NZ$80 million to expand its Penrose, Auckland, plant and create more jobs.

“This decision highlights the positive environment for investment in New Zealand under this Labour-led government,” Pete Hodgson said.

“As Helen Clark has said, this government has a commitment to regulatory improvement. We are rated second in the 2008 World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Survey. O-I’ s plans reflect this. Our regulatory framework is years ahead of our competitors.

“Owens-Illinois Inc’s announcement is also a vote of confidence in the Emissions Trading Scheme as it is an energy-intensive company and it has decided to expand in New Zealand rather than in a non-Kyoto country.”
