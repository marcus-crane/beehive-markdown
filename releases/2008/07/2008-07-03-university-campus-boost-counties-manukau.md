A new university campus in Counties Manukau, to be opened in 2009, was announced by the Prime Minister Helen Clark and Tertiary Education Minister Hodgson today.

Situated in the heart of Manukau City near the Rainbow’s End park, the new campus will be developed at the site of the former Carter Holt Harvey headquarters, which has been purchased by Auckland University of Technology (AUT) with a $25 million capital investment from the government.

Speaking at the site, Helen Clark said the campus would increase opportunities to study at tertiary level in the Counties-Manukau area.

“Counties Manukau is home to New Zealand’s largest and fastest growing population of under-25 year olds, a high proportion of whom are Maori and Pacific school leavers.

“Young people in this area deserve every opportunity to realise their career aspirations. A university campus in the heart of this community is an important step towards making that happen,” Helen Clark said.

“AUT will now work with the community, local businesses, industry, and other stakeholders to ensure that the courses offered at the campus meet the region’s growing skills needs and the aspiration of its young people.

“AUT is to be commended for promoting this initiative. It has secured a site and buildings which are well-suited to becoming a university campus and are virtually ready to use. AUT’s strength in advancing undergraduate education among Maori and Pacific students makes it well positioned to deliver university education in Counties Manukau,” Helen Clark said.

The site

- The new AUT Campus is situated at 640 Great South Rd. The site was formerly home to Carter Holt Harvey’s Manukau headquarters.
- The 7.8ha site is close to the expanding Manukau CBD and its facilities and services.
- Buildings required very little retro-fitting or refurbishment for immediate use as a general teaching campus and a university research and innovation centre
- Present capacity for teaching is 1,000 to 1,500 EFTS. Additional buildings could expand this to 6,000 -10,000 EFTS
- The Government has contributed a Capital Grant of $25 million to AUT to purchase the site.

The campus

- The campus is expected to deliver limited programmes to approximately 190 EFTS from 2009. It is expected to be fully up and running by 2014. By then it will be delivering programmes to 1,000 EFTS.

- The AUT Tech Park business incubator, technology transfer activities, and some research institutes will move from Penrose as soon as facilities are available.
- The full range of programmes to be delivered will be decided in close consultation with the Counties Manukau community and by existing providers especially the Manukau Institute of Technolgy, Te Wananga O Aotearoa and various private tertiary providers.
