Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker announced today that His Excellency Governor-General Anand Satyanand has appointed Mary Richardson to the Gambling Commission.

"Mary Richardson will bring her extensive experience in management, public policy, and local government to the Commission," Mr Barker said. 

She currently works as a Research Consultant specialising in policy for JHI Consultancy.  Her previous roles have included Director of Policy for the Local Government and Community Branch at the Department of Internal Affairs, and Unit Manager of the Research and Policy Unit at the Christchurch City Council.  She is also currently a Trustee of the Community Trust of Canterbury. 

Mary Richardson’s term of three years will commence on 1 July 2008 and will expire on 30 June 2011.

Established under section 220 of the Gambling Act 2003, the Gambling Commission is an independent statutory decision-making body.  The Commission hears casino licensing applications, and appeals on licensing and enforcement decisions made by the Secretary of Internal Affairs in relation to gaming machines and other non-casino gambling activities.
