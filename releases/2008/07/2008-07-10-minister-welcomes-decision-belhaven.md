Minister of Health David Cunliffe has welcomed a decision to move residents of the Belhaven Rest Home into a new home

“The safety and wellbeing of the patients is the number one priority and I am pleased that the Ministry of Health and Auckland DHB have moved swiftly to ensure the patients receive the care they need,” Mr Cunliffe said.

Mr Cunliffe said he supported entirely the decision to terminate the contract with the Belhaven Rest Home.

“I am entirely satisfied that today’s decision is in the best interests of the patients.”

Mr Cunliffe said elderly had the right to be treated with dignity and respect and have their clinical needs met, and providers who were unable to do this would not be tolerated

“There can be no excuses for failing to treat our elderly with the respect they deserve.”
