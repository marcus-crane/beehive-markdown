The Government is investing more than a million dollars on upgrading Rewarewa Court in New Lynn, West Auckland over the next 12 months.

The block of 33 units, built in the 1970’s, has had a history of maintenance issues dating back several years.

Housing Minister Maryan Street and New Lynn MP David Cunliffe said, “This is a great day for the residents of Rewarewa Court. It is rewarding to know that the families we met here three months ago will have warmer and healthier homes after these units are refurbished.”

Minister for Housing Maryan Street said “The estimated $1.25 million refurbishment will make a big difference to the lives of the families living there. On visiting the complex in April I asked for short medium and long term solutions for these tenants. These are the short term solutions which we are able to deliver fairly quickly.”

The refurbishment will include replacing skylights, improving ventilation in bathrooms and kitchens, providing carpet throughout, infilling stairways, additional heating, hardiglazing bathroom walls and ceilings, modifying ceilings and providing insulation.

Housing New Zealand is also discussing tree removal and tree thinning work which would open up the units to more natural light.

Housing New Zealand spends around $187 million annually on the maintenance of 68,000 properties across the country.

Tenants have recently been advised of the refurbishment and the work will go out for tender shortly. Housing New Zealand will look at the impact of this refurbishment and how it will affect tenants. Tenants will be fully informed of further details as the project develops.
