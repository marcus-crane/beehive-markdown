"Dianne is ideally suited to this role on all levels. She's from the Waikato, arguably the food bowl of New Zealand, and has close links to the primary sector. She has a strong grasp of issues involving international treaties through her role as chair of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Select Committee and is experienced in health and science issues as a former member of the Health Select Committee," Lianne Dalziel said.

"The work of FSANZ is a crucial part of food regulation in New Zealand. The agency develops world class food standards so consumers can be confident of the overall integrity of the food supply. Dianne's extensive experience of government will complement the existing New Zealand members’ expertise in nutrition, public health, food science and industry on the FSANZ Board," Lianne Dalziel said.

"FSANZ is a science-based organisation, and I’m confident that Dianne, who was responsible for introducing the Human Assisted Reproductive Technology Bill to Parliament, will be able to serve New Zealand well in this context."

FSANZ is an independent statutory agency established under Australian law and is responsible for the development of standards for food composition and labelling in New Zealand and Australia. New Zealand holds three membership positions on the FSANZ Board. The two other New Zealand members are Dr Laurence Eyres, a food science specialist at the University of Auckland, and Ms Hikihiki Pihema, senior dietitian at Gisborne Hospital.

Philippa Smith AM, has been appointed as the new Chair of the FSANZ Board replacing Mr Rob Knowles who had chaired the Board since its establishment in 2002.
