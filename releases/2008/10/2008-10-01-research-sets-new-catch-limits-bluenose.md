Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton has today reduced catch limits in commercial bluenose fisheries, based on information from joint industry-government research.

Jim Anderton said the research suggested that there were sustainability issues in the fishery, and he was reducing catch limits in response to this.

"Industry's involvement in the research and their general support for the new catch limits show an ongoing commitment to sustainability in the fishery."

Commercial catches of bluenose in five quota areas had previously been increased as part of a joint industry-government research programme. The programme was designed to get more information about the fishery by increasing catches and collecting more catch and effort data.

Jim Anderton said the analysis of this catch and effort information suggested catch rates in the fishery were falling.

"So catch limits need to be reduced, to ensure New Zealand retains a sustainable and profitable bluenose fishery."

This results in the following Total Allowable Commercial Catch reductions:

BLUENOSE 1 - TACC reduced from 1,000 tonnes to 786 tonnes  
BLUENOSE 2 - TACC reduced from 1,048 tonnes to 902 tonnes  
BLUENOSE 3 - TACC reduced from 925 tonnes to 505 tonnes  
BLUENOSE 7 - TACC reduced from 150 tonnes to 89 tonnes  
BLUENOSE 8 - TACC reduced from 100 tonnes to 43 tonnes

These TACC changes are the first fisheries catch adjustments to be made under the Fisheries Act's new section 13(2A) that was passed by Parliament late last month.

The recreational bag limits and customary catch allowances for bluenose remain unchanged.
