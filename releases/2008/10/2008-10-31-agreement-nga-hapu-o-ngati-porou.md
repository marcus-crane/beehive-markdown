The first foreshore and seabed Deed of Agreement was signed today in Wellington by the Crown and 48 hapū of east coast iwi Ngāti Porou.

This landmark agreement reflects the determination of the hapū to safeguard their longstanding customary rights and the commitment by the Government to recognise and protect those rights.

This Deed protects rights which have clearly been exercised since well before the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi while making sure that the interests of the wider community in the public foreshore and seabed are protected as well.

"This Deed of Agreement is innovative, it provides a number of important mechanisms that make sure the rights of both the hapū that are party to this agreement and the wider community are safeguarded into the future," Attorney-General Michael Cullen said.

A Heads of Agreement setting out the broad outline of the agreement was signed in February. The finalised Deed setting out the agreement in detail was initialled in August and was then subject to ratification by hapū.

A Bill giving effect to the Deed of Agreement was introduced to Parliament on 29 September.

Following the signing, representatives of the hapū of Ngāti Porou that ratified the Deed will file an application in the High Court for confirmation that the requirements for a finding by the High Court under section 96 of the Foreshore and Seabed Act have been satisfied.
