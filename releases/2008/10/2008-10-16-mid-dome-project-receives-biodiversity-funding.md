Southland's Mid Dome project, aimed at clearing the high country tussock grasslands of wilding pines, is to benefit from the latest allocation round of the Biodiversity Funds, Environment Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

The Southland project is among 71 projects throughout the country that will receive a total of $1.3 million from the Biodiversity Funds, announced by Trevor Mallard and Conservation Minister Steve Chadwick.

A grant of $54,000 has been approved for the Mid Dome project. The grant will help control wilding pine in two areas on private land, known as the Nokomai and Blackmore covenants and covering 1183 hectares. In particular it is aimed at eradicating the seed source. This is part of the overall programme to clear Mid Dome of wilding pine trees from 100,000 hectares of iconic southern high country tussock grasslands.

Trevor Mallard was shown the area and briefed on the project by the Mid Dome Wilding Trees Charitable Trust today.

"This project is a great example of collaboration and partnerships between regional and local councils, central government, private landowners and local communities. The biodiversity fund support from the Labour-led government is great news for the local environment and demonstrates our commitment to biodiversity," Trevor Mallard said.

"The Biodiversity Funds are really zeroing in on the National Priorities for Biodiversity, so that threatened species, such as mudfish, kiwi and New Zealand dotterel will benefit. "At risk" environments, including coastal dune lands, lowland forests and freshwater habitats such as wetlands and streams are also receiving this support.

"The Biodiversity Funds over the last seven years have provided financial assistance to almost 1000 projects on private land. A new $4 million Community Conservation Fund is about supporting community initiatives on public land. That means there is now significant investment being made by the Labour-led government to support community and landowner led initiatives in halting the decline of New Zealand's biodiversity," Trevor Mallard said.

The next funding round for the Biodiversity Funds will open towards the end of October.
