The Government's decision to transfer day services funding from the Ministry of Health to the Ministry of Social Development is aimed at improving employment and community participation services for disabled people.

The move brings vocational services for people with intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities together under one funding agency which will ultimately enable a more coherent use of resources.

"Services will continue as normal," says Ruth Dyson, Minister for Social Development and Employment. "People currently receiving Ministry of Health funded day services will continue to receive the same levels of services and support after the transfer. Existing commitments to service users, and their families, to meet their day service needs will be maintained as long as the people require such services.

"Over time the transfer will provide greater opportunities for people using day services to be linked to employment and other services provided by the Ministry of Social Development," said Ruth Dyson.

The Minister of Health, David Cunliffe, says the transfer of funding responsibility will be phased to ease the transition.

"The first stage of the transfer is for those with more straightforward funding arrangements and will start from 01 April 2009. It is expected that this will cover day services for about 1,500 people delivered by about 50 providers," Mr Cunliffe says. "The second stage would involve providers with more complex funding arrangements."

Ms Dyson says the transfer will enable services to be aligned more closely with the Government's 2001 Pathways to Inclusion strategy which aims to increase the participation of disabled people in employment and in the community.

Disabled people have been entering both the workforce and training and community services in increasing numbers. Currently 10,500 disabled people are being supported to work under the Pathways to Inclusion Strategy. This is a significant increase from 1200 people in 2000.
