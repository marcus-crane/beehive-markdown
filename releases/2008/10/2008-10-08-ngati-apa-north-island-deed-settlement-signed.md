Ngāti Apa (North Island) and the Crown signed a Deed of Settlement today, Treaty Negotiations Minister Michael Cullen said. Minister of Maori Affairs, Hon Parekura Horomia, signed the Deed of Settlement on behalf of the Crown.

The signing follows the ratification by Ngāti Apa (North Island) of a draft Deed of Settlement initialled on 3 September 2008.

"I am very pleased to see the results of Ngāti Apa's ratification process, which showed overwhelming support for the settlement.  This support is testament to the leadership of Te Runanga o Ngāti Apa, and their able advocacy for their people," Dr Cullen said.

Ngāti Apa (North Island) have more than 3,200 members and are based in the Rangitikei region. Their claims relate primarily to the Crown's purchase in 1849 of the 260,000 acre Rangitikei-Turakina Block, including the subsequent failure to adequately protect approximately 35,000 acres of reserves set aside from this transaction. Their claims also relate to the operation and impact of the native land laws, which contributed to the erosion of traditional tribal structures and resulted in the gradual alienation of nearly all their remaining land.  

The settlement includes:

\* An historical account, Crown acknowledgement of historical breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles and a Crown apology to Ngāti Apa (North Island).

\* A cultural redress package featuring the transfer of a number of sites of cultural significance to Ngāti Apa (North Island), including two lakebeds.

\* A quantum of $16 million, including the opportunity to purchase four Crown properties in the Rangitikei region.

"Te Rünanga o Ngāti Apa demonstrated a constructive, solution-focused approach to their negotiations and for that I pay tribute to the Ngäti Apa negotiators. This settlement has also seen the development of innovative "cultural revitalisation" redress developed during the negotiations process," Dr Cullen said.

"This settlement is an historic moment in the relationship between the Crown and Ngäti Apa and will allow us to move forward into the future," Dr Cullen said.

The settlement remains conditional only on the passage of settlement legislation.  Under the Deed of Settlement, the Crown is obliged to introduce legislation to implement the settlement in the next twelve months.
