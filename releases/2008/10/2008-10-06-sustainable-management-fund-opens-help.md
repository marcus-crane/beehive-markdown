Environment Minister Trevor Mallard has announced the opening of the 2009/2010 Sustainable Management Fund, which is designed to assist community groups, iwi, businesses and local government in making a positive difference to the environment.

"The objectives of the Sustainable Management Fund are to encourage greater awareness of the environment by funding projects that support the government's environment and sustainability priorities, encourage pro-active partnerships, and promote community action," Trevor Mallard said.

"The four priority areas for 2009/10 are encouraging sustainable households, sustainable land and water management, supporting sustainable business practices, and meeting the challenges of climate change.

The Sustainable Management Fund is a contestable fund of $3.84 million. Applicants can apply for a minimum of $10,000 to a maximum of $200,000 in this funding round with successful applicants announced in June 2009.

"In the 2008/2009 funding round, 39 sustainability projects focussing on land and water, climate change, business and households received funding. These projects encourage wide community involvement and promote practical action to produce long-term environmental benefits.

"I have no doubt that the applicants for this year's funding round will be of the same calibre," Trevor Mallard said. 

Community groups, iwi, businesses and local government are encouraged to visit the Sustainable Management Fund (SMF) webpage at [**www.smf.govt.nz**](http://www.smf.govt.nz/) and follow the instructions for applications.

The deadline for applications is **Thursday 22 January 2009.**
