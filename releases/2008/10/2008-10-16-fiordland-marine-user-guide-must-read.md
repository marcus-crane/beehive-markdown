Environment Minister Trevor Mallard paid tribute to the Fiordland Guardians today and urged people to check out their new Fiordland Marine User Guide, being launched tonight in Invercargill.

The guide was written by the Fiordland Marine Guardians with help from the Ministry of Fisheries, Department of Conservation, MAF Biosecurity, Environment Southland and the Ministry for the Environment. It has attractive, illustrated detail about fish species and rules about fishing, marine reserves, bio-security issues and useful maps.

"I would encourage people to purchase this high quality book and gain knowledge about this magnificent area. It's a great way to learn about the delicate marine life and the environmental balance that is required for the area to flourish.

"With summer in sight, Fiordland will come alive with people wanting to dive, fish and explore, so I ask everyone to be respectful of the environment and to support the Guardians in their efforts to preserve this precious marine area," Trevor Mallard said.

The Guardians were formed in response to concerns about the escalating pressures on the Fiordland Marine Area and declining fish numbers.

"Environmental guardians play an important role as the need to actively maintain the beauty and resources of our natural environment grows  in the face of higher tourist numbers, climate change and a greater demand on our environmental resources," Trevor Mallard said.

Trevor Mallard also confirmed the reappointment of Malcolm Lawson, Ken Grange and Alan Mark as Fiordland Marine Guardians.

 "I have great confidence in reappointing Malcolm Lawson, the current chair, for another three year term. His tremendous efforts to preserve the special values of the marine environment in Fiordland are invaluable.

"I also warmly congratulate Ken Grange and Alan Mark for their reappointment for three and two year terms respectively. Their scientific knowledge is an important contribution to the sustainable management of this unique marine environment," Trevor Mallard said.
