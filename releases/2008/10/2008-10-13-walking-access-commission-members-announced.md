Members of the Board of the New Zealand Walking Access Commission were announced today by Rural Affairs Minister Damien O'Connor.

The Commission was established under the Walking Access Act 2008 which passed into law last week. The Commission will provide leadership on walking access issues, develop a national strategy, undertake mapping of walking access, provide information to the public, develop a code of responsible conduct, assist with dispute resolution, and negotiate new walking access.

"Improving and extending walking access to our outdoor heritage is a high priority for many New Zealanders. I am confident that the members of the Commission will do a great job in showing leadership both at a national and local level on these very important issues," said Mr O'Connor.

Members of the New Zealand Walking Access Board are: John Acland (Chair, Geraldine), John Aspinall (Wanaka), Brian Stephenson (Auckland), Peter Brown (Gisborne), Dr Kay Booth (Christchurch), Maggie Bayfield (Ohope), John Forbes (Opotiki) and Barbara Stuart (Nelson).

Collectively, the members have significant experience in farming, forestry, public service, land management, law, Maori interests, public consultation, local government, recreational access and dispute resolution.

The Minister noted that owing to the conventions relating to the pre-election period, the appointments have been made for a relatively short term and will expire on 28 February 2009.
