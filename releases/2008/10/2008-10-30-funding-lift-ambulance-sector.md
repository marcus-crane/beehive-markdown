Minister of Health, David Cunliffe and Minister for ACC Maryan Street today announced a $47 million funding injection for the ambulance sector over the next five years.

"Earlier this year I directed the Ministry of Health to develop a strategic plan for the ambulance sector," Mr Cunliffe said.

"I am pleased to allocate this funding to advance the ambulance services provided to all New Zealanders."

Mr Cunliffe said the sector had some urgent needs and this funding would go some way in addressing those.

"I expect this funding to be used to reduce part charges by the ambulance sector and to address in part the issue of single crewing."  
Mr Cunliffe said where the funding would be invested would be further reviewed once consultation had been completed on the draft ambulance strategy.

The Government released a draft New Zealand Ambulance Service Strategy in September, and comments from the public are welcome until 12 December 2008.

ACC and the Ministry of Health recently created a joint venture organisation, the National Ambulance Sector Office (NASO), to coordinate crown funding for emergency ambulance services and to provide a national view for the sector. NASO is soliciting comments on the draft strategy through [www.naso.govt.nz](http://www.naso.govt.nz).

"I hope that all concerned parties will provide comments on the draft strategy," Ms Street said

"The goal of the strategy is a cohesive, safe, sustainable, quality, cost-effective appropriate and efficient ambulance service for New Zealand," said Ms Street.

Mr Cunliffe noted that he had directed NASO to implement funding changes on the basis of the findings of the strategy consultation by 31 March 2009.
