Internal Affairs Minister, Rick Barker today launched the new decorative birth certificates available now from the Births Deaths and Marriages Registry of the Department of Internal Affairs.

There will be two designs available that incorporate images of New Zealand - one depicting a New Zealand native forest setting, and the other a mother and child on a beach.

"I like the fact that the Department is approaching its service delivery responsibilities with a bit of flair and style. After all your birth certificate is a special document, it is the probably first official document that's all about you, and it is the key building block of an individual's documented identity" said Mr Barker.

The birth certificates will be treasured keepsakes, but will also be part of New Zealand's documented history in years to come. "It will be interesting to see how these designs evolve as years go by," said Mr Barker.

The Department of Internal Affairs has decided to make decorative birth certificates available on a permanent basis following the success of limited edition millennium birth certificates in 2000.

Decorative Birth Certificates will contain the same information as the standard certificates, will be bi-lingual with both English and Maori, and will cost the same as standard certificates.
