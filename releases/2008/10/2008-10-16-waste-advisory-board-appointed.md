A new advisory board has been appointed to provide advice to the Environment Minister on issues relating to waste minimisation, Environment Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

The Waste Advisory Board has members from business and communities with extensive experience in the waste area. The board is charged under the Waste Minimisation Act with providing independent advice to the minister and Ministry for the Environment on waste minimisation issues.

"The Waste Advisory Board will add a fresh perspective on waste minimisation issues, including the waste minimisation fund and product stewardship," Trevor Mallard said.

"I am very pleased with the high calibre of the board's members. I believe they have the combined knowledge, skills and experience to provide me with sound advice on matters outlined in the Act.

"The idea of introducing a board received much support through the submissions on the Waste Minimisation Act.

The Waste Advisory Board members are chair Rob Fenwick, Lynne Kenny, Morris Love, John Pask, Sheryl Stivens, Lesley Stone and Nandor Tanczos.

All members were appointed after a public call for nominations and were selected for their knowledge, skills and experience relating to the Waste Minimisation Act, community projects for waste minimisation, industry (including the commercial waste industry), local government and tikanga Māori.

"Now that the Act is in force, I want to start implementing key provisions such as consulting on which products should be priority products, product stewardship schemes, criteria for the funding of waste minimisation projects and the information requirements to implement and monitor the effectiveness of the Act. The board's initial work will be in providing advice on these areas, so proposals can go out for public consultation early next year," Trevor Mallard said.

The Waste Minimisation Act offers economic incentives and rewards to businesses and councils who act to reduce the waste caused by their products. Under the Act's product stewardship clauses, producers, brand owners, importers, retailers, consumers and other parties take responsibility for the environmental effects of their products - from ‘cradle-to-grave'. Product stewardship is mandatory for products that are declared to be "priority" products. *(see also other background information on the Act below).*

- the introduction of a contestable fund (using the revenue from the waste levy) to help local government, communities and businesses minimise waste. In addition, this will help reduce waste of all types going to landfill by encouraging people to consider alternatives to disposal
