The Governor of the Mexican State of Jalisco, Mr Emilio González Márquez, will visit New Zealand with a delegation of officials and business representatives next week, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton announced today.

Jim Anderton said Mexico was a priority country under the New Zealand Government's Latin America Strategy, and our warm and positive relationship is expanding.

"Agricultural cooperation will be a primary focus of Mr González' visit. An arrangement will be signed to allow greater cooperation between the State of Jalisco and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.

"Jalisco has the third largest economy of the Mexican states and is an important agricultural producer. Mr González' visit underlines the scope for partnerships with New Zealand on agri-technology and food production.  
"We hope that our engagement with Jalisco will demonstrate to the rest of Mexico the benefits of working more closely with New Zealand. Mexico as a whole is an important trading partner for New Zealand and we are focusing on the potential for even further collaboration."

The 2006 report of the New Zealand-Mexico Joint Experts Group highlighted the complementary nature of the two economies and pointed to the mutual gains from a closer bilateral economic partnership.

Jim Anderton said Mr Gonzalez' visit came in the context of an increased tempo of high level visits between New Zealand and Mexico in the past year, suitably marking the 35th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries.
