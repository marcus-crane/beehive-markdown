Education Minister Chris Carter gave special education in Wellington a boost by announcing today that $18 million will be invested into the rebuilding of two special schools in the region.

Kimi Ora Special School, which provides for students with high levels of physical disability, will be relocated and rebuilt on a site at Naenae Intermediate School, with a satellite unit at Evans Bay Intermediate.

Kapi Mana Special School, which provides for students with high level learning, social and behavioural needs, will be relocated and rebuilt on a site at Mana College in Porirua. 

Chris Carter said the two new schools would provide more education options for students with special needs. 

"The new schools will provide greatly improved facilities and a higher standard of accommodation for students attending special schools.

"They will replace current facilities that are overcrowded and substandard and enable strong links to be established with local schools while providing for projected increases in demand."   

The Labour-led government will invest $18.285 million in the rebuilding of Kapi Mana and Kimi Ora Schools.  The establishment of these new schools and satellite unit on existing school sites will enable the work to be undertaken promptly, with the new buildings scheduled to open in 2010.
