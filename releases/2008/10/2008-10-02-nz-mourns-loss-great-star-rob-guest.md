Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark and Associate Minister Judith Tizard have today expressed deep sadness at the passing of outstanding singer and performer Rob Guest.

"Our sympathies are with his family and friends on this sad day," Helen Clark said.

A much-loved musical theatre star and television host, Rob Guest was 58.  He was born in Britain and enjoyed fame as a pop star in New Zealand in the 1970s and 1980s.  He was awarded an OBE for services to New Zealand entertainment industry in 1994.

"For many years, Rob Guest has inspired many New Zealand and Australian audiences with his remarkably powerful performances," Helen Clark said.

Rob Guest starred in Les Miserables and The Phantom of the Opera.

Judith Tizard extended her condolences to the family and friends.

"He touched the lives of many New Zealanders and he will be sadly missed," she said.
