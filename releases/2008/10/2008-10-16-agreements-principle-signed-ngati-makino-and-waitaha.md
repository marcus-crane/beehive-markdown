Ngāti Makino Heritage Trust, Waitaha Raupatu Trust, and the Crown signed Agreements in Principle today in two ceremonies at Hei Marae, Te Puke and Otamarakau Marae, Otamarakau, Treaty Negotiations Minister Michael Cullen said.

The Agreements in Principle outline the broad settlement packages that the parties have agreed will settle the historical Treaty of Waitangi claims of Ngäti Makino and Waitaha.

In February this year Ngāti Makino and Waitaha entered into joint Terms of Negotiation with the Crown to negotiate the settlement of their historical Treaty of Waitangi claims.

The area of interest of Ngāti Makino lies in the Bay of Plenty region from Lakes Rotoiti and Rotomā to the coast.

The claims of Ngäti Makino relate primarily to the New Zealand Wars and the Bay of Plenty confiscation, the operation and impact of the native land laws, the Crown's land purchasing techniques, and twentieth century issues relating to public works and scenic reserve takings.

"In 1997, Ngāti Makino mandated the Ngāti Makino Heritage Trust to negotiate a settlement of their historical Treaty of Waitangi claims with the Crown. Today I pay my respects to those who have gone before us in laying the ground work for this agreement, and the Ngāti Makino people for supporting the Ngāti Makino Heritage Trust and keeping their mandate strong during the 10 years since your mandate was first recognised," Dr Cullen said today.

Ngāti Makino articulated to the Crown during negotiations the importance to them of developing relationships with local authorities and their neighbouring iwi over the management of the Scenic Reserve lands within their rohe. In recognition of this, a key aspect of the cultural redress package features an offer to explore the transfer and transfer-back of scenic reserve lands in the rohe of Ngāti Makino.

The area of interest of Waitaha lies from Tauranga Harbour in the west across to Maketü in the east.

The claims of Waitaha relate primarily to the New Zealand Wars (including the treatment of their chief, Hakaraia), the Tauranga confiscation, the operation and impact of the native land laws, and the Crown's land purchasing techniques.

"At the core of the Waitaha claim is recognition of their tupuna, Hakaraia. In negotiations Waitaha have explained the centrality and importance of Hakaraia to their claims. The Crown has, in negotiating this settlement package, sought to reflect his importance to Waitaha and lay the foundations for the restoration of the mana of Waitaha and of Hakaraia," Dr Cullen said today.

"In recognition of your tupuna, Hakaraia, the cultural redress package includes redress specifically for the recognition of Hakaraia. I am pleased to announce the creation of an education endowment fund of $3 million for all of Waitaha to share in."

The pragmatism, vision and leadership of the two teams of negotiators have allowed these joint negotiations to reach Agreements in Principle in unprecedented time, and for this I congratulate Ngāti Makino and Waitaha.

These Agreements in Principle are the start of the next phase in the negotiations process. The Crown, Ngāti Makino and Waitaha will now work towards detailed Deeds of Settlement, which will be subject to ratification by all members of Ngāti Makino and Waitaha. .
