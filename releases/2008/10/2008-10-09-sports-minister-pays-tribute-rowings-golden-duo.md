Sport and Recreation Minister Clayton Cosgrove has paid tribute to Caroline and Georgina Evers-Swindell who announced their retirement from competitive rowing today.

"Caroline and Georgina Evers-Swindell are undoubtedly New Zealand's finest female rowers and leave an extraordinary legacy of success.

"The word "great" is often over-used in sport, but it is a description which is truly fitting for two athletes who have achieved repeatedly at the Olympics and at world championships," Mr Cosgrove said.

"Caroline and Georgina have also conducted themselves with dignity and exhibited true sportsmanship.

"They have provided inspiration and joy for all New Zealanders who see them affectionately simply as "the twins". 

"On a personal level, I feel honoured and privileged to have been part of the crowd cheering them on for their nail-biting, thrilling victory at the Beijing Olympics. It was a great day for New Zealand and a fitting triumph for their fantastic rowing careers.

"I wish them well in their future endeavours," Mr Cosgrove said.

Mr Cosgrove said the government has been proud to support Georgina and Caroline Evers-Swindell throughout their careers.
