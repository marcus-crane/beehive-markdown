A ceremony was held today at Tarimano Marae in Rotorua to celebrate the recognition by the Crown of the mandates of the Tapuika Iwi Authority Trust and Te Maru o Ngati Rangiwewehi Iwi Authority to negotiate the settlement of the historic Treaty of Waitangi claims of Tapuika and Ngati Rangiwewehi.

On 14 August this year, Tapuika and Ngati Rangiwewehi signed Joint Terms of Negotiation with the Crown which set out the scope of their upcoming negotiations to settle their historic Treaty of Waitangi claims. These Terms of Negotiation were subject to the Crown recognising the mandates of the Tapuika Iwi Authority Trust and Te Maru o Ngati Rangiwewehi Iwi Authority.

"Today is another significant step in the process to comprehensively resolve the historical Treaty claims of Tapuika and Ngati Rangiwewehi, following the signing of the Joint Terms of Negotiation with the Crown earlier this year," Treaty Negotiations Minister Michael Cullen said today.

"I would like to congratulate the Tapuika Iwi Authority Trust and Te Maru o Ngati Rangiwewehi Iwi Authority on receiving strong support from their members to negotiate the settlement of their Treaty claims with the Crown."

"The Crown recognition of the mandates can ensure that the negotiations can proceed and that the considerable momentum built up this year in addressing all the historical Treaty claims in the central North Island can be maintained," Dr Cullen said.

Tapuika and Ngati Rangiwewehi claims have been heard as part of the Waitangi Tribunal's Central North Island Inquiry. The area of interest of Tapuika includes the coastal Bay of Plenty north of Rotorua. The area of interest of Ngati Rangiwewehi lies mainly to the west of Lake Rotorua.

The claims of Tapuika and Ngati Rangiwewehi primarily relate to the operation of the native land laws, Crown purchases of land, public works takings and impacts on their natural environment. Both iwi were also affected by the New Zealand Wars.
