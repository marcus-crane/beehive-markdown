A further 31 New Zealand schools will benefit from a $14 million investment into school property announced Education Minister Chris Carter today.

The School Property Guide Deficiencies Programme is an annual discretionary fund aimed at addressing high priority deficiencies in state school buildings.

"These schools have existing property that is in need of an upgrade and I am delighted to be able to announce the list of successful applicants today," said Chris Carter.

"Schools have the opportunity to combine this funding with other property budgets, such as the five year agreement, to add area and upgrade existing facilities at the same time," said Chris Carter.

Funding is provided to schools to address lack of space in buildings, as measured by the school property guide.

So far the Labour-led government has committed $3.3 billion to property investment in New Zealand schools.

"While there are still some schools with space deficiencies, the $14 million allocated this year will address many of the larger deficiencies," said Chris Carter.

The school property guide programme has been operating since 2000 and has provided funding to approximately 500 schools.

Since 1999 the Labour-led government has invested over $400 million building 24 new schools and 22 Kura Kaupapa schools and $470 million building 1,500 new classrooms in existing schools.
