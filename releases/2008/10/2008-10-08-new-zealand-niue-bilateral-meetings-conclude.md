Senior Government Minister Phil Goff and Premier of Niue Hon Toke Talagi successfully completed a series of bilateral meetings in Wellington today.

"Over the past three days I have had constructive discussions with the Premier during which New Zealand and Niue reaffirmed the high value both countries place on the special relationship," Phil Goff said.

"The Premier was also able to meet the Prime Minister.

"The talks provided a good basis for continuing the partnership with New Zealand. Discussions focused on the path forward for facilitating the current programme of assistance, and structuring a new package of support to Niue from 2009.

"The improvements are designed to achieve flexibility in meeting Niue's challenges, and speed in responding to agreed targets - while also ensuring robust accountability on funds provided by the New Zealand taxpayer in line with the New Zealand Public Finance Act.

"The Premier and I agreed that both countries remain committed to the goal of an economically viable and vibrant Niuean community on Niue, as a focus for maintaining Niuean language and culture," Phil Goff said.
