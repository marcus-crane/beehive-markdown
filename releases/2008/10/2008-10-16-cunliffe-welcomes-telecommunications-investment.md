Minister of Information Communications Technology David Cunliffe today welcomed the announcement of further significant investment in New Zealand's communications infrastructure.

"Yesterday Telecom announced that it is investing $574 million in its new 3G network and will be fast tracking its rollout. That brings new industry investment in 3G networks to in excess of $1 billion," Mr Cunliffe said.

Telecom's new network will bring 3G coverage and fast mobile broadband to 97% of the population.

"That is excellent news for New Zealand consumers, as it goes a long way to providing mobile broadband coverage to all New Zealanders."

Telecom's new 3G network will promote competition in the delivery of more innovative mobile broadband services.

"The winners here are New Zealanders, who will have greater choice of providers and better services."

Other significant investments announced since the government undertook the Telecommunications Stocktake in 2005 include:

- By 2010 Vodafone will have invested $500 million in its Vodafone Red mobile broadband network;
- NZ Communications is investing at least $150 million to launch in New Zealand, and has recently signed co-location and interconnection agreements with Vodafone;
- Telstra Clear have recently launched a significant mobile service, wholesaling off Telecom;
- There are also significant investments in urban fibre loops and unbundled local loop access.

"This is unprecedented local investment. It shows that the new regulatory environment that the Labour-led Government brought in is working exceedingly well."

"We are delivering on our commitment to improved services in a better regulatory environment."

"I want to congratulate the telecommunications companies for their investment in New Zealand's telecommunications infrastructure. This is good for New Zealand and good for New Zealanders."
