Mainzeal Property and Construction Limited has been awarded the construction contract to build the new Levin courthouse, Courts Minister Rick Barker announced today.

"I am pleased to advise the appointment of Mainzeal Property and Construction Limited to carry out the project which involves the construction of a brand new courthouse which will include two new courtrooms and judicial and administration facilities.

"The new courthouse will also include large waiting and jury assembly areas, secure witness rooms and hearing and mediation rooms.

"Extensive site works and landscaping on the existing Stanley Street site will also be carried out as part of the redevelopment.

"The new courthouse has been designed to meet the needs of the local community now and in the future. As well as being bigger the courthouse will have advanced security systems and will be capable of supporting the latest technology including audio visual links and evidence recording services.

"Construction on the project is scheduled to begin next week and is expected to be completed by late 2009.

"This project is part of the Ministry of Justices wider building programme to deliver first class justice services to New Zealand," said Mr Barker.

The original courthouse was located in Bristol Street. It has been moved to the local rose gardens in Bath Street. The Stanley Street site, where the new courthouse is to be built, is cleared and ready to go.
