Today Courts Minister Rick Barker announced the reappointment of Eamon Daly,

Deborah Clapshaw, Patsi Davies and Simativa Perese as members of the Human Rights Review Tribunal Panel.

"I have reappointed these members for shortened terms of six months starting today. This is to ensure compliance with Cabinet office guidance on decision making in the pre- election period," said Mr Barker. Terms of appointment are usually for periods of up to five years.

The Human Rights Review Tribunal must be supported by a sufficient panel of members to meet the requirements of the Human Rights Act 1993.

Minister Barker said it was important to proceed with the reappointments to ensure the Tribunal's ability to function was not compromised in any way.

The short term reappointment of these members to the panel will allow the Tribunal to continue with business as usual. All members have made, and will continue to make a significant contribution to the work of the Tribunal.
