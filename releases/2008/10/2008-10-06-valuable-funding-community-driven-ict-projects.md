The 2008/09 funding round of the Community Partnership Fund (CPF) is now open for people seeking to launch innovative grassroots Information and Communication Technology (ICT) initiatives.

Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Ruth Dyson says community-based ICT projects are essential if New Zealand is to become a leader in the digital world.

"The $5.8 million dollars allocated through the new Digital Strategy 2.0 for the CPF will help us reach our goal of creating a prosperous, sustainable and vibrant society," said Ruth Dyson.

"The Government has an important role to play in supporting communities in the digital world. To fulfil this role we face some significant challenges. We have to ensure that the digital world is open to everyone and that includes those living in rural or isolated areas, those on lower incomes and disabled people. Whether you are a young child or a savvy senior, we must all be part of our nation's digital journey."

"If New Zealand is to become a leader in the digital world, our communities have a vital role to play," said Ruth Dyson.

Since 2005, the CPF has provided $17.4 million to over 100 community-driven ICT projects.

Partnerships between community, local government, businesses and government have brought further contributions of over $30 million to complete CPF projects.

This year, as well as supporting new projects, the CPF will help existing projects link up, expand into new areas and regions, or develop new uses.

The CPF is an excellent example of communities, government and businesses working together to achieve practical results.

The 2008/09 funding round of the CPF opens today.
