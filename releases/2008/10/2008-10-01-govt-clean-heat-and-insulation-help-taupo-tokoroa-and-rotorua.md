Environment Minister Trevor Mallard today visited homes in Taupo and Rotorua benefiting from government funding to replace inefficient wood burners with clean heating and install insulation - to reduce air pollution and protect people's health.

"The government grants are helping low income households in areas with air pollution problems. We are replacing open fires and older styles of wood and coal burners with clean and efficient heating, and also helping insulate homes," Trevor Mallard said.

"I am delighted to visit homes benefiting from this support to hear firsthand how the government support has helped via the ENERGYWISE Homes programme. I would also to thank the other local partners in these important projects and thanks also to Energy Options for hosting me. "

In Taupo, Trevor Mallard and Taupo MP Mark Burton visited the home of Ella Martelli. Thanks to a government grant, the home has been insulated and will soon have clean heating installed. The government provided 60 per cent ($2,438.51) of the total amount of the insulation subsidy and the rest was funded by Lakes Taupo PHO and Lakes District Health Board.

In Tokoroa the pair were hosted by the Tokoroa Warm Homes Clean Air Committee where they were to hear about success stories from the programme from the South Waikato Pacific Island Health Committee and the Raukawa Trust Board.

In Rotorua, Trevor Mallard and Rotorua MP Steve Chadwick visited the home of Mae and Erueti Foster. Their home has been insulated, with clean heating also installed. The government provided 60 per cent of the insulation subsidy ($2,311) and 50 per cent or $1,972 for clean heat. The rest was funded by the Lakes District Health Board, Rotorua Energy Charitable Trust and Bay Trust.

"Using cleaner, more efficient heating can reduce air pollution, save energy and improve health. The government is providing $1.1 million a year nationwide for clean heat funding through EECA (Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority).

"New Zealand has a particular problem with winter-time pollution in urban areas and we know that bad air pollution can lead to health problems. New Zealander's deserve clean air and we want to help make homes warmer and drier. The grants are helping homes across New Zealand and I congratulate all the parties who are matching government contributions - including regional councils and local health organisations," Trevor Mallard said.

The Waikato Clean Heat programme has been funded equally by EECA and Environment Waikato.  EECA has awarded a total of $1.36 million to this programme to install over 780 clean heaters over the next three years in Tokoroa, Taupo and Te Kuiti. 

The Rotorua Clean Heat programme has been funded equally by EECA and Environment Bay of Plenty.  EECA has awarded $556,000 to continue this programme over the next three years to replace over 300 burners and open fires.

To qualify for a Clean Heat grant, people must be eligible for a community services card, live in a home built before 2000 and in an area with poor air quality.

In 2007/08 a programme pilot was delivered, where a total of 495 clean heat devices were installed. Over the next three years EECA will be working with five service providers across the country to install over 2400 clean heating appliances, with an average target of 800 per year.

The Clean Heat programme is one of several initiatives to tackle air pollution. In 2004 the government introduced 14 national environmental standards to improve air quality and protect people's health. The standards include restrictions on resource consents to reduce levels of pollution in areas where it is high. The levels set by the standard are intended to protect the health of the whole community including the most vulnerable, such as children and old people.
