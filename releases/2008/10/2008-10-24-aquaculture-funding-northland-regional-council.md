Northland Regional Council (NRC) is to receive funding of $52,400 to continue with specific aquaculture development projects, Environment MinisterTrevor Mallard announced today.

This funding is from a $2 million contestable fund announced last year to help councils to develop sustainable aquaculture in their regions.

"Northland is a priority area for aquaculture development, and the council has been working hard to develop their aquaculture policy framework," Trevor Mallard said.

"This money will help the council to develop a method to predict when shellfish harvest areas are degrading or improving with regard to microbial food safety risks in Northland.

"Northland also intends to fix derelict farms in Waikare by obtaining information on water quality in the Waikare Inlet. This will remove a major impediment to one of the best oyster growing areas in New Zealand, and the information on water quality will allow the Northland Regional Council to plan for future aquaculture in the region.

"Aquaculture has the potential to transform New Zealand's economy, and the funding provided is part of the government's response to the New Zealand Aquaculture Sector Strategy. A key issue in that strategy was the need to build the confidence to invest in aquaculture," Trevor Mallard said.

Northland received a large allocation of $230,000 last year to help the council facilitate public consultation on proposed changes to its regional plan for Aquaculture Marine Areas (AMAs). Northland Regional Council has made good progress on their Plan Change project.
