A growing number of local councils are delivering practical initiatives which will improve the lives of older people in their communities as part of the New Zealand Positive Ageing Strategy, says Senior Citizens Minister, Ruth Dyson.

Launching the eighth Action Plan for the Strategy, Ms Dyson says 36 local government authorities contributed this year with initiatives that include housing upgrade projects, accessibility to public transport, rates rebate schemes, mentoring programmes and free parking for older drivers.

"The New Zealand Positive Ageing Strategy envisages a society where people can age positively, where older people are highly valued, and where they have continuing opportunities for participation. I am impressed with the number of exciting initiatives that are being undertaken, particularly by local councils," said Ms Dyson.

Following a review of the goals and objectives of the Strategy earlier this year, the annual planning and reporting cycle has moved to a two-yearly cycle.

"This will assist government agencies to plan for and complete longer-term policy projects and allows the Office for Senior Citizens to allocate more time working with councils not in the Action Plan," said Ms Dyson.

Forty-one central government agencies also contributed to the latest Action Plan. These contributions included increasing the number of discounts for SuperGold cardholders, including free off-peak public transport travel for cardholders, the construction, insulation and modernisation of housing units for older people, and supporting fair and inclusive human resource policies for the employment and promotion of older workers.

"Positive ageing is becoming well understood in New Zealand and this makes us the envy of many other countries in the world. I am encouraged by the commitment of everyone who has contributed to this document. The work that older people do to make their communities a better place to live in, also helps communities to appreciate the knowledge, skills and experience that they bring to society to keep positive ageing alive," said Ms Dyson.
