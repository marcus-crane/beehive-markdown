Customs Minister Nanaia Mahuta and Police Minister Annette King  today congratulated the NZ Customs Service and NZ Police for the interception of  a 100-kilo shipment of pseudoephedrine, a principal component of the drug methamphetamine, at the border in Auckland.

A joint Customs/Police investigation into the importation of the shipment from China  has resulted in two male offenders being charged with import and possession for supply of a class C controlled drug.  The maximum sentence is eight years imprisonment.

"New Zealanders can feel very gratified that we have these two outstanding agencies working cooperatively, in order to intercept these criminal organisations and their illicit drug trade," the Ministers said.

"This an excellent example of the good work being done within New Zealand, in order to protect our borders and our communities from the predations of these organised criminals. Their efforts are to be congratulated."

The Ministers say one chilling aspect of the bust is the fact that such a large volume of pseudoephedrine could well have been imported not for transit, but for manufacturing methamphetamine for domestic use. The toll on local communities could have been severe.

"Protecting communities from drugs needs a two-pronged attack; our border agencies and the police are doing their bit, however individuals, families and communities must also be making their contribution by collectively saying no to drugs."
