A new top level advisory body for leading technology change in the health sector was announced today by Health Minister David Cunliffe.

"HISAC, the Health Information Strategy Advisory Committee has been reconstituted and powered up to provide sector wide ICT leadership," Mr Cunliffe said.

In its new role, rather than working ‘bottom up', encouraging individual health IT projects, HISAC will provide top level advice direct to the Minister of Health," Mr Cunliffe said.

Decisions made at ministerial level, on advice, will then be the responsibility of the Ministry of Health to implement across the health system, working in partnership with DHBs and other health providers.

"The sector has been great at identifying pockets of innovation but needs new mechanisms to achieve a fast and decisive roll out across the sector," Mr Cunliffe said.

"Achieving the Government's vision of a fully connected health sector, where patients' health information is available where and when they need it."

"This committee is about instigating action and changes in a co-ordinated and effective manner.

"HISAC will continue to provide independent advice on the Health Information Strategy and on investments in sector-wide health information solutions."

"These appointments demonstrate greater emphasis on clinical leadership and consumer participation. Together these people bring together broad experience in both public and private organisations in the health system and ICT industry, and continue the integrity and independence of the Committee," Mr Cunliffe said.
