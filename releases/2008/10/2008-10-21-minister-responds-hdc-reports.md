Minister of Health David Cunliffe accepts the Health and Disability Commissioner's report on three recent complaints involving patient information errors and agrees with the Commissioner's conclusions.

"The Commissioner's findings reflect work currently being undertaken by the Quality Improvement Committee to build safer systems within the health sector."

"This week we have restructured the Health Information Systems Advisory Group (HISAC) and announced far-reaching moves to improve information flows between DHBs and other health providers," said Mr Cunliffe.

"There is no excuse for the lapses identified by the Health and Disability Commissioner in the three cases involved, and I extend my sincerest condolences to the families concerned,' he said.
