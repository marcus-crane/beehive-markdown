Speaking at the Royal New Zealand Returned Services Association National Conference, Veterans' Minister Rick Barker today told veterans that good progress has been made on implementing the Memorandum of Understanding between government and Viet Nam veterans.

To date more than 5,400 veterans and family members have registered with Veterans Affairs New Zealand and 72 ex gratia payments totalling $2,545,000 have been made to Viet Nam veterans and their families for specific health conditions.

The Viet Nam Veterans and their Families Trust has now made 102 grants totalling around $800,000.

Earlier in the year, Registered Veterans were sent information on accessing free one-off medical assessments. Data from the medical checks will be used to ensure veterans are receiving their entitlements.
