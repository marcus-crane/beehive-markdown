The signing of the Conservation Accord is a significant milestone for conservation management in the lower Waikato River catchment, Conservation Minister Steve Chadwick said today.

The Minister of Conservation, Waikato-Tainui and the Director-General of Conservation have signed a Conservation Accord in Wellington as part of the Waikato River Treaty settlement.  The agreement sets out how the Crown and iwi will achieve co-management in conservation of the Waikato River catchment, between Karapiro and the mouth of the Waikato River.

"Conservation in the Waikato River catchment is extremely important to Waikato-Tainui, so today is an important day," Steve Chadwick said.

"Both the Crown and Waikato-Tainui recognise that conservation is critical in the restoration and protection of the health and wellbeing of the Waikato River for future generations.

"Through this Accord, the Crown and Waikato-Tainui are committing to a positive and enduring relationship surrounding the conservation of the river. 

"Waikato-Tainui input will be integral in all Conservation projects and processes in the River catchment area, including the preservation of threatened species, conservation of the whitebait fishery and protection of the internationally-renowned Waikato wetlands.  I look forward to seeing that relationship grow and strengthen over time."

As part of the Treaty settlement, the Department of Conservation and Waikato-Tainui will also jointly develop a conservation component of an integrated management plan for the Waikato River, and the Waikato River Vision and Strategy will be implemented through Conservation planning documents.

The Conservation Accord is one of the Accords that were provided for in the Deed of Settlement signed between the Crown and Waikato-Tainui on 22 August 2008.
