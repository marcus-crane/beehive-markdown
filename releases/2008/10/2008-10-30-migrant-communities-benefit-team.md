Education and Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter launched a new booklet to assist migrant parents in the education of their children at Mt Roskill Primary School today.

Chris Carter said the 'Team Up' booklet, which has been produced in six different languages (Chinese, Korean, Arabic, Hindi, Somali and Dari/Farsi), will help migrant families to understand New Zealand's education system and encourage them to help their children to learn.

"I know how important it is for parents and families to be involved in the education of their children and this booklet will help migrant families to confidently and successfully navigate their children through their education journey.

"New Zealand today is home to over 170 different ethnic groups. The government is keen to see al Kiwi kids succeed at School, 'Team Up' has been a very successful programme for involving parents in their children's education."

The booklet contains a wide range of information for parents of early childhood, primary and secondary aged children, including topics such as the New Zealand curriculum, learning through play, NCEA and reading with your children.

"The key words in Team Up are inspiration, information and support.

"We want parents to be inspired to be involved, we want parents to be informed about how they can help and we want to support parents to do this.

"The vision that drives these booklets and a number of other recent education initiatives is to encourage the involvement of parents and communities in the life of a school, its children and its learning," said Chris Carter.

Further sets of booklets are scheduled to be produced in other languages, including Te Reo Maori and Pacific Island languages.

The booklets are also be available online from the Team Up website: [www.teamup.co.nz](http://www.teamup.co.nz)
