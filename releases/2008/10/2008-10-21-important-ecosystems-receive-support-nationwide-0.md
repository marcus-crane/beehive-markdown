Projects protecting coastal habitats, lowland forest, wetlands and threatened species will benefit from the latest funding round of the Biodiversity Funds, Environment Minister Trevor Mallard and Conservation Minister Steve Chadwick announced today.

A total of 71 projects throughout the country will receive $1.3 million from the Biodiversity Funds which focus on projects involving private land. Fifteen projects will fund advice and information to private landowners, while 56 projects will enhance biodiversity on private land through, fencing, restoration planting, weed and animal control work programmes.

"What is really exciting about these projects are the partnerships involved. The government contribution is well matched by the significant landowner, communities and other organisations doing their bit through money and their own hard work," the ministers said.

"Landowners and community groups provide a substantial role in the protection of our country's native species. A lot of this work is being done in collaboration with regional and local councils, QEII National Trust and the Department of Conservation.

"The fund zeroes in on the National Priorities for Biodiversity, and threatened species, such as mudfish, kiwi, the New Zealand dotterel will benefit. At risk environments, including coastal dune lands, lowland forests and freshwater habitats - wetlands and streams will also receive support."

The Funds over the last seven years have provided financial assistance to almost 1000 projects on private land. The support assists and encourages landowner initiatives, and helps provide skills and knowledge to increase the awareness and value of New Zealand's biodiversity.

"The new $4 million Community Conservation Fund is about supporting community initiatives on public land, so there is now significant investment being made by the Government to support both community and landowner-led initiatives in halting the decline of New Zealand's biodiversity," the ministers said.

The next funding round for the Biodiversity Funds will open towards the end of October.
