The government is providing funding to help small communities improve their sewerage systems, Associate Health Minister Damien O'Connor said today.

"These subsidies will assist smaller communities to have access to safe, efficient, and hygienic sewerage systems," said Mr O'Connor.

Martins Bay and Point Wells in the Rodney District and Westport in the Buller District have received final approval for their projects, totalling $8.9 million. Provisional approval has been granted for two communities with a value of $2.44 million and nine other communities received preliminary approval with an approximate value of $28.8 million.

The funding comes from the Sanitary Works Subsidy Scheme (SWSS) introduced in 2003. This scheme covers the capital costs of sewerage systems for small, mainly rural, communities who have difficulty funding necessary upgrades.

Funding commitments (including GST) to communities are:

- **Point Wells** - in Rodney, has final approval for $798,750 for a sewerage reticulation scheme with pumping to the Omaha treatment plant.
- **Martins Bay** - south of Snells Beach, has final approval for $281,250 for a sewerage reticulation scheme.
- **Westport** - in Buller has final approval for $7.82 million to build a treatment plant and reticulate the Orowaiti area. The plant has already been constructed.
- **Tauwhare Pa** - in the Waikato, has provisional approval for its project totalling $2.07 million.
- **Punakaiki** - in the Buller District, has provisional approval of $371,250.

Other communities which have had their preliminary applications approved by the Sanitary Works Technical Advisory Committee (SaWTAC) are Ruakaka (Whangarei), Himatangi (Manawatu), Pahi and Tinopai (Kaipara), Te Ohaki Road (Waikato), Waharoa (Matamata Piako), Benneydale (Waitomo), Kawhia (Otorohanga) and Taylorville (Grey). The approximate subsidies for these communities total $28.8 million.

Mr O'Connor said the Labour-led government will look at expanding the sewerage subsidy scheme to support currently unfunded local government proposals, as announced by the Prime Minister on Sunday.

"These are generally higher need communities, many of which are small and rural. I am delighted to announce this government's investment in infrastructure that is vital for the health and wellbeing of people in all our communities," said Mr O'Connor.
