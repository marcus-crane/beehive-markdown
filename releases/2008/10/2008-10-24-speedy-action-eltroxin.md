Minister of Health David Cunliffe today praised the rapid action by Pharmac and Medsafe in getting Eltroxin substitutes on to the New Zealand market by November 1.

"I am aware of the effort that has gone into getting these drugs up and running for New Zealanders who are experiencing a bad reaction to the new formula Eltroxin.

"This must bring a measure of reassurance and comfort to the 700 New Zealanders that have been reporting adverse reactions since the new formula was introduced to the country last year."

Mr Cunliffe said he was also delighted that Pharmac had managed to fast track the approval process so one of the products Goldshield's Levothyroxine (Eltroxin alternative) will be full funded from November the 1.

"I would however note that Medsafe have made it clear that patients who change to the new formulations must continue to be monitored by a doctor."
