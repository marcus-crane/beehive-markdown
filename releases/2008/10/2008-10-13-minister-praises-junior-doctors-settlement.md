Minister of Health David Cunliffe today praised the settlement of the Resident Doctors' Association wage dispute as a win-win for the health sector.

"Patients in our hospitals will not have to face another round of strikes by the Resident Doctors' Association. My primary concern has always been the patients whose safety could be put at risk in the union pursuing unrealistic wage claims."

"I am delighted that this has been achieved in line with other settlements within the health sector."

Mr Cunliffe said having settled the wage round, the RMO workforce has a historic opportunity to better align career development and training with the Health care system with the Commission into the resident doctor's workforce issues. This is a great chance for the resident doctors to have a strategic voice in what happens to their sector.

"I look forward to the Commission and hope that the resident doctors themselves participate fully by making their own submissions on training and workforce conditions," said Mr Cunliffe.

"The Terms of Reference of the Workforce Commission have now been determined and we expect membership of the Commission will be announced soon."

"I expect a final report will be delivered to the Government by next April."
