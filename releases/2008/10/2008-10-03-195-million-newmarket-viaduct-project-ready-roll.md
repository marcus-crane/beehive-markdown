Prime Minister Helen Clark and Transport Minister Annette King today announced that work on the $195 million Newmarket Viaduct project in Auckland can start as early as next month.

Helen Clark today took part in a ceremony at the Viaduct to mark the commencement of the project.

Helen Clark said that the New Zealand Transport Agency ([NZTA](http://nzta.govt.nz/)) Board has decided to release funds for the project now after resource consents were gained earlier than expected

"Construction can now start as early as next month. A significant part of the project will be ready for the Rugby World Cup in 2011 with the whole project due for completion in 2013.

"This is great news for Auckland. The viaduct is used by around 200,000 vehicles every day. The new viaduct will improve traffic flow and ease congestion through this vital part of the motorway network," Helen Clark said.

Annette King said that the Newmarket Viaduct project will replace the 43-year-old six lane bridge with a seven lane structure, incorporating an extra southbound lane.

"Construction will be staged, allowing the motorway to remain operational throughout, and so that the extra southbound lane is available to motorists part way through construction.

"The project will be constructed by the [Northern Gateway Alliance](http://www.northerngateway.co.nz/), which is currently constructing the Northern Gateway route north of Auckland," Annette King said.

Helen Clark said that the Government is investing more than $1 billion in Auckland's transport infrastructure this year alone.

"Of that, $170 million is forecast to be spent on local roads; $490 million on State highways; and $350 million on public transport," Helen Clark said.
