Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor today called for students with an interest in tourism to apply for $15,000 Tourism Research Scholarships.

Applications for the Ministry of Tourism's programme opened today, and offers $15,000 to students undertaking a Masters research thesis on a tourism-related topic in the 2009 study year.

Mr O'Connor said the scholarships are designed to build research capacity in tourism, increase research applicable to the tourism industry and create stronger links between researchers, industry and the public sector.

"The aim of the scholarships is to encourage a research culture in New Zealand tourism, particularly research that is applicable and accessible to the tourism industry.

"Projects will cover exciting areas and will help tourism in New Zealand develop in a sustainable way. The research is vital for New Zealand tourism to keep ahead of the pack," said Mr O'Connor.

This year's scholarships are taking a slightly different approach with the Ministry of Tourism outlining topics of interest, which are of current importance to the industry. Preference will be given to applicants who address these topics.

The topics are:

- Qualmark as a business tool
- The use of Maori culture in tourism
- Differential pricing of tourism products for international and domestic tourists
- Domestic tourism
- Business advantages of sustainability programmes
- Climate change and regional tourism adaptation
- i-SITE Visitor Centres and online booking
- Statistical analysis using the Ministry of Tourism's core tourism dataset

Applications for the 2009 Tourism Research Scholarships close at 5pm on Friday, 21 November 2008. For more information go to [www.tourism.govt.nz/researchscholarships](http://www.tourism.govt.nz/researchscholarships)
