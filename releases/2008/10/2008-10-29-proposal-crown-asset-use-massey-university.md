The government has agreed in-principle to a Massey University request for more control over two Crown assets it uses, Tertiary Education Minister Pete Hodgson said today.

"The two assets involved are the Blair Tennant residential hall in Palmerston North and the College of Education at Hokowhitu," Pete Hodgson said.

"The government has agreed to start a process to sell the Blair Tennant residential hall, and reinvest the proceeds in the university. It has also agreed in-principle to begin a process to enable the transfer of the current site of the College of Education into Massey University ownership. This transfer of ownership would allow the university to determine the future use of the Hokowhitu site.

"The proposal has been under consideration since 2006 and follows other similar suggestions from other tertiary institutions, for example, earlier this year the government agreed to sell the Prosser Street property occupied by Whitireia Community Polytechnic and reinvest the proceeds back into the polytechnic.

"Potentially the proposal will bring about more efficient use of Crown assets and provide Massey University with more certainty and control over sites it already occupies," he said.

The government was working within the existing framework for the sale and transfer of Crown assets which involves consultation with Maori and previous landowners to ensure the protection of their interests.

All decisions would be in-principle, and the actual transactions would go through normal processes with existing protections and clearances.
