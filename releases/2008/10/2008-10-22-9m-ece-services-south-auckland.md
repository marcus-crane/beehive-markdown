Education Minister Chris Carter today announced $9 million over two years to develop nine new early childhood education services on existing school sites in South Auckland.

"We know that quality early childhood education gives our children the best possible chance of succeeding in school and later in life," said Chris Carter.

"Early childhood education participation rates are lower in the Counties Manukau area than in other parts of the country and the government is committed to ensuring more children have access to early learning opportunities."

These services will be a new type of government-sponsored early childhood education property project and will provide for a maximum of 450 new ‘equivalent full time' places for children not currently participating in early childhood education.

The ministry will work with school boards of trustees and organisations that operate the services to ensure they attract and retain children from the target communities.

"This is a quality investment in the future of our children and a key part of our drive to provide the best foundations for our young children to help them grow into successful adults," said Chris Carter.

MP for Manurewa George Hawkins said this decision would boost ECE participation rates in South Auckland and benefit the community as a whole.

"I welcome this decision from Chris Carter. It will benefit our families and youngest citizens greatly. These nine new centres will give South Auckland children the best possible start to their education and set them up for their primary school learning," said George Hawkins.

According to the recently announced Pre-Election Fiscal and Economic Update (PREFU) the government now spends over $1 billion annually on ECE, an increase of 212 per cent since 1999.

Final construction of services on these nine sites remains dependent on agreement with the relevant Boards of Trustees. The schools that have been identified are; Greenmeadows Intermediate, Homai Primary, James Cook High, Mangere Bridge, Mangere East, Mansell Senior, Sir Douglas Bader Intermediate, Weymouth and Manurewa West schools.
