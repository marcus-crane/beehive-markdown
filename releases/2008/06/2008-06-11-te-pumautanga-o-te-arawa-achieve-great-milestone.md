Pumautanga o Te Arawa have worked long and hard to achieve the best out come for their people. Today’s signing of a revised Deed of Settlement is a testament to their willingness and good-faith in this settlement process.” Minister of Maori Affairs, Parekura Horomia said today.

 This morning, Te Pumautanga o Te Arawa, representing the Affiliate Te Arawa and Treaty Negotiations Minister Michael Cullen signed the agreement on Te Pakira Marae in Rotorua.

"This signing signals a way forward for affiliate Te Arawa iwi and hapu, and recognises the significance of these lands to the collective members."

 The Deed of Settlement includes:

·        a formal apology from the Crown to the Affiliate Te Arawa Iwi/Hapu for historical breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi;

·        an amended financial redress package to reflect Te Pumautanga o Te Arawa’s participation in the Central North Island Collective settlement;

·        the transfer of 19 areas of Crown-owned land of special significance to the Affiliate Te Arawa Iwi/Hapu; and

·        redress that will enable increased input into management over Crown-owned land, and protocols with certain government agencies.

The revised settlement no longer includes redress over forestry assets.  Te Pumautanga o Te Arawa have agreed that their historical claims to the Central North Island forests will be settled in any future Central North Island Collective settlement.

“Many a treaty milestone has been reached between the Crown and Maori over the past few months. This is confirmation of the strengtherned relationship Maori and the Crown have developed under a shared responsibility to address Treaty issues and invest in the future of Maori development” 

“I would like to congratulate Te Pumautanga o Te Arawa and look forward to the passage of legislation which will give effect to the settlement.”
