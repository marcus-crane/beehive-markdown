Customs Minister Nanaia Mahuta is congratulating New Zealand Customs Service Comptroller and Chief Executive, Martyn Dunne, who has been elected chairperson of the World Customs Organisation.

 

“This is a tremendous honour for New Zealand and a reflection of the regard in which New Zealand, and the New Zealand Customs Service, is held in the international Customs community,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

“Martyn Dunne has significant international experience working in a broad range of strategic and operational areas, alongside foreign government and international agencies.  His experience will serve him well in the new role.

 

Martyn Dunne was elected at a WCO council session in Brussels over the weekend.

 

The Chairperson assumes various responsibilities in the WCO with regard to the conduct of Policy Commission and Council sessions. 

 

These responsibilities include providing guidance and advice to the Secretary General and providing leadership to the WCO’s members. This might involve commissioning external studies for the Council or mediating between members or regions on issues. 

 

The Chairperson is chosen annually by WCO member states and holds office for a year.  Martyn Dunne, who has been Comptroller and Chief Executive of the New Zealand Customs Service since 2004, will continue in this role, and represent the WCO at major international events. 

 

“The New Zealand Customs Service values integrity, respect and commitment, and having a New Zealander at the helm as chairman is a wonderful achievement and one to be shared across the Customs service,” Nanaia Mahuta said.
