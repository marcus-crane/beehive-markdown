Courts Minister Rick Barker today announced that Mainzeal Property and Construction Limited has been awarded the contract to redevelop the Whangarei courthouse.

"I am pleased to advise the appointment of Mainzeal Property and Construction Limited to carry out the project which involves the construction of a new addition to the existing courthouse that will provide a new Jury courtroom and Jury assembly area, additional judicial chambers and increased custodial facilities," Mr Barker said.

"The redevelopment will see an additional 1173m2 added to the existing court, and extensive alterations and refurbishment to the court building in Bank Street.

"Extensive site works and landscaping will also be carried out as part of the redevelopment.

"The redeveloped courthouse has been designed to meet the needs of the local community now and in the future. As well as being bigger the courthouse will have advanced security systems and will be capable of supporting the latest technology including video conferencing and evidence recording service.

"Construction on the project is scheduled to begin at the end of the month and is expected to be completed by September 2009.

"This project is part of the government's wider building programme to deliver first class justice services to New Zealand."
