Tertiary Education Minister Pete Hodgson signalled stability in student fees today when he announced the proposed Fee and Course Cost Maxima rates for 2009.

The Fee and Course Cost Maxima rates set the maximum fees that tertiary education organisations can charge their students and this proposal will increase the maxima by 2.6 percent.

People interested in making a submission on the rates should do so by 17 July 2008.  Details on making a submission are included in the notice published in the New Zealand Gazette.
