The Minister of Health David Cunliffe today praised the Auckland District Health Board as one of health’s real success stories.

 “ While many of health’s spectacular success stories get drowned out by  a small number of problem areas, the Auckland District health Board should be hailed as an example of just how well the DHB system can work”.

 “In financial terms it has moved from a deficit of $66 .1 million in 2001 -2002 to break even now .It has reduced the percentage of its expenditure it spent on administrative staff in 2003 from 16 percent to less than 10.5 per cent today, said Mr Cunliffe.

 “This is a remarkable achievement, especially considering the large number of complex cases seen within Auckland - it is an example that other DHBs around the country should be following”.  

 Returning from a day spent touring Auckland Hospital and Starship, the Minister said that it must be remembered that the DHB’s hospitals have some of the most advanced treatment facilities in the country and some of the world‘s leading specialists.

“Auckland is lucky to have such a dedicated team of people looking after them and I was very impressed by my visit to the Hospital’s emergency department. Despite being one of the busiest in the country this department has an admission process that ensures patients are treated as quickly as possible.”

 “The next steps for the Auckland District Health Board are to play a strong leadership role on clinical excellence and regional shared services and ensuring a proactive and seamless primary health care approach”, said Mr Cunliffe.

 This visit was part of a series that the Minister is making to DHBs around the country. The Minister, together with his Associate Ministers of Health, have responsibility for particular DHBs and visit them regularly to keep up to date with issues that they face on a day to day basis.

 A particular highlight of his visit was when he met with a small child who had been airlifted into the hospital in a critically ill condition with head and chest injuries and now ten days later was running around the ward. 

Mr Cunliffe said “politicians may spend their time discussing high level policy around health services but at the end of the day what matters is patient care.”
