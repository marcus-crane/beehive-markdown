“Today is a historic occasion for Te Pūmautanga o Te Arawa. They have secured their much sought after Treaty Settlement that they worked long and hard over many years to achieve” said Associate Treaty Minister Mita Ririnui today.

Te Pūmautanga O Te Arawa, the governance body for 11 Te Arawa Iwi and Hapu signed their Deed of Settlement with the Crown today at Te Pakiri Marae, Whakarewarewa in Rotorua.

“Te Pūmautanga O Te Arawa must be commended for their unselfish approach to forestry redress. They passed most of their forestry redress over to the central North Island iwi claim over the Central North Island forests. This collective iwi are currently working towards settlement and Te Pūmautanga O Te Arawa’s forestry interests are encompassed in such a settlement.”

“I am pleased to have reached this stage with Te Pūmautanga O Te Arawa. It is another shining example of how the Crown and iwi can work collaboratively to reach a point of agreement. It is another step towards forming positive relationships between the Crown and iwi.”

Included in the settlement already announced by Treaty Minister Hon Dr. Michael Cullen, additional redress will include the gifting of land under 5 Rotorua schools with lease back arrangements to the Crown; the gifting of Ngatamariki geothermal assets valued at $5 Million; a Crown statement acknowledging Te Arawa’s interests in the upper reaches of the Waikato River and a waver of current Whakarewarewa Village debt.

“Te Pūmautanga O Te Arawa’s negotiating team must be acknowledged for their perseverance in reaching a settlement for the betterment of all iwi members. In particular, I would like to acknowledge Chief Negotiator Rawiri Te Whare and his team Henare Colbert, Ruka Hughes, Kere Cookson-Ua and Brian Barge as well as chair Eru George.”

The Deed is now conditional on the passing of settlement legislation which is expected to be introduced to Parliament within the next fortnight.
