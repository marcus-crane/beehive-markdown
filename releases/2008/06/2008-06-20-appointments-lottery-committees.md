Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker, has announced 15 appointments and reappointments to the Lottery Regional and National Community Distribution Committees, the Lottery Health Research Distribution Committee, and two newly established Committees; the Lottery Individuals with Disabilities Distribution Committee and the Lottery Community Sector Research Committee.

"Eleven Lottery Regional Community Distribution Committees and eight National Distribution Committees distribute the profits of New Zealand Lotteries such as Lotto, Lotto Strike, Instant Kiwi and Keno.  The Lottery Grants Board allocates this money to each distribution committee. The main function of Lottery distribution committees is to provide funding for community projects," Mr Barker said.

The Lottery National Distribution Committees consider applications that have a national focus, or where applicants are national organisations. Lottery Regional Community Distribution Committees consider applications that have a more local focus.  The committees must consider the needs of Maori, Pacific peoples and other ethnic communities, women, youth, older people, and people with disabilities.
