New Zealand’s bid for election to the United Nations Human Rights Council took another step forward today with the launch of a campaign website, Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters said.

 

New Zealand is standing for election next year to the 47-seat Council for the term 2009-2012, and is the first country from the Pacific region to stand.

 

“The campaign website [www.votenz4hrc.org](http://www.votenz4hrc.org) provides information about New Zealand’s election bid, and our work to advance human rights standards,” Mr Peters said.

 

"New Zealand played an active role in setting up the [UN Human Rights Council](http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/WRD) and wants to ensure that the Council realises its full potential.

 

“We have a long history of ground-breaking legislation that advances human rights, such as being the first country to give women the right to vote.

 

"New Zealand works closely with Pacific Island nations to support and protect human rights, which can lead to changes in attitudes and practices that make a lasting difference to people’s lives.

 

"Last month New Zealand’s work to improve the rights of people with disabilities both domestically and internationally was [recognised](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/minister+receives+disability+award+new+zealand) through the Franklin Delano Roosevelt International Disability Award.

 

“We are a credible and committed candidate for election to the UN Human Rights Council in May 2009,” Mr Peters said.

 

New Zealand’s bid for election is supported by Canada and Australia.
