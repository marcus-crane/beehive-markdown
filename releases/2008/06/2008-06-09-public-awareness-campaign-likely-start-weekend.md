TV advertising by the electricity industry is likely to start this weekend to further encourage homes and businesses to be prudent with their power use, Energy Minister David Parker announced today.

The campaign is the next step in a series of actions the government and industry has been taking to manage the prolonged drought, the Minister said.

“Rain over the weekend has had a small positive impact, but unless we receive significantly more this week, a power savings campaign funded by electricity generators will be stepped up, starting on Sunday. 

“We do not want the sick or elderly to turn off the heaters at home.  This is about reminding homes and businesses about the simple steps they can take to reduce power use and save on their power bills, such as turning off lights and equipment that’s not being used.”

“Negotiations with major industrial users to buy-back load will also continue.

“The best advice we have is that if we have normal rainfall in the hydro catchments, as is forecast, extra measures will not be needed.”

“This year’s hydro lake inflows have been even lower than in 1992, yet hydro lake levels remain higher.  This situation is a result of better management, and good cooperation by the industry. I also note the temporary outage of Otahuhu B, a major power station, has also not caused the system to collapse, contrary to some predictions.”
