An Australian model for funding legal claims by investors in failed finance companies is one of several that has caught the interest of Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel who will meet visiting Australian consumer advocate Denise Brailey in Hamilton tomorrow.

Lianne Dalziel has also received suggestions by advocates for Blue Chip investors, including lawyer Paul Dale who wants to see a 'designated co-ordinator' for Blue Chip investors seeking legal aid.

Denise Brailey works for IMF (Australia) Ltd, a publicly listed company that provides money for legal action in cases involving large scale commercial litigation or multiparty actions where the claim size is over A$2 million. IMF only funds legal action, it does not provide legal advice of any sort.

"I'm very interested in helping investors find ways and means to access legal advice, especially where a finance or property investment company failure may be due to illegal behaviour by directors, or where people invested as a result of shonky advice," Lianne Dalziel said.

"It seems that lack of funding for legal action is one of the biggest barriers to investors getting their day in court as many do not qualify for legal aid, despite having lost considerable sums of money and, in some cases, their life savings or their homes.

"Ms Brailey's company provides an interesting model and I'm interested in finding out more about it."

Lianne Dalziel said Ms Brailey had a reputation as a passionate and successful consumer advocate for victims of property or financial advice fraud.

"I'm interested in learning more about the cases Ms Brailey has been involved in and to see if there is anything we in New Zealand can learn from her experience," Lianne Dalziel said.
