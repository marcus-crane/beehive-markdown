Treaty Negotiations Minister Hon Dr Michael Cullen signed Terms of Negotiation on behalf of the Crown with representatives of Ngâti Whatua o Kaipara this morning in Auckland.

"The South Kaipara claims have been the subject of two Waitangi Tribunal reports, the Kaipara interim report in 2002 and a final report in 2006. It is important that the Crown and the South Kaipara claims committee are now commencing negotiations for the settlement of these historical Treaty claims," Dr Cullen said.

The claims of Ngâti Whatua o Kaipara primarily relate to the Crown purchase of Ngâti Whatua o Kaipara land and the operation of the Native Land Laws. 

"The signing of Terms with Ngâti Whatua o Kaipara recognises the significant efforts of those who have been involved in these claims during the past sixteen years. Today’s signing is a welcome addition to the latest steps by the government to settle all historical Treaty claims by 2020.

"This is a positive and dynamic phase for Crown-Mâori relationships in New Zealand," Dr Cullen said.
