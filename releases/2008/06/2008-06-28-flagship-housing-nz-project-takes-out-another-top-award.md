Housing New Zealand’s flagship community renewal project Talbot Park has won yet another commendation, this time from the Property Council New Zealand, says Housing Minister Maryan Street.

Talbot Park in Glen Innes, Auckland, won the top urban design award at the Property Council’s annual prizegiving ceremony last night.

“Winning the Property Council award is yet another feather in the cap of what is fast becoming a landmark in urban design. All those involved in the project should feel very proud of the outstanding work they did to transform Talbot Park,” Maryan Street says.

The community renewal project, completed in 2007, involved removing and refurbishing 167 homes which were replaced with 219 new properties built to meet better the needs of those who live there.

“Talbot Park combined innovative housing design with environmentally friendly aspects, to trial new ideas in state housing to meet the needs of future generations. It has also helped create a real sense of community pride in Glen Innes.

“At the outset of the project, Talbot Park had high crime and tenant turnover. Now that has been transformed. Tenant turnover is down from around 50 per cent to 5 per cent a year, and the area has a safer, stronger neighbourhood.

“Talbot Park is a great example of partnership – partnership between the community, Auckland City Council and Housing New Zealand. Without all three working together none of this could have been achieved. For that reason, it represents one of the best and most exciting urban renewal projects that has ever been embarked on in this country. It’s a fine example for what can be done elsewhere in New Zealand,” Maryan Street said.

Talbot Park has also received top honours at other significant industry awards ceremonies since its completion. Among these are: Australasian Housing Institute award for its contribution to community renewal practice; NZ Architects Institute award for apartment building design; and Master Builders award for family housing.

Maryan Street is also attending the opening of the neigbourhood’s Kotuku and Talbot Parks today. Led by Auckland City Council, the parks have been redesigned to include a children’s playgrounds, skate facilities, green spaces, hard courts, covered event/exercise pavilion and cycle way.

Both the parks and housing development adhered to crime prevention design principles in order to improve safety and reduce crime, Maryan Street said.

“The challenge now is for both the Corporation, and the community to maintain and build on the successes demonstrated at Talbot Park, for the long-term sustainability of the Talbot Park community and for future urban renewal projects.

“The opening of Talbot and Kotuku Parks certainly goes a long way towards ensuring that the development continues to meet the needs of residents both now and in the future.

“The next step is to look beyond Talbot Park at the wider Tamaki area, which includes Glen Innes, Panmure and Point England.

“By partnering with local government, we want to work with the local community to create more attractive neighbourhoods and open spaces, provide quality rental housing and home ownership opportunities, improve transport, education, social and healthcare infrastructure and services, stimulating better employment and economic opportunities in Tamaki,” Maryan Street said.

A Tamaki Plan Development Board, comprising central and local government agencies, is doing some groundwork on how this might be achieved.

“When we have a clearer understanding of the options, extensive community engagement will take place. I want to assure the people of Tamaki that they will play a big role in any changes to the area.”
