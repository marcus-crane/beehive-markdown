Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel wants to provide the public with further opportunities to have input on issues raised during consultation on proposed changes to the New Zealand regime for clearing and settlement systems. 

The changes, which give the government the authority to designate clearing houses and settlement systems, are aimed at making New Zealand a more attractive place for financial trading.

Designation of a settlement system gives statutory backing to the system’s rules, providing finality and meeting international standards. Under the current rules in New Zealand, statutory backing is only an option for payment systems involving cash. The settlement systems currently in place are not designated but if the law changes those systems can apply for designation. Designated settlement systems allow statutory backing to be applied to systems trading commodities including bonds, shares and securities.

The proposed Bill is currently being finalised and is expected to be introduced into Parliament later this year. Lianne Dalziel says the additional consultation process will not interfere with this timetable.

"By introducing the proposed Settlement Systems Bill we hope to provide a process for settlement system designation, while we consider bigger questions of market structure."

It is not yet clear whether the additional consultation will result in a decision to make further legislative amendments.

Consultation on a draft version of the Bill earlier this year highlighted the importance of getting these systems right to support capital market development in New Zealand.

"We’d like to thank those who have provided input so far and look forward to continuing our dialogue with stakeholders in the coming months.

"We hope to work together with anyone who has an interest in these systems, including listed companies, system operators, investors, brokers, banks, and other service providers in the financial sector."

Lianne Dalziel says this will give certainty to key stakeholders that all issues around the proposed Bill will be fully addressed.

The proposed Bill also contains provisions about emission units and futures exchanges. The government is currently considering options that will focus the Bill more appropriately on settlement system designation. Further information on the consultation process will be made available in due course.

The discussion document and an earlier draft Bill, called the Emissions Units, Settlement Systems, and Futures Bill, that were consulted on earlier this year, can be found along with copies of submissions on the Ministry of Economic Development [website.](http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/MultipageDocumentTOC____33704.aspx)
