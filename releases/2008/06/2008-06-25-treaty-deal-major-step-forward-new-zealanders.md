The settlement achieved between the Crown and the Central North Island Iwi Collective is a major step forward for all New Zealanders, Treaty Negotiations Minister Michael Cullen said today.

The Crown and representatives of the seven Collective iwi signed a deed of settlement resolving their claims on central North Island forestry assets.  The agreement is the largest reached in the Treaty of Waitangi Settlements process to date.

The Collective is made up of Ngāi Tūhoe, Ngāti Tuwharetoa, Ngāti Whakaue, Ngāti Whare, Ngāti Manawa, Raukawa, and the Affiliate Te Arawa Iwi and Hapū.  An eighth iwi, Ngati Rangitihi, had previously been a member of the collective and the Crown is holding a door open to them if they choose to return to the Collective.

 “The Treaty Settlements process is giving all New Zealanders a chance to acknowledge difficult aspects of our history,” Dr Cullen said.  “And most importantly, the settlements process is giving all New Zealanders – Maori and Pakeha – a platform to move forward together.

“The Deed of Settlement signed today is the biggest step we have taken in the Treaty Settlements process to date.  Signed by iwi representing over 100,000 people, the Central North Island settlement will deliver a major economic boost to the members of the collective with significant gains for the regional and national economies as well. 

“For nearly 20 years rents have been building up in the Crown Forestry Rental Trust waiting for the issues surrounding the region’s forests to be resolved.  With today’s agreement, nearly 90 per cent of that land and those accumulated rentals can finally be released to the seven iwi involved and unlocked for their economic development.

“The agreement reached today is a result of the iwi-initiated, iwi-led negotiation process started by Dr Tumu Te Heuheu late last year.  On behalf of the Crown I thank all those involved for their hard work and for their commitment to the successful resolution of the Treaty Settlements process.”
