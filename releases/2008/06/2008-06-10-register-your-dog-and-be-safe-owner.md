“It’s a time of year when dog owners should register their dog and that’s a good time to take stock of your dog and its environment,” Local Government Minister Nanaia Mahuta said today.

Nanaia Mahuta is urging dog owners to register their pets before 1 July.

 

“I commend all the councils for their good work in registration and animal management. There are about 484,435 registered dogs in New Zealand. Christchurch City has the most at over 30,000. We know there are plenty more dogs not registered – it’s time to get on board,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

She is heartened by reports from some councils that microchipping is reducing costs.

 

“This is because the speedy return of lost or stolen animals cuts down on paperwork and on the cost of keeping dogs in the pound. Microchipping is usually done by vets and the cost to councils is in the time to view and check the microchipping certificate and putting that information in the National Dog Database,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

“Dog safety requires good law, effective enforcement, community support for enforcement and responsible dog ownership.

 

“We want to enjoy our pets - neither the animals nor the people around them deserve to be under threat from neglected dogs. It only takes a couple of dogs, not fed, not secured or cared for to change the way people feel about their community.”

 

Proposed changes to the law mean that dogs classified as menacing must be neutered if they are of the listed breed or type (currently, American Pit Bull Terrier, Dogo Argentino, Brazilian Fila and Japanese Tosa). It will also mean that a Council can require any other dog classified as menacing to be neutered if they think that dog poses a threat to people, stock or animals.

 

“Late last year I released a discussion paper outlining some options to improve dog control and public safety around dogs. I’m pleased to say that 217 submissions have been received and are being analysed. That’s good community response,” Nanaia Mahuta said.
