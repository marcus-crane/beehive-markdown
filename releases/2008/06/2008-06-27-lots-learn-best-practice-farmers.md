Awards such as the Ballance environmental awards celebrate the business success of farmers who are smart business people, innovative and environmentally conscious, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said.

Speaking at the awards ceremony in Palmerston North, he said that the regional winners we celebrated tonight had seen and proved the value of integrating the environment into their farming practice.

“Every year these awards attract a wide group of entrants – entrants who are prepared to open themselves up to the scrutiny of the judges and ultimately their peers.

“The point of ceremonies like this is to celebrate success and inspire others.

“There is a lot to learn from the practice common to everyone who participated. The experts found there were other characteristics that were consistent across successful entries. Careful business planning and knowledge about current technology and best practice are examples.

“They diversify into area such as farm tourism to take pressure off the natural resources of the farm. They use integrated farming systems, such as goats for weed control and additional income streams, and using farm waste for fertiliser or compost. Land use is well matched to land type and the strengths and weakness of the soil. They conserve wetlands and native bush and encourage wildlife.

“Staff retention is a crucial issue and entrants have excellent staff management. They provide training and staff development. Entrants also tend to be heavily involved in community service and leadership.

“And of course, they are successful businesses.”

Jim Anderton said that protection of our physical environment was more and more a benefit, rather than a cost.

“Integrating the environment into the farm business is working for their business, as well as for our environment. It can save costs and connect with new consumer demands.”

Jim Anderton also announced the inaugural New Zealand Farm Environment Awards Trust–MAF Scholar.

This Scholarship provides an opportunity for the Regional Supreme Award winners to put themselves forward for support to complete an in depth study. 

Each year the Supreme Regional winners will be invited to prepare a proposal for study that advances highly productive and environmentally responsible agriculture. 

“I am now pleased to announce that the New Zealand Farm Environment Awards Trust – MAF Scholar for 2008 is David Ward.”

David and Hilary Ward run a mixed cropping unit on 425 ha near Ashburton where they are achieving top results across a range of crops.

David Ward will use the $15,000 award to investigate the use of Lucerne either as a cut and carry forage crop or grazing for dairy farming and dairy support. 

While lucerne is an older crop traditionally used in New Zealand many years ago, it had lost favour to more modern crop species. Lucerne handles drought conditions far better than most green feed crops, requires lower fertilizer inputs and giving better nutrient conversion.
