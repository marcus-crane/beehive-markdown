Youth Affairs and Local Government Minister Nanaia Mahuta today announced a $1.1 million boost for 16 local councils to fund youth projects in their regions.

 

“This investment comes from the Youth Development Partnership Fund, which supports territorial authorities and young people to work together to provide projects that respond to the real needs of young people in local communities,” Nanaia Mahuta says.

 

"This is the third round of announcements, and it’s great to see central and local government along with the community, working together by investing in projects that target the needs of young people.”

 

The 16 successful project applications were developed by the local councils, with the support and endorsement of their Chief Executive Officers, and young people.

 

"The fund reflects the fact that councils not only need to develop projects which address the needs of young people in their communities, but that they also need to be innovative and inclusive in their approach if they are to truly engage with young people and keep them involved and enthusiastic,”  Nanaia Mahuta says.

 

"It's an opportunity to take an innovative approach which can make a real impact."

 

Since it was established in 2005, the Youth Development Partnership Fund has helped 30 local councils deliver 39 projects, with more than 8,000 young people benefiting from education, training and employment opportunities provided through the projects.

 

Past projects include the Opotiki District Council’s *Tourism Product Development* project which provided a chance for young people to experience business, learn about the tourism industry, and be involved in a community-wide initiative.

 

Upper Hutt City Council also received funding for their *Cadetship Scheme*.  The *Cadetship Scheme* offers support for 18-24-year-olds through their first year of employment by providing training, skill development and work experience in a supportive environment.

 

"These are just a couple of examples where the Youth Development Partnership Fund has made a difference to communities thinking differently about meeting the needs of their young people,” Nanaia Mahuta says.
