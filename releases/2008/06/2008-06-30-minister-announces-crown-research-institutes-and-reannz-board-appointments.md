The appointments (list appended), made up of 14 new appointments, 15 reappointments and 2 appointments of current Directors to Deputy Board Chairs, include a new Chair for AgResearch Ltd – Sam Robinson.

Mr Robinson replaces outgoing Chair Rick Christie, who will step down after six years in the role. “I’d like to thank Rick for his contribution to AgResearch and the agricultural sector over the years” said Pete Hodgson. “Rick has been very successful in leading AgResearch through its renewed focus on pastoral research and development that provides great benefit for New Zealand”.

Mr Robinson is Hawke’s Bay-based and has extensive experience in the farming industry and agricultural sector. He currently serves on the Board of the state-owned enterprise AsureQuality Ltd. He was the Chair of Richmond Limited until July 2004, and is until recently, was the Chair of the Agricultural and Marketing Research and Development Trust (AGMARDT).

“The Crown Research Institutes and REANNZ play an important role in the New Zealand innovation system” said Pete Hodgson. “I am pleased to welcome the new appointments to the Boards, each of whom have a wide mix of skills and experience and will make a valuable contribution”.

The nine Crown Research Institutes and REANNZ employ approximately 4,300 staff throughout New Zealand.
