Minister of Finance Michael Cullen and Minister for Social Development and Employment Ruth Dyson have written to Retirement Commissioner Diana Crossan in response to the 2007 Review of Retirement Income Policy.

The letter notes that a number of the Review’s recommendations focus on the impact of an ageing population and that a cross agency working group will be established to work with the Retirement Commissioner on these issues.
