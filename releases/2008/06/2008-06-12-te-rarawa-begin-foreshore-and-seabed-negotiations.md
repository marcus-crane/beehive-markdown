“I am impressed with the way in which Te Rarawa have made significant progress with their claim to the Foreshore and Seabed in their rohe, which has brought them to today’s signing of their Terms of Negotiation with the Crown” said Associate Minister of Treaty Negotiations Mita Ririnui.

Te Rarawa is the latest iwi to pull a chair up to the Crowns negotiating table to discuss their claim of the foreshore and seabed and today saw the official signing of the Terms of Negotiation between Te Rarawa and the Crown.

With rapid progress being made in the treaty settlements and more recent claims to the foreshore and seabed, Minister Ririnui says he is excited by future prospects and possibilities opening for all other iwi in the country.

“The latest advancements is a sign that the Foreshore and Seabed legislation is working for Maori, and despite huge opposition in the past, the legislation is actually working for Maori interests, not against us.”

“Ngati Porou and Te Whanau Apanui have signed their Heads of Agreement with the Crown and now Te Rarawa have an opportunity to obtain the same status, there is no reason why other iwi can not become involved in negotiations and benefit from what is available as customary redress as well.”

“Te Rarawa should be commended for their vision and commitment to progressing their claims. As many of us know, it is a long hard road when working on treaty settlements and it is easy to become sidetracked. If Te Rarawa continue on this path, there is no reason why they would not reach a settlement in the near future.”

An Agreement in Principle will now need to be developed where Te Rarawa will be required to identify specific parts of the public foreshore and seabed in the Te Rarawa rohe where the hapu of Te Rarawa would have held territorial customary rights to prior to the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004.
