New Zealand’s forest cover is largely unchanged because deforestation caused by land use changes, such as clearing forests to create more dairy farms, has been matched by replanting and new forest plantings, Forestry Minister Jim Anderton said today.

“While our total forest estate stopped expanding in 2003 and has contracted slightly, the total change in New Zealand’s exotic forest cover since 2003 is just under 1% - so this is not, as some suggest, a disaster for the environment or for the forestry industry.

“Of the 40,800 hectares of forest harvested last year, 33,000 hectares were replanted and a further 2,600 hectares of new forest were also planted, which clearly reflects a degree of confidence in the future for forestry. These figures have come down from historically high levels of planting in the 1990s when plantings were subsidised, but with the current economic conditions this is still a high level of continued investment in forestry.

“Hysterical scaremongering reports of “chainsaw massacres” and “mass deforestation” are just that – election year spin that is not based on reality. The evidence shows that reality is quite different – replanting and new planting continues.”

As noted in a recent report from the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry, published last week, recent deforestation was land management change – people shifting productive land from forestry into something more profitable, such as dairying. The overwhelming majority of this land use change occurred on land in Canterbury and the North Island’s Central Plateau that is demonstrably more suitable for pastoral farming but for historical reasons (soil quality and financial incentives) had been planted in pine trees.

“This land use change picked up in 2004, matching the time when forestry returns slid to record lows and dairying really started to take off. This has a positive outcome for landowners personally, the region in terms of employment, and the country in terms of a vibrant economy.”

Jim Anderton said that what deforestation had been occurring slowed right down at the beginning of this year as a new control regime came into effect and the future of forestry in the era of climate change is looking brighter. 

He said that the proposed Emissions Trading Scheme legislation would help new investment in carbon forestry take off, and there were already examples of significant investment being planned in carbon sink forests.

“Deforestation will mainly occur where the economic returns can pay for the carbon liabilities and still be profitable. The Government elected to introduce an Emissions Trading Scheme, rather than regulation to stop deforestation, precisely because it allows flexibility of land use. ”

Jim Anderton said that, despite difficult market conditions for forestry, it would continue to be an important industry in New Zealand and investors shouldn’t be intimated by the reckless scaremongering of politicians and those with narrow financial interests trying to talk up an election year ‘crisis’.
