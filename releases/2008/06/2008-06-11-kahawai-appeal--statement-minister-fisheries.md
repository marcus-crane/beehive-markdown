The Court of Appeal has today released its judgement on an appeal following the judicial review of Ministerial decisions in 2004 and 2005 on catch limits and the allocation of kahawai catch between recreational and commercial fishers.

These court cases arose because both recreational and commercial fishers were unhappy about how the previous Minister of Fisheries set catch levels for kahawai in 2004 and 2005.

“We will have to carefully consider the implications of this judgement” said Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton today.

“I note that the Court was sympathetic to the difficult decisions that Minister of Fisheries have to make and it agreed with the High Court Judge that when making these decisions we walk a tightrope between two powerful interest groups.”

“I also note the direction of the Court to review the bag catch limits for recreational fishers next time I set catch levels for kahawai,” Jim Anderton said.

“There are a number of issues identified in the judgement. I am seeking advice from Ministry of Fisheries and Crown Law officials on what the judgement means for the ongoing management of the kahawai fishery.”
