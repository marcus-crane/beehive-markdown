Chill your power bill by getting rid of your old, inefficient fridge and looking for the ENERGY STAR® mark to find the most efficient new one.

From this week, the most energy-efficient 25 percent of fridges will carry the blue ENERGY STAR® mark, the independent, international benchmark for energy efficiency. At the same time, old, energy guzzling fridges are being collected for recycling and disposal.

Replacing an average 10 year old fridge with a new model will save up to $100 a year, and an ENERGY STAR fridge could save you up to an additional 30 percent on top.

Government Spokesperson for Energy Efficiency Jeanette Fitzsimons says this will not only make a difference to your power bill, but also make a difference to the planet.

“With World Environment Day happening this week, it’s a good time to think about what you can do.”

The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) is teaming up with partners, including Noel Leeming, to offer cash incentives to get rid of old fridges which are disposed of in an environmentally responsible manner. Noel Leeming sends the fridges to Fisher & Paykel’s recycling programme.

“Many old fridges are more than 15 years old, very inefficient, and research suggests up to one in six are faulty. This means they’re using two to three times more electricity than a new one. The potential for savings is significant,” says Jeanette Fitzsimons.

Noel Leeming is New Zealand’s first ENERGY STAR retail partner and Chief Executive Andrew Dutkiewicz, says: “we’re really pleased to be able to offer energy efficiency support for our customers at both ends of the scale – by helping people get rid of their old, inefficient fridges, and helping them understand the superior energy efficiency of new fridges and other appliances that carry the ENERGY STAR mark.”

“This is a great example of how the retail sector can get involved with helping New Zealanders make decisions that are good for the wallet and good for the environment,” says Jeanette Fitzsimons.
