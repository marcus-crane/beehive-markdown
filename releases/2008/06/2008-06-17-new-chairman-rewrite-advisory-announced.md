Revenue Minister Peter Dunne today announced the appointment of Wellington barrister David McLay as the new chairman of the Rewrite Advisory Panel, the body that oversees the rewrite of income tax law into plain language.

Mr McLay takes over from Sir Ivor Richardson, who was appointed chairman in 2003.

“Mr McLay is eminently qualified to assume the chairmanship of the Panel,” Mr Dunne said.

“He has practised as a tax barrister since 2003, following 17 years as tax partner with Bell Gully, and is a widely known tax lawyer who has considerable experience in most areas of tax law and tax litigation.

“The Rewrite Advisory Panel was formed in 1995 to oversee the progressive rewrite of the Income Tax Act 1994 into law that is clear, written in plain language and is structurally consistent.

“That massive undertaking was completed in late 2007 with the enactment of the Income Tax Act 2007.

“There is still important work for the panel to do, however. It will now review the submissions of those who have identified what may be unintended changes in the law as a result of its having been rewritten and, where necessary, recommend legislative action to correct any problems.

“The panel will also monitor the working of the new 2007 Act to ensure its consistency with the objectives of the Rewrite.

“I welcome Mr McLay to the role of chairman, and thank Sir Ivor Richardson for the outstanding contribution he made to the completion of the Rewrite,” Mr Dunne said.
