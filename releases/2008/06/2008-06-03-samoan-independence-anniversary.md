New Zealand has a special relationship with Samoa, Pacific Island Affairs Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said tonight while attending the 46th anniversary of the Independence of Samoa hosted by the Samoan High Commissioner. 

Samoa became independent from the New Zealand administered United Nations Trusteeship on 1 January 1962. This is celebrated in Samoa and by Samoans around the world on 1 June every year.

"An important element of the close relationship between New Zealand and Samoa is the 1962 Treaty of Friendship, agreed shortly after Samoa achieved independence.

"The treaty is unique and of symbolic importance, as Samoa is the only country that New Zealand has a formal treaty of friendship with," Laban said.

"As a Pacific nation, New Zealand has a special relationship with our Pacific neighbours, and particularly Samoa. It is also important that we in New Zealand know about our history and this friendship.

"Our close ties with Samoa are also underpinned by the number of people of Samoan ethnicity living in New Zealand, who make up around fifty per cent of New Zealand's Pacific population.

"Samoans make an important contribution to the social, economic, political and sporting life of New Zealand and this is reflected in our links with Samoa, who we work closely with on issues of common interest.

"The anniversary of Samoan Independence provides an important opportunity to reflect on the past, celebrate our special friendship, and look to the future," Laban said.

Laban also attended and spoke at an ecumenical Samoan church service held in Wellington on 1 June to join in celebration of independence with Samoans all over New Zealand, in Samoa and the rest of the world.
