New Zealand businesses are set to strengthen the kiwi presence and leadership on the United Nations' Climate Neutral Network - with 16 joining so far and others poised to sign up, Environment Minister Trevor Mallard said at a Wellington meeting of the international network today.

"The Climate Neutral Network run by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) provides a good opportunity for businesses and organisations to share carbon neutral strategies and collaborate on innovations to tackle climate change. It's great to hear that kiwi companies make up about half of all the companies/organisations from around the world who are members of this fledgling network so far," Trevor Mallard said.

"I'm told that sixteen New Zealand businesses have joined to date and more are in the process of applying for membership.

"The government signed New Zealand up to the network when it was set up in February, as one of the four original countries. Tomorrow New Zealand is host country for the United Nations World Environment Day, and as we focus on its theme of moving towards a low carbon economy, it's excellent to see these kiwi firms making international commitments to reduce their carbon emissions. I hope others will follow their lead."

The Climate Neutral Network meeting was hosted in Wellington on the eve of World Environment Day by State Owned Enterprise Meridian Energy and Crown Research Institute Landcare Research, which are both members of the network.

"Climate change should not be viewed just as a cost -- it offers economic opportunities and spinoffs for New Zealand as more and more consumers worldwide demand climate friendly goods and services. Companies that seek to reduce their carbon emissions and embrace sustainability throughout their business, and that aim for carbon neutrality can get a competitive edge over firms that ignore climate change and do nothing about their pollution and waste," Trevor Mallard said.

"As this network grows in stature, it will be a valuable source of knowledge for countries, cities, organisations and businesses which want to exchange ideas about moving towards lower carbon consumption, and then carbon neutrality."
