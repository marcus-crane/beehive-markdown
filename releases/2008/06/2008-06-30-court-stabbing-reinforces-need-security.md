Today's stabbing in Wellington District Court reinforced the wisdom of boosting court security as announced in last month's Budget.

Courts Minister Georgina te Heuheu said the stabbing was a tragedy for the man, his family, court staff and members of the public who witnessed it.

Wellington District Court will be one of the first to benefit from the additional security. 

Today's court list was not regarded as high risk and the man, who was appearing for sentencing after being remanded on bail at an earlier hearing, was not scanned.

Budget 2009 provided $9 million in operating funding and $800,000 in capital funding to upgrade court security over the next four years.

‘While I am naturally pleased this Government moved quickly to address court security, I find it irresponsible that Labour turned down budget bids three years in a row.'

Mrs te Heuheu says the new funding will help improve safety for court users and staff while maintaining public confidence in the justice system.

‘Courts by their nature are emotionally tense environments where parties in dispute are brought together.

‘Scanning and searching people entering courts is the single most effective way of reducing the risk of security incidents.

‘The physical presence of dedicated security officers will help prevent incidents such as that which occurred in Wellington today.'
