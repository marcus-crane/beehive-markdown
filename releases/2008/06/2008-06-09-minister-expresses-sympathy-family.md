Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter today expressed his deepest sympathies to the family of Navtej Singh who was callously shot while attending to his Manurewa liquor store on Saturday night.

“Words cannot describe the grief that his family must be feeling at this time,” Chris Carter said.

The Minister also commented on how vulnerable family operated businesses are to crime. He said that these stores often run on skeleton staff and cannot always afford to install adequate security that may otherwise discourage would-be criminals.

Chris Carter along with Police Minister Annette King met with the New Zealand Indian Central Association (NZICA) executive in February to discuss the safety of small business operators.  This followed an incident in South Auckland where a young Indian man, Krishna Naidu, was killed while working at his family’s dairy.

Following this initial meeting in Auckland, community representatives have again met with both the Ethnic Affairs Minister and Police Minister to discuss what measures could be put in place to improve the safety of staff working in small owner operator businesses.   

“In our discussions with community members we have decided on a number of measures that could improve the safety of staff in these stores.  We are looking at some longer term solutions to address these concerns,” Chris Carter said.
