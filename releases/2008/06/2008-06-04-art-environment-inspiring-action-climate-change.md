Climate Change Minister David Parker says he is delighted to open the United Nations Art for the Environment exhibition today as part of World Environment Day 2008 celebrations being hosted in New Zealand. 

The exhibition, entitled ‘Moving Towards a Balanced Earth: Kick the Carbon Habit’, is part of World Environment Day’s ongoing Art for the Environment initiative.

“This exhibition uses photographs, paintings, sculpture, video, multimedia and conceptual installations to inspire audiences and motivate them to take environmental action,” David Parker said.

The Natural World Museum, (an international cultural foundation based in San Fransisco which focuses on art as a way to engage people in environmental awareness and action), in partnership with the United Nations Environment Programme and the Ministry for the Environment will present works of art from 27 artists representing 20 countries.

The exhibition will be hosted at Te Papa in Wellington until 7 September 2008, before travelling through Latin America, North America, Asia, and Europe.

New Zealand artists Alison Clouston, Bill Culbert, Ralph Hotere, and Geoff Dixon have shared their vision with exhibited works.

“These artworks are a unique way of communicating climate change and its effects that move beyond the traditional realm of science. I hope New Zealanders who come to see the exhibition are inspired to take steps towards sustainability.

“World Environment Day is providing New Zealanders with the opportunity to attend the many wonderful events like this one, taking place across the country throughout the week, and to raise their consciousness on climate change issues facing us today,” said David Parker.
