### Raukawa and the Crown have today signed Terms of Negotiations, marking the beginning of negotiations for the settlement of Raukawa’s outstanding historic Treaty of Waitangi claims, Treaty Negotiations Minister Michael Cullen said.

### The initial focus of Raukawa negotiations is on their claims over the Waikato River.  Raukawa today also signed the Central North Island Collective Deed of Settlement.

### Raukawa is one of the largest iwi in the central North Island with claims spanning an area including parts of both the Waikato and Bay of Plenty regions.  The negotiations will not include the claims of the closely related Raukawa ki Te Tonga Iwi from the Manawatu/Horowhenua region.

### Raukawa’s claims relate to the loss of large areas of the central North Island in various ways, along with the impact of the Crown’s military actions and land confiscations in the Waikato region.

### “Raukawa has been working collectively with their neighbours on their Treaty claims– including over CNI forests and the Waikato River during the past 12 months,” Dr Cullen said. “I commend the constructive approach that Raukawa has taken to engagement with the Crown to bring these matters to resolution.

### “This is a positive and dynamic phase for Crown-Maori relationships in New Zealand.”
