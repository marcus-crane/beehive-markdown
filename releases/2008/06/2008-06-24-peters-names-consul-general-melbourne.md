Career diplomat Rob Hole will be New Zealand’s new Consul-General in Melbourne, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

 

“The government is boosting New Zealand’s diplomatic representation in Melbourne as part of a wider effort to advance our political, economic, and trade interests in Australia," Mr Peters said.

 

“Two-way trade with the state of Victoria is worth over $4 billion a year, and we have particularly important links in the areas of tourism, defence procurement, and science and innovation.   

 

"The decision to base a diplomat in Melbourne was made in the wider context of the major funding boost the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade received in this year’s Budget, aimed at lifting New Zealand’s international presence and influence.

 

“As Consul-General, Mr Hole will work closely with the New Zealand Trade and Enterprise staff already based in Melbourne, and with our High Commission in Canberra,” Mr Peters said.

 

Mr Hole is currently deputy director of the Information and Public Affairs Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and has previously been posted to Washington DC, Honiara, Moscow, and London.  He takes up his position in October.
