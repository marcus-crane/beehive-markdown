The latest recipient of the Enviroschools Green-Gold award was announced by Education Minister Chris Carter today at Beachlands School.

Beachlands School has received the Green-Gold award for their work in setting up the Kaiawai gardens project which produces fruit and vegetables. The school also raises chickens for recycling food scraps, has established worm farms that biodegrade waste hand-towels, as well as running recycling projects.

“This is a terrific achievement by Beachlands Schools, one of just eight schools in New Zealand to have earned this award for their work in environmental studies.

“I commend the dedication of students and staff in making their school more environmentally sustainable,” Chris Carter said.

Enviroschools is a nationwide sustainable schools programme that presents awards aimed at recognising commitment to environmental sustainability at school and in the local community.

The programme that began as a small community partnership in Hamilton is now active in approximately 550 schools around New Zealand.

Other recipients of the Green-Gold award previously announced this year have been Te Miro School near Cambridge and Pukerua Bay School north of Wellington.

“This award recognises the hard work that has gone into making this school more environmentally friendly and I hope that work will continue beyond school, with family, whanau and communities all doing there part toward a more sustainable future,” said Chris Carter.
