The government must follow due legal process in order to release the report referred to on the front page of the Dominion Post today, State Services Minister David Parker said.

“Kristy McDonald QC provided a report on this ministerial inquiry to Hon Annette King and me in mid-December of last year.

“The report outlines an unfortunate and tragic series of events that led to the death of a young woman at the hands of a drunk driver.

“There are complex issues involved which have prevented the release of the report and these will become clear once it is released. Some of the content is subject to suppression orders and officials have had to work through the legality of releasing that material. Today’s report in the Dominion Post does not appear to breach those orders and I commend the newspaper for its responsible reporting.

“Crown Law has filed an application with the High Court to revise suppression orders which currently restrict the release of the inquiry report. An urgent hearing date has been sought for that application.

“I can completely understand the frustration the victim’s family feels. We have great sympathy for the effect that this inquiry process has had on them. Officials and Hon Annette King have met with the family and kept them informed of developments throughout.

“I look forward to releasing Kristy McDonald’s findings and recommendations once due legal process has been followed, so that proper public scrutiny of these events can take place, as was the intent of this inquiry when Hon Annette King instigated it late last year.”
