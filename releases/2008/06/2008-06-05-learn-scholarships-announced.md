The Government is to offer up to nine scholarships for scientists from developing countries working in animal greenhouse gas emissions research to work in New Zealand, Acting Agriculture Minister Damien O’Connor said today.

 Mr O’Connor said that in November last year, New Zealand set up an international research network entitled the ‘Livestock Emissions & Abatement Research Network’ (LEARN).  It is an international research network focused upon improving the understanding of greenhouse gas emissions from livestock agriculture.

 The objectives of the network are to improve the quantification of non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from animal agriculture at all scales, and to facilitate the development of cost effective and practical greenhouse gas mitigation solutions.

 Mr O’Connor said that as part of this, the Government would offer up to nine New Zealand LEARN Fellowships a year for scientists or technicians from developing countries to work in New Zealand in livestock emissions research. 

 “Successful candidates will have the opportunity to work alongside some of the world’s best researchers and develop links that they will keep throughout their careers,” said Mr O’Connor

 The scholarships take two forms: a six-month programme for candidates who have completed a post-graduate qualification in their home country and who wish to gain work experience in New Zealand relevant to their field of study, with preference given to those applicants who are currently enrolled in a PhD in their home country; and a year-long Post-Doctoral for candidates who have preferably completed a PhD within five years of LEARN Fellowship application submission.

 They must be either currently employed by, or sponsored by, a Research Institute or Government organisation in their home country. 

 Education NZ will administer the LEARN Fellowship programme. More information available at:  [www.newzealandeducated.com/scholarships](http://www.newzealandeducated.com/scholarships)  or [www.livestockemissions.net/](http://www.livestockemissions.net/)
