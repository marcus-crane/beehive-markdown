“Maori have waited long enough and are now able to celebrate the ever growing presence and acceptance of rongoa Maori in 21st century Aotearoa” says Associate Health Minister Mita Ririnui.

Launching Te Paepae Matua mo te Rongoa – the Rongoa National Regional Body Taumata - at Hauiti Marae in Tologa Bay last month, Minister Ririnui welcomed the new acceptance of rongoa Maori in today’s society, but firmly stated that it is not rongoa Maori that needs to change to meet western methodology’s of health, it is our society that needs to change to accept rongoa Maori.

“Rongoa Maori has survived through our tupuna and kaumatua passing this knowledge down to the next generation. Its survival has been natural and long lasting. It does not need to change and it does not need things to survive, but with support it will flourish.”

In recognition of the inequalities of health for Maori compared to that of non-Maori, the government implemented several new initiatives in 2000 to focus on bridging those gaps in health. One initiative was to contract 12 Maori Health Providers to provide traditional rongoa services to the community.

The demand for such a service has continued to grow to where the Ministry is now contracting 16 Maori Health Providers to deliver rongoa Maori services within their respective communities.

In 2006 the Ministry of Health released Taonga Tuku Iho – Treasure of our Heritage, the Rongoa Development plan. The document outlined how it would support further development of rongoa Maori and establishing a national body was part of that plan.

Toanga Tuku Iho and Te Paepae Matua mo te Rongoa will be worked together to insure rongoa Maori gains strong support and appreciation within the health sector.

“The new taumata is about the place rongoa holds in our country. Our rongoa practitioners can get on with doing what they know and love, confident that Te Paepae Matua mo te Rongoa is there making sure rongoa has a place to stand.”
