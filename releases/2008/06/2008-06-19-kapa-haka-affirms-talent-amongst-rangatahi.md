Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta is praising the hard work and effort of rangatahi taking part in this year’s Secondary Schools National Kapa Haka competition.

 

“It’s great to see the pride of young performers on stage and its obvious they have put in a lot of practice hours and hard work to get to the competition,” Nanaia Mahuta said.  

 

The three day event has been held at the TSB Arena in Wellington this week, bringing together about 50 Kapa Haka groups from schools across Aotearoa/New Zealand.

 

“I’m passionate about Kapa Haka, because it’s an opportunity to for rangatahi and to demonstrate their contribution to maintaining te reo Maori.  There is certainly a high level of artistic talents in Maori Performing Arts,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

“These young people have practiced for months.  It takes dedication, not just for the performers but for their tutors and their whanaau.”

 

Kapa haka combines dance, song, rhythm, and harmony to tell a story.  It’s unique and it’s indigenous to our great country. Groups went through regional competition, where the top schools were selected for the national competition.

 

The nationals, which is part of Wellington’s Matariki celebrations, and Nanaia Mahuta is impressed with the commitment shown by the representatives of the 14 rohe involved in this year’s event.

 

“It’s a competitive environment and one where the young people thrive.  It’s wonderful to see so much enthusiasm and creativity. It’s the Maaori equivalent to other Secondary schools competitions like Stage Challenge or Battle of the Bands,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

“I congratulate the Whanganui-a-Tara Teachers Association who are hosting Kapa Haka Kura Tuarua 08, and all the participants. I’m looking forward to seeing more of the high calibre performances and congratulate all participants, sponsors, judges, tutors and whaanau supporting the event.”
