Tourism expenditure has surpassed $20 billion a year for the first time according to new figures out today, said Tourism Minister Damien O’Connor.

The *Tourism Satellite Account: 2007*, published today by Statistics New Zealand, shows tourism spend in New Zealand increased 4.7 percent ($896 million) in the year to March 2007 compared to the previous year. 

The figures also show international tourism expenditure accounted for $8.8 billion, or 18.3 percent of New Zealand’s exports, compared with $8.4 billion the previous year, confirming tourism remains New Zealand’s number one export earner.

Mr O’Connor said the report demonstrates just how important tourism is to New Zealand’s economy, contributing 9.2 percent of GDP.

“The sheer size of the tourism industry and its potential to help transform our economy into one which is more sustainable and of higher value means it is extremely important to New Zealand,” said Mr O’Connor.

“These figures are a culmination of the huge amount of effort and innovation thousands of companies and individuals demonstrate on a daily basis.

“Tourism's future depends upon sustainability and delivering greater value from each and every visitor to this country.  We need to continue to deliver on our world famous 100% Pure New Zealand brand and implement the outcomes of the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015 to ensure ongoing prosperity in the industry.

“While escalating oil prices will provide a challenge for tourism and every other industry in this country, it is a challenge faced across the globe.  Our ability to compete will depend on delivering a better product than our competitors, ensuring we are environmentally, economically, socially and culturally sustainable.

“Operating sustainably is no longer optional.  In today’s world it is essential for business success.  Doing what we can to protect our environment will also reward us financially, ensuring the economic sustainability of the tourism industry and New Zealand as a whole,” said Mr O’Connor.
