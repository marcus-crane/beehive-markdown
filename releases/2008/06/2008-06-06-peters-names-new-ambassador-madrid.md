New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Spain will be career diplomat Rob Moore-Jones, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

 

Mr Moore-Jones will also be accredited as Ambassador to Morocco and the Holy See.

 

“Spain is an increasingly important economic partner for New Zealand.  Tourism and investment links continue to grow,” Mr Peters said.

 

“We have recently concluded bilateral agreements on taxation and on co-operation in film production and are now exploring further avenues to enhance cultural and personal ties.

 

“New Zealand and Spain share a common approach to many international issues, including a commitment to effective multilateralism.  We are dedicated, for example, to combating extremism through the promotion of inter-religious and inter-cultural co-operation in forums such as the Alliance of Civilisations,” Mr Peters said.

 

Mr Moore-Jones is currently Foreign Affairs Adviser to Mr Peters. He has previously served as New Zealand’s High Commissioner to the Cook Islands, and Ambassador to the Philippines.

 

Mr Moore-Jones will take up his appointment in February 2009, replacing Geoff Ward, who is returning to Wellington.
