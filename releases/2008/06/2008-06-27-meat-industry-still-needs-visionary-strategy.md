Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said today that he was disappointed the Meat and Wool New Zealand’s industry taskforce had been disbanded.

“It’s disappointing, because we have an industry with a long history and a good product, but it’s in some disarray at the moment. There is a need for an industry-wide vision and strategy, but that’s obviously going to take some time.”

Jim Anderton said he remained committed to working with the industry to find a way forward.

He said any proposal should be based around a clearly articulated industry strategy.

“Simply changing the structure of the meat industry is unlikely to provide for the long-term sustainable profitability that we all desire. There is a lot more to do.”

He said the long term outlook for the primary sectors, including red meat, is very favourable

“High quality, high value, safe protein, produced in environmentally sound ways – as we do in New Zealand – is going to become increasingly sought-after.”
