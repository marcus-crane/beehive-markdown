Ngati Whatua o Kaipara are the latest iwi to move further up the treaty settlement ladder with the signing of the Ngati Whatua o Kaipara Terms of Negotiation with the Crown in Auckland today.

Associate Minister of Treaty Negotiations Mita Ririnui says he is happy to see progress for these claimants, many of whom became involved in these claims from the beginning, some sixteen years ago.

“It is great to see that we are making head way with Ngati Whatua o Kaipara and have witnessed the signing of the Terms of Negotiation today. The process has been a long and often arduous task but myself and my colleagues as well as representatives from Kaipara are all committed to working towards the most positive outcome – a treaty settlement that will suit all concerned.”

The Ngati Whatua o Kaipara claims focus primarily on historical grievances around the Crowns purchase of Ngati Whatua o Kaipara land and the operation of the Native Land Laws.

The next step for the Ngati Whatua o Kaipara treaty negotiations will be to form an Agreement in Principal and Minister Ririnui believes that there is no reason why such a milestone could not be achieved soon.

“We are forming another positive Crown-Iwi relationship built around good faith and a mutual desire to maintain the progress shown here today. The platform has been set and I am looking forward to achieving the end result, some time in the future.”
