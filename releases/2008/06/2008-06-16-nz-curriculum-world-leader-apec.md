The New Zealand curriculum was the centrepiece of the APEC Education Ministers’ meeting in Peru last week and was widely praised, Education Minister Chris Carter said.

At the request of Peru’s Education Minister and host of the conference, Jose Antonio Chang Escobedo, Mr Carter delivered a keynote presentation on how we have successfully modernised our school curriculum.

“Our curriculum is regarded as world-class and New Zealand is at the forefront internationally on curriculum change. We were asked to take centre-stage at the conference opening because of the recognised quality of our new curriculum,” said Chris Carter.

Chris Carter said New Zealand’s curriculum is seen as a best-practice model by APEC and other countries are deeply interested in modernising their own school curricula along similar lines.

“The 19 countries present were keen to hear about how we have developed our curriculum, especially its collaborative approach involving the public, business, unions, students, principals, teachers and other educationalists.”

In developing the new curriculum 15,000 people were consulted and 10,000 written submissions were made. The draft document was peer reviewed by international and national education experts.

The APEC Education Ministers’ Joint Statement highlighted the importance of education systems focusing on the kinds of broad competencies that are included in the new New Zealand curriculum.

“These competencies are not solely aimed at preparing all young people to work in a 21st century economy, but also at becoming quality citizens in a diverse and interconnected local, national and global society,” Chris Carter said.
