New Zealand is providing $4 million to help Vanuatu ensure all children receive quality basic education, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

 

“Literacy and numeracy levels in Vanuatu compare poorly with other Pacific countries, and many children are missing out on education altogether. It’s important we do what we can to turn this around,” Mr Peters said.

 

“A good basic education offers many benefits in countries such as Vanuatu. It makes people more employable, and therefore improves the living standards of individuals, families and communities.

 

“New Zealand has a long history of supporting education in Vanuatu and we are committed to providing future funding.

 

"Our contribution will be directed through the government’s international aid and development agency NZAID to the Vanuatu Education Support Action Plan.

 

“The plan is a 12-month joint initiative between Vanuatu, New Zealand and Australia, and marks a new era in education in Vanuatu.

 

“New Zealand’s support will go towards the renovation of 25 primary schools, the purchase of stationery and reading books in English and French, and building the capacity of Vanuatu’s Ministry of Education," Mr Peters said.
