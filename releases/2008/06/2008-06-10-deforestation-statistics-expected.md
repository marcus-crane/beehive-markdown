The deforestation statistics as contained in a MAF report published today are as expected, Forestry Minister Jim Anderton said.

He said that, as the report from the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry noted, a lot of the deforestation was land management change – people shifting productive land from forestry into something more profitable, such as dairying.

“This picked up in 2004, matching about the time when dairying really started to take off. This is good for landowners personally, the region in terms of employment, and the country in terms of a vibrant economy.

“Does Nick Smith intend to stop people using their resources in the best way? Perhaps he better check with head office first, after all they may have a different policy?”

Jim Anderton said the Government’s policy on sustainable land management was quite clear, and landowners had been given a transition period to make changes before the new controls were introduced.

“An increase in deforestation was anticipated, and it is not a surprise that some landowners deforested their land before January 1 this year.

“Forecasts show that deforestation is down sharply now the new policy is in place, and increased planting is expected. The Government’s policy is clear and it is having a substantial impact.”
