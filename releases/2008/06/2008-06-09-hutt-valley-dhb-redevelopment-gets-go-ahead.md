Residents of the Hutt Valley will benefit from an $81.9 million redevelopment of Hutt Valley District Health Board’s theatre and Accident and Emergency Departments.

Minister of Health David Cunliffe received the final business case on Thursday and spent the weekend reviewing the information.

 “There is no doubt from the information presented to me that this redevelopment is needed and will be of significant benefit to the community and clinicians.”

The proposal will see four new theatres built at Hutt Valley Hospital and the Emergency Department expanded and redeveloped.

 “The proposal that has been developed will not only increase the number of patients that are able to be seen but will also provide for a more efficient and effective workplace for clinicians.”

 The project will be funded from a Government injection of $60 million, while Hutt Valley DHB will provide the balance to complete the project.

 “I am satisfied that Hutt Valley DHB, the Ministry of Health and central agencies conducted a robust process that will ensure the redevelopment will meet the needs of the community.”

 Since 2000, Ministerial approval has been granted for more than 30 capital projects around the country to value of more than $1.3 billion.

 Those projects have included either new or redeveloped hospitals in Wairarapa, Southland, Canterbury, Wellington, Auckland and others and have also included a number of other initiatives such as a new dementia unit for the West Coast and a new linear accelerator for Wellington.

“As a government we have committed to the largest improvement in health infrastructure in living memory that will serve New Zealanders well for many decades to come.”
