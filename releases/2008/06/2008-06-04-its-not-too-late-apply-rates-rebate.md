Local Government Minister and Tainui MP Nanaia Mahuta says it is not too late for people to apply for a rates rebate for this year.

“Applications for this financial year have to be received by local councils by 30 June, so eligible households still have three weeks to apply,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

The government provided leadership on this issue in 2006 when, under the Rates Rebate Scheme we raised the annual rebate from $200 up to a maximum of $500.

 

“These rebates are particularly important for our senior citizens and kaumatua (65+) who can really benefit, and gain much needed relief from a rebate,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

“While the income eligibility for a rebate is $20,000, those who are on higher income can still be entitled to a rebate depending on their circumstances.

 

“While it’s great to know that more households are applying for a rates rebate, there are many people and households who are eligible for a rates rebate, but have not yet applied,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

“This reflects the government’s commitment to lower-income homeowners, and supporting them in the contribution they make through rates to the local community.

 

Up to $70 million has been allocated for the Rates Rebate Scheme for the current rating year.  Up to $70 million has been allocated for the Rates Rebate scheme for the current rating year. Eligibility depends on a combination of income and rates levels, along with the number of dependants.   For example, a married couple on NZ Superannuation of $25,278 and paying annual rates of $1,899 or more would be entitled to $500. A married couple on NZ Superannuation of $25,278 and paying annual rates of $1,500 would be entitled to a $234 rebate.

 

Budget 08 future-proofed the Scheme, ensuring that the rebate and income eligibility will be amended to reflect inflation levels.

 

“I want to encourage people to make contact with their local council and enquire about whether they are eligible, before the 30 June deadline for the end of this financial year.” Nanaia Mahuta said.
