Associate Environment Minister Nanaia Mahuta today welcomed the Toi te Taiao: Bioethics Council report on pre-birth testing, entitled Who Gets Born?

 

“I am pleased to have formerly received the Bioethics Council report and I am aware that a lot of work has gone into engaging views from across the community on the issue of pre-birth testing,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

“It is evident there is a range of complex matters that must be considered.”

 

The Bioethics Council is an independent advisory committee which provides advice and recommendations to the government on the cultural, ethical and spiritual aspects of biotechnology.

 

Pre-birth testing includes blood tests, scans and amniocentesis, as well as more specialised tests, including those used to detect rare genetic conditions or illnesses.

 

Nanaia Mahuta said the recommendations in the report will now be considered at in full by a Ministerial Group.

 

“I want to acknowledge the work of the Bioethics Council, and especially those who took part in this report. I look forward to working through the recommendations with other Ministers,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

“While no timeframe has been set for a government response, I am keen to ensure the report and its recommendations contribute to the public debate on pre-birth testing and that it informs future policy and decision-making thinking.”
