Minister of Health David Cunliffe today confirmed there is no proposal for Hutt Valley DHB to use theatre space at Capital and Coast DHB.

 

“This proposal has always been and remains a proposal to redevelop Hutt Valley Hospital.”

 

Mr Cunliffe said he was aware of media reports concerning using surplus theatre capacity at Capital and Coast DHB however that did not mean it was being considered by him.

 

“The process for approving multi-million dollar redevelopments is robust to ensure that taxpayers money is spent wisely. As part of that process the Ministry of Health and central agencies routinely ask questions to ensure the final proposal has passed the most vigorous of tests.”

 

Mr Cunliffe said he wanted to reassure the people of the Hutt Valley that he was keeping their best interests in mind.

 

“As far as I am concerned this process is about improving services and infrastructure for the people of the Hutt Valley, in the Hutt Valley.”
