Education Minister and Minister Responsible for the Education Review Office Chris Carter will attend the APEC Education Ministers’ Meeting in Peru later this week where major changes to the New Zealand education system will be showcased.

The meeting is also a chance for New Zealand to share its work on the new New Zealand curriculum, launched earlier this year, and innovative work in the early childhood education sector.

Education Ministers from Australia, USA, Canada, Brunei, Korea, Mexico, Peru, Colombia, the Philippines and other Pacific Rim countries are expected to attend.

“The meeting’s themes have strong connections to recent and current New Zealand education priorities including the main theme of this conference, ‘21st Century Competencies’,” Chris Carter said.

“Other themes have special relevance for New Zealand including Language Learning, Information Communications Technology, Mathematics and Science and Career and Technical (Vocational) Education.

“The Career and Technical theme links strongly to New Zealand’s Schools Plus policy whereby the government is extending a wider range of pathways for students so they remain in engaged in learning or training until 18.”

Preceding the APEC meeting, the Minister will attend a seminar on 'The New Zealand Education Experience and its Relevance for Chile' in Santiago, where he will speak on the opportunities for educational co-operation and knowledge-sharing between New Zealand and Chile. The seminar will be jointly opened by Chris Carter and Chilean Education Minister Monica Jimenez.

On his way home, Chris Carter will return to Chile to explore opportunities for New Zealand engagement with Chile around English language training, agricultural training, Maori language education on Rapa Nui (Easter Island), and a proposed scholarship scheme.

“I will be giving the Chilean Education Minister Monica Jimenez a strong affirmation of New Zealand’s commitment to a growing bilateral relationship between our two countries,” Chris Carter said.
