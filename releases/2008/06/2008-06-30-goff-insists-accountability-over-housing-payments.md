Defence Minister Phil Goff says he expects full accountability from the Defence Force over payments made by it for housing allowances to officers seconded to the United Nations, in contravention of UN rules.

“UN rules require that officers in receipt of UN allowances not receive additional allowances from their home country,” Mr Goff said.

“It is totally inappropriate for rules set by the UN to be ignored by Defence Force officials. The Chief of Defence Force has undertaken to report to me as soon as possible on this and on what action will be taken against those responsible,” Mr Goff said.
