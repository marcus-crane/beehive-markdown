Sport and Recreation Minister Clayton Cosgrove announced today that funding support from the government agency Sport and Recreation New Zealand (SPARC) will continue for the New Zealand Area Schools Association tournament.

“I am pleased to report that SPARC and the Area Schools Association have found a solution to ensure future funding support for the Association’s annual sports tournaments,” Mr Cosgrove said.

The Area Schools Association runs an annual tournament for over 30 rural schools around the country and has previously relied on funding from SPARC’s ‘Sport Fit’ programme.  Funding from this programme is now being wholly devoted to supporting sport and recreation coordinators in over 400 secondary schools throughout New Zealand.

The Minister had raised concerns about the long-term funding of the Area Schools Association tournament and called for a report from SPARC.  “I am pleased to be able to reassure people that SPARC is going to meet its commitment to providing ongoing funding support for this tournament that is so crucial to country kids” said the Minister.

The Area Schools Association has appointed a working party to review the tournament and sports policy and SPARC looks forward to liaising with this group.

SPARC had alre**a**dy committed $12,500 as travel support for this year’s Area Schools Association tournament in Whangarei to be held from 6 to 10 July 2008.  The ongoing support is in line with SPARC’s mission to promote access to sport and recreation for all New Zealanders.

SPARC is the government agency charged with promoting, encouraging and supporting sport and physical recreation in New Zealand.
