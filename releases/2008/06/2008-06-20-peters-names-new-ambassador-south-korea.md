New Zealand’s next Ambassador to South Korea will be career diplomat Richard Mann, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced today.

 

Mr Mann will also be accredited to North Korea.

 

“New Zealand and South Korea have complimentary economies, while our involvement in the Korean War has led to close personal contacts between our two nations," Mr Peters said.

 

“Trade with South Korea is currently valued at $2.7 billion, and is expected to grow significantly if a proposed Free Trade Agreement goes ahead.

 

“Collaboration on film, and science and technology are just two areas which offer exciting opportunities for both countries.

 

"Mr Mann’s appointment to Pyongyang comes at a time when all members of the international community are looking to North Korea to end its nuclear aspirations in the interests of maintaining stability on the Korean Peninsula,” Mr Peters said.

 

Mr Mann is currently director of the Human Resources Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. He has previously been Ambassador to Chile, and had postings to Bangkok and Suva.

 

He will replace current ambassador Jane Coombs when he takes up his posting in January 2009.
