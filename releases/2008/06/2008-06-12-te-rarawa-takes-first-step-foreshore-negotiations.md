“Significant progress has been made on foreshore and seabed issues this year. Today’s signed Terms of Negotiation with Northern iwi Te Rarawa is the latest milestone to be achieved.” Minister for Maori Affairs, Parekura Horomia said today.

 “Reaching agreement on the Terms of Negotiation is an important step towards ensuring that the customary activities of Te Rarawa are acknowledged and protected, now and into the future”  

 The next step in the process is to identify the specific parts of the public foreshore and seabed in the Te Rarawa rohe where the hapu of Te Rarawa would have held territorial customary rights prior to the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004 and to develop an Agreement in Principle.

 “We made a commitment in 2004 to protect Māori ancestral associations and mana to the foreshore and seabed. These terms of negotiation are a step towards honouring that commitment.”

 “The Foreshore and Seabed Act is a vehicle Maori can use to ensure that their rights, tikanga and history regarding their continuous use of the foreshore and seabed in their rohe are legally protected. This protection will preserve iwi traditions for the many generations who are to follow”

 “This is a great achievement for both negotiating iwi and this Government. And I congratulate Te Rarawa in their achievements to date.”
