The government has been advised of the decision by the Board of the National Pacific Radio Trust (NPRT) to restructure its operations to meet its financial responsibilities, Broadcasting Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

"NPRT is being assisted by the advance of $300,000 of government funding from the coming financial year.  The Board continues to be accountable for funding and reports regularly on its performance," Trevor Mallard said.
