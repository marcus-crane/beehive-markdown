Sport and Recreation Minister Clayton Cosgrove announced today that adventurous kiwis planning to embark on a challenging outdoor expedition can apply for funding through the government’s Hillary Expedition programme.

The government agency Sport and Recreation New Zealand (SPARC) makes Hillary Expedition grants available every two years. This year, up to six groups of inspiring adventurers will be offered grants between $10,000 and $30,000.

“The Hillary Expedition programme is one way that SPARC is encouraging Kiwis to get active and explore the outdoors. These expeditions are always challenging for the adventurers and an inspiration for others wanting to get involved in the outdoors,” said Mr Cosgrove.

“The outdoors is an excellent environment for people to learn and grow, both mentally and physically,” said Mr Cosgrove. “In past years SPARC has received some great applications for various expeditions, including world first attempts.”

The  2006/2007 Hillary Expeditions included crossing the Greenland ice cap, scaling two peaks in Garhwal Himalaya of India, and making the first ascent of an unclimbed and unnamed tower in the Aisen Province, Chile.

To qualify for a grant, expeditions have to include any one or a combination of outdoor activities such as tramping, mountaineering, rock climbing, cross-country skiing, white water and/or sea kayaking, mountain biking, and sailing. 

Application criteria and application forms are available on the SPARC website at [www.sparc.org.nz](http://www.sparc.org.nz/). Applications close on Friday 26 September 2008 and successful applicants are expected to be announced in December 2008. 

SPARC is the government agency charged with promoting, encouraging and supporting sport and physical recreation in New Zealand.
