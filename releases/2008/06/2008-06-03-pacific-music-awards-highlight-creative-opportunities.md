Saturday night's S3 Pacific Music Awards showcased Pacific music and recognised the enormous achievements of our Pacific artists, Pacific Island Affairs Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.

"The Pacific Music Awards are always a highlight on my calendar, and the fourth annual awards were a fantastic opportunity to honour and celebrate the rich creative talents of our Pacific people.

“Music and arts are not only an illustration of Pacific culture and life, they are also a platform for the economic development of Pacific communities,” said Laban.

"We want our Pacific communities to be increasingly aware of the opportunities available in creative, emerging and growth industries, and the success of our Pacific musicians highlights one of the many ways our people can utilise their talents.

"Our Pacific musicians have had a major influence on NZ music and have helped New Zealand music achieve the enormous success it now enjoys.  Pacific music adds to the unique national identity and cultural flavour of New Zealand, it also contributes to our economy and that of our Pacific neighbours," Laban said.
