“Recycling is an easy way we can all contribute to sustainability,” Environment Associate Minister and Tainui MP Nanaia Mahuta said in Raglan today.

Nanaia Mahuta today visited Raglan to introduce 30 new recycling bins to spread throughout the town, as part of a nationwide government initiative to set up 600 bins in tourist spots and urban areas by 2010.

 

“The initiative will give the Raglan community and visitors the chance to recycle when they’re out and about, and fits in with the government’s aspiration for New Zealand to be the first truly sustainable nation,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

“Working with the council and community groups in Raglan to set up the bins is an obvious choice for the Government, given the attraction of this town to visitors from all over the country and overseas.” 

 

The launch is one of many community initiatives organised to celebrate World Environment Day, which is hosted by New Zealand in partnership with the United Nations Environment Programme.

 

Under the initiative, recycling bins have been installed in public places in Kaikoura, Wellington, Taupo and the Far North.  Bins in Christchurch, Wanaka and Arrowtown are coming soon.  All bins are branded with the Love NZ – Recycle with care brand. More than 200 bins will have been set up within the initiative’s first year.

 

“World Environment Day is a great opportunity for New Zealand to showcase the positive things we are doing nationally, regionally and internationally to promote sustainability and reduce the impacts of climate change,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

“Giving residents and visitors of Raglan the opportunity to recycle when they are away from home, is a good example of this.”
