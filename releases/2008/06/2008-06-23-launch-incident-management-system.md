The Minister of Health, David Cunliffe today launched the new National Incident Management System, a project which will make our hospitals even safer.

 

“This will be a systematic approach to the classification, prioritisation and management of healthcare incidents in New Zealand. “

 

” The Incident Management System will also mean that patients and their families, who do suffer harm as a result of errors in their treatment, will see a standardised approach to open disclosure,” said Mr Cunliffe.

 

“The success of this programme relies on it being fair and just. This will not be about blaming individuals but learning from our mistakes.”

 

“We already have enough mechanisms in the Health industry to hold people to account in the rare events where errors are the result of human negligence .This is about our commitment to a great transparency with the public about the performance of our Health Services.”

 

“This is the result of collaboration across the health sector between the DHBs, the Ministry of Health, ACC, the Office of the Health and Disability Commissioner and the private sector,” said Mr Cunliffe.

 

“While I am conscious of the contributions senior medical staff are making to the Time for Quality Agreement, I am also keen to see junior doctors, nurses and other health professionals contribute to this debate.”

 

In August 2007 the Ministry of Health approved $20 million for spending on the National Quality Improvement Programme and $1.15 million will be spent over the next two years on the management of healthcare incidents. This will be led by the Waikato District Health Board. At present 0.25 per cent of all DHB budgets are linked to performance on quality improvement.
