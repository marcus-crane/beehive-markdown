Hockey’s Selwyn Maister and rugby’s Richie Guy have received lifetime achievement awards from the government’s sport and recreation agency, SPARC, in recognition of their huge contributions to sport.

The pair are the inaugural recipients of the SPARC Sport and Recreation Sector Awards. They received their awards at a function following the opening day of the sport and recreation sector conference in Auckland last night (June 23).

Sport and Recreation Minister Clayton Cosgrove is delighted two such great servants of sport have been the first recipients of the award.

“Selwyn Maister and Richie Guy have been heroes on and off the field. They have given their life to sport and served the community brilliantly.

“They have shown a selfless commitment to the sport sector long after their playing careers finished. They are truly inspirational,” Mr Cosgove said.

SPARC Chief Executive Peter Miskimmin says the calibre of the recipients is truly exceptional.

“These are two outstanding individuals. Everything they’ve done on and off the field has benefitted their sports.

“Richie Guy and Selwyn Maister have given decades of service to the community and they continue to make important contributions to this day,” said Mr Miskimmin.

Selwyn Maister was a member of the gold-medal winning New Zealand hockey team at the 1976 Olympics. He represented New Zealand at four Olympics and has been a national selector, assistant Black Sticks coach and an administrator for over 30 years. He is a former CEO of the Canterbury West Coast Sports Trust and is on the board of the New Zealand Academy of Sport South Island. A life member of the Harewood hockey club in Christchurch, he is still involved in coaching, in charge of the under-eight ‘minis’.

Richie Guy played nine matches for the All Blacks as a prop and turned out for North Auckland 91 times before moving into administration. He joined the then New Zealand Rugby Union Council in 1984 and was manager of the All Blacks team that won the inaugural Rugby World Cup in 1987 and became NZRFU Chairman in 1995. He has also served as the chairman of Sport Northland and has been a dedicated member of the Waipu rugby club for most of his life. He played his final club game at the age of 60.

From 2009 the SPARC Sport and Recreation Sector Awards will recognize outstanding achievement and service in following categories: Lifetime Achievement Award, Awards for the best National Sport and Recreation Organisation, the best Regional Sports Trust, CEO, the best event, collaborative project and the best Innovation.
