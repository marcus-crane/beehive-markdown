The trial of the RMA INFO free helpline has been a success and the government will continue to fund this service, Environment Minister Trevor Mallard said today at Tauranga City Council.

RMA INFO (0800 762 4636) is a free phone line and email service which provides information about Resource Management Act (RMA) processes, with funding of around $24,000 per year.

The Resource Management Act is the main piece of legislation aimed at ensuring the sustainable management of New Zealand's environment and sustainable use and development of New Zealand's natural resources like land and water.

"It's great to see the RMA INFO line being accessed by all sorts of people and small businesses who want to work with the RMA effectively and successfully for their personal situations", Trevor Mallard said.

RMA INFO managed over 1300 queries since September 2006, while around 95,000 RMA Everyday Guide publications and 16,000 CD-ROMS have been requested since their launch in August 2006.

"We have also extended the popular 'Everyday Guide to the RMA' booklet series to include a guide on enforcement and increased the distribution of these tools. The box sets are on display at Councils, BizInfo outlets, Law Centres and also in many schools throughout New Zealand. The series also has a CD-Rom that talks people through the nuts and bolts of working with the RMA," Trevor Mallard said.

"This government believes New Zealand could be the first truly sustainable nation, and helping people understand the RMA to manage resources sustainably so they last for generations to come, is an important part of this.

"The new enforcement booklet provides information about what steps councils can take to ensure that people are complying with the RMA, a resource consent or district or regional plans. These steps include issuing excessive noise directions, water shortage directions, infringement notices, abatement notices, enforcement orders or prosecution."

“The CD Rom contains tip sheets, diagrams and 13 booklets covering various aspects of the RMA.

"We are making this targeted, easy to follow information available for people who use the RMA from time to time, but want straight forward, practical information to get them started."

Around 95,000 RMA Everyday Guide publications and 16,000 CD-ROMS have been requested since their launch in August 2006, and RMA INFO managed over 1300 queries since September 2006.

The booklets and CD-Rom can be ordered by emailing publication@mfe.govt.nz, or booklets can be downloaded from www.rma.govt.nz. The number for the RMA info line is 0800 762 4636.
