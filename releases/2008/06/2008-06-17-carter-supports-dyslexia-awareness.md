Education Minister Chris Carter has welcomed guests at a film premiere to mark the second annual Dyslexia Awareness Week with a commitment to improve accessibility to information about dyslexia.

Chris Carter addressed guests at a film premiere of Taare Zameen Par (Every Child is Special) and acknowledged the excellent work of the Dyslexia Foundation of New Zealand in bringing dyslexia to the attention of all New Zealanders.

“I fully support the Foundation in improving public understanding and awareness of dyslexia. It is vital that we have an education system that continues to meet the needs of students with learning difficulties, including those with dyslexia,” said Chris Carter.

The Ministry of Education has produced a new on-line resource called ‘Sounds and Words’ which complements the launch of the popular “Breaking Down the Barriers” brochure last December. 

In addition, the Ministry’s draft Literacy Learning Progressions document describes the skills and knowledge students need to master successful literacy.  The progressions specifically include the development of phonological awareness skills, which are often problematic for children with dyslexia. 

“Since the Ministry of Education acknowledged dyslexia last year and began working with the Foundation and others, there has been a building momentum within their literacy work programme. I look forward to seeing further progress in this area,” said Chris Carter.
