Communications and Information Technology Minister David Cunliffe today announced the release of a discussion paper on the operation of the Managed Spectrum Park (MSP) in the 2.5 GHz radio spectrum band.

 “The MSP is a new concept in New Zealand,” Mr Cunliffe said. “It is intended for local and regional broadband services, such as Wi-MAX, and seeks to encourage a flexible, cooperative, low cost and self-managed approach to allocation and use of radio spectrum.”

In December last year, six bidders acquired nation-wide management rights in the government’s auction of radio spectrum in the 2.3 GHz and 2.5 GHz bands and 25 MHz was reserved for Maori in the 2.3 GHz band.  At the same time, 45 MHz was set aside for a MSP for local services in the 2.5 GHz band.

The proposals are likely to be of interest to smaller industry players, local and regional councils and iwi groups. The intention is to have the new concept operating as early as possible in 2009.

“The MSP will make a valuable contribution to the government’s Digital Strategy, and in particular to the overall objective of making broadband services available to all New Zealanders,” Mr Cunliffe concluded.
