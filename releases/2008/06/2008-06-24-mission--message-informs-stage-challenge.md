“Stage Challenge’s a great opportunity for young people to show their talent and take part in a professionally run show.  It requires hard work, team effort and loads of energy, both behind the scenes and on stage but it’s worth it,” Youth Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

Nanaia Mahuta will this evening present the ‘Excellence for Environmental or Social Awareness’ award at the Mission-On Stage Challenge Hamilton event.

 

“Environmental and Social Awareness are important themes for this Labour government and it’s important to encourage young people to gain a stronger awareness of environmental and social issues so they in turn can generate effective responses to both the sustainability and social challenges,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

“The whole idea of ‘Mission On’ Stage Challenge is to encourage students to have fun, get active, entertain and educate the audience about themes which are important to young people, at the same time.  It’s a real team effort with teachers, parents and supporters all working together to prepare a performance,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

 

Each school is allocated eight minutes to present their show, which involves dance and drama, with a back stage support crew responsible for designing and building sets, costume design and fundraising.

 

Stage Challenge is an alcohol and drug free event for young people and reinforces the desire to help young people to make positive choices.

 

The Mission-On initiative was launched in 2006, to encourage children and young people to lead active and healthy lives.  This is the first year that Sport and Recreation New Zealand (SPARC), through the Mission-On government-led initiative, is the major sponsor of the popular event.

 

 

“The government is committed to young people and by supporting forward-thinking initiatives like Stage Challenge, we can make a difference in the lives of young New Zealanders.
