The abuse of older people in our society is completely unacceptable.

“The alleged abuse of an elderly rest home resident is abhorrent,” said Ruth Dyson Minister for Senior Citizens and Minister of Health David Cunliffe said.

“While I can’t comment on this incident as the police are now involved, such abuse is totally unacceptable.  As a community we need to change social attitudes by raising community awareness about the abuse and neglect of older people.  It saddens me that such an incident can occur, but the abuse of older people is often a hidden problem,” said Ruth Dyson.

Minister of Health David Cunliffe said he had sought urgent information on the alleged case.

“I would expect if any rest-home or care-provider was found to have allowed any form of abuse to have occurred then steps would be swiftly taken to ensure the safety of some of our most vulnerable citizens is protected and action taken against any perpetrator,” Mr Cunliffe said.

“If the facts of this case are verified as they appear I would expect the MOH to urgent action against the rest-home concerned,” Mr Cunliffe said

"The Government has worked on a range of initiatives to stop the abuse of older people and has taken significant steps to promote positive ageing. To achieve this, the government funds prevention services in 24 communities,” said Ruth Dyson.
