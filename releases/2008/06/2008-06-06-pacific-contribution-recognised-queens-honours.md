It is fantastic to see the achievements and contribution of Pacific people recognised in this year’s Queen’s Birthday Honours list, said Pacific Island Affairs Minister Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

"Our honours system is a way for New Zealand to say thanks and well done to those who have served and those who have achieved.

"I am extremely grateful for the service that the seven recipients have provided not only to our Pacific community, but also to women, sport, education, research, and the arts.

"They are all strong role models and epitomise the aims of the Pacific Economic Action Plan and the Pacific Women's Economic Development Plan, as their leadership is an inspiration for our young Pacific people", Laban said.
