New Zealand Fast Forward will be governed by two new crown companies, Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton said today.

He said both would be small organisations with specific tasks, and members with specialist skills.

One – New Zealand Fast Forward Fund Ltd – would be a three-member board responsible for the stewardship of the $700 million Government contribution over the 15-year life of the fund.

“The expectation is that this will be invested conservatively, in products such as Government securities, for example.”

He said the other, New Zealand Fast Forward Ltd, would have a board of up to seven people, with a chief executive and small secretariat, to fund innovation programmes across the whole value chain from farm to fork.

“This company will approve and monitor the industry-government projects that will drive innovation within the food and pastoral agriculture sectors.”

Jim Anderton said that already, there has been strong support from pastoral and food industry groups, with indicative commitments of around $70 million a year so far.

“This is a sign that industry recognises the benefit of the New Zealand Fast Forward initiative. This is the single largest boost to innovation in our nation’s history. It means that we as a nation will be able to enhance our living standards as we develop and market new products and better technology.”

The two boards are expected to be set up within a month, when appointments of chairs and directors are made.
