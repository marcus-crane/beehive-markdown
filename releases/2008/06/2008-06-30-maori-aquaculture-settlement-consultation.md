Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton is calling for submissions on a Plan that assesses the Crown’s progress on its obligations to iwi under the Maori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act 2004.

The plan will provide a road map on how the Crown intends to meet its outstanding obligations by 2014.

Jim Anderton said the development of this plan marked an important stage in the implementation of the aquaculture settlement.

“It canvasses a range of issues including the potential to amend the existing settlement legislation to better deliver the settlement assets to iwi.

 “I’m committed to moving toward our goal of full and final settlement and I’m seeking the views of iwi, Te Ohu Kaimoana Trustee Limited, and others on this plan.”

Under this settlement the Crown has two obligations:

·        The new space obligation requires iwi are provided with 20% of all new aquaculture space created after 1 January 2005; and

·        The pre-commencement space obligation requires the Crown to provide iwi with the equivalent of 20% of existing aquaculture space created between 21 September 1992 and 31 December 2004.

Jim Anderton said the plan outlined how the Crown intended to use the legislated settlement methods to provide settlement assets to iwi and fulfil its settlement obligations. These include how the Crown might purchase marine farms and how the financial equivalent may be determined.

The Plan will be released for consultation to iwi organisations and Te Ohu Kaimoana Trustee Limited, as well as regional councils and members of the aquaculture industry.

“I look forward to working with iwi to develop the Plan and advance this settlement,” he said.

Submissions close Friday 31 October 2008.
