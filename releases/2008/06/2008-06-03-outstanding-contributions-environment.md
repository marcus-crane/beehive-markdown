This year’s Green Ribbon Awards honour outstanding contributions to the environment, and tonight’s award ceremony marks the beginning of events celebrating New Zealand’s hosting of World Environment Day, said Prime Minister Helen Clark and Environment Minister Trevor Mallard.

The awards recognise the outstanding contributions of individuals, community organisations, businesses, and local government to sustaining and enhancing New Zealand’s unique environment.

"Tonight’s ceremony doubles as the opening event for New Zealand’s hosting of World Environment Day on Thursday 5 June. During the week, communities throughout our country will showcase what they are doing to protect our environment, raise awareness of environmental issues and make a difference to our overall wellbeing. There are lots of events for the public to get involved in," Helen Clark said.

"Our congratulations go to this year’s [Green Ribbon Award](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/withyou/awards/green-ribbon.html "More info on the awards") winners, who through their actions show just how innovative, resourceful, and dedicated people can make a difference for the better. I can think of no better way to kick off World Environment Day celebrations than to honour some of our most committed carers for the environment," Helen Clark and Trevor Mallard said.

The Green Ribbon Award categories this year have been expanded from six to nine to reflect the many different areas in which New Zealanders make contributions to a better environment. The winners of each category are:

- Environment in the spotlight: Horizons Regional Council Green Rig Environmental Educators, Palmerston North

"Everyone has a part to play in caring for the environment, and these winners have set great examples of what can be achieved. With dedication and sheer hard work, they are championing environmental issues in their homes, schools, communities and businesses," Trevor Mallard said.
