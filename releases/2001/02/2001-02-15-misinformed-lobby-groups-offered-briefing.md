Education Minister Trevor Mallard says he will be writing to the Employers and Manufacturers Association (Northern) to offer them a briefing on the NCEA.

"The organisation is misinformed on much of the detail of the new qualifications system," Trevor Mallard said.

"While the Employers Federation is represented on the sector group which is developing much of the work, this particular group is not.

"Mr Thompson is therefore not up to date with much of the work that has been going on to ensure that the needs of employers are integrated into the new system at all levels.

"If he is genuinely interested in the needs of employers, rather than the needs of the National Party, his concerns expressed today could be allayed with a comprehensive briefing on the new system.

"I am happy to make officials available for such a briefing.

"But I would urge employers not to be misled National Party propaganda. A chart that I tabled in Parliament yesterday, clearly shows that the system that will be introduced to schools next year is fundamentally the one developed by National Ministers of Education. It is obvious that all changes made will result in standards being clarified and improved," Trevor Mallard said.
