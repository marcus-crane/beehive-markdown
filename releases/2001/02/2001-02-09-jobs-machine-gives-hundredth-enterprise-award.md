Jobs machine gives 100th Enterprise Award

"Over 100 kiwi businesses and entrepreneurs are better off because of the Labour Alliance Coalition Government's jobs machine," said Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton announcing the 100th Enterprise Award recipient today.

Jim Anderton inspected the 'Jiggernaut' developed by Christchurch entrepreneur Derek McCullough which was on display at the Christchurch Convention Centre during the Government Business Forum. Kirsteen Britten and Wayne Alexander of Britten Prototypes (founded by the late John Britten) who designed the 'Jiggernaut' were also in attendance.

The Jiggernaut uses train or tram tracks for racing or leisure jiggers and Derek McCullough has received $10,000 to develop the potential of these 'new age' machines.

"I am also pleased to announce a further 39 Enterprise Award winners. Clearly there is a wealth of kiwi ingenuity out there that can create jobs and build our economy and this Labour Alliance Coalition Government is recognising this," said Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton.

Other award winners include investigating making dog food from possums, a telescope manufacturer, a swim school franchise, and the development of an international documentary series.

In total, Industry New Zealand, the Government's jobs machine, has made Enterprise Awards Scheme grants to 111 businesses and entrepreneurs, totalling $627,074, to help get their great ideas up and running. More will be announced each month.

"The Enterprise Award Scheme is gaining huge interest - each month the number of applications and the number of awards both increase," said Jim Anderton.

Entrepreneurs or small business owners can receive a maximum of $20,000, which can be used to fund up to 50 percent of the total cost of a project.  
"I have visited several successful companies and I have been told repeatedly how much the award means to them. It's not just the money, either - it's recognition and support for their idea. And it's the expert advice from the business specialists at Industry NZ that is proving so valuable," said Jim Anderton.
