The Minister in Charge of Treaty Negotiations Margaret Wilson says Sir Robert Mahuta will be remembered both for his major achievements on behalf of the Tainui people and his enduring contribution to the Crown-Maori relationship itself.

"Everyone with an understanding of the relationship between Maori and the Crown will not only mourn Sir Robert as a person, but deeply regret his absence from debates to come.

"His leadership in the treaty negotiations process and his other achievements have assured Sir Robert's place in history, which will recognise the true extent of his vision for the advancement of his people.

"In expressing my sadness at the passing of this great New Zealander, I offer my condolences to his family and all who were close to him".
