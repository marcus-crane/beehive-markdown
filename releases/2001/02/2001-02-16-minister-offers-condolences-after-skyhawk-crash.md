Defence Minister Mark Burton has extended his sympathy and deepest condolences to the family of Squadron Leader Murray Neilson, who was killed today while piloting a A4-K Skyhawk in Australia.

"I am deeply saddened by the tragic death of Squadron Leader Neilson and my thoughts at this terrible time are with his family.

"Squadron Leader Neilson's death will have a profound impact on his family, his friends and the members of No. 2 Squadron and indeed all of the Defence Force.

"There will be of course a full investigation into the accident. But our first priority is to ensure all possible support is available to Squadron Leader Neilson's family.

"I know that the Government and all New Zealanders will join me in conveying our deepest sympathy to family, friends and colleagues", Mark Burton said.
