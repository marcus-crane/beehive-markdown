Bill English’s excitement at naming the mediocre David Carter as his new finance spokesperson must be the reason that he forgot to name a new education spokesperson.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard said he has noted with interest Mr McCully’s foray into the issue of equity funding for schools and the silence of the party’s official spokesperson Nick Smith.

“I can only conclude that Bill forgot to talk about Murray and is saving that announcement for next week,” Trevor Mallard said.

“But like other issues that Murray McCully gets involved in, this latest education idea is based around bashing the underprivileged.

“He talks about ‘poor schools’ having to prove that they have used money properly.

“What he fails to mention is that all schools receive a considerable amount of taxpayer funding and they are accountable for that funding through both annual reports and through reviews by the Education Review Office.

“Decile-related funding only amounts to about 4% of total funds spent on schools and about 90% of all schools receive varying degrees of that funding.

“Mr McCully should explain if it is those 90% of schools he thinks should have to provide more ‘proof’ of proper use of funds. If that’s not the case, where is he going to draw the line?

“I look forward to challenging National MPs in the House on their complete lack of action in the education area. Like Gerry Brownlee’s plan to give all children over ten a laptop computer, this latest policy announcement is ill thought out,” Trevor Mallard said.
