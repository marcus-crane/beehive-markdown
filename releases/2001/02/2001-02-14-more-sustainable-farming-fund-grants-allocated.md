Three more grants from the Sustainable Farming Fund have been made, Agriculture and Rural Affairs Minister Jim Sutton said today.  
The new grants are to:

\* Blackcurrants NZ Ltd, for a project on soil quality management for  
berryfruit growers;  
\* Regional Summergreen Grower Discussion Groups, for expert support for  
summerfruit community grower groups; and  
\* The NZ Avocado Growers Association, for a project implementing orchard  
best management practices for the avocados.

This brings the number of grants from the first round of the fund to 22 sofar.  
Applications are now open for the second round of the Sustainable Farming  
Fund. The closing date for applications is 15 March 2001. Mr Sutton said funding in this round was for projects that were ready to go from July this year.

"There is no lower limit. Smaller projects with costs under $10,000 are now  
included. Also, water management issues previously funded from other  
sources will now be eligible for Sustainable Farming Fund grants."
