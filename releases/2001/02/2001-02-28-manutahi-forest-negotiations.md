Hon Parekura Horomia  
Minister of Maori Affairs  
Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia and State Owned Enterprises Minister Mark Burton have agreed to revisit the matter of the sale of Manutahi Forest to ensure appropriate consultation occurs between the Gisborne District Council, the Crown and Ngati Porou.

Mr Horomia met today with officials from Mark Burton's office, the chief executive of Crown Forestry Management Ltd, the chief executive of Te Puni Kokiri and the chairperson of Te Runanga o Ngati Porou, Apirana Mahuika, to clarify the sale process.

Mark Burton said Crown-owned agencies are required to follow established processes for the disposal of surplus assets.

“Government set up processes to protect the rights of previous owners and Maori interests. As part of the process, notification of the intention to sell the property is placed in the Sunday newspapers and sent directly to local iwi. At that point anyone with an interest in the property can make a submission to the Protection Mechanism Co-ordinator at the Office of Treaty Settlements .”

Mark Burton has asked the chief executive of Crown Forestry Management to provide as much assistance as possible to the Minister of Maori Affairs to allow fair decisions to be made.

Mr Horomia, who is also the MP for Ikaroa Rawhiti, has spoken with the Mayor of Gisborne John Clark and indicated he is happy to facilitate a meeting between the Council, the Runanga and Crown Forestry Management Ltd to achieve the greatest benefit from the consultation phase.

"I am confident that discussions, set down for next week, will help to generate a mutually beneficial result for all."
