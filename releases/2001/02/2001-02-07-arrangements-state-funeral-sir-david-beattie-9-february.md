Prime Minister Helen Clark has announced details of the state funeral for Sir David Beattie on Friday 9 February.

The funeral service will be held at the Wellington Cathedral of St Paul, on Molesworth Street, at 1 pm.

The funeral procession, with full military honours, will leave the steps of Parliament House at about 12.50 pm. It will pass through the Molesworth Street exit to stop at the Hill Street entrance to the cathedral, where a karanga will be given as the casket is borne into the cathedral.

The gun carriage bearing the casket will be flanked by a tri-service bearer party, and preceded by the Defence Force band.

Sir David's funeral service will be conducted by the Dean of Wellington, the Very Reverend Michael Brown. Each of Sir David's children will make tributes together with readings by two grandchildren. Tributes will also be given by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. A blend of choral, organ and chamber music will feature.

At the conclusion of the cathedral service the funeral cortege, escorted by a 100-man guard from the three armed services, will travel through central Wellington (via Molesworth Street, Lambton Quay, Panama Street, Customhouse Quay, Willis Street) to the Lychgate Funeral Home for a private service.

A 21-gun salute will be fired from Pt Jerningham at one-minute intervals when the cortege leaves Wellington Cathedral.

Floral tributes may be left at Wellington Cathedral.

A condolence book is now available for signing in the foyer of Parliament House.
