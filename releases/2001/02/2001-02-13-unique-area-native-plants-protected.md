The Minister of Conservation, Hon Sandra Lee, today announced that 26-hectares of Central Otago land containing one of the highest concentrations of rare plants in New Zealand has been purchased by the Nature Heritage Fund.

"This distinct ecosystem at Pisa Flats of semi-arid terrace gravels and saline soils contains a special range of tiny plants including some that are rare and that have only ever been found at this site," Ms Lee said.

"Most similar gravel terrace areas in the region have been either cultivated or flooded by Lake Dunstan, so it is gratifying to be able to add this area to our conservation heritage with the help of other organisations," she said.

Assistance in purchasing the property came from the Miss E.L.Hellaby Indigenous Grasslands Research Trust and the Dr Marjorie Barclay Trust administered by the Dunedin branch of the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society.

"I particularly appreciate the financial contributions from the Indigenous Grasslands Trust and the Dr Marjorie Barclay Trust," Ms Lee said. "They have shown tremendous generosity in backing this sort of acquisition financially and it shows the public that they rate the area very highly."

Ms Lee said there are a number of rare plants found at the Pisa Flats site and DOC was fortunate to have this opportunity to protect them.

"Many people driving past might think it is a dry barren piece of land but it actually includes a magnitude of tiny, unique, little known plants," the Conservation Minister said.

"It is this type of area we are identifying, protecting and telling people about through the Labour-Alliance coalition's New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy."
