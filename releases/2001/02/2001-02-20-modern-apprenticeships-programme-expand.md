Apprenticeships is to expand into industries as diverse as aeronautical engineering, outdoor recreation, and sports turf management this year, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey announced today.

The second phase of Modern Apprenticeships nationwide roll-out begins in June 2001 and Skill New Zealand is now seeking Modern Apprenticeships Co-ordinators to work with employers and apprentices in the new industries the scheme is to expand into.

"Modern Apprenticeships is working for young people and the nation's employers.

"Less than a year after the Government first announced the Modern Apprenticeships concept, we already have 500 Modern Apprentices in industry training, and we're extending coverage across a good proportion of New Zealand's industries.

"The second stage of the national roll out brings the programme into the agriculture, forestry and fisheries; community and social services; food and related products processing; and service industries and expands coverage within the building and construction, and engineering industries.

"Skill New Zealand is now inviting proposals from organisations ready to become Modern Apprenticeships Co-ordinators. These Co-ordinators work with employers, apprentices, ITOs and education providers to make taking on an apprentice easy for employers. They also provide mentoring to help young people complete their qualification.

"The support and expertise provided by Modern Apprenticeships Co-ordinators throughout the country mean it's never been easier for employers to take on and train apprentices," says Steve Maharey.
