The Hon Parekura Horomia is delighted to be at Waitangi tomorrow (Waitangi Day) to participate in discussion about a 40-year development plan for Maori people.

He said he and his colleague Tariana Turia will be amongst other Maori leaders who are keen to hear the presentation headed by Sir Graham Latimer and Sir John Turei.

Mr Horomia said the Treaty of Waitangi is the founding document of New Zealand and Maori, as tangata whenua, have a special status that is recognised in the articles of the treaty. I want to pay my respects to the people of Nga Puhi and their special role with the Treaty."

"Waitangi has always been an important forum for the debate and discussion of Maori issues. Over the last few years there has been an increasing focus on the dissension and protest at Waitangi, and less focus on the other dynamic and positive initiatives that have also taken place. I'm delighted to be there with other Maori leaders to develop a 40-year plan for Maoridom."

Mr Horomia said he still supports Waitangi day celebrations being held throughout New Zealand.

"People learn through participation and if more people develop and design their own local celebrations then you will get more participation and quicker understanding of what Maori issues are."

"The celebrations around the country also remind us that that the treaty was taken around the country for signing over many weeks."
