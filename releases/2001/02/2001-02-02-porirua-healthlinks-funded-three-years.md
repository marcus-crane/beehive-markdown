Health Minister Annette King today announced that Porirua Healthlinks is to receive a further three years' funding.

"This indicates the Government's commitment to working with local people to improve health. The Ministry of Health will continue to work with Healthlinks and local providers on initiatives to improve services and outcomes," Annette King said.

Annette King's decision to continue the funding for a further three years was based on information and recommendations in Porirua City Health and Disability Report and Plan 2000 about health and disability needs of Porirua people and their priorities for improvements.

Porirua Healthlinks Committee co-chair Maureen Gillon welcomed the news and said the funding would allow Porirua Healthlinks to ensure the community could continue to work with local providers and the Capital and Coast District Health Board.

"This means that we can employ a local project manager and support other Healthlinks in providing leadership to realise better health for people in Porirua," Ms Gillon said.

The Porirua City Health and Disability Report and Plan 2000 also recommended better access to primary care services for people living in the eastern and western suburbs of Porirua, an information service so that people and practitioners could find out about services available, counselling services,  
a greater range of services from Maori and Pacific providers, and better access to specialist outpatient and inpatient services at Kenepuru Hospital, including 24-hour hospital accident & emergency services. Further work is currently under way on these recommendations.
