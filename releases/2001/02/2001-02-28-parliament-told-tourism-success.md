The Minister of Tourism Mark Burton today told members of parliament that Tourism was making a crucial contribution to the economy.

Mark Burton highlighted the findings of Tourism New Zealand's latest International Visitor Survey during Question Time.

"They show that the record 1.8 million international visitors who came to New Zealand last year spent a record $4.7 billion dollars," he told the House.

"That's an 11 percent increase in numbers and a 22 percent increase in expenditure.

"The New Zealand economy benefited last year by an additional $873 million.

"There are many individual highlights contained in the survey," Mark Burton said.

"Spending by German visitors is up by over 50 percent.

"Visitors from the United States contributed $756 million to our economy last year, a 49 percent increase.

"Australia continues to be our largest market, with visitor spend up by 9 percent to $857 million.

"Japanese visitors still lead the individual spending stakes, averaging nearly $5000 per visit.

"And of course the recent air deal reached between New Zealand and Japan is set to boost visitor numbers by 30,000 a year – that adds up to an extra $150 million.

"There has also been spectacular improvement in other Asian markets, with South Korea, Thailand and China all posting strong growth in both visitor numbers and expenditure.

"Total visitor spend from South Korea is up by a staggering 72 percent."

Mark Burton told the House that the government is working in partnership with the industry to ensure the sustainability of this tourism growth

"This Government came into office determined to implement a tourism strategy, building on the work already done on behalf of the industry by the Tourism Industry Association.

"I am now due to receive a draft of this strategy in a months time.

"The overall strategy will be focused on the sustainable development of the tourism industry – not just economically but environmentally, culturally and socially," Mark Burton said.
