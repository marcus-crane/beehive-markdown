"I am aware of the issues involved with local authority Chief Executives’ fixed-term contracts, including the requirements for advertising such positions.

"In March 2000, I sponsored a Bill in Parliament that validated the reappointment of Chief Executives and the actions of those Chief Executives for the period ending 8 September 1999.

"The Local Government (Validation of Reappointments) Act 2000 received the Royal Assent on 21 March 2000, and came into force on that date.

"You may be aware that a major review of the Local Government Act 1974 is currently in progress. The issue of Chief Executives’ fixed term contracts is being examined as part of that review, and my officials are currently working on policy options for my consideration. I anticipate that a Bill encompassing the results of that review will be introduced into Parliament at the end of this year."
