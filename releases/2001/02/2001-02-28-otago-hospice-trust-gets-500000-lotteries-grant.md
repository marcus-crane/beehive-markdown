The Lottery Grants Board has given $500,000 to the Otago Community Hospice Trust for a new 12-bed hospice facility in Dunedin.

Minister of internal Affairs and Lotteries Grants Board chairperson Hon George Hawkins announced the grant today.

The $500,000 grant will help the hospice provide extended services to its clients in a purpose-built facility.

"The layout of rooms in the current hospice building, which is the only one in Dunedin, is no longer suitable for the personal needs of patients," George Hawkins said.

"The current facility has only two single rooms. The grant will allow two further rooms to be built with three beds in each.

"The new building with its additional beds will meet current and future needs of patients and their families while still retaining a home style environment, George Hawkins said.
