Deputy Alliance leader Sandra Lee has marked the 50th anniversary of the start of the 1951 Lockout today (Thursday) with a call for the business community to support "local people for local jobs" when all other hiring factors balance out.

Ms Lee said that in the half century since the Lockout, the jobs of many New Zealanders, not just those on the waterfront, had come under increasing threat from cheap labour sourced from beyond local communities.

She said increasing casualisation of the workforce in some sectors had also undermined worker confidence in job security.

"Businesses operating in this country must have and be seen to have a genuine stake in local communities or suffer the consequences of a consumer backlash against globalisation," Ms Lee said.

"The Alliance pressed for the setting up of the government's jobs machine, Industry New Zealand, to help provide companies with that genuine stake," she said.

"We also support overseas investment when it's in our national interest, for example by creating jobs, introducing new technology or boosting our exports without negative consequences.

"But the Alliance will also never hesitate to stand beside New Zealanders defending their jobs against increased casualisation or the displacement of local workers by cheap imported labour," Ms Lee said.

"I am aware that some are drawing parallels between the 1951 dispute and the current Carter Holt Harvey waterside dispute," she said.

"The Labour-Alliance government has encouraged all parties to the current dispute to talk through their concerns, and a mediator has been provided to assist.

Ms Lee said the Employment Contracts Act set the scene for contracting out and competitive undercutting in North Island ports.

She said the Employment Relations Act would over time provide workers with the tools to rebuild in those ports.

In the meantime, she said, it provided a strong focus on good faith and mediation to assist the resolution of the Carter Holt Harvey waterside dispute.

Ms Lee is the daughter of a watersider locked out in the 1951 dispute.

She will be on one of the panels of "Lockout '51, 50 Years On", a two day seminar held during 16-17 February at the Wellington Town Hall, organised by the Trade Union History Project.
