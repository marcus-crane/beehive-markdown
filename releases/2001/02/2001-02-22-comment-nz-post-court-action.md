I am aware that New Zealand Post has taken court action to stop ACT leader, Richard Prebble, from publicly airing information from a leaked copy of its business plan for a banking arm.

This action does not require Ministerial involvement or consent, and there was no discussion with any Minister before this action was taken.

Under the State Owned Enterprises Act 1986, Boards have the commercial responsibility to protect the interest of shareholders.

There is no question of Parliament's, and Parliamentarians' rights, and indeed their proper duty, to scrutinise the activities of SOEs.

However, there is an attendant responsibility on all Members of Parliament not to act in a reckless manner and put at risk the assets of the people that we all represent in this Parliament.
