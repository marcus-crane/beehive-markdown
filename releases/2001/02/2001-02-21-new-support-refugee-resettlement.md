Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel today confirmed the allocation of more than $560,000 into refugee resettlement support. The Minister detailed the funding allocations at the first meeting of the Refugee Sub-Group (of the Ministerial Advisory Group) in Wellington today.

The Refugee Sub-Group, and the Ministerial Advisory Group, which also met for the first time today, were set up to provide a sounding board for specific aspects of Government immigration policy.

"The meeting today covered a number of issues seeking better resettlement outcomes for refugees in New Zealand. As an example, we discussed ways to more effectively connect well-qualified refugees to our labour market," Lianne Dalziel.

"Although it is often referred to as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) quota, it is in fact the UNHCR's resettlement programme. Unless we are committed to good resettlement outcomes then we fail our international obligations.

"Establishing the Refugee Sub-Group and allocating funding for resettlement support services are positive steps towards the outcomes we are seeking. Ensuring that refugees have adequate support services available to them is essential if we are to help people resettle successfully in our communities.

"The resettlement funding, up to June 2002, will focus on two important areas - supporting groups working with asylum seekers and orientation courses for families of refugees."

"A total $335,000 has been set aside to pilot initiatives for groups working with asylum seekers, including a $279,758 grant to the Auckland Refugee Council to provide emergency accommodation. We have also allocated funding to the Shakti Asian Women's Safe House, the Auckland Latin American Community in Auckland, and the Refugee and Migrant Centre.

"The second part of funding, totalling $229,000, will fund orientation courses for families of refugees. This includes funding for the services in West Auckland, Christchurch, Wellington and Hamilton. These courses range from English language, to housing and community orientation," Lianne Dalziel said.

"UNHCR refugees receive a six week orientation course at the Mangere Reception Centre. This is the first time ever that families of refugees are to have access to orientation programmes and they will be delivered in the places where they will be living."
