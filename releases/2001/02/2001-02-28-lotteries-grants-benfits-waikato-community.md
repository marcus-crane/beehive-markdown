Waikato's double-header stadium project has attracted $2 million in Lottery grants, Minister of Internal Affairs and Lottery Grants Board chairperson George Hawkins announced today.

In the past the Grants Board has given substantial financial help to build stadiums in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.

The Stadium Project involves the redevelopment of Hamilton's existing Rugby and WestpacTrust Parks.

"It is great to see this kind of support going to what is essentially rural New Zealand," George Hawkins said.

"This Waikato project is exciting, dynamic and different.

"Instead of the one venue, the Waikato region will end up with a purpose-built football and events stadium as well as a facility for cricket and other events. This complex will be suitable for one day internationals and also night tests," George Hawkins said.

The double-header stadium solves the problem of overlapping sporting seasons. It also reaps the financial benefits of getting two venues for almost half the price of a $50 million super stadium.
