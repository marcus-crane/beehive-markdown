What will the bank be called?  
Decisions about the bank's name will be taken by the independent Board of the new bank, which has not yet been appointed. It will launch its brand at the time that is most advantageous for it from a marketing point of view.

How much is the Government putting in?  
The Government will contribute $78.2 million towards start-up costs: A capital injection of $72.2 million and up to $6 million in foregone NZ Post dividends in the current financial year.

The sum will provide the new bank with a strong balance sheet and should ensure New Zealand Post maintains its excellent AA rating with Standard and Poors.

Is this a subsidy? Why should the taxpayer foot the bill for banking?  
The sum is not a subsidy. It is a capital injection and the Government expects to receive a commercial rate of return on it.

The Government has received $468 million in dividends from New Zealand Post since it was established as an SOE in 1987 from net profits of $548 million. NZ Post is suffering from increased competition on its mail business, and its successful international operations will expand faster if it can offer banking services as well as its expertise in managing postal operations.

This injection will help the company to enhance its future dividends. With the asset value of the bank likely to rise to as much as $500 million over the next ten years, the Government will achieve a very strong return for its capital contribution.

In other words, if the Government did not make this investment, it would be effectively 'spending' the money by diminishing the asset value of NZ Post.

The Government examined a number of scenarios for raising the necessary funds, including a public float of redeemable preference shares and partnership with outside agencies. All of these suggestions were rejected on the grounds that a cash injection to New Zealand Post would provide the best means to protect and enhance the company's asset value for the Government, and ultimately the taxpayer.

How much will the bank lose before it becomes profitable?  
The bank will make profits after three years and will have repaid the Government's cash contribution within seven years. It is forecast to have an asset value of $500 million within ten years.

How much cheaper will it be than existing services?  
Precise fees will be determined by the board of the new bank. The business case is built around a fee structure that is up to 28% lower on average than fees charged by existing banks.

How can the bank be cheaper than existing banks and still make a profit?  
The bank will use New Zealand Post's existing branch network. It therefore has to cover only the marginal costs of offering banking services. It doesn't have to recover the fixed costs of its entire parent network.

The new bank will also purchase advanced technology that has only become available in the last few years. Existing banks are encumbered with expensive technology that is very difficult to transfer to the new generation software.

In addition, the overseas-owned banks reaped operating profits of $1400 million from New Zealand Post last year. The Australian banks comprise the most profitable blue chip sector on the Australian stock exchange, with an average rate of return on shareholders assets of around 18%. New Zealand Post is one of New Zealand's most successful companies with a target return on capital of 11.7% It can therefore undercut the profit margins of the Australian banks and still make a very healthy return.

Who do you expect will bank with this bank? Is it a poor people's bank?  
This is a New Zealand bank, and all personal banking will be welcome. New Zealanders of many income levels and backgrounds are fed up with being gouged for bank fees, and with the loss of services from their local communities. Many New Zealanders will want to bank with the new bank simply because it provides more convenience, the service standards synonymous with New Zealand Post, and because it returns its profits to New Zealanders.

How many people will it employ?  
The bank will employ around more than a hundred new staff. Many agencies of New Zealand Post already make extensive use of part time staff to cover peak times, and it is expected that some of these jobs will expand while others are added.

New Zealand Post enjoys a good relationship with the NZEPMU, and it expects to discuss further staffing issues with the union.

What security measures are being put in place?  
The bank will employ bank level security. This will mean extensive upgrades for many Post branches. Highly experienced bank security experts have been engaged to supervise the process. There have been so many branch closures in recent years that very high quality used security equipment is available in many places and this will help to control the costs of the security upgrade.

What services will it offer and where will the branches be?  
· Will it offer mortgages, ATMs, cheques, overdrafts, credit cards, business accounts, automatic payments and direct credits, Internet and phone banking?  
The bank will offer full personal banking services. The full product range will be finalised by the board and announced at the most strategic time for the bank's marketing purposes. Some products will become available after the bank first opens for business.

It is not envisaged that the bank will offer corporate banking services, such as loans to companies.

The business case envisages a full range of services, including mortgages, cheques, ATM and EFT-POS, credit cards, internet and phone banking.

The Government was particularly impressed by the business case intention to offer junior saver accounts to help get young New Zealanders back into the habit of saving a small amount of their own.

The business case envisages up to 300 branches will open to begin with. New Zealand Post intends to work with local communities in areas that don't have banks or a Post Shop to try to establish banking services in their localities.

Why won't you release the business case?  
The business case is a very sensitive document. It sets out all of New Zealand Post's proposed competitive strategy. The overseas banks would love to get their hands on it. Even Mrs Shipley has finally conceded that the document should not be made public and she has shredded the copy she was leaking from.

Will the bank be politically controlled?  
No. The bank will have an independent board and be supervised by the Reserve Bank, just like any other registered bank.

What is to stop the bank being sold overseas?  
The bank will be a fully-owned subsidiary of New Zealand Post. While NZ Post remains in public ownership, the bank will be fully publicly-owned by the people of New Zealand. Only voters can stop NZ Post from being sold, by refusing to elect a Government that will sell it.

Will the public be able to buy shares in the bank?  
No.

Why aren't TSB/SBS/credit unions involved?  
TSB and SBS both rejected approaches to become involved with the bank under a structure that would have protected their ownership. The bank has been structured in the way that best protects the interests of the Government and New Zealand Post.
