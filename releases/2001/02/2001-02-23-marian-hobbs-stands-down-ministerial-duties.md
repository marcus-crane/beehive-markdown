This week I received a letter from the Registrar of Electors seeking further information with regard to inquires she is making into my enrolment status.

It is clear to me that these inquiries are now going to continue for some time. In these circumstances I believe it is appropriate to offer the Prime Minister my resignation from ministerial duties.

I am confident that when the inquiries are complete I will be shown to have done nothing wrong.

I will be making no further comment on this issue
