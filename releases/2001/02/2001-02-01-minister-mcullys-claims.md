The Minister of Broadcasting, Marian Hobbs, says the costs of implementing the TVNZ Charter are still under investigation and peer review and are also part of the Budget discussions.

She said claims made by Opposition MP Murray McCully were ludicrous.

She said a range of scenarios looking at possible costs of implementing the Charter have been prepared but these will not be made public as they contain commercially sensitive information.

Marian Hobbs said the Charter will be implemented by TVNZ gradually to maintain audience and spread costs.
