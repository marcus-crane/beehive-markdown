The Minister of Conservation, Hon Sandra Lee, has expressed condolences to the whanau of her chief adviser on Maori conservation issues, Agnes McGhee, who died on Monday in Gisborne at the age of 39.

"From the time she joined my Beehive staff in August last year, Agnes applied her excellent leadership qualities that have been lost far too soon," Ms Lee said. "We are all the poorer for her sudden passing.

"Agnes was head-hunted from the Department of Conservation to ensure that I was given high quality advice from a Maori perspective on conservation issues and policy development.

"She had previously served as a Public Service Association organiser, when she impressed both DOC management and staff with her negotiating skills while representing staff in talks on the departmental restructuring that followed Cave Creek."

Ms Lee said Agnes took leave to undergo medical treatment late last year and went to Gisborne to be with her whanau. She died peacefully at home surrounded by whanau and friends.

The Conservation Minister along with Beehive colleagues of Agnes and a large group from the Department of Conservation will attend her funeral at 11am tomorrow (Thursday 8 February) at the Te Poho o Rawiri marae in Gisborne.
