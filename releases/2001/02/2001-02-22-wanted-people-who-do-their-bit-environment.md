The Minister for the Environment, Marian Hobbs, is seeking nominations for the 2001 Green Ribbon Awards.

"We will never solve New Zealand’s environmental problems if we expect central and local government to do it all," the Minister said. "What I want to hear about are the people, organisations and businesses which are doing their bit - and probably somebody else’s as well.

“Those we honour through the Green Ribbon Awards are an example to the rest of us of how individuals and small organisations can make a big difference through their commitment and hard work."

Marian Hobbs said that for the first time there would be a "kids who care" award for a young person or youth organisation.

Other awards will be made for:  
\* caring for the urban environment  
\* caring for the rural environment  
\* caring for our biodiversity  
\* raising awareness of environmental issues  
\* business caring for our environment  
\* state of the environment reporting

Nominations for the awards close on April 30. The winners will be announced on World Environment Day June 5.
