The Minister of Tourism Mark Burton has applauded the new short breaks holiday campaign aimed at Australian tourists, which has been launched jointly by Tourism New Zealand and Air New Zealand.

"This government has a strong focus on regional development, and this campaign emphasises that each of New Zealand's regions offers visitors an unique experience," Mark Burton said.

"Last year more than 570,000 Australians visited New Zealand, but we can encourage even more of our trans-Tasman neighbours to cross the ditch.

"Extensive research by Tourism New Zealand has identified that Australians are taking shorter holidays more often – and this new campaign is targeting this market.

"New Zealand is a wonderfully diverse tourism experience and this campaign recognises and highlights the fact that visitors don't have to try and see everything in one go.

"Indeed, we want tourists to know that when they have visited one region of New Zealand and had a great experience, there are many equal but unique experiences to be had in other regions, on future visits.

"I am delighted that the regional tourism organisations have got behind this campaign and have helped develop regional touring options. For its part, Tourism New Zealand has made the 100% Pure brand available to the RTOs.

"As Minister, I have been encouraging and building effective partnerships throughout the tourism industry.

"This new campaign, involving a government agency, private enterprise and the regions is a great example of this partnership approach," Mark Burton said.
