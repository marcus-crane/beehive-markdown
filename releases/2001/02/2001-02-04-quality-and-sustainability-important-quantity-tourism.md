Tourists are flocking to New Zealand in record numbers but the Minister of Tourism Mark Burton says there is also a need to look beyond the numbers.

In 2000, a record 1.789 million international visitors arrived in New Zealand, an 11 percent increase on the year before.

"It is a fantastic result, and the tourism industry and Tourism New Zealand deserve credit for their efforts in marketing New Zealand," Mark Burton said.

"However, we must not settle for the narrow-focused approach taken by Government in the 1990's, and gauge success by numbers alone.

"We must ensure that visitors to New Zealand, along with our own domestic tourists, enjoy a quality experience and that the development of tourism is sustainable – protecting and preserving both the environment and lifestyle values of New Zealand.

"The New Zealand Tourism Strategy aims to be the key to achieving these goals. For too long there has been an ad hoc approach to tourism planning, and as Minister I have worked hard to restore the tourism industry's confidence in central government.

"The Tourism Strategy is being developed as part of the new partnership approach and I expect to see a draft from the Strategy Working Group by the end of March," Mark Burton said.

"For the first time New Zealand is developing a proper strategy to manage the appropriate growth of the tourism sector, and the implications of that growth."
