Prime Minister Helen Clark today expressed her sadness at the death of Sir Robert Mahuta and passed on her deepest condolences to his family and to the Tainui people.

"Sir Robert was one of Maoridom's most prominent figures and has made a huge contribution to its development throughout his life.

"Even when suffering from very poor health, Sir Robert continued to work tirelessly on behalf the Tainui people he had served, in various ways, all his life.

"Sir Robert Mahuta's work to advance the landmark Tainui settlement with the government in 1995 was his crowning achievement.

"On behalf of the government I extend my condolences to my Parliamentary colleague Nanaia Mahuta, to all Sir Robert's family and to Tainui, which has lost one of its greatest sons.

"Our thoughts are with them at this saddest of times," Helen Clark said.
