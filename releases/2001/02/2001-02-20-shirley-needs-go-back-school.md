Shirley needs to go back to school - Cullen

Accident Insurance Minister Michael Cullen says ACT deputy leader Ken Shirley needs to go back to school to improve his reading and arithmetic skills.  
"This afternoon Mr Shirley claimed that ACC was charging premiums for the period 1 July 2000 to 31 March 2001 for 275 days when there were only 274 days in that period.  
"There are certainly only 274 days but he is totally wrong in claiming employers were being charged for 275 days.  
"In fact, they are being charged for 75% (or nine months) of a full year. On the basis that the year in question is an ordinary year with 365 days, they are being charged 273.75 days.  
"That means, in effect, a freebie from ACC of a quarter of a day.  
"Mr Shirley also has failed a simple comprehension test. The example he has used to prove his claims is not a standard one. In fact the person concerned had just started up the business on 30 June 2000 whereas Mr Shirley has quoted 1 July 2000 and in this instance the number of days' cover is 275 as expressed on the invoice.  
"ACC charges for the exact number of days' cover where self employed people have ceased or started. This cover period is notated in the black and white strip on the invoice.  
ACC doesn't expect any thanks for giving a little bit of extra cover or for continuing to drop premiums but I do expect better basic school skills from a deputy leader," Dr Cullen said.
