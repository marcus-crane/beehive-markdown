Acting Minister of Broadcasting Steve Maharey will be contacting industry stakeholders over the next few weeks as he familiarises himself with the key policy issues facing the industry and the Government.

"I regret the circumstances under which the Prime Minister was required to ask me to assume these additional responsibilities. The resignation of my colleague the Hon Marion Hobbs is a matter of deep sadness and I acknowledge her contribution to the portfolio."

Mr Maharey said that he had a long-standing interest in broadcasting policy, including a period as the Labour Party spokesperson.

"The portfolio is a key one, and the Government is committed to implementing the policies on which it was elected," Steve Maharey said.
