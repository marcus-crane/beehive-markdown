Literacy and numeracy initiatives and extra staffing are the most popular use of the extra money made available to schools through the redistribution of bulk funding.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard said a survey of schools released today showed that more than half the schools that received extra funding through the end of bulk funding would spend some of that money on nearly $10 million of numeracy and literacy initiatives.

"I'm thrilled that so many schools have chosen to use this money on these really important basic skills," Trevor Mallard said.

"Extra staffing and ways to reduce workload are also popular with more than a thousand schools planning to spend nearly $26 million in these areas. Other uses of the money include special needs, ICT, and professional development.

"These are all areas that will have a positive impact on the quality of learning in our schools.

"More than $100 million of money previously only available to bulk funded schools was redistributed to all schools using a fair and equitable system. On top of that schools received an increase in their operation grants. That means that about $60 million extra is going directly into schools this year compared to last year.

"This report back process shows that schools are using that money well to improve their children's learning outcomes.

"Schools were notified of extra funding in August last year and were asked to report back as to what they planned to do with the extra funds.

"For some schools, it was a massive jump in funding and I wanted to encourage boards of trustees to plan carefully how they would use that money to improve the education in their schools," Trevor Mallard said.
