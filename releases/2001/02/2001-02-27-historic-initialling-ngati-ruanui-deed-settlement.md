The Government and representatives of Ngati Ruanui will today initial a Deed of Settlement proposing a settlement of grievances dating back to the New Zealand Wars.

The Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, Margaret Wilson said the proposed settlement was the first Taranaki claim to reach this stage.

"It is over to the people of Ngati Ruanui whether the settlement is supported. I hope it will be approved, and that the process of healing for which the whole Taranaki regions has waited so long can begin".

The grievances of Ngati Ruanui arose from unjustified acts by the Crown in the 1860s, including waging war, confiscation of land, the return of some land under unfair leasehold arrangements and the assault on Ngati Ruanui people and others at Parihaka.

If members of Ngati Ruanui support the settlement, the Crown will

\* formally apologise  
\* provide commercial redress of 41 million dollars in land or cash in recognition of the economic losses suffered by Ngati Ruanui.  
\* transfer five sites of significance to Ngati Ruanui  
\* acknowledge Ngati Ruanui fishing rights and rights over areas of importance to the iwi,  
\* agree that Ngati Ruanui will also have a 50 year right of first refusal to buy, at full market value, certain Crown-owned land in the area.

The initialling will take place on the ground floor of the Beehive Thursday, 1 March 2001 10:30 am - 11:00 am
