The Minister of Tourism Mark Burton has presented a cheque for $100,000 to help fund a new display at the New Zealand National Maritime Museum on Auckland's Waterfront.

The presentation was made at the Museum this afternoon. (At 3.30pm)

The money comes from the Tourism Facilities Grants Programme, which has had a significant association with the National Maritime Museum. Grants from the programme contributed to the Museum’s opening in 1993. A second grant contributed towards the construction of the courtyard theatre and surrounds.

"I am pleased to be able to continue this association with a grant for $100,000 to contribute to the creation of the Pacific Discovery Experience," Mark Burton said.

"The stories told in the museum traverse the range of associations that New Zealanders have with the sea. The Pacific Discovery Experience will add a new level of story telling. The Experience uses cutting edge technology and audiovisual design to create a virtual reality experience and immerse the viewers into the story of the discovery of New Zealand by the peoples of the Pacific, and later, by Europeans.

"I believe this will be an experience as realistic as any that you will find in the museums and theme parks of the world," Mark Burton said.

"I would encourage all New Zealanders to take this experience – we can all learn something about our past, and something about ourselves.

"The Experience will also help our international visitors understand and appreciate the unique and the emotive of the story of the discovery of the islands of Aotearoa.

"This project draws together the Government's commitment to appropriate support both for the tourism industry and activities which celebrate and preserve our cultural heritage.

The Government is proud to be in partnership with the Maritime Museum to further develop its outstanding exhibits," Mark Burton said.
