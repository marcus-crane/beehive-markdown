The Minister of Labour, Margaret Wilson has announced the membership and terms of reference of three advisory committees which will develop new proposals for New Zealand workplace law and practice.

The groups will advise on Equal Employment Opportunity, the Holidays Act and the protection of workers when work is transferred to a different employer.

Ms Wilson said she was pleased to have been able to appoint groups which represent employers and employees and include experts in the different fields of study.

"In each case a talented and skilled chairperson will lead the advisory group. Employers and employees can expect their voices to be heard and their opinions to be carefully considered by the committees.

Equal Employment Opportunities

"Both Labour and the Alliance are keeping their promises to look for new ways to enhance the rights of people in work or looking for a job. There's a lot of evidence that subtle and insidious discrimination has continued in New Zealand workplaces in the last decade. The old and the young, recent immigrants, women, people with disabilities, Maori and Pacific Islanders all continue to face unjustified discrimination.

"In many cases employers – and shareholders – are being let down by managers who make decisions based on false assumptions and are unaware that they are discriminating unfairly and therefore not appointing the best person for the job.

"We want a system which makes it easy for employers to recruit the best talent without adding compliance costs to their businesses".

"We also want New Zealand to be able to attract and retain the best people in an increasingly competitive global labour market.

Holidays Act

"There is agreement from everyone that the Holidays Act needs reform. It is complex, unfair and high on compliance costs for employers.

"The government is seeking advice on a change to the law which meets the needs of all parties and the changing nature of the labour market.

Transfer of undertakings

"When a business is sold, or work is contracted out, the existing employees of the business being transferred may be left with little or no protection of their employment and conditions of work. This has been an important issue for some low-paid groups such as cleaners. The government, by setting up this advisory group is delivering on a promise made at the time the Employment Relations Bill was being debated to consider whether additional protections need to be put in place.

"The advisory groups continue the government's programme of supporting high quality workplaces and high productivity and balancing the needs of the modern international economy with the need for fairness and equity.

"I have not placed any timetable on the groups but I would like to see interim reports in April."
