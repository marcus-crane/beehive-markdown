Housing Minister Mark Gosche has confirmed that more than 2,400 families with serious, urgent housing needs were placed in state houses in December 2000 and January 2001.

"We have been helping out people living in shocking conditions who were simply not welcome in state houses under the previous Government's regime," Mr Gosche said today.

"Some of these families include mothers and children who for some time had been sheltering in women's refuges, surviving in camping grounds, and making do in garages, tents and sheds."

"Unlike National we are allocating to the neediest families."

Since December 1, 2001 more than 2400 families and households with serious housing need have been placed in state houses.

"The National Government's profit-driven housing regime meant waiting lists for state houses were first come - first served: they were not reserved for those with severe housing needs."

"This is why we have tenants on high incomes living in state houses: every one of them applied to live in state houses under the previous National Government."

Recent statistics showed that less than 0.02% of the Government's 59,000 state house tenants earned high incomes. More than 86% of all tenants were on low incomes and had qualified for an income related rent.

"The National Government saw state houses as a way to make a profit and that's why a few tenants with high incomes are now living in state houses."

"This is yet another problem we have been left to deal with by National's profit driven state housing regime, we expect over time that those few tenants on high incomes will move on to other places."
