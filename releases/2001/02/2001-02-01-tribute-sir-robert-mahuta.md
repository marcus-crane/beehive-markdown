The Minister of Maori Affairs, Hon Parekura Horomia, is deeply saddened by the news of the death of Tainui leader Sir Robert Mahuta. Mr Horomia said Sir Robert Mahuta was one of the outstanding leaders of Maori society in modern times. "Sir Robert's achievements are unsurpassed, irrespective of the troubles in recent times. The nation should not forget his energy and drive in terms of the ground-breaking Tainui settlement and also the education of his people." Mr Horomia said he had the utmost respect for Bob and was grateful for the opportunity to work together, which they did so on many occasions.
