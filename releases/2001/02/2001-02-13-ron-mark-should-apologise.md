New Zealand First's Police spokesperson, Ron Mark, should apologise to current Fire Service Acting Chief Executive Alison Timms for suggesting that she will be the next deputy commissioner of police. "Ron Mark has again displayed how out of touch he is. Mrs Timms has not even applied for the job," George Hawkins said. "Ron Mark's speculation on who will be the next deputy commissioner is unfounded, ill-advised, and by the nature of his incorrect assumption, an insult to Mrs Timms. He should apologise immediately. "A decision on the appointment of the next deputy commissioner of Police will be made in due course," George Hawkins said.
