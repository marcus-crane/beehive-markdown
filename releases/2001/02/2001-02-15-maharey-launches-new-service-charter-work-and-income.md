Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey launched a service charter for the Department of Work (DWI) and Income today.

The Charter describes the services offered by the Department and the what beneficiaries and employers can expect of DWI. The charter was developed last year in consultation with beneficiary advocacy and employer organisations across the country. Mr Maharey said the charter was developed to give a focus to improving service standards and to further assist the development of a strong public service ethic within DWI.

"Significant progress was made within DWI last year to transform it into a client-centered organisation which goes the extra mile to ensure beneficiaries get what they are entitled to and are helped into real paying jobs.

"Supporting employers to find the right people with the right skills for the job has also been a focus.

"Service charters have been used in European and American welfare agencies to inform clients of their rights and responsibilities and to signal expected service level standards to staff.

"The charter now in place within DWI has been developed in close cooperation with community organisations, beneficiary advocacy groups, employer organisations and other stakeholder groups. It will be displayed in all DWI offices and copies will be available for clients to take away," Steve Maharey said.
