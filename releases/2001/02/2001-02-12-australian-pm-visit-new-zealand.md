Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that the Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, will visit New Zealand from 24 February to 26 February.

Helen Clark said the annual meeting of the New Zealand and Australian prime ministers was a key event in transtasman relations.

"Mr Howard and I see each other regularly at international gatherings, but our dedicated annual meeting is an opportunity to focus on current bilateral issues as well as a range of regional issues," Helen Clark said.

The programme for Mr Howard will feature a number of weekend engagements in Auckland, including a business function and a visit to an island on the Hauraki Gulf.

On Monday 26 February in Wellington Mr Howard will meet with the New Zealand Cabinet and attend a State luncheon.

Helen Clark said that she was looking forward to welcoming Mr Howard to New Zealand for his fourth official visit. The Australian Prime Minister was last here for the APEC Leaders' meeting in September 1999.

Talks with Mr Howard are expected to be wide-ranging.

The two leaders will exchange views on regional matters where New Zealand and Australian interests are engaged, and discuss bilateral issues such as defence co-operation and social security.
