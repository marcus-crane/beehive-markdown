Health Minister Annette King today announced that HealthShare Ltd, a subsidiary company of five of the new district health boards, Waikato, Lakeland, Pacific, Taranaki and Tairawhiti, will provide regional service planning, purchasing and contracting functions for the five boards.

Mrs King said that establishment of the company, coming into effect on February 1, was a very sensible development, and would "streamline the administrative functions of the five DHBs.

"It also illustrates the sort of co-operative work that has been going on between the Ministry of Health and boards leading up to and following the passing of the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act in December.

"The new legislation encourages these sorts of cooperative efficiencies among our leading public health providers. The public and health sector alike will benefit from the establishment of HealthShare as it will provide the DHBs with stability and continuity as they develop funding skills and move toward full autonomy."

The five DHBs will jointly control HealthShare Ltd, with equal voting rights, and shareholdings based on their respective contributions.

Mrs King said the company would be governed by a board of directors consisting of the five DHB chief executives, with the chair rotating between the DHBs. The five DHBs would, however, remain accountable for their individual funding decisions.

"I am confident this arrangement will be highly successful in contributing to greater health gains for all New Zealanders, and I anticipate similar cooperative efforts between other DHBs will occur in the coming months."
