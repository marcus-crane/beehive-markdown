New Zealand is to seek World Trade Organisation permission to take action against Canada for its failure to conform to international trading rules related to its subsidised dairy exports, Minister for Trade Negotiations Jim Sutton said today.

In 1999 Canada lost a case brought against it by New Zealand and the United States under the WTO's dispute settlement system over its programmes for subsidising dairy exports without counting these against allowed limits -the "Special Milk Class" programmes.

Canada has had a year to implement the decision, but instead seemed to put a lot of effort into devising a new system to get round the ruling, Mr Sutton said. New Zealand and America would now contest the new system as well.

"WTO rules enable us to seek the right to retaliate against Canada. It is important we demonstrate to Canada our determination that it should meet its commitments."

Mr Sutton said he had instructed officials to seek authorisation to impose penalty tariffs on Canadian products up to the value of about US$35 million dollars a year, which is the damage caused to New Zealand by these illegal exports.The earliest a WTO decision is expected is late this year.

"I'm confident Canada would not fail to heed the WTO's rulings a second time, and that New Zealand will not actually have to follow through with its action," Mr Sutton said.

"While we don't want or expect to have to retaliate, should we be left with no choice in the end but to do so, we will select the areas which best suit New Zealand's overall interests, and choose an appropriate value of sanctions within the overall limit approved by the WTO."
