Health Minister Annette King says she has agreed to a request from Gisborne Cervical Screening Inquiry chairperson Ailsa Duffy to extend the reporting deadline by a month to March 30.

Mrs King said today Ms Duffy had asked for the extension for personal family reasons.

"I regret the delay, but I fully understand and accept the circumstances."

Mrs King said she now expected to release the report in early April.
