Health Minister Annette King today announced continued funding that will support the Kapiti Healthlinks project.

"I am delighted to announce that we have agreed to funding sufficient for a project manager for the Kapiti Healthlinks project for the next three-and-a-half years," Minister of Health Annette King said today.

"The $75,000 a year will come from the Ministry of Health and reflects our commitment to last year's Kapiti District Health and Disability Report and Plan, and to communities having a greater say in their health services."

One of the priorities in the plan was to have the Ministry of Health, alongside other partners, to continue funding for an ongoing health partnership which would advocate initiatives to improve health and disability outcomes for people in the Kapiti District.

Funding has also been approved for a pilot project to support two community health workers, working as part of primary health care teams in Otaki, until June 2004.

Annette King said the Ministry of Health would set up a working group involving representatives of the Kapiti Community Health Group Trust, local providers, iwi, and key community groups from Otaki to work with it on the services to be funded.

Catherine Gibson, chairperson of the Kapiti Community Health Group Trust, welcomed these announcements.

"This will assist greatly with the Trust's efforts in promoting and improving the health of communities as identified in the Kapiti Healthlinks report, working with iwi and other groups as appropriate," said Catherine Gibson.

"Many of the recommendations contained in Kapiti's Healthlinks report have been or are in the process of being put in place. For example, Capital and Coast DHB is investigating integrated services for outpatients, rehabilitation, emergency and general practice from one site.

"There is still much work to do and another three-and-a-half years of funding will enable the Trust to continue working towards optimum health and disability services for Kapiti residents.

"This support by the Minister of Health indicates a commitment to working in partnership with local communities - an approach to developments which has proved most successful in the early stages of the Healthlinks project," said Catherine Gibson.
