Tourism Minister Mark Burton has told those attending the Marlborough Culinary Fare 2001 that the event highlights the important and exciting relationship that exists between the tourism industry and the cuisine sectors.

Mark Burton was one of the speakers at tonight's dinner at Seresin Estate.

"Tourism is an industry where visitors seek out enjoyable experiences in new and interesting places," he told the gathering.

"To effectively compete in the international marketplace, we as a nation need to be sure that the providers of tourism-related goods and services meet and exceed the expectations of our visitors.

"Food and wine is a vitally important component of the tourism experience. Tourists want to enjoy quality cuisine, in an attractive setting and often in a lively social context. For most people, satisfaction with the food and drink on offer is critical to an enjoyable holiday.

"This needs to be widely understood within both the tourism and cuisine sectors. As Minister, I have actively encouraged a raising of the already high standards that have been achieved.

"From a regional tourism perspective, wine and food can be important points of differentiation or even a compelling reason to travel.

"Marlborough provides a fine example of this," Mark Burton said. "The wine industry allied with the quality food products of the region defines Marlborough as a quality destination for many visitors".

Mark Burton congratulated the local Regional Tourism Organisation, Destination Marlborough for recognising this.

"Destination Marlborough is active in supporting such important events as this dinner and the associated Wine Marlborough Festival 2001."

Mark Burton is attending the Festival tomorrow (Saturday).
