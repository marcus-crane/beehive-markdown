Transport Minister Mark Gosche today introduced legislation to Parliament to begin rebuilding the aviation medical certification system.  
Mr Gosche said decisive action was needed after an independent study found serious flaws in the current system.  
The report by Professor Gorman and Professor Sir John Scott concludes that the current system is “defective”:

“Our overall conclusion is that public safety demands urgent changes to the process of determining medical fitness to fly aeroplanes in New Zealand.”  
Professor Gorman is head of occupational medicine at Auckland University and the leading New Zealand academic on occupational medicine. Professor Sir John Scott is one of this country’s most eminent doctors and a renowned expert on medical processes and ethics. Both professors are experts in health surveillance systems.

“They have revealed a serious public safety issue,” Mr Gosche said. “Passengers should be able to have confidence in their pilot’s fitness. Unless we take rapid action they will be not be able to do so.”  
“The Government has to address the fact that independent experts have found serious faults with the present system and that the New Zealand system is not up to international best practice.”At present, private sector practitioners known as Aviation Medical Assessors (AMAs) assess pilot medical records compiled by Designated Medical Examiners (DMEs) who conduct the physical examination of pilots.

In future, the report recommends the DMEs’ reports should be assessed by a team of specialists employed by the CAA in a model similar to those of Canada and Australia. The Director must be given the legal power over the medical assessment process that he needs to protect public safety.

Mr Gosche said the legislation would give the Director of Civil Aviation clear statutory responsibility for aviation medical certification. This included the power to appoint and remove medical examiners, to issue directions to medical examiners, to conduct medical assessments and to issue and withdraw medical certificates.  
The Bill would also ensure validation of all existing medical certificates, he said.  
“These changes effectively recentralise a medical system that was decentralised in 1992. That was done with the best of intentions, but the experiment has not worked.”

“I could not allow a system with such inherent flaws to continue.”  
Mr Gosche said overseas experience suggested more centralised systems permitted a collegial approach that helped doctors make complex assessment decisions, and also helped develop a depth of experience and precedent.  
Independent Examination of Medical Standards

Mr Gosche also announced that, separately from the Bill, he was establishing an independent examination of the medical standards contained in the Civil Aviation Rules, and that examination would include looking at the contentious “one percent rule”.  
The one percent rule relates to cardiovascular risk and provides a threshold beyond which further checks or health intervention may be necessary. Strong aviation industry opposition to the one percent rule has recently led to legal action.

Mr Gosche said he recognised the strong concerns of the aviation industry on this issue. This was, however, separate from the medical process.  
The examination panel would consist of an eminent lawyer and an overseas aviation medical expert to consider international best practice in regard to medical risk standards. The panel would hear the views of all parties and make recommendations directly to him.

“The panel’s report, and that of the professors, will form the backbone of a complete rewrite of the medical rules and the medical manual.”  
“I am hopeful that that rewrite will go some way to mending relationships between the CAA and the aviation industry. These have been badly strained in recent times and I want to do all I can to fix that.”  
“I am aware, also, of the public’s interest in this. Whatever the outcome, public safety has to be paramount,” Mr Gosche said.  
Mr Gosche said he was hopeful that the new rule could be in place by Christmas.
