Mana Motuhake leader Sandra Lee, in a statement from the Chatham Islands, has paid tribute to Sir Robert Mahuta who she described as "a tenacious Maori advocate from the old guard".

"The fact that he led the charge for a settlement for Tainui which resulted in the Crown conceding to the first major Maori claim settlement in New Zealand can never be taken away from him," Ms Lee said.

"I have admired for a considerable time the way in which Sir Robert put his own personal health needs aside in favour of advocating the best way forward for Tainui, as he saw it," she said.

"Irrespective of competing views, I have absolutely no doubt that all Tainui and Maori in general will mourn his passing as a leader and fighting rangatira of his time."
