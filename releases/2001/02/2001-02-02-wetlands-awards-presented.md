The work of three organisations to protect and restore our environment has been acknowledged today (Friday) by the Environment and Conservation Ministers as part of nationwide celebrations marking World Wetlands Day.

The Minister for the Environment Marian Hobbs announced New Zealand Wetlands Awards for the Whakaki Lake Trustees, the Pauatahanui Reserve Management Committee of the Royal Forest & Bird Protection Society of New Zealand, and Norske-Skog Tasman. The awards will be presented on behalf of Conservation Minister Hon Sandra Lee, who is in the Chatham Islands this week.

"These awards are well justified because of the important contribution each group has made to our wetlands," the Ministers said in a joint statement today. "Our wetlands are cradles of biological diversity, providing the water and primary productivity upon which countless species of plants and animals depend for survival."

The Ministers said that while wetlands were one of New Zealand's most productive environments they were also one of our most threatened natural ecosystems.

"The Whakaki Lake Trustees have been working to restore the natural hydrology and ecology of the Whakaki Lagoon and its coastal wetland system near Wairoa, on behalf of the Maori owners. Their project partners include the Department of Conservation, the Hawke's Bay Regional Council, and Fish and Game Council.

"The Pauatahanui Reserve Management Committee of Forest & Bird has had a longstanding commitment to restoring a large remnant of public saltmarsh and coastal wetlands in the Pauatahanui Wildlife Management Reserve. Their work has included educating the public on the importance of the wetlands.

"Norske-Skog Tasman has made a substantial corporate commitment to mitigate and offset historical industrial impacts on the aquatic systems of the lower Tarawera Catchment. They are currently restoring wetland systems associated with Lakes Rotoroa and Rotoitipaku, and had previously helped restore the Matata Lagoon Wildlife Refuge," the Ministers said.

For further information contact Trevor Henry, Press Secretary, 04 471 9131 or 025 477 994, or Sue McCabe, Department of Conservation Media Liaison on 04 471 3117 or 025 846 810

Representatives from the Pauatahanui Reserve Management Committee and Norske-Skog Tasman will receive their award from Environment Minister at 10.30am Friday 2 February at the Karori Wildlife Sanctuary in Wellington. The ceremony is part of the commemoration of World Wetlands Day. Also at the function, schoolchildren will plant vegetation at a wetland in the sanctuary and the NZ Gamebird Habitat Trust Board Stamp will be launched.
