Foreign Affairs Minister Phil Goff has announced that New Zealand's next High Commissioner to Fiji will be Adrian Simcock. Mr Simcock who is currently New Zealand's High Commissioner to India will take up the posting in June. He will replace Tia Barrett who is returning to New Zealand following the completion of his three-year appointment.

"I am pleased that New Zealand will be represented in what is a difficult posting by a person who knows the Pacific well and has such extensive experience. "Mr Simcock joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in 1966 and has served as the New Zealand High Commissioner to the Cook Islands and High Commissioner to Samoa, as well as serving in Malaysia and Washington. "My thanks also to the work done by Tia Barrett. He has represented New Zealand well over what has been a troubled and difficult period in Fiji," said Mr Goff. In addition to being New Zealand's High Commissioner in Fiji, Mr Simcock will also be accredited as High Commissioner to Nauru and Tuvalu.
