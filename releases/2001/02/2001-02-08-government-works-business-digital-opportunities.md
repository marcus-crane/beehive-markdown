Prime Minister Helen Clark and Education Minister Trevor Mallard today announced four education-based pilots to help New Zealand embrace the economic and social benefits of information technology.

Helen Clark said the projects resulted from meetings between senior Government Ministers and information and communication technology business leaders which began in July last year.

"We have a shared vision of New Zealand as an innovative nation leading the world using modern technology," Helen Clark said.

"The potential economic and social benefits for the country are enormous.

"But turning the vision into reality will require bringing all our citizens on board and giving them the opportunity to access and gain the skills to use new technology. It's about access, ability and attitude.

"Representatives from some of the country's leading ICT and related companies have been meeting with Government for six months to discuss how we can work in partnership to help bridge the digital divide and create a digital opportunity.

"Today, we are signing a protocol that formalises that partnership and leads the way to develop four pilot projects to start realising our vision.

"While the agreement does not extend beyond these initial projects, I am confident that there will be further opportunities for Government and business to work together towards common goals," Helen Clark said.

Trevor Mallard said by making education the focus of the pilots the Government was recognising the important role schools play in turning the digital divide into a digital opportunity.

"Education is the ideal place to start because we can use ICT to stimulate and enhance learning, while helping a generation of young people to grow up comfortable and confident with ICT.

"If children from poor or rural areas are left behind, there is a high chance that they will never catch up.

"The four pilot projects recognise some of the barriers to realising our vision and propose practical solutions. (summaries attached)

"The Government will commit $10.4 million over the next four years to the projects. Our business partners will contribute in a variety of ways including offering products at reduced rates as well as the skills and experience of their staff," Trevor Mallard said.

"Contributions from businesses mean the cost of the projects to the tax-payer will be lower than could be achieved through a contestable tendering process. The exact contributions will be confirmed in service agreements between the businesses and the Ministry of Education, together with participating schools.

"This is an exciting opportunity for schools in the pilot areas as well as for the development of our country," Trevor Mallard said.
