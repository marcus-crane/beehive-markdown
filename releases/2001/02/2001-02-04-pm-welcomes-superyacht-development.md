Prime Minister Helen Clark today welcomed the decision of Sovereign Yachts to establish a large, new superyacht enterprise in West Auckland, and said it would strengthen further New Zealand's high value marine industries.

Helen Clark said that the proposed development on surplus land at Hobsonville air force base would stimulate Auckland's economy and highlight New Zealand's credentials as a producer of leading-edge goods and services.

Helen Clark, Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton, Waitakere Mayor Bob Harvey and Bill Lloyd of Sovereign Yachts were at Hobsonville for today's announcement.

Helen Clark welcomed Sovereign Yachts' estimates of 350 jobs within two years and export earnings of $600 million over five years.

"This project gives substance to our vision of New Zealand becoming innovators to the world, turning great ideas into great ventures," she said.

"New Zealand needs quality investment in leading-edge ideas and technologies to build our economy. The government is prepared to play its part in facilitating that. This project shows the results which a commitment to smart, active government can bring.

"Jim Anderton and the Ministry for Economic Development have worked in partnership with the New Zealand Defence Force and Waitakere City to make this venture a reality, after Trade New Zealand had drawn attention to the project's potential.

"This is an outcome which reflects well on the government's commitment to being active in promoting investment, exporting, business and job growth.

"New Zealand's future prosperity depends on us being innovative and accepting no limits on our potential.

"I am delighted that Bill Lloyd and Sovereign Yachts have chosen New Zealand to base this major new development in," Helen Clark said.
