Foreign Affairs Minister Phil Goff had a wide-ranging discussion when he met with the Commander of the Fijian Military Forces, Commodore Frank Bainimarama today. The discussion focused on the upcoming Court of Appeal hearing on the Justice Gates' decision on the Constitution, the treason trial of Speight and others and the security situation within Fiji.

"I set out New Zealand's expectations of Fiji, that whatever the outcome of the Court of Appeal hearing, Fiji move quickly back to a constitutional and democratic government. "I welcomed Commodore Bainimarama's public statement that the Fiji Military Forces would uphold the law and respect the judgement of the Court of Appeal. "I also acknowledged the importance he attached to maintaining peace and stability following the court's decision.

No-one benefits from chaos and violence, which are inimical to the restoration and maintenance of democracy in Fiji. "I expressed New Zealand's willingness to assist with the process of transition back to democratic government and the belief that a government of national reconciliation and unity would assist a peaceful transition pending new elections," said Mr Goff
