Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel is delighted with the results of the first meeting of the Ministerial Advisory Group in Wellington yesterday.

Members of the new Ministerial Advisory Group, and its Refugee Sub-Group, were welcomed to the meetings by Lianne Dalziel.

The Group members are William Milnes, Dr Ashraf Coudhary, Partha Sarathy, Samuelu Sefuiva, Patrick O'Connor, Karen Te-O-Kahurangi Grant and Trudie McNaughton.

"I know that this group will provide an excellent sounding board on immigration policy, for me as Minister of Immigration and for the government," Lianne Dalziel said.

"The meeting was spent getting an overview of where immigration policy is at now and the direction we want for the future. The migration initiatives announced at the business forum two weeks ago seem to have been well received and the Group has generated some excellent ideas on addressing other immigration issues.

"We have discussed a number issues including labour market links, English language assistance and enforceable standards for immigration consultants.

"I am confident that this Group and the Refugee Sub-Group will provide invaluable advice to me as Minister, in addition to advice from the New Zealand Immigration Service," she said.
