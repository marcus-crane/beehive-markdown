Jim Anderton Minister of Economic Development today inspected the first of three new locally made fire engines going from Lower Hutt to fight fires in South Australia. The successful company, Fraser Fire and Rescue, received some advice on contracts from Industry New Zealand, the Government's jobs machine.

Jm Anderton, said "I am pleased to see a local company developing such a strong market niche using Kiwi know-how and getting the edge they needed from advice from an Industry New Zealand specialist business adviser."

"This Labour Alliance Coalition Government is committed to providing support where there is a need, so that we can continue to lower unemployment and get more Kiwis to work. Business advice is just as important, if not more important than grants, and often a few hours of specialised support is the difference between success and failure," he said.

Jim Anderton, Deputy Prime Minister met with Martin Simpson, the General Manager of Fraser Fire and Rescue as well as David Schmerl from the South Australian Fire Service.

Release from Industry New Zealand

MEDIA RELEASE  
15 February 2001

GOVERNMENT POLICY PRAISED BY NZ BUSINESS

"This is the sort of government policy that can do business the world of good" says Martin Simpson, General Manager Fraser Fire and Rescue.

Jim Anderton, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Economic Development first recognised the export potential of Fraser Fire and Rescue in late 2000. Industry NZ has since been working with Fraser Fire and Rescue to assist in the exporting of three new fire engines to the South Australian Fire Service.

Mr Simpson said, "The help and confidence they (Industry NZ) gave us was invaluable. This was an example of extremely good government input into business". Industry NZ provided overall assistance and support but particularly in the area of contract advice.

"Industry NZ focuses on high growth companies. Fraser Fire and Rescue, part of the JJ Fraser Group, is a high growth company and fits within that focus. We're pleased that our assistance resulted in export orders. We hope we have made a difference because that's what we're here for," says Industry NZ Acting Chief Executive Bruce McLean.

"Although Industry NZ does offer financial support, we are finding that most companies are requesting the assistance, referral and liaison support we also offer."

The first of the fire engines was shown to Mr Anderton today on Parliament's forecourt by  
Mr Simpson and his staff and a representative from the South Australian Fire Service.

"We were very impressed with Industry NZ. The assistance and direction they gave us was fantastic," Mr Simpson said.
