Sport, Fitness and Leisure Minister Trevor Mallard welcomed the release of the discussion document into gaming.

"The review into sport, fitness and leisure contained recommendations in it which impact on gaming profits," Trevor Mallard said.

"As I said at the time of that release, any decisions about this have to be made in the context of the gaming review.

"I am therefore pleased that the discussion document on gaming has been released so that all New Zealanders can have a say on this issue.

"The public have been asked to contribute to this debate. I hope sporting clubs and individuals will consider taking part in this process," Trevor Mallard said.
