Prime Minister Helen Clark today said she was saddened by the sudden death of former Governor General Sir David Beattie. She paid tribute to his long and distinguished service in many areas of New Zealand life.

"Throughout his life Sir David served his country in a remarkably wide range of fields - the law, sports, arts and charities, and as Governor General.

"Even after his official retirement from public life, when his term as Governor General ended in 1985, Sir David kept contributing in his usual indefatigable and enthusiastic way.

"Among his achievements in a country passionate about sport, Sir David had the honour of serving as president of the New Zealand Olympic Committee.

"Sir David was also active in the arts, chairing the successful International Festival of the Arts from 1986 until 1990.

"Our thoughts are with Sir David's wife, Lady Beattie, and his family at this sad time," Helen Clark said.
