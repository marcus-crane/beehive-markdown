The Government today announced a new direction for the future delivery of special education services.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard and Associate Education Minister Lianne Dalziel said that Specialist Education Services (SES) will be disestablished, and its services transferred to a new directorate within the Ministry of Education. The directorate will be set up in 2002 and will establish a Learning Support Network with regional and local resource and support centres.

The Ministers said the decision was based on the Wylie Report recommendation that SES be disestablished, and that a new national network of support and resource centres for special education be developed under the aegis of the Ministry of Education. A range of options emerged from the submission process and subsequent consultations.

Trevor Mallard said the decision would enable the new direction to take full advantage of the professionalism and experience of SES staff.

" SES staff have performed well under difficult circumstances and I know many will welcome the opportunity to be part of the new direction. Concerns about SES can be sheeted home to the contestability and fragmentation of services introduced by the National government," Trevor Mallard said.

"The Government is proceeding with the option that provides the best basis for improved co-ordination both within the education system and with other social services to address the fragmentation that currently exists for children, young people and their families.

"There is a clear need for special education to be responsive to local needs while at the same time offering national consistency, leadership and strong professional support for the specialists who work in special education. Placing responsibility for SE2000 within the Ministry creates a direct line of accountability to Government," Trevor Mallard said.

Last year the Government announced some specific changes to SE2000 to address immediate needs, Lianne Dalziel said.

"Today we are announcing the structural framework that will enable SE2000 to meet its goals. Further decisions with respect to staffing issues and the question of magnet schools and units, are still to be made this year.

"The next round of decisions will, we believe, complete the task that this Government had set itself, to address the implementation faults inherent in SE2000, to ensure that the principles underpinning SE2000 are upheld," Lianne Dalziel said.

Parents who made submissions during the consultation period called for accountability, advocacy and attitudinal change. Lianne Dalziel said she had seen and heard too many reports of discrimination, hostility, exclusion, powerlessness and despair.

"We have taken the opportunity in today's announcement to remind all schools that both the Education Act and the Human Rights Act provide the right to education for children and young people with disabilities and special learning needs. This Government is committed to ensuring that their right to education is protected and upheld in a meaningful way," she said.
