Associate Minister of Commerce Laila Harré has released a public discussion paper on the Labour-Alliance coalition's insolvency law review.

Laila Harré said a simple and predictable regime for dealing with financial failure is of central importance to the New Zealand economy.

"We need to find the right balance between certainty and flexibility in the law for both personal and corporate insolvency."

The discussion document looks at issues such as alternatives to bankruptcy for indebted consumers and the order in which creditors are paid when a company goes into liquidation.

"Unsecured creditors have been hit hard by the increasing number of bankruptcies and liquidations over recent years, and the Labour-Alliance coalition wants to act quickly on this issue," Laila Harré said.

"Reforming corporate insolvency law will help to create the right environment for business growth and entrepreneurship.

"With regard to personal insolvency, our objective is to enable individuals in bankruptcy to once again participate in the economic life of the community."

The government hopes to make final policy decisions on these issues later this year.
