Commerce Minister Paul Swain today announced the appointment of Paula Rebstock as Deputy Chair of the Commerce Commission for a four-year term commencing 1 October 2001.

She replaces Mark Berry who left the Commission in August of this year.

Paula Rebstock was appointed an Associate Member of the Commerce Commission in August 1998 and became a full member in July 2000.

“Ms Rebstock has a strong background in economics and has gained valuable experience during the three years she has been involved with the Commission”, Paul Swain said.

“She has performed well and gained the respect of the business community and given the Commission is undergoing a period of substantial growth and increasing complexity of work, she will provide continuity and experience within the Commission”, he said.

Paula Rebstock is an economic consultant and a Director of several organisations, including the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology.

Her previous work experience in New Zealand includes a two-year period as an analyst at the New Zealand Treasury in the late 1980s and the role of Adviser in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet from 1990 to 1992. From 1993 to 1997 she was the General Manager of Policy for the Department of Labour. Prior to completing her post-graduate studies and coming to New Zealand in 1988, she worked in the private sector in the United States.

Paula Rebstock holds an MSc in Economics from the London School of Economics and has carried out post-graduate studies at the Kiel Institute of World Economics. Her economics work has focused on microeconomics, labour markets and regulatory economics.
