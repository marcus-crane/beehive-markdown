Media Statement October 3 2001 – Embargoed until 1 am Thursday October 4

Waka will paddle in to Hobson’s Wharf in the Viaduct Basin today (Thursday) to present the first National Safety Guidelines for Waka to kaumatua and Mark Gosche, Minister of Transport.

"The guidelines are the result of 18 months work following a fatal waka incident early last year. They have been developed by the waka community in partnership with the Maritime Safety Authority to detail safety procedures for waka", said Mr Gosche.

Junior crews training for the world sprint championships will help launch the safety guidelines with on the water demonstrations of safety procedures and equipment.

“These guidelines are a symbol of consultation and partnership between the government and the waka community. They will help to ensure the integrity, mana and future of a national symbol – the waka.”

“The consultation process has contributed to the resurgence of Kaupapa Waka and there is no doubt that it has helped to strengthen the waka community. Of great importance is the fact that these guidelines recognise traditional Maori safety practices and waka knowledge.”

As well as detailing safety procedures the guidelines clarify the roles and responsibilities of all those who paddle, support and embrace the waka. They also outline training, operational and emergency procedures, equipment and construction requirements.

“The MSA works to promote safety on the water and we are pleased to have been able to support such a positive initiative, driven by the waka community to ensure the safety of their crews,” says Russell Kilvington, Director of Maritime Safety.

Note to chief reporters:  
The launch is at 11.00am at Hobson’s Wharf adjacent to the Maritime Museum, in the Viaduct Basin, Auckland. Afterwards members of the Nga Waka Federation and Nga Kaihoe o Aotearoa will be available for comment.
