The Minister of Defence Mark Burton said he has received the judgement of the Chief of Defence Force in dealing with a disputed order from the Chief of General Staff to his deputy.

"The Chief of Defence Force Air Marshal Carey Adamson has considered the matters of conduct consistent with his command powers and responsibilities," Mark Burton said.

"This matter has been dealt with according to the appropriate military chain of command process. Obviously, it would have been quite improper for any political interference in the Chief of Defence Force's consideration of this matter.

"However, the wider issues of defence relationships and accountabilities are of concern to me," Mark Burton said, "and will be addressed by the recently announced review and inquiry package, further details of which are being released today."
