"Landonline is a ground-breaking project which moves the registration of New Zealand land transactions from an unsustainable paper environment to the new world of digital exchange, says Land Information Minister, Matt Robson.

He was opening the annual conference of the New Zealand Institute of Surveyors, at Te Papa in Wellington.

"The government's vision is that New Zealand will become a world-leader in e-government. My department, Land Information New Zealand, is playing a key role in that.

"Landonline has been a massive undertaking. The automation of both title and survey processes and information in such a system is a world first. Other countries have already expressed interest in how we are making it work," says Matt Robson.

"When the first stage of Landonline is complete LINZ will have captured and converted 5 million title documents and over a million survey plans and geodetic survey marks to a digital environment.

"Stage 2 is where customers will see the most change and benefit - they will be able to lodge routine transactions digitally from their own computer and be able to do things like pre-validate new data against the existing work. Stage 2 is expected to be ready for customers towards the end of 2002."

Titles conversion is now complete for the South Island and most of Wellington region. Landonline is scheduled to roll out in the Hamilton region in November this year and in Auckland in 2002. Titles conversion drives the implementation of Landonline.

Over 300 customers, including surveyors, lawyers and search agents have signed up for remote access to stage 1 of Landonline so far.
