Health Minister Annette King today launched a set of Toolkits to help District Health Boards meet the 13 priority health objectives of the New Zealand Health Strategy.

Speaking at the launch at Te Papa in Wellington, Mrs King said the Toolkits would provide a valuable resource for newly elected DHBs, because they gave background information on each of the priority areas, together with guidance on how to proceed in each area.

“These Toolkits will act as a much-needed ‘bridge’ between the high-level strategic objectives of the New Zealand Health Strategy, and the practical issues that DHBs will need to tackle in order to ensure health gains in each of the key areas,” Mrs King said.

“However, it is important to point out that these Toolkits are not accountability documents. They do not instruct DHBs or others in the sector how to do things. Rather they give practical advice and evidence on the most effective ways to tackle issues.”

For this reason they all take a slightly different approach, which is based on the advice of the expert groups. For example:  
·The Cardiovascular Toolkit looks at the major risk factors and then categories of cardiovascular disease, such as heart failure and stroke, and gives information on available tools that DHBs can use such as guidelines, information packs, videos etc.  
·The Suicide Toolkit looks at risk factors and then adopts a thematic approach looking at issues such as mental health promotion, training on suicide risk assessment, and reducing access to the means of suicide.  
·The Nutrition Toolkit identifies the best evidence on interventions to improve nutrition and also provides a checklist for DHBs.

The Toolkits were developed by lead writers from the Ministry of Health, in conjunction with more than 150 experts from academic units, the voluntary sector and the health sector.

The Toolkits will be placed on a website (www.newhealth.govt.nz/Toolkits) which has been designed to encourage feedback and the sharing of information. The website is expected to go live today and will be updated at regular intervals, so that new ideas and information can be incorporated into it.
