The Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Hon Jim Anderton, said today that he was appalled to learn of the killing of Israeli politician Revaham Ze’evi.

“I wish to express New Zealand’s condolences to the people and government of Israel on this loss. Our thoughts are particularly with the family of Mr Ze’evi, to whom we extend our sincere sympathies.

“The perpetrators must be brought to account for this crime. The consequences should be well measured. Circumstances call for the outrage to be dealt with in keeping with the principles of justice and the rigorous application of the rule of law,” Jim Anderton said.

Jim Anderton also drew attention to the need for a comprehensive and durable peace agreement between the parties.

“New Zealand joins with other nations in expressing the hope that this abhorrent and criminal act will not be allowed to divert efforts away from reconciliation. The goal of terrorists is a breakdown in dialogue. They should not be allowed to succeed. I urge Israel and the Palestinian Authority not to allow such acts to derail the ongoing work towards the restoration of the peace process.

“An equitable solution must be found. It must provide Palestinians with a viable and independent state, and reinforce Israelis’ rights to live in their nation with secure and recognised borders,” said Jim Anderton.
