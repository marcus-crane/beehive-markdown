The government-supported Computers in Homes project has been given a top award at the Stockholm Challenge 2001.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard said the win was welcome recognition for a project supported by the Government

The challenge, a prestigious event attracting hundreds of IT-entrepreneurs, looks for the best modern technology ideas which could open up better opportunities for families, he said.

Computers in Homes, initiated by the 20/20 trust, has been supported with $45,000 from the Ministry of Education. Trevor Mallard said that being a winner in the challenge will not change the way the project is run but will increase the chances of extension into new communities.

"I hope that businesses will continue to work in partnership with schools as they see the project's international recognition," he said.

"The success of Computers in Homes has meant schools and their families have  
been keen to continue and extend the project independently of further Ministry funding.

"Some families have bought their own computers and passed the original ones to new families while some schools have also negotiated deals with local training and service providers.

"Families selected for the project were each given a recycled computer, free Internet connection for six months and technology training and support from a specialist. Each family contributed $50 to the project," Trevor Mallard said.

Computers in Homes began as a pilot project in 2000 at Cannon’s Creek School in Porirua, Panmure Bridge School in Auckland and extended to families in Newton and as part of the Tuhoe education initiative.
