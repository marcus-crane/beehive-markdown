Economic development Minister Jim Anderton is thrilled with Southland’s promotional campaign, and he says it’s an example to other regions.

The campaign was launched with newspaper inserts today. The inserts boast about Southland’s booming economy.

“It’s not very long ago that regional New Zealand was deeply worried about dwindling populations, declining services and struggling economic performance. Now that has all turned around and regions are bouncing back.

“Every region has unique advantages. Southland is building on its special qualities and growing faster than any other region in New Zealand. It is working to bring people, jobs, services and businesses back and it is succeeding.

“Southland has led the way in initiatives such as removing fees to attract students to its Polytech.

“I would like to see every region showing the self-confidence, growth and performance that Southland is showing,” Jim Anderton said.
