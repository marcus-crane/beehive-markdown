Claims by embattled National Party MP Jenny Shipley that the Government has not done enough to state its support for the United States have been rejected by Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton.

Jim Anderton was the Acting Prime Minister when the attacks occurred.

"Mrs Shipley is making these allegations at some cost to her own credibility. New Zealand has been unflinching in expressing our grief and our willingness to help in any way we can.

"As Acting Prime Minister on the day of the attacks I sent a message to President Bush at 4 a.m., and stated New Zealand's support in a news release and press conference at 9 a.m., in a Ministerial statement to parliament, in a motion I moved in the House, and in an address to a commemorative service."

· Message to President Bush at 4 a.m. on 12 September:  
"The people of New Zealand share your sense of outrage and pain."  
· News release issued at a.m. on the day of the attacks:  
"We must see this attack not only as an attack on the United States, but as an attack on all civilised nations….We will stand ready to offer help in any way we can."  
· Ministerial statement:  
"The perpetrators of this violence must be brought swiftly to justice…The international community must work together to find everyone who has made this happen, and to punish them. New Zealand will stand with all other democratic countries to do whatever is necessary to prevent and remove threats to peace and the devastating scourge of terrorism."  
· House resolution:  
Expressing "New Zealand's strong resolve to work with all other countries in the international community to stamp out terrorism and swiftly to bring terrorist to justice."  
· Address at St Paul's cathedral commemorative service;  
"We resolve that we will stand against such acts of terror, and demand that those responsible be brought to justice."
