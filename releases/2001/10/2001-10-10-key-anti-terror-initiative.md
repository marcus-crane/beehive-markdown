New Zealand and its partners in the New Agenda initiative reaffirmed their determination to pursue global nuclear disarmament in New York yesterday.

The seven New Agenda countries (Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa and Sweden) issued a fresh statement at the United Nations.

“Just last year we saw a new determination to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons. For the first time the five nuclear weapon states gave an unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals," says Disarmament Minister, Matt Robson.

“They recognise that nuclear weapons cannot be allowed to exist indefinitely. Today more than ever we are aware of the terrible risks of nuclear weapons in the wrong hands.”

"But we are concerned at challenges to long term disarmament. We must now re-double our efforts to ensure that no steps are taken that would undermine the determination of the international community to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

"It is hoped that the United States will take a leadership role and bring the countries that have stayed outside the disarmament framework, into the tent," says Matt Robson.
