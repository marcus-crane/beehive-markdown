The newly-established $35 million Tertiary Education Strategic Change Fund gives public tertiary institutions the ability to make changes which respond to the Tertiary Education Strategy coming into place next year, says Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey.

A new tertiary education funding and regulatory environment is being introduced in 2003 to reshape New Zealand¡¦s tertiary education system. A Tertiary Education Strategy will be in place from next year and will place new demands on tertiary education providers. Steve Maharey said he has now written to tertiary institutions inviting applications for a share of the $35m one-off Fund and detailing the criteria that will be used to assess them.

¡§The need to reorient our tertiary education system to meet New Zealand¡¦s changing economic and social needs is urgent. The Fund offers an opportunity for institutions to respond to these challenges.

¡§In order to receive funding, institutions will be required to demonstrate how the changes they want to make enable them to:  
„h contribute to New Zealand¡¦s social, environmental and economic development;  
„h respond to the challenges of a new strategically-focused tertiary education sector; and,  
„h build on their current position.  
Applications will also need to describe achievable and measurable success criteria and be supported by a clear business plan.

¡§Total funding worth 34.7m (comprising $18.1m in operating expenditure and $16.6m for capital expenditure) will be divided proportionally amongst successful applicants on the basis of their student roll.

¡§The Fund has been extremely well received by the tertiary sector with Vice-Chancellor¡¦s Committee Chair James McWha describing it as a ¡¥very, very good outcome¡¦,¡¨ Steve Maharey said.
