Industry and Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton today called on employers in Tairawhiti, Waikato, Auckland, Southland and the Lower North Island to take on students for skilled jobs over summer under the new Snap student employment initiative.

“All around the country I hear employers say that they are struggling to get the skilled people they need. This is a chance to not only invest in and encourage New Zealand talent, but businesses can market themselves as future employers and find top quality future staff.

“I will be writing to some employers in the pilot regions asking them to consider hiring a student for special projects such as developing a marketing plan, work on a web site, or reviewing personnel policies,” said Jim Anderton.

Some samples of job descriptions are available on the website and employers wanting guidelines on student projects can look at these on www.snap.govt.nz.  
Employers can register jobs with http://www.snap.govt.nz/employresources.htm

Snap will be piloted in Auckland, Hamilton, Gisborne and Invercargill, by Student Job Search. There will be a pilot targeted to Maori in Canterbury as well as two industry-specific projects; tourism in Northland, and manufacturing in the lower half of the North Island. There are two additional regional matched projects facilitated by Economic Development Agencies in South Auckland and Waitakere.

“Many employers will be contacted by the agencies running pilots, and a flyer will appear in business post boxes providing details of the programme.

“The matched project pilots will provide students with the opportunity to undertake a project in a business setting, while enabling a small and medium enterprise to obtain skills that it may have been unable to find.

“The one-year trial starts with a national information drive to help employers think of smart ways they can use a tertiary student to help their business grow.

“We need to encourage talent and innovation. Our students are an excellent place to start,” said Jim Anderton.
