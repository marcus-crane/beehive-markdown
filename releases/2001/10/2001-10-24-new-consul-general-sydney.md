Career diplomat Peter Heenan will be New Zealand’s next Consul-General in Sydney, Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced today.

Mr Heenan is currently Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s Australia Division, a position he has held for the past five years. He also worked in the High Commission in Canberra, and had considerable experience working with New Zealand business and tourism interests on the West Coast of the United States, as Consul-General in Los Angeles in the mid 1980s.

“Mr Heenan brings extensive background to this important relationship,” Mr Goff said.

“He will work closely with the High Commissioner in Canberra to promote all aspects of New Zealand’s bilateral relationship in Australia, with specific accreditation to New South Wales and Queensland.

“These two States are major trading and business partners for New Zealand. As Sydney positions itself to be a leading business and financial centre for the Asia/Pacific region, its importance to New Zealand has grown significantly,” Mr Goff said.

About 250,000 New Zealanders live in NSW and Queensland and the States attract more Kiwi visitors than any other overseas destination. Consular services supporting these New Zealanders is an integral part of the Consulate-General’s work.

In addition to assignments in Canberra and Los Angeles Mr Heenan has also served as High Commissioner in Apia, Deputy Head of Mission in Paris. He has also held postings in Bangkok and Paris.

Mr Heenan takes up his new position in Sydney next April, replacing current Consul-General Priscilla Williams.
