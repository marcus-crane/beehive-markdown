“Huge potential for more jobs and economic growth,” is how Industry and Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton described the textile, clothing and footwear industry, following this industry’s first steering group meeting today at Vogel House.

"Today I was pleased to sit with key industry representatives and hear them share their ideas. We looked at information on how to create jobs and started to identify ways in which the industry can move ahead by removing barriers to growth.

"Today’s meeting was hugely encouraging as it shows this is clearly a dynamic and competitive sector.

“Textiles, clothing and footwear rely on two of our strongest competitive advantages; innovation and creativity. These industries have a bright future and the Labour/Alliance Coalition Government is committed to assisting industry to create growth.

“Textile, clothing and footwear will benefit from the whole-of-government approach where all Government agencies work closely together with industry to provide solutions.

“Like both of the Wood Processing and Manufacturing Industry Steering Groups this partnership between government and industry will now allow us to develop an action plan of what has to be done now, this week, this month, and this year.

“The Labour/Alliance Coalition Government is making this industry a priority along with wood processing, manufacturing, creative industries and tourism, as they are job-rich, high-skill, high-value export industries with the potential for rapid growth," said Jim Anderton.
