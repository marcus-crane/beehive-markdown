The future of Ohakea airbase is secure and there may be new opportunities for the communities that support the base, the Minister of Defence Mark Burton said.

"This is a difficult time, especially for the 30 civilian staff at Ohakea who have been made redundant and the 7 uniformed personnel for whom positions could not be found. A further 59 personnel at Ohakea have taken voluntary discharge and a number of others have sought early release.

"Comprehensive measures have been put in place to assist these personnel, financially and otherwise," Mark Burton said.

"Ohakea airbase remains a key New Zealand Defence Force asset. The planned $20 million upgrade of the runway at Ohakea will proceed and the Iroquois helicopters of 3 Squadron are scheduled to move to Ohakea next year.

"Further consolidation of Air Force resources at Ohakea is a possibility, along with the development of Ohakea as a joint military/civilian base," Mark Burton said.

"It is important to remember that modernising and re-equipping the RNZAF is a crucial commitment made by this government.

"We are upgrading or replacing the ageing Iroquois helicopters. The C130 Hercules and Boeing-727s will also be replaced or upgraded. The P-3 Orions will get modern equipment upgrades. A significant amount of money will be invested in our airforce.

"This investment is likely to offer opportunities for the Rangitikei region," Mark Burton said.
