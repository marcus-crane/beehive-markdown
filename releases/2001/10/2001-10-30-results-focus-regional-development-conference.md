“Delegates who attend the Regional Development Conference to be held in Rotorua at the end of November must leave the event committed to creating the conditions for businesses to create jobs”, Jim Anderton says.

Jim Anderton, Industry and Regional Development Minister urged regional leaders to ensure that they send people to November’s Regional Development Conference who can make a difference, “the more key players we have the more of a difference this conference will make.”

About 500 delegates from throughout New Zealand are expected to attend the conference – “Regional Development - A Springboard for Growth” – which is being held in Rotorua on 28 and 29 November.

“To achieve this objectives the Conference must have lively and positive discussions which are practically focussed and share knowledge and ideas,” said Jim Anderton.

“For New Zealand to reach its maximum potential all our regions need to make the most of their unique regional resources. All New Zealanders need to see strong regions as an integral part of a vibrant national economy.”

A feature of the conference will be local heroes who will present their success stories and the challenges they faced along the way:
