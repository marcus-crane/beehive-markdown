October 12 2001 - Embargoed Until 10 am October 12Media Statement  
Transport Minister Mark Gosche today announced a review of New Zealand's child restraint standards.

Speaking at the launch of the Waitakere City Council "Safety Warrior" programme today Mr Gosche said that the review would ensure New Zealand had the best possible restraint standards.

"As well as getting more children buckled in to cars we need to be making sure they are in the right restraints, installed and used correctly. We also need to make it easier for parents to choose the right restraint."

"The review by the Ministry of Transport and the Land Transport Safety Authority will examine the present standards for child restraints, as well as the way child restraints are secured within vehicles."

“This is important because while 80 per cent of our ‘under-5s’ are now being restrained in cars, a Dunedin study last year found an alarming 65 per cent of child seats are likely to be incorrectly installed or used."

The Safety Warrior programme launched by the Minister today expects to recruit 15,000 school children in West Auckland to promote injury prevention.

“Being a ‘safety warrior’ is about kids thinking smart to keep themselves, and others, injury free. Like remembering to ‘buckle up’ for every car trip, choosing to wear a helmet for every bike rid and considering the safety of younger brothers and sisters,” Mr Gosche said.

“Currently, one child passenger under the age of five is killed on our roads nearly every month in New Zealand – two children a month if children up to the age of 14 are included. And that is only the tip of the iceberg. Four hundred children a year are hospitalised as a result of being passengers in cars that crash.”

‘We need to do better at getting the one in five children who are still unrestrained, safely buckled in. And we need to all drive safely - unfortunately factors such as drink driving, excessive speed, failure to give way and inattention all continue to play a role in killing children on our roads.”

The launch of the ‘Safe Warriors’ programme coincides with the launch today of New Zealand’s national child safety week. All around the country this week, car seat checking clinics are being run to help families check their car seats, booster seats and restraints.

“I am pleased that both the Land Transport Safety Authority and road safety coordinators around the country are so actively involved in the Week,” Mr Gosche said.

"This government is committed to road safety. Last year we doubled the funding available for community based initiatives such as ‘Safety Warriors’. Currently we are considering a package of road safety initiatives to significantly reduce our road toll by 2010. Finding ways to improve the safety of our most vulnerable road users, such as children, will be part of this.”
