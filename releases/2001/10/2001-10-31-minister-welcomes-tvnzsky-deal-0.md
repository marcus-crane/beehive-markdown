Broadcasting Minister Marian Hobbs says she’s pleased TVNZ and Sky Television have reached agreement for TV ONE and TV2 to be available on the Sky digital platform.

“I’ve been concerned that TVNZ risked losing viewers because Sky customers couldn’t access One and Two easily via the hand-held remote,” she said.

“In the longer term however my concern is still to ensure all New Zealanders have access to the choice and opportunities that digital can offer.

"This requires setting a direction that supports open access and open standards for one set top box for consumers.

"These matters are being investigated and considered at the moment.”
