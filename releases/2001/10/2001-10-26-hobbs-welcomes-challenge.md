Wellington Central MP Marian Hobbs says she will definitely be seeking the Labour Party electorate nomination for next year's General Election and is confident of being returned to Parliament.

"The National Party clearly acknowledges the threat I pose to their ever regaining the seat because they've devoted most of their press release, announcing the calling of nominations, to a personal attack on me," Marian Hobbs said.  
"As I have moved around the electorate support for National has clearly not  
been evident.  
"I love being the MP for Wellington Central and look forward to working  
with my electorate team and supporters to ensure Labour retains government."
