The government has committed $2.9 million to provide modified homes in the community for former residents of the Kimberley Centre and Braemar Hospital, Housing Minister Mark Gosche and Disability Issues Minister Ruth Dyson announced today.  
The funding will be for 14 community houses this financial year. Housing New Zealand is expected to acquire and modify 93 community houses in total for the former residents over the next four years.  
"The first 14 houses will be for those people who are expected to be resettled this financial year. The houses will provide 24-hour care and support for the residents," Mr Gosche said.

Minister for Disability Issues Ruth Dyson announced last month that approximately 375 residents of the Kimberley Centre in Levin were expected to be resettled in the community over the next four years.

Eighty residents of Nelson's Braemar Hospital are to be resettled over a 14- month period beginning next year.

“Caring for people with disabilities in large institutions is no longer appropriate,” Ms Dyson said. “The residents of Kimberley and Braemar have the right to live in the community like everyone else, with the necessary support to meet their personal, medical and social needs.”

Decisions on further community houses for the residents will be made next year.
