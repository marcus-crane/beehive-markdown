The deadline for submissions on proposed changes to Maori authority tax laws is being extended by three weeks, to 9 November, Revenue Minister Michael Cullen and Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia announced today.

The proposals are part of the discussion document "Taxation of Maori Organisations", published in August.

If implemented, the changes will affect a wide range of Maori authorities, including marae, runanga, land trusts, trust boards and incorporations.

"The discussion document has raised a great deal of interest in the Maori community," the Ministers said. "Over 1000 people attended workshops held throughout the country to help the consultation process. Many at the workshops asked for more time for making submissions on the proposals."

"The Government is pleased to extend the deadline. We encourage all those who are interested to express their views," the Ministers said.

"Taxation of Maori Organisations" is available at Bennett's Government Bookshops and on the web sites of the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, at www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz and the Ministry of Maori Development, at www.tpk.govt.nz under "News and events".
