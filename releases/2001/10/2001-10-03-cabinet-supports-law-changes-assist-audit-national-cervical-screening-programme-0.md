Health Minister Annette King says the Government has given the go-ahead to proposed new law changes to implement key recommendations of the Gisborne Cervical Screening Inquiry.

Mrs King says the Cabinet has approved changes to legislation to support the monitoring, audit and evaluation of the National Cervical Screening Programme (NCSP), following the receipt of 101 submissions on proposed changes to Section 74A of the Health Act 1956.

The changes would allow information from the NCSP Register to be available for the purpose of monitoring, auditing and evaluating the effectiveness of the programme, she said. "The changes also include provision for women to ‘opt off’ the programme completely, ensuring their register information is not used if they so choose.

“Under strict security guidelines, selected auditors will be able to access identifiable information held on the Register for auditing the programme. Auditors will be required to keep all personal information confidential and secure.

“I believe women will see the benefits of remaining on the programme. With the new consent arrangements for accessing clinical records in place, and in light of the emphasis the Gisborne inquiry gave to the obvious need for monitoring, auditing and evaluation, it is unlikely many women will leave the programme.

“The changes will meet several key recommendations of the Gisborne report, but consent will still need to be sought to access clinical records of women. As part of an audit of women with invasive cervical cancer, those who have opted off the programme may also be contacted for consent to clinical records," Mrs King said.

“The message in submissions was clear. Three-quarters of submissions (74 percent) were opposed to giving access to clinical records without consent. Accordingly we have developed a process which recognises these concerns while giving us the best possible framework for conducting effective programme monitoring, audit and evaluation. The Cabinet has accepted this process."

Mrs King said the Gisborne report in April called the changes to the legislation 'by far the most important change which is required to make the National Cervical Screening Programme fully effective'.  
“But it was important to take into account the strong views among consumer and women’s groups and some health professionals who were against the proposal.

“There has been significant progress in strengthening the National Cervical Screening Programme in the past two years. These changes will improve the legislative base on which the programme is built, in turn providing the best programme possible for New Zealand women, taking into account privacy concerns over access to clinical records.”

The changes to section 74A of the Health Act are intended to be included as part of a comprehensive bill which will address a number of safety and quality issues across the health sector.

The changes will not effect information on the NCSP Register relating to Maori women, which is managed by the National Kaitiaki Group. Preparations have begun for a consultation process on the Kaitiaki regulations, which will take place with Maori women and their families early in 2002.

Steady progress is continuing to be made in implementing the recommendations of the Gisborne Inquiry. The fifth monthly report by the Ministry of Health is now available on the Inquiry website (www.csi.org.nz).
