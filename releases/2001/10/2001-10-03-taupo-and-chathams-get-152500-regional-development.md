Taupo and the Chatham Islands are each taking another step toward guaranteeing a strong economic future.

Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton today welcomed Taupo and the Chatham Islands joining Industry New Zealand's Regional Partnership Programme and receiving $92,500 and $60,000 respectively to develop regional economic development plans.

"This is excellent news for both regions," said Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton.

"I know that in both regions the partnerships will have significant benefit to local people through the Regional Partnerships Programme.

"I visited both regions recently and was impressed with progress in both regions.

"The ideas that each plan needs will come from local people committed to making their regional economy work," said Jim Anderton.

The partnership grants can be up to $100,000 for regional plans and up to $100,000 for making sure the plans can be implemented (capability building). Funding of up to $2 million per region is available to contribute to major regional initiatives that come out of the strategies developed in the first two stages.

Nineteen regions have secured grants in the previous four rounds of the Regional Partnership Programme. This round sees the total already committed to regional partnerships reach $2,513,817 for 21 regions.
