Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Phil Goff confirmed that members of the Government have been briefed by the United States on the evidence which currently exists linking al Qaeda and Bin Laden to the World Trade Centre and Pentagon terrorist attacks.

“I have seen the material. The briefing was on a confidential basis so we are unable to go into the details, but the material is consistent with al Qaeda and Bin Laden being involved with the terrorist attacks.

“It is also consistent with past terrorist attacks orchestrated by Bin Laden such as the East African embassies.

No organisation other than Bin Laden has the resources and organisation capable of perpetrating these attacks,” said Mr Goff.
