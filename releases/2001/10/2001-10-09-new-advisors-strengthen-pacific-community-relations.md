New Advisors To Strengthen Pacific Community Relations  
Three new community advisors have been appointed by the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs to help Pacific communities more effectively access government services and agencies, Pacific Island Affairs Minister Mark Gosche announced today

The new advisors, who met with the Minister today as part of their induction programme, will help inform Pacific communities of government services and help them access those services, Mr Gosche said.

“These community advisors will be important in building closer relationships between the Ministry and our Pacific communities.”

One of their key roles will be to help assist in monitoring the implementation of the Ministry’s Pacific Capacity Building strategy.

“Their backgrounds mean they all have a good knowledge of government processes and how to work with state sector agencies and officials. They will help to improve the ongoing relationships between Pacific peoples and government agencies.”

Wayne Brown (Niuean) will be based in Auckland. (Lauano Ati Ilaoa, who is Samoan) will be in Wellington and Tala Kele (Tokelaun) will be in Christchurch.

Two other advisors are to be appointed.
