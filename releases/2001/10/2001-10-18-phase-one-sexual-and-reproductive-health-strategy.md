Health Minister Annette King says New Zealand must be open about sexuality and sexual practices.

Mrs King today launched phase one of the country’s first comprehensive Sexual and Reproductive Health Strategy, and said the Government shared community concern about issues such as increasing rates of teenage and unwanted pregnancy, abortions and sexually transmissible infections (STIs).

“The Government has a responsibility to help ensure positive sexual health. Sexual and reproductive health providers provide quality services, but for many years now they have been saying that they have problems,” Mrs King said.

“Services are fragmented. There are huge gaps, such as a lack of specialist services in the South Island. There is disharmony between providers, encouraged by a competition for dollars. The sector as a whole lacks strategic direction and the leadership to move forward.”

Phase one was designed to provide that leadership, she said. “It will provide the overall direction the Government wishes to take. The second phase will be developing action plans to address issues such as reducing STIs, HIV/AIDS, and unwanted/unintended pregnancies, and maximising the health of at-risk groups like Mäori and Pacific peoples. Action plans will start to emerge early next year.”

Mrs King said she acknowledged that a strategy document “will not provide the instant answers some seek to long-term problems in sexual and reproductive health. The Government can’t stop people having unsafe sex, or ensure that all pregnancies are planned. We can provide leadership, however, working through issues with the sector and with New Zealanders.”

Other sectors, such as education, families and communities, could also contribute to the improvement of sexual and reproductive health, she said.

“Positive sexuality and sexual and reproductive health affects individuals and communities differently. One model does not fit all. Maori, young people and disabled people, for example, all have issues specific to them. This Strategy will provide the Ministry of Health and District Health Boards with the basis to develop plans for specific services and to make consistent, thoughtful funding decisions.

“Sexual and reproductive health is a complex area, requiring a long-term approach. It is no good simply dictating strategies at a political level, something that has occurred in the past.

“This Strategy identifies four particularly important strategic approaches. Society needs to accept and value safer sex practices. We need to ensure individuals and groups have access to correct information about risks. We need comprehensive, affordable and accessible services. And we need accurate and consistent data so that we can address gaps in services.”

Mrs King paid tribute to the work of an Expert Sector reference Group who had provided advice to the Ministry during development of the Strategy.

Questions and answers

Question: Who is the Ministry of Health consulting as it develops the Strategy?

Answer: A broadly representative sector reference group was set up to provide expert advice. The group has 13 members:  
\* Dr Pippa MacKay (former chair, New Zealand Medical Association)  
\* Dr Rick Franklin (Clinical Director, Auckland Sexual Health Services;  
\* Association of Sexual Health Services)  
\* Kevin Hague (Director of NZ AIDS Foundation)  
\* Pania Ellison (Te Puawai Tapu)  
\* Ingi Hayward (Northland Health Peer Sexuality Education Programme)  
\* Fuimaono Karl Pulotu-Endemann (Pacific Consultant)  
\* Olivia Tusa (Hutt Valley Health)  
\* Alan Flemming (Principal, St Bernards School)  
\* Gillian Tasker (Christchurch College of Education)  
\* Catherine Healey (NZ Prostitutes Collective)  
\* Nigel Dickson (Dept of Preventative Medicine, Otago University)  
\* Gill Greer (Family Planning Association)  
\* Kitty Flannery (President, NZ Venerological Association)

Question: Does the Strategy cover all areas of sexual and reproductive health?

Answer: The action plans will focus on those people most likely to be in at risk situations, particularly young people, Maori and Pacific people, in the key areas of STI and HIV prevention and control, prevention of teen pregnancy and reducing unwanted/unintended pregnancy.

Question: How much money is currently being spent on sexual and reproductive health services?

Answer: The Government spent more than $26 million a year on sexual health services in 2000. We have extended access to free sexual health services and reduced fragmentation with a national contract for the Family Planning Association, and specific contracts in Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland.

There are a number of new services the Government has announced recently, including wider and easier access to the emergency contraceptive pill by allowing over the counter sales and free services for all under 22 year olds and Community Service Card holders at the Family Planning Association. The Government has also recognized virology as a health professional speciality by Order-In-Council.This increases the status of the work, and encourages young health professionals to view sexual health as a career option.

Question: Why do we need a sexual and reproductive health strategy?

Answer: Many providers offer sexual and reproductive health services, but not necessarily in a cooperative, non-fragmented way. There is no clear direction on services for the future. The Government has brought the sector together to develop a direction for the future. Previous attempts to provide such a direction have not involved the sector closely enough and have not been accepted by them. This time the Government is taking the necessary time to get it right.

Question: Didn't former Minister of Health Jenny Shipley release a sexual health strategy? What happened to that?

Answer: She released a strategic document in 1996 when she was Minister of Health. It was largely written by her office, and never enjoyed wide sector buy-in. Funding she committed continues in baseline funding for Vote Health.

Question: Has this strategy been influenced by international research and agreements?

Answer: International research and models of practice have been included in the document. It also adheres to international agreements that New Zealand is a signatory to, including:  
\* Charter for the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women  
\* Conference on Population and Development Programme on Action Second Five Years  
\* United Nations HIV/AIDS Declaration  
\* Beijing+5 Platform  
\* United Nations Convention on the Rights of Children.

Question: Why does the prevalence of STIs in New Zealand appear to be rising?

Answer: There is much debate about the causes of the current increase in reported cases of chlamydia and gonorrhoea. There is no national data collected on STI prevalence, but information we have indicates infections are increasing. The reasons are complex and may include changing behaviour and community attitudes to sexual expression, alcohol and drug use, lack of knowledge of, or access to, methods of protection, and a growing mass of infected people.

Question: What are the priorities when in sexual and reproductive health?

Answer: The principles, contained in the New Zealand Health Strategy, include:  
\* Offering sexual and reproductive health services as a public health service.  
\* Providing a comprehensive, free, specialist sexual health service close to the community.  
\* Ensuring at risk groups have access to effective education programmes.  
\* Controlling HIV/AIDS as a sexually transmitted infection.  
\* Emphasising effective and available services for Maori, Pacific peoples and young people.
