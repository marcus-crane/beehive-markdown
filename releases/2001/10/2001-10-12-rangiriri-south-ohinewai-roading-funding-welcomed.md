12 October 2001Media Statement

Transport Minister Mark Gosche today welcomed the news that funding approval had been given to build 10km of four lane State Highway from Rangiriri to South of Ohinewai.

Funding for the $26 million project was announced today by Transfund New Zealand and Transit New Zealand.

Construction is expected to start immediately.

"This has always been an area with an extremely high accident rate. In the last five years there have been 10 fatalities and many serious accidents. It is therefore excellent news that construction has been given the go ahead."

"This is one of the busiest stretches of highway in New Zealand. Anyone who drives regularly between Auckland and Hamilton will welcome this news."

The long term plan is to extend the Waikato Expressway from Mercer to Cambridge.
