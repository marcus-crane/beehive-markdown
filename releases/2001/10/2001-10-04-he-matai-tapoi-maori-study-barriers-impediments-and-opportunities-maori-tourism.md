The Government is seeking feedback on the report He Mätai Täpoi Mäori, which looks at the barriers, impediments and opportunities for Mäori in tourism.

He Mätai Täpoi Mäori is an attempt to quantify Mäori involvement across the spectrum of the industry, as business owners and operators, as investors, employers and employees. Mäori Affairs Minister Hon Parekura Horomia and Tourism Minister Hon Mark Burton have now received the report.

Both Ministers believe that He Mätai Täpoi Mäori will generate wide debate and encourage all interested parties to have their say.

"Issues identified include difficulties in securing finance, low turnover, variable standards of product quality, lack of consultation and the lack of preparedness by some Mäori applicants for investment. By identifying the issues, we are already part way to solving them."

Mr Horomia said in an internationally competitive environment where tourists are looking for unique overseas experiences, Mäori are New Zealand’s point of difference.

"Therefore, whether as business operators, investors or employees, Mäori have an important role to play in the future development of our tourism industry. The challenge is to create an environment where Mäori can grow as active participants in the sector."

Tourism Minister Mark Burton said a number of the recommendations from this report reinforce conclusions in the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2010.

"Therefore the consultation process over the next month is timely. Feedback will enhance the overall tourism strategy and add value to the tourism industry. I look forward to receiving the results."

The Office of Tourism and Sport and Te Puni Kökiri will now seek feedback from a range of stakeholders on He Mätai Täpoi Mäori. This process will be completed by 2 November 2001.

Backgrounder

The Minister of Mäori Affairs and Minister of Tourism commissioned the He Mätai Täpoi Mäori project in March 2000.

He Mätai Täpoi Mäori means a study of Mäori in tourism.

Te Puni Kökiri and the Office of Tourism and Sport formed a partnership to complete the report with the following key objectives:  
 Determining the extent of Mäori involvement in the tourism sector and comparing this with non-Mäori involvement  
 Identifying barriers and impediments which are unique to Mäori and which inhibit Mäori involvement and performance in the tourism industry  
 Identifying opportunities for Mäori involvement in the tourism industry in employment and business development and recommending policies for capacity building and improving involvement and commercial performance.

The steps involved in the project included establishing a project team, establishing a Mäori Tourism Business Committee for peer review of the study, qualitative and quantitative research, reviewing case studies and the preparation of two preliminary reports.

Interviews were conducted with both Mäori and non-Mäori tourism operators, financial institutions (including trading and investment banks), economic development agencies and relevant government agencies. In addition over 150 tourism businesses participated in a short form questionnaire.

Key findings were based around Employment; Mäori Tourism Businesses; Mäori Views of the Tourism Industry; Investment and Finance Community Views; Demand for Mäori Tourism Product: Inbound Tour Operator Views; Key Barriers and Impediments. A selection of some of the key findings are presented below:  
 Mäori employees are less likely to have a tourism related qualification  
 Mäori tourism businesses interviewed reported generally low turn over - $50,000 - $350,000 per annum  
 Mäori tourism businesses were twice as likely to sell Mäori tourism product  
 Mäori consider it difficult to raise finance for tourism projects from banks  
 Interviewees in the investment and finance community considered tourism to be a high risk industry, though Mäori tourism projects were not viewed as more high risk then non-Mäori ones  
 Mäori applicants for investment banking are often ill prepared eg. Lacking feasibility studies or business plans  
 As at December 2000, Mäori performances were one of the top 15 attractions sighted by international visitors  
 93% of the 28 inbound tour operators surveyed sold Mäori tourism product but demand was considered to be average or low compared to other product on offer  
 Inbound tour operators expressed concern about the lack of new product, limited variety of product, variability in quality and uncompetitive pricing  
 Key barriers for Mäori included difficulty in securing debt and equity finance, lack of training and education of Mäori in tourism and tourism related careers, lack of consultation of Mäori in tourism related careers

The major recommendations based on the research were:  
 Develop and implement a market research programme for Mäori tourism  
 Develop and implement a Mäori tourism strategy  
 Develop and implement a broad reaching capacity building campaign  
 Facilitate more effective consultation between Mäori and government  
 Facilitate and increase the representation of Mäori interests within tourism bodies  
 Facilitate improved access to finance and other assistance for existing and potential Mäori tourism businesses  
 Facilitate access to more tightly defined businesses skills and tourism training courses  
 Protect intellectual and cultural property  
 Facilitate Mäori self-determination  
 Facilitate Mäori product development to meet market needs
