This year’s APEC meeting in Shanghai will provide a key forum for developing international co-operation in response to terrorism, Prime Minister Helen Clark said today.

Helen Clark will be in Shanghai from 19 to 21 October. She will address the CEOs’ summit, and be one of the lead speakers at the leaders’ retreat on the future of APEC.

Helen Clark said that along with almost half the other leaders who will be present in Shanghai, this will be President Bush’s first attendance at an APEC meeting.

“The presence of so many new leaders helps to symbolise the new challenges facing the APEC economies since our last gathering in Brunei.

“Two years ago, in Auckland, APEC provided a vehicle for addressing the situation in East Timor. This year I expect we will both deliver a political message  
against terrorism, and discuss also specific proposals for action on  
money laundering, aviation security, energy security and customs  
enforcement.

"Another political message I hope APEC can deliver is on the importance of  
launching a new WTO Round, in order to reinforce confidence in the world economy and stimulate growth.

“With the critical WTO Ministerial in Doha scheduled to take place three weeks after APEC, New Zealand will be working with like-minded economies to achieve the strongest possible impetus for the new round from the APEC leaders' meeting.

"Promoting sustainable growth will be a key element of this year's  
leaders' declaration.

"I want to emphasize New Zealand's perspective on environmental and social sustainability, and ensure that APEC's current agenda on sustainable development links into the World Summit on Sustainable Development to be held in Brazil next year.”

"I will be reiterating New Zealand's support for the inclusion of the region’s unions in dialogue with APEC.

“All countries appreciate the value which has been added by APEC's Business Advisory Council (ABAC); and we are urge that an inclusive approach also be taken to organized labour representatives.”

Helen Clark said she is particularly looking forward to meeting the leaders attending APEC for the first time, including President Bush and the Indonesian President, Megawati Sukarnoputri.
