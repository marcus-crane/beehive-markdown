“I am profoundly sorry that this tragedy has happened and first want to express my sympathy to the families of the two girls. I also feel for the teachers, parents and other students who were on this outdoor activity.

“The Minister of Education, Trevor Mallard, was informed the girls were missing before he left the country, and immediately had his office contact Water Safety New Zealand.

“I understand Water Safety New Zealand is sending somebody down to Hamner to assist.

“The Ministry of Education is also in Hamner assisting the people involved. The Specialist Education Services Traumatic Incident Team has been dispatched and are on their way to Hamner," Steve Maharey said.
