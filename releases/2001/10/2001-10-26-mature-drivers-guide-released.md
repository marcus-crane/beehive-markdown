October 26 2001Media Statement

The 34,000 drivers aged over 75 on New Zealand’s roads now have a guide advising them on road rules, the licensing process and the road environment.

Transport Minister Mark Gosche launched “The Positive Guide for Mature Road Users” in Auckland today.

“The guide eases the worries many older drivers have about sitting the older driving test by explaining the process and offering straight-forward advice about what’s involved,” Mark Gosche said.

It also offers advice and support for people considering retiring from driving.

The guide is designed to compliment “Safe with Age” courses, free classes run by mature drivers to help others drive safely.

“It is based on a very successful booklet produced by the Kapiti Coast District Council. As word of that booklet spread requests came from all over New Zealand.”

Copies of the guide are available from the Land Transport Safety Authority, “Safe with Age” course facilitators, driver licensing agents, libraries, medical practices, Grey Power and Age Concern.

“The key message is that ability, not age, determines safe driving,” said Mr Gosche.
