Associate Commerce Minister Laila Harré says residential building has not been excluded from the Construction Contracts Bill.

Clarifying comments made in the New Zealand Herald this morning, Laila Harré said residential construction contracts are treated just like any other construction contract, and are subject to the same provisions of the Bill.

"If a block of flats is being built this is treated just like any other commercial construction contract."

This means that pay when paid and pay if pay clauses are illegal, and sub-contractors will retain the right to suspend work if head contractors do not pay them.

They will also have access to the fast track adjudication service, and be covered by the default regime. This means that property developers must make progress payments for work completed unless an alternative contractual arrangement has been made.

"It is only contracts with residential occupiers, that is those living in the premises, that are treated differently," Laila Harré said.

"The application of the Bill to a contract between a residential occupier and their head contractor is limited. Its application to the contract between contractor and sub-contractor is not."

The reason for this is that homeowners who enter into contracts with contractors tend to lack knowledge and experience of the construction industry.

"This means a homewoner would have been at a clear disadvantage if, for example, a sub-contractor was in a position to make a claim over their property due to non-payment by a head contractor.

"It was considered fair that a homeowner who has paid everything they owe should not be threatened with losing their home in this situation."

The New Zealand Construction Contracts Bill does more to protect residential owner/occupiers than the legislation in New South Wales and the United Kingdom on which it was modelled.

"We have extended rights of access to the fast track adjudication service to homeowners to ensure that they too have a quick and inexpensive way of resolving the genuine disputes that sometimes arise around construction contracts."
