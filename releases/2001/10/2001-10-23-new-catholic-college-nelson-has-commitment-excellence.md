State-of-the-art buildings, high quality equipment, an internet café and an e-mail address for every student are among the attractions at New Zealand’s newest secondary school.

The Catholic co-educational school Garin College opens in January and is located in Richmond, Nelson.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard today signed the integration agreement for the school, under which the state will pay the cost of the school’s teaching staff and operational costs while the school board is responsible for the property.

The college is named after French priest and Nelson pioneer Father Antoine Garin, who started four Catholic schools in the region between 1850 and 1889. He is remembered by the Catholic community as the “Apostle of Education”.

The establishment board of trustees for Garin College says the school will provide quality education against a background of religious observance and instruction. It will emphasise the values of inclusiveness, commitment, dignity, excellence, environment, justice and gospel. The mission statement focuses on a commitment to excellence.

Trevor Mallard says the previous lack of a Catholic secondary school in the upper South Island has meant parents wanting a Catholic education for year 9-13 children have had to look as far away as Wellington, Christchurch or beyond.

The establishment board has strong links with all of the Catholic primary schools in Nelson, Marlborough and Buller, and also expects to draw pupils from elsewhere in the South Island. The school has residential facilities for up to 60 students which can be expanded if necessary.

Garin College will have about 320 students when it opens, and already has a waiting list for non-preference (non-Catholic) students who can fill up to 10% of the college’s intake. The college expects to reach its maximum roll of 670 within three years.
