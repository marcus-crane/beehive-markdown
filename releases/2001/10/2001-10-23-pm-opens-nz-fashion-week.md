Prime Minister Helen Clark today opened the L’Oreal New Zealand Fashion Week, saying the event will showcase New Zealand’s finest design talent to international fashion buyers, media, and designers.

“New Zealand’s fashion designers are building an international reputation for creativity and flair. They are translating innovative ideas into export dollars.

“Increasingly the New Zealand fashion industry is basing its future on the 'high-fashion' end of the market. The export success of New Zealand designers shows that the New Zealand fashion industry can do very well in large international markets.

“Textile, clothing and footwear exports in the year ended 31 March 2001 are provisionally estimated to be $522 million.

“In the 21st century, pragmatic partnerships for economic growth based on the skills and innovative ability of New Zealanders will transform our economy. Our export-oriented creative industries, like fashion and design, are part of our future upmarket economy delivering higher living standards to New Zealanders.”

Helen Clark said the government was actively working with the fashion industry. Two weeks ago, for example, she opened the Dunedin Fashion Incubator, which showcases the talents of that city’s young designers.

“The Dunedin Fashion incubator, backed by the government, is currently helping to support four designers, Christina Perriam, Cat Callanan, Shelley Tiplady, and Toni Darling.

“The Labour-Alliance Government over the past two years has been establishing firm partnerships with industries and businesses to drive economic growth.

“Jim Anderton and Paul Swain are currently in discussions with the textile, clothing and footwear industries about the establishment of an industry-government steering group to take the industry forward,” Helen Clark said.
