North Shore's bus rapid transit system is now a step closer as Transfund has approved funding for the design stage of the $35 million upgrade of the Esmonde Road interchange, Transport Minister Mark Gosche announced today.

The $2.5 million funding approval comes on the eve of the official start of the North Shore bus lane. The Minister will turn the first sod on the bus lane at a ceremony tomorrow (Saturday) morning.

The bus lane is the first part of the much longer term Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) network for the North Shore. The bus lane project includes widening the Esmonde Rd southbound motorway on-ramp and Shoal Bay bridge, as well as modifying the existing lighting and traffic signals at the Barrys Point Rd intersection. Work on this project is due to be completed in February.

The bus lane will later be incorporated into the proposed upgrade of the Esmonde Rd interchange, which will complement the BRT busway system.

"Currently this interchange is a significant bottleneck for traffic. It has south-facing ramps only and local traffic can travel only from west to east over the motorway. For many North Shore people changes to the interchange are well overdue."

The upgrade will provide an east-west link with Akoranga Drive and new north-facing motorway on-ramps. It will also incorporate an underpass to accommodate the bus lane. It is the design work for this phase that was approved by Transfund today, said Mr Gosche.

"The Bus Rapid Transit network is critical to getting Auckland moving again, so today's announcement brings that goal another step closer.

"We have already seen a significant increase in the number of Aucklanders using public transport in the last year because of patronage funding. There is the equivalent of an extra 2.9 million Aucklanders using the buses, trains and ferries since that scheme was introduced last year.

Hopefully with the new bus lane and the interchange upgrade to follow, that figure will continue to grow, relieving Auckland's traffic congestion."
