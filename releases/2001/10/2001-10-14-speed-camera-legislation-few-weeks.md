14 November 2001Media Statement

Legislation to fix the anomaly in the law regarding speed cameras is expected to be introduced into Parliament in the week of November 26, Transport Minister Mark Gosche said today.

“The aim is to get the legislation passed by Christmas to close this loophole,” Mr Gosche said.

The anomaly means that police can no longer rely on the courts accepting certificates of accuracy in some instances where speed lasers and static cameras operate in 50 km and certain local speed limited areas.

Until the legislation is passed the police will continue using mobile cameras in affected areas, Mr Gosche said.
