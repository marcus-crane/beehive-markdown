Stout Research Centre director Dr Lydia Wevers has been appointed as a member of the Arts Board of Creative New Zealand, Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Judith Tizard, announced today.

Dr Wevers' appointment fills an extraordinary vacancy that arose when Dame Fiona Kidman resigned in August.

“I want to acknowledge the contribution of Dame Fiona Kidman who recently tendered her resignation from the Arts Board of Creative New Zealand. Dame Fiona’s experience and knowledge will be missed”, said Judith Tizard.

Dr Lydia Wevers is the Director of the Stout Research Centre at Victoria University of Wellington. She was awarded a Master of Philosophy in English at St Anne’s College, Oxford, and completed her Doctorate of Philosophy in English at Victoria University of Wellington.

She has been Principal Researcher, History of Print Culture Project, on a Marsden Fund grant, as well as Senior Associate/Research Associate at the School of English Film and Theatre at Victoria University in Wellington. Dr Wevers is an editor, whose contribution to numerous literary works and literary conference presentations is valued in New Zealand and overseas.

"I look forward to the contribution that Dr Lydia Wevers will make to the Arts Board. I am confident that Creative New Zealand will be well served by her impressive range of skills and experience," said Judith Tizard.

The term of the appointment is effective from 1 October 2001 until 30 June 2003.

Creative New Zealand encourages, promotes and supports the arts in New Zealand. It has an Arts Council and two boards, the Arts Board and Te Waka Toi each with seven members.
