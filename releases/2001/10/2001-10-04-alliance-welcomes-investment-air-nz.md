Alliance leader and Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton is welcoming the Government’s decision to invest in Air New Zealand.

Jim Anderton was a member of the ad hoc Minister’s group dealing with the Air New Zealand issue.

“As the only parliamentary opponent at the time of the sale of Air New Zealand, there is rich irony in presiding over the re-purchase of the airline.

“This week I was to have been in Melbourne delivering an address about New Zealand’s experience of the privatisation of strategic publicly-owned assets.

“Air New Zealand was held up by the New Right as a glittering jewel in the Crown of asset sales. Yet in public ownership, Air New Zealand would almost certainly not have made its disastrous decision to buy Ansett Australia.

“As in rail, banking, telecommunications and energy, this Government is having to cope with the problems of a failed economic ideology.

“New Zealand’s economic development and tourism future hinges on maintaining a strong air transport carrier. The primary consideration for the Government in making the decision to invest is the national interest in maintaining an effective flag carrier.

“This has been a difficult time for Air New Zealand and its staff and I am hopeful the Coalition Government’s decision will provide the stability the airline needs for the future.

“I believe New Zealanders will warmly welcome the opportunity to travel with our national carrier,” Jim Anderton said.
