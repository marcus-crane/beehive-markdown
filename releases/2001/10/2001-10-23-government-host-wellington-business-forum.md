Business leaders from the Wellington region are attending a forum with government ministers to identify initiatives which will help improve New Zealand's economic performance.

The forum, to be held in Wellington tomorrow, follows on from business-to-government forums in Auckland, Christchurch, Hamilton, and Manukau City.

Prime Minister Helen Clark said the forums demonstrated the importance that the government attaches to developing and maintaining an ongoing dialogue with business to improve New Zealand's economic performance.

"The Wellington forum continues our pragmatic efforts to work with business to identify and implement policy initiatives which will help stimulate the economy and improve further the social climate in New Zealand.

"The feedback we have had from the previous forums indicates that business leaders appreciate the opportunity to have a say and contribute to policy development.

"The government acknowledges that there are limitations on what governments can achieve on their own. That is why we actively seek partnerships across the economic sectors and society as a whole," Helen Clark said.

The forum will be held in the Wellington Town Hall starting at 9.30am.

Ministers who will be attending include Helen Clark; Jim Anderton, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Economic Development and Industry and Regional Development; Michael Cullen, Minister of Finance and Revenue; Trevor Mallard, Minister of Education and Associate Minister of Finance; Pete Hodgson, Minister of Research, Science and Technology; and Paul Swain, Minister of Commerce, Communications and Information Technology.

Business leaders invited are from a range of sectors. Like the earlier forums, it will be a private function at which Chatham House rules will apply. There will be a media briefing after the forum.
