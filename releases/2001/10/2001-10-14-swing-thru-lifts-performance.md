Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton welcomed the success of Dunedin container crane company Swing Thru International, which has resulted in $100,000 Business Growth Fund grant from Industry New Zealand.

“Swing Thru is an innovative successful company and Industry New Zealand support will be more than returned to the community through company growth.

“The $100,000 will be used for a range of developments such as building stronger relationships with overseas companies, market exploration, and design work on integration of Swing Thru cranes with overseas built trailers.

“One major competitive advantage we have is that New Zealanders and our companies are highly innovative. Swing Thru has developed a world first with a crane that can work on either side of a train or truck carriage and which can lift a container in one movement.

"Many New Zealand businesses are innovative with excellent ideas, but many lack capacity and capital to expand and become larger. Grants like this which are matched dollar for dollar by the company, will make significant returns to our economy,” said Jim Anderton.

The Business Growth Service was set up by the Labour/Alliance Coalition Government as part of Industry New Zealand and helps businesses take a leap to the next stage in their development. The Service offers advice and also can provide up to $100,000 for specified measures that will make a significant difference.

The Business Growth Service is one of the range of measures promised in the Alliance pre election policy "Partnership 2000" which outlined practical ways to create jobs and make the New Zealand economy perform better.
