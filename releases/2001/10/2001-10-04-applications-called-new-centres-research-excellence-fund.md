Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey today announced applications are now being sought for the new $60m Centres of Research Excellence (CoRE) fund.

Funding was provided in the budget to establish specialist centres of research excellence which will operate at the leading edge of their field within the international research community. Operating expenditure of $40.6 million over four years, and one-off capital funding of $20m for investment in strategic research assets this financial year, has been allocated for the Fund. It is expected that 3-6 centres will receive funding.

Mr Maharey said that the Government has now signed off the selection criteria which will be used to determine which applications for funding will be successful.

"Research is fundamental to developing New Zealand as a knowledge society. The CoRE Fund is designed to encourage greater concentration and networking of high quality specialised research resources in the tertiary sector.

"The Government has now agreed on the selection criteria which will be used when deciding who should receive CoRE funding. To be successful, applications will have to demonstrate that they will support research that is of excellent (world class) quality, focused on New Zealand’s future economic and social development and that will lead to the transfer of knowledge.

"The selection process will be managed independently by the Royal Society of New Zealand.

“Centres of research excellence will be funded for up to 6 years, subject to a review at the mid-point. One-off capital payments can be made to centres in their first year of operation to contribute to the purchasing of strategic research assets.

"The centres of research excellence are to be primarily inter-institutional research networks with the researchers working together on a commonly agreed work programme. Any tertiary education institution can nominate itself as the ‘host’ institution for a centre.
