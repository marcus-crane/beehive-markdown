The Kaikohe Heartland Services Centre, opened today by Rural Affairs Minister Jim Sutton, is the fourth such centre to be opened since May.

Mr Sutton said the Heartland Services initiative was an important part of the Government's commitment to rural people.

"It also honours a promise that the Labour Party made in its 1999 manifesto to return Government services to rural New Zealand. This Government keeps its promises."

He said another 20 proposals for centres or outreach services were currently being worked on. The most advanced include proposals for service centres in Kaitaia, Pukekohe, Hawera, Kawerau, Opotiki, and Waipukurau.

There should be at least six more service centres opened before Christmas.

Mr Sutton said the Kaikohe centre opened today would eventually have two functions.

"Firstly it provides a one-stop shop for the public of the mid north of the district to access, face to face the services provided by Work & Income, Housing NZ Corp., ACC, Courts, Inland Revenue and Child, Youth & Family. Information on services offered by other Departments such as the Ministry of Agriculture & Forestry will also be available. And we hope to expand the range of participating Departments over time.

"Secondly, in recognition of the pressures being placed on community and particularly voluntary agencies, we expect that where space permits it will be possible to develop a community resource centre to support groups needing to access photocopying, fax, or training and meeting facilities."

Mr Sutton said the Kaikohe centre was based at the Work and Income Service premises. Not all the participating government agencies would be in the office every day and a Heartland Services co-ordinator will be employed five days a week between the hours of 10am and 2pm to provide a valuable link for the public and departments when the departmental representatives are not there.
