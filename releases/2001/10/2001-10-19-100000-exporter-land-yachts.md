Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton welcomed a $100,000 Industry New Zealand grant to International award-winning wind powered kart manufacturer, blokart International Ltd of Mt Maunganui.

blokeart has been given the Industry New Zealand Business Growth Fund grant to help manage booming export growth over the next four years.

“The award, from the Business Growth Fund, will be used to develop overseas distribution networks, Intellectual property protection, strategic business and marketing plan, operational processes and to help meet US and European regulatory requirements.

“blokart is using kiwi ingenuity and our growing competitive advantage in yacht building,” said Jim Anderton.

“The funding for these projects will be matched dollar-for-dollar by blokart, and the community will benefit from the jobs and economic activity this business is already creating.

blokart has won two prestigious international awards: The best brand new summer hardware product at ispo, Europe’s largest sports trade fair and the UK Soltex Innovations Award for outdoor leisure products.

The blokart, which fits into a 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.2 metre bag and weights 25 kg, sells in New Zealand, Australia, Chile and the UK. blokart does R&D locally, contracts out component manufacture throughout New Zealand. The company recently moved into larger premises to cope with demand.

The Business Growth Service was set up by the Labour/Alliance Coalition Government as part of Industry New Zealand and helps businesses take a leap to the next stage in their development. The Service offers advice and also can provide up to $100,000 for specified measures that will make a significant difference.

The Business Growth Service is one of the range of measures promised in the Alliance pre election policy ‘Partnership 2000’ which outlined practical ways to create jobs and make the New Zealand economy perform better.
