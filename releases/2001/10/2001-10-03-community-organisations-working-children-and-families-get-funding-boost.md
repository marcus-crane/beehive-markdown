Community social services working with children and families will receive additional funding this financial year, says Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey.

A report detailing the $71.6m in funding provided to over 1,750 individual organisations across the country in the 2000/01 financial year was tabled in Parliament this afternoon. Social service agencies received funding worth more than $71.6m in the year to June 2001. Services were provided by organisations operating nationwide including Women's Refuge, Barnardos and Relationship Services and many hundreds of small-community based organisations.

Mr Maharey said the Government has priortised support for children and families. Additional funding has been provided in the current financial year.

"An additional $3.8m was provided in the budget to compensate community providers for price increases they have faced in recent years on a case-by-case basis. Funding decisions will be announced later this month.

"In the year to June 2001 $71.639m in funding was provided to non-government organisations to deliver a wide range of preventative social services including family violence counselling and home parenting skills support.

"Key initiatives which began during the year include:

- provider and workforce development projects have been agreed with 145 Iwi/Maori organisations to build their ability to respond to the needs of their communities;
- enhanced funding was provided for family violence prevention services; and,li&gt;funding for budgeting services was increased.

"The Government won't solve community problems alone, but by working in partnership with community agencies we are rebuilding strong communities ready, willing and able to take on this responsibility," Steve Maharey said.
