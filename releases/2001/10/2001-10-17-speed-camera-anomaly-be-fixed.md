October 17 2001Media Statement

An anomaly in the law regarding speed cameras in certain areas will be corrected, Transport Minister Mark Gosche said today.

"The government is committed to correcting the problem. There is no doubt that a legislative fix is needed to correct this anomaly "

The anomaly means that police can no longer rely on the courts accepting certificates of accuracy in some instances where speed lasers and static cameras operate in 50 km and certain local speed limited areas.

"I am looking at the options for how we can get legislation introduced as soon as possible."

In the meantime, the Minister reminded motorists that the police would be using mobile cameras in affected areas.
