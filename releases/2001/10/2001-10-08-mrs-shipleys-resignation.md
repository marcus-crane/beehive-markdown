Prime Minister Helen Clark said tonight that outgoing National Party leader Mrs Shipley had been white-anted by Mr English and his cabal for some time.

“Mrs Shipley has soldiered on with an increasingly disloyal caucus. Her resignation now has come as no surprise.

“It is important to note that Mrs Shipley has served as a member of Parliament for 14 years and has held the highest political office in the land.

“Whatever one thinks of her politics, she has made her mark.

“The leadership change will not solve the National Party’s problems. It has yet to demonstrate that it has learned anything from its defeat at the 1999 election.

“As long as National articulates policies which were resoundingly rejected by voters two years ago, its prospects under any leader are dim,” Helen Clark said.
