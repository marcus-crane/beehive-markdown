Minister of Conservation Sandra Lee today announced that she has approved a permit for the Hastings District Council’s discharge of wastewater.  
She said the permit conditions were largely in line with the changes to the proposal approved by the Environment Court.  
“The council had agreed that by December 2, 2002 it would separate and milliscreen all separable industrial wastewater, and by 2007 it would have implemented a system to remove a significant proportion of the human waste from the flow.  
“The main change I have made to the current proposal is that the consent’s expiry date shifts from 2020 to 2014. This means the council will have to consider other options for dealing with wastewater by 2010.  
“I have reduced the consent period because the council’s proposal will not markedly improve effluent quality during the permit term. The shorter consent period allows the council enough time to examine options yet provides the community the opportunity to reconsider this important issue within an acceptable timeframe.  
“This decision also avoids imposing a greater financial burden on ratepayers and industry than what the council had agreed to in its latest proposal. I am aware that the cost to ratepayers was a major consideration for the council. It means that the council will have to look at options earlier, but this will not necessarily result in the introduction of a higher cost system,” Ms Lee said.  
“I want to encourage the cleaning up of our seas and see improvements in the quality of effluent discharges as an important part of this exercise,. Ms Lee said.  
The council’s existing permit expires next year, when the new Restricted Coastal Activity Permit will start. The council has established a committee with tangata whenua to carry out the requirement to consider other options, with community consultation due by 2010 and a draft plan due for release by 2012.
