Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton welcomed an important aid for regional economies with the release of a cultural tourism business development guide developed in Nelson

'Nelson's Story', funded by Industry New Zealand, profiles the region's tourism and cultural strengths. It will be used by local tourism organisations and marketing groups throughout New Zealand to create stronger local creative arts industries.

Jim Anderton said, "Developing each region's business and industry base is essential to the whole New Zealand economy.

"Each region has unique strengths and Nelson has a vital and very real art and creative advantage.

"The report ties in with the NZ Tourism Strategy 2010 which says our cultural products are one way New Zealand can be seen as different from the rest of the world," said Jim Anderton.

The report has been released to arts and cultural organisations, economic development agencies, regional tourism organisations and local government.

"Regional development is essential to our economy and that is why I have asked the Ministry of Economic Development to organise a major Regional Development Conference to be held in November this year. The Labour/Alliance Coalition Government is the first government in a generation to get involved as a partner in regional development, and in making sure our economy is developing in the right direction.

"Regions need to learn from each other and we want them to pass on their views to each other and the Government, " said Jim Anderton.

The Regional Development Conference is to be held in Rotorua on the 28th and 29th of November. More information is available from regdev@confer.co.nz, Fax:(03) 546 6020, phone:(03) 546 6022.
