Prime Minister Helen Clark received a personal briefing from US President George Bush last night on the campaign against terrorism.

Helen Clark said that President Bush had thanked New Zealand for its strong support for the campaign and in particular thanked the government for its offer of SAS troops for the campaign.

“President Bush was very well briefed about New Zealand and the contribution it is making, and was very complimentary about the reputation of the New Zealand SAS.

“The President emphasized that he saw the campaign against terrorism as long-term in nature. He sees it as being very different from the Gulf War of a decade ago. He also emphasized the multifaceted nature of the campaign, ranging from military action, diplomatic support, and intelligence gathering, to humanitarian aid and to financial measures to stop the flow of cash to terrorists and those who support them.

“President Bush struck me as a very determined man who is prepared to see this campaign through for the long term. He is also well aware of New Zealand’s friendship and support for the campaign.

“The President advised me that he expects to be at the APEC meetings in Shanghai in ten days’ time, and we looked forward to meeting each other there,” Helen Clark said.
