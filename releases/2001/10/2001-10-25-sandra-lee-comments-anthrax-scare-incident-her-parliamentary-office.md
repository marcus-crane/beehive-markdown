"I commend the authorities for their prompt response to this incident," Conservation Minister Sandra Lee said today.  
"I have been assured there will be a full investigation of the source of the white powdery substance that was in an envelope addressed to me at Parliament," she said.  
"As this incident is the subject of current Police inquiries, I will not be making any further comment."
