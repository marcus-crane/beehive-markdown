Function of the Maori Television Service  
The function of the Maori television service is to promote te reo Maori me nga tikanga Maori, through the provision of a high quality, cost effective Maori television service, in both Maori and English, which informs, educates and entertains, and in doing so, enriches New Zealand's society, culture and heritage.

Key principles for the establishment of the Maori Television Service

· That together, the Crown and Maori have a Treaty obligation in preserving, protecting and promoting te reo Maori;

· That the service broadcast original te reo Maori and Maori interest programming in English, that informs, entertains and educates a broad viewing audience;

· That the service provides broadcast services which are technically available across all of New Zealand and practically accessible to as many people as possible.

Maori Television Service

The Maori television service will be established as a statutory corporation with its own legislation. Through this arrangement both the Crown and Maori will have responsibilities for promoting te reo Maori.  
There will be seven directors, three appointed by the Crown and four to be appointed by an Electoral College.  
There will be an interim phase until legislation is passed at the end of this year.

Interim Maori Television Service Directors Role  
The interim directors will be required to:  
· Appoint an interim Chief Executive;  
· Establish the Maori television service;  
· Prepare accountability documents;  
· Confirm preferred transmission and broadcast arrangements and engaging with prospective providers for a Maori television service;  
· Develop detailed specifications for the programme format and broadcasting requirements and engaging with Te Mangai Paho and independent producers over the provision of programme content; and  
· Negotiate with TVNZ and others concerning scheduling arrangements and access and ownership of archival material.

Interim Electoral College  
An interim Electoral College would need to be established in advance of the Maori Television Service Act. A number of organisations may wish to join the Electoral College at a later stage, but at this stage the Electoral College would include:  
· Te Kohanga Reo National Trust;  
· Te Runanganui o Nga Kura Kaupapa Maori o Aotearoa (organisation representing affiliated Kura Kaupapa);  
· Te Tauihu o Nga Wananga (the Wananga Association);  
· Te Ataarangi Incorporated (Maori Language organisation);  
· Te Whakaruruhau o Nga Reo Irirangi o Aotearoa (Maori Radio Stations Federation);  
· Nga Aho Whakaari Maori in Film, Video and Television Incorporated;  
· Kawea Te Rongo (Maori Journalists Federation);  
· New Zealand Maori Council;  
· National Maori Congress;  
· Maori Women's Welfare League;  
· Nga Kaiwhakapumau i te reo Maori (the Wellington Board of Maori Language).

The functions and duties of the interim Electoral College would be to:  
· Appoint and dismiss four interim directors for the Maori television service;  
· Receive updates on progress towards the establishment of the Maori television service; and  
· Make recommendations to the statutorily confirmed Electoral College about re-confirming the four establishment directors as directors for a  
3 year term.

The Minister of Maori Affairs and Te Puni Kokiri will assist with the formation of the interim Electoral College so that the Electoral College can meet quickly to appoint four interim directors.

Appointing the Full Maori Television Service Board

Once the Maori Television Service Act is passed, there will need to be confirmation with those interim Electoral College organisations and the respective functions and duties.

Criteria for Appointing Establishment for Directors and Directors  
Selection criteria for both the interim directors and directors for the Maori Television Service for use by both the government and the Electoral College will be included in legislation. This will include:  
Background and Experience  
· Governance;  
· Practical or professional commercial/business experience; and  
· Broadcasting/programme production.

Key Competencies to be covered on the Board include:  
· An appreciation of the dual role of the Crown and Maori as stakeholders;  
· An understanding of Crown and Maori responsibilities to protect and promote te reo Maori;  
· An ability to distinguish governance from management;  
· A knowledge of the responsibilities of a director;  
· A background in the development and implementation of te reo Maori policy;  
· Competency in te reo Maori and knowledge of tikanga Maori;  
· Financial skills;  
· An ability to work as a team and collaborate;  
· Integrity and a strong sense of ethics.

Functions and Duties of the Establishment Directors and Directors  
The Maori Television Service Directors will have the same duties as those set out in the Companies Act 1993, and all Directors will be expected to act in the best interests of the Maori television service.

Criteria for Dismissing Establishment Directors and Directors  
The Crown and the Electoral College will each be responsible for dismissing their own appointees to the Maori Television Service. The following dismissal criteria will also be included in the Maori Television Services Bill:  
· Misconduct;  
· Bringing the Maori television service into disrepute;  
· Bankruptcy or financial impropriety;  
· Inability to perform the functions of office  
· Failure to attend three consecutive meetings of the Maori television service board, without giving prior notice of his or her ability to attend; and  
· Failure to disclose without reasonable excuse as soon as possible, after the relevant facts have come to the member's knowledge, an interest in a matter being considered or about to be considered.

Kaumatua Council

Maori television service may wish to constitute a Kaumatua Council, which would have an advisory role.

Accountabilities  
A principle of dual accountability will be applied to both the Crown and the Electoral College. Officials will work with key Maori stakeholders to develop this further.

Funding

Maori Television Service: Operations

Te Puni Kokiri will enter into multi-year agreements with the Maori television service for its operational funding for up to $6 million each year.

As the Maori television service will be in establishment phase for 2001/02, $3.863 million is available to establish the Maori television service. The remaining $7 million of the $10.863 extra already allocated for the service in 2001/02 would go to funding programmes for broadcast on the Maori television service.

Maori Programmes  
The government's objective is to provide a level of funding that will enable the establishment of a credible Maori television service. The new service should strive towards broadcasting a minimum of three hours a day of original programming by its third year.  
It is projected that up to an additional $7.391 million (GST incl) will be needed in 2002/03, $14.783 million in 2003/04 and $22.174 million in 2004/05 and outyears toward Maori television programmes for broadcast on the Maori television service.

Maori Television Service and Relationship with other Agencies  
Te Mangai Paho and New Zealand on Air will form a relationship agreement with the Maori television service to facilitate an understanding of the types of genre required to meet the television channel's objectives and organisational priorities.

With regard to archived Maori programmes, arrangements with archival material will need to be negotiated with Te Mangai Paho, relevant broadcasters (Television New Zealand, TV 3 and TV 4) and relevant production companies.

Funding will continue to be allocated through Te Mangai Paho. While it is envisaged that the Maori Television Service will have a capability to make programmes inhouse, it is likely that most of the new programmes broadcast on the new service will be produced by independent producers.

The Crown recognises that it has an obligation to provide some Maori programming on mainstream television as well. It is intended that in the future this obligation will be met by ensuring that TVNZ continues to produce and broadcast at least its existing level of inhouse production.

Frequency Management Rights to be Received by the Kaitiaki Trust  
A "Kaitiaki Trust" comprising three members appointed by the Electoral College from amongst its members to receive the management rights from the Crown. The management right would then be assigned by the Kaitiaki Trust to the Maori television service. The ongoing management role would be with the Maori television service.  
In the event that the Maori television service is dissolved or otherwise ceases to perform the function of the Maori television service within the ten-year term, the management right reverts back to the Kaitiaki Trust appointed by the Electoral College.

Mainstreaming

Government is committed to meeting its mainstreaming undertaking which will be met in future through TVNZ broadcast.
