Pacific Business Awards Inspiring  
Prime Minister Helen Clark and Pacific Island Affairs Minister Mark Gosche today congratulated the finalists and winners of the Pacific Business Awards, announced tonight at a dinner in Auckland.

Twenty Pacific business people and businesses made it to the finals of the three categories of the awards. Finalists included business consultants, a real estate company, a café, fashion and design companies, a furniture company, engineering companies, importers, a dancer and the owner of a $2 shop.

Helen Clark and Mark Gosche said this diversity reflected the dynamic nature of Pacific business development.

"These awards showcase many stories of determination, talent and success.

"New Zealand is built on small businesses. These awards celebrate the significant contribution Pacific businesses and business people are making - not only to Pacific communities but also to the wider New Zealand economy."

Helen Clark presented the Pacific business of the year award to Uaita Fui and John Down, from Christchurch company E and I Engineering. Mark Gosche presented Westpac Trust economist Adrian Orr with the Pacific business person of the year.

The third major award, the Pacific Enterprise Award, went to Fangupo Tu'ipulotu and Ana Manukava Tu'ipulotu, and their Auckland company Petrol and Diesel Engines Importers Ltd.

"The Pacific Business Awards recognise the outstanding success and achievements of our Pacific businesses, business people and entrepreneurs. All the finalists, including the winners, are to be congratulated," Helen Clark and Mark Gosche said.
