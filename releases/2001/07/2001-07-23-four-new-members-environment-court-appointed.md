Background note on the Environment Court·

The major business of the Environment Court is hearing and deciding appeals from decisions on resource consent applications and references about the content of regional and district planning instruments under the Resource Management Act 1991. For those cases sittings of the Court are usually constituted by one Environment Judge and two Environment Commissioners.

The court can also make declarations on the interpretation and application of resource management law, make enforcement orders (similar to injunctions), and decide appeals from local authority abatement notices under the Resource Management Act. Those cases can be heard by an Environment Judge sitting alone, without Commissioners. Where the parties consent, Environment Commissioners may also sit alone to hear and decide cases specifically assigned to them.

Environment Judges also sit regularly in the District Court to hear prosecutions for offences under the Resource Management Act 1991.
