E-Learning Advisory Group appointed

An expert panel will advise the government on how the tertiary sector can best use the new learning technologies particularly in the area of e-learning, Associate Minister (Tertiary Education) Steve Maharey told the Association of Tertiary Education Management National Conference in Palmerston North today.

"The E-Learning Advisory Group will report to the government by the end of this year on how to develop e-learning capacity in tertiary education. Allocation was made in Budget 2001 for this purpose.

"It is a key ingredient in the government's knowledge society project," Mr Maharey said.

Shona Butterfield, the Chief Executive of the Open Polytechnic of New Zealand and a member of the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission, will chair the E-Learning Advisory Group. Other members are:  
· Tom Prebble, Principal, Extramural and International, Massey University (Deputy Chair);  
· John Hinchcliff, Chief Executive, the Auckland University of Technology;  
· Ruakine Hond, Academic Manager, Te Whare Wananga o Awanuiarangi;  
· Trish Brimblecombe, Head of the School of Computing, Whitireia Community Polytechnic;  
· Terry Barnett, Group Manager Academic Services, the Waikato Polytechnic;  
· Martin Eadie, General Manager, NZ Seafood Industry Training Organisation;  
· Nola Campbell, Senior Lecturer in ICT, Coordinator of Online Development, School of Education, Waikato University;  
· Te Kaka Keegan, Senior Lecturer, the University of Waikato; and  
· Andrew Higgins, Director, Higher Education Development Centre, the University of Otago.

Mr Maharey said decisions on the group's membership had been made difficult by the high level of interest and thanked all those who had offered to participate in the initiative.  
He invited them to make a contribution through the e-learning forum being developed by the Ministry of Education on a website to be created by the end of next month.
