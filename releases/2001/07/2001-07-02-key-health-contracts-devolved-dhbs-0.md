Health Minister Annette King says today's transfer of some key health contracts to District Health Boards signals the beginning of a new era in collaboration and community ownership of public health services in New Zealand.

An Order-In-Council had formalised devolution from the Ministry of Health to 21 District Health Boards for funding and managing most contracts for personal health, Maori health, mental health and some Pacific health services, she said. From today organisations providing health services in these areas will negotiate with, be monitored by, and be accountable to DHBs rather than a central agency.

"Giving overall management of these key services to boards provides an effective way to address health and disability inequalities. This sets the scene for publicly funded health services to better reflect and be responsive to clearly identified local and community health needs."

Mrs King said today's devolution marked another development stage in the new public health system, following the merger of the Health Funding Authority and the Ministry of Health, the establishment of DHBs, and launch of the New Zealand Health and Disability strategies which set out the priorities for boards to address.

"We are now a step closer to empowering health professionals and communities to determine their own health needs and decide how best to meet them. This community focus is particularly important in enabling Maori to achieve their own health aspirations. These changes will ensure we can work with hapu, iwi, Maori communities and other organisations to improve Maori health."

Mrs King paid tribute to the work DHBs had done in preparing for this milestone. "More service agreements will be devolved to district health boards in October. And the next significant step in the development of a genuinely public and locally-driven health service will be the district health board elections in the same month.

"In total I believe the changes we are making will give New Zealanders a comprehensive, locally-driven health system," Mrs King said.
