The Government has awarded scholarships to 28 primary and secondary school teachers to upgrade their skills in teaching English to speakers of other languages.

Associate Education Minister Lianne Dalziel says the scholarships will pay for tuition fees and books over a two-year study period.

"A total 14 teachers from Wellington schools will study part-time at Victoria University for the Diploma of Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages," Lianne Dalziel said.

"The other 14, including teacher aides, from schools in rural areas and provincial cities, will study through distance education at Massey University for the Certificate in Teaching English as an Additional Language.

"Trained ESOL teachers are a critical resource for students who are struggling with English oracy, literacy and learning skills. This scholarship programme is part of a wide range of initiatives to improve literacy learning in New Zealand schools," Lianne Dalziel said.

As part of the Pacific English Language and Literacy Initiative announced last December, the government is providing scholarships to 80 teachers this year. Further scholarships will be offered next year in Auckland, Hamilton and Christchurch.

Today's scholarships have been granted to teachers from the following schools:  
Wesley College, Camberley School, Peterhead School, Spotswood College, Strathmore Primary School, Tokoroa Central School, Palmerston North Girls' High School, Levin East School, Aramoho School, Katikati Primary, Te Kura o Takaro, Central Normal School, Upper Hutt College, Windley School, Petone Central, Holy Family School, Wellington East Girls' College, Mt Cook School, Porirua College, Tairangi School, Sacred Heart School (Petone), Corinna School, Berhampore School, St Anne's School (Newtown).
