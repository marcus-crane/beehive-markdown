The Government has appointed a six-member advisory board for the new $100 million New Zealand Venture Investment Fund.

The fund, launched in the Budget, is a key measure amongst the Government's initiatives to stimulate business growth and transform the New Zealand economy.

"The VIF is a bold initiative to accelerate the development of New Zealand's venture capital sector, which is vital to the formation of innovative new businesses," said Research, Science and Technology Minister Pete Hodgson. "This money will back New Zealand's innovators in universities, Crown Research Institutes and the private sector.

"The advisory board will provide the commercial knowledge and judgement the fund needs to drive up seed and start-up investment activity. Its expertise will be crucial in the establishment phase of VIF, when we will be seeking private sector partners for a series of 'drop-down' investment funds."

The chair of the advisory board will be John Grant, currently executive chairman of Australian investment company Grantham Capital. Mr Grant has 20 years experience in private equity investing in Australia and internationally and is a former committee chairman of Australia's Industry Research and Development Board.

Mr Grant is joined on the board by:  
· Peter Taylor, company director and chair of a HortResearch/Enza joint venture company and Gas Investments (NZ) Ltd;  
· John Hindmarsh, Treasurer, Auckland City Council;  
· June McCabe, chief manager, WestpacTrust;  
· Geoff Page, chief executive, Industrial Research Ltd;  
· Grant Ryan, manager NBCi New Zealand Ltd;  
· Dr James Buwalda, chief executive of the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology, (ex officio member).

The $100 million in NZVIF will be invested in a number of individual funds over the next two to three years, with each fund operated by professional venture capital fund managers contracted by the board. Managers will be sought from the venture fund management industry in New Zealand and internationally through a request for proposal (RFP) process.

Mr Hodgson said the advisory board's expertise would be called on in defining the conditions of the RFP, assessing proposals, negotiating the conditions for VIF investment in individual funds, making judgements about when to set up individual funds and balancing the government's risk across the portfolio of VIF funds.

"The advisory board balances internatioinal venture capital expertise with good governance skills and technical capability from New Zealand's innovation sector," Mr Hodgson said. "I am confident it can successfully guide the VIF in its mission to accelerate the formation of a thriving venture capital sector in this country."
