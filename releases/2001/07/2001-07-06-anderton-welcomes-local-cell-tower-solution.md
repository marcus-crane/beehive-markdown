Anderton welcomes local cell tower solution

"I am pleased to see a co-operative approach to try and address the placement of cell sites and towers," said Deputy Prime Minister and Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton in Christchurch today.

"It is an innovative solution to have the Christchurch City Council work with the mobile telecommunications industry in partnership to locate mobile phone sites in Christchurch away from people.

"A successful economy depends heavily on modern, high-tech infrastructure such as mobile phone networks.

"The Christchurch City Council's new mobile phone sites process will help facilitate the development of mobile phone networks in the city, while accommodating local people's views."

"This solution developed here in Christchurch seems to me to have the potential to work for everyone; the community, the Council and the companies.

"New Zealanders are known for our ability to adapt and change. Where a new tool is useful, New Zealanders will use it," said Jim Anderton.

Nearly two million New Zealanders have a cell phone, and an estimated 180,000 Cantabrians have mobile phones.
