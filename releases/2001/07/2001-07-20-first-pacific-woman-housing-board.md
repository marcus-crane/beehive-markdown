20 July 2001Media Statement

Housing Minister Mark Gosche today announced the appointment of the first Pacific woman to the board of Housing New Zealand.

Lope Sasao Heath, a South Auckland lawyer with Samoan and Palagi heritage, has been appointed for a three year term.

Housing New Zealand Corporation is the new housing agency created last month. It merges the old Housing New Zealand, Housing Corporation and Community Housing, as well as the former housing staff of the Ministry of Social Policy. None of these previous organisations had any Pacific women on their boards.

"Housing New Zealand tenants are ethnically diverse. While about a third are Pakeha, 25 per cent are Maori and 20 per cent are Pacific people. It is therefore very appropriate that the board's make-up reflects that diversity."

"This is a very significant appointment. More than 160,000 people live in Housing New Zealand rental properties and the new organisation's assets total more than $6 billion."

Ms Heath is an experienced lawyer specialising in family court work, including representing children. Her law company, King Alofivae Malosi, consists of six women lawyers – three Maori and three Samoan.

Her previous legal experience includes four years at the Grey Lynn Neighbourhood Law Office, where she dealt with a wide range of community groups. She is currently an executive committee member of the Auckland Women Lawyers' Association and is also a trustee for the Tautai Contemporary Pacific Arts Trust. She is also a past member of the Auckland District Law Society’s Equal Employment Opportunities Committee.

Ms Heath is the only new member on the board of the new organisation. Existing Housing New Zealand board members former Prime Minister David Lange, David Pritchard and Paul White were also appointed to the new organisation's board, along with Maryan Street and John Hill who were both on the board of the former Housing Corporation. The chair of the Housing New Zealand board, Roger Bonifant, is the chair of the new board and Patrick Sneddon is his deputy.
