Tourism Minister Mark Burton has welcomed new visitor figures, which reflect New Zealand's growing reputation as a winter holiday destination.

"Total overseas visitor arrivals in June were up a staggering 15 percent on last June," Mark Burton said. "That's on the back of a 12 percent rise in May. In the past two months, we welcomed over 223,000 overseas visitors.

"The New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2010, which the government has produced in partnership with the tourism sector, identifies a need to encourage tourists to visit throughout the year, not just at the height of summer.

"July is shaping up to be every bit as good, and record snowfalls in the last few days in the central North Island will do no harm at all.

"New Zealand offers special attractions year round – and it seems the message is getting out there."

Mark Burton also noted the continued rapid growth of the Chinese market. China has quickly climbed to be our seventh largest source of visitors, with arrival numbers in the past year up by almost 50 percent.
