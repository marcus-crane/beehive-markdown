The government's newest agency, which opened its doors to the public for the first time this week, would help those most in need get better access to housing, Housing Minister Mark Gosche said today.

Housing New Zealand Corporation merges Housing NZ Ltd, the Housing Corporation, Community Housing Ltd and the housing policy team from the Ministry of Social Policy into one agency.

"Bringing all those agencies under one roof in a "one stop shop" will help low income New Zealanders find the most appropriate solutions to their housing problems."

"While this will often involve providing rental houslng it could also involve assistance and advice to home buyers."

Having a multitude of different agencies has not worked well for those most in need, Mr Gosche said.

"Creating a single gateway to housing services is an important part of the government's housing programme. Building a strong single agency is part of our commitment to ensuring low income New Zealanders have more access to affordable, quality housing."

The new agency will  
\* provide housing for community organisations offering residetntial support services  
\* provide assistance and advice to households on low incomes who want to become home owners and  
\* provide advice to the Minister of Housing on housing policy.
