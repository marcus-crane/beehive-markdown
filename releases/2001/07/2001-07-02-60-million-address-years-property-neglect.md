The Minister of Police, George Hawkins, announced today that the Government would invest $60 million over the next five years in capital works, including refurbishment and replacement of police stations.

Mr Hawkins was in Invercargill to announce funding of almost $3.2 million for the extension and refurbishment of the main Invercargill police station.

"It is great news for police throughout the country that we will be spending around $12 million per year for essential work over the next five years.

"The National government let police buildings fall into disrepair to pay for INCIS. Between 1996 and 1999, on average, they spent less than one million dollars a year on capital works. That simply wasn't enough.

"Last week, Mr Ryall shed crocodile tears over the appalling state of some police stations - but it was the National government which allowed it to happen. Yet again we are cleaning up the mess they left behind," said Mr Hawkins.

While in Invercargill, Mr Hawkins took the opportunity to congratulate police in the Southland District on their excellent work, which saw crime in the district fall by 7.5% last year, three times the nationwide drop. "The great work is continuing" said Mr Hawkins.
