Foreign fee-paying students in record numbers - report  
"The export education industry is a classic example of the knowledge economy and is well on target to achieve foreign exchange earnings of $1 billion by 2005," Associate Education Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey was commenting on the release of a statistical overview prepared by the Ministry of Education on foreign fee-paying students in New Zealand. Last year, the sector added around $700 million to the country's GDP.

"The growth in student numbers has been rapid at both tertiary and pre-tertiary levels. Foreign fee-paying students comprised 1.3 percent of the total school roll in 2000 - an increase of 50 percent in a year. At tertiary level, the number in public institutions was 11,498 - up from just 3,945 in 1994 - and projected to continue growing strongly.

"A further 20,000 were estimated to be studying in private training establishments," Mr Maharey said.

Over 80 percent of all foreign fee-paying students came from Asia, and a third of those came from China. However the numbers from Europe and the Americas, although still modest, were increasing steadily.

Mr Maharey said the report, which represented the first substantive collation of statistics on the issue, posed some challenges for the government.

"While we are becoming increasingly popular as a country in which to study, we need to be mindful that the distribution of overseas students in New Zealand is uneven, with Auckland attracting around half of all enrolments and the higher socio-economic areas dominating the market.

"This raises capacity questions in those schools which are also in high demand by domestic students.

"Compounding this problem is the fact that foreign fee-paying school students are more likely to study maths, the physical sciences and business-related subjects where teacher supply is limited.

"The Export Education Strategy, and the $1.3 million allocated to it in this financial year, are intended to address these pressures and to achieve more balanced growth in what is an important and promising industry ," Mr Maharey said.
