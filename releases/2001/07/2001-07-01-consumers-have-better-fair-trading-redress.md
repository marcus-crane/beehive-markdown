Consumers have better Fair Trading redress

Consumers will now have three years from when they discover they have been misled to raise breaches under the Fair Trading Act. Until this change a claim could only be made within three years of being misled.

"It doesn't make sense to have a three year limit on seeking redress against a company or sales person on their claims when the goods or services might have a lifespan which is much longer. This is particularly true for major purchases like houses or insurance products which are major household commitments," said Acting Consumer Affairs Minister Jim Anderton.

"Under this change, claims made by sales people can be monitored for the entire lifespan of the product or service, and the consumer has three years from finding they were misled to make a claim under the Fair Trading Act," said Jim Anderton.

The change to the Act does not apply retrospectively, so it will not apply to people who have claims for which the original three year period limitation period has already expired.
