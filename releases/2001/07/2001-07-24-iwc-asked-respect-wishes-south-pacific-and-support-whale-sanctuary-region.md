This week’s meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in London has been asked to respect the wishes of South Pacific countries and to support the establishment of a South Pacific Whale Sanctuary.

The proposal was first submitted to the IWC at its meeting in Adelaide last year, and a three quarters majority vote of IWC member nations is required for its adoption.

Speaking in London today, New Zealand Minister of Conservation, Sandra Lee, said she had come to the meeting to seek international recognition of the cultural aspirations of South Pacific countries for the protection of whales.

“Polynesian peoples have had a long cultural connection with whales.” Ms Lee said.

“The IWC respects the customary rights of certain indigenous peoples in other parts of the world to take whales to meet their traditional and nutritional needs.

"New Zealand has always supported that proposition, but also seeks equal recognition for the rights of the peoples of the South Pacific to protect whales as part of the living heritage that we pass on to our children.

"In the South Pacific, we do not kill our whales, and we ask other countries to respect our wishes.

"It seems to me that this cultural tradition has not in the past received adequate recognition by IWC members.”

40 countries are attending the IWC meeting, and one of the most hotly-debated items on the agenda will be the proposal to establish a South Pacific Whale Sanctuary, which would encompass some 20 million square kilometres of the South Pacific Ocean, from the Equator to 40 degrees South.

It would protect nine species of large whales on their winter breeding grounds in the tropics, from which they migrate southwards to feed in the krill-rich waters of the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary around Antarctica.

Sandra Lee said she had arrived in London with a strong mandate from the region, following a series of resolutions agreed over the past three years by the 16-member Pacific Islands Forum and the 22 members of the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme.

This process culminated in a regional consultation to progress the whale sanctuary proposal in Samoa in April 2001, involving fifteen countries and territories, at which the Apia Statement was agreed.

Countries and territories represented at the Apia meeting were Samoa, Australia, American Samoa, Cook Islands, French Polynesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Niue, New Zealand, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, Tuvalu, Tokelau and Wallis and Futuna.

In the Apia Statement, the Pacific Island nations noted the critical significance of the South Pacific as breeding grounds for nine species of great whale and the serious depletion of whale populations in the region from commercial whaling last century.

Sandra Lee said that establishment of the South Pacific Whale Sanctuary would also provide an economic boost to the region through the encouragement of whale watching.

“Whale-watching is a rapidly growing industry in the region enabling countries like the Kingdom of Tonga to develop sustainable economic opportunities for their people from carefully managed opportunities for tourists to view the breeding congregations of whales.”

“The world should take note that conservation of marine life is one of the top priorities for the Pacific Island Nations, and it should be clear by now that there is widespread support amongst the island nations of the South Pacific for a whale sanctuary," Ms Lee said.  
"These magnificent animals have roamed our seas for millions of years and we wish them to be a living part of the inheritance we protect and pass on to the children of our region."
