Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that the Queen will visit Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin during her visit in October this year.

The Queen will be accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh. The visit will follow immediately after a ten-day visit to Australia, which includes the Queen's attendance at the Commonwealth Heads of Government conference in Brisbane. In New Zealand there will be an initial weekend rest period prior to the five-day official visit beginning on Monday, 15 October.

The Queen's itinerary has, of necessity, been limited to the four main centres. As the time for the visit is short, the visit programme includes a mixture of formal and informal functions to allow the Queen to meet a diverse range of New Zealanders.

In Wellington there will be a ceremony of welcome at Parliament following a drive through the CBD. The Queen will attend the consecration service at the Wellington Cathedral of St Paul and also open the new art galleries at Te Papa.

While in Dunedin the Queen will open the Information Services Building at Otago University, visit the Natural History New Zealand studios, and walk in the Octagon.

She will also meet New Zealanders in Cathedral Square in Christchurch, following a welcome by Ngai Tahu at Rehua Marae and prior to a visit to Burnham Military Camp where she will meet defence staff preparing for duty in East Timor.

In Auckland, activities will include a visit to the Team New Zealand base and a garden party at Government House.

This year's Royal Visit will be the Queen's tenth visit to New Zealand since her initial visit in 1953. The Queen will celebrate her golden jubilee on 6 February 2002.

A full itinerary will be released when finalised
