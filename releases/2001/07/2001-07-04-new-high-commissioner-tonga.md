New Zealand's next High Commissioner to Tonga would be career diplomat Warwick Hawker, Acting Foreign Affairs Minister Jim Sutton said today. He said New Zealand has friendly relations with Tonga based on close historical ties and extensive people-to-people linkages.

Tongans are a significant part of the Pacific Islands' population in New Zealand. In the 1996 New Zealand Census more than 31,000 people identified themselves as Tongans, making them the third-largest Pacific Island community living here.

"New Zealand and Tonga cooperate on a number of regional and international issues such as the South Pacific Whale Sanctuary, fisheries management for the Pacific, and the International Peace Monitoring Team in the Solomon  
Islands.

"We are both founding members of the Pacific Islands Forum and work closely together in the UN and the Commonwealth." Mr Sutton said the close links were reinforced by New Zealand's Official Development Assistance programme which assisted Tongan people with sustainable and equitable development of their social and economic infrastructure.

"Tonga is a valuable trading partner for New Zealand in the Pacific with annual exports to the island worth $38 million. Tonga is also looking to join the WTO. "Mr Hawker's considerable trade experience will enable him to further develop New Zealand's interests in this area," Mr Sutton said.  
Mr Hawker is currently New Zealand's Ambassador in Tehran. He has previously served as Trade Commissioner in Suva, Singapore and Adelaide and Deputy Head of Mission in Kuala Lumpur and Beijing.

He joined the Foreign Affairs Ministry in 1988 after working for the Department of Trade and Industry. He takes over from current High Commissioner Brian Smythe in December.
