Thirty employment relations education courses by employer, union and tertiary institutions have so far been approved under the Employment Relations Act.

The Minister of Labour, Margaret Wilson says the courses cover a wide range of skills that will help improve workplace relationships, including problem solving, communication and negotiation, as well as working together in good faith.

Employees can use leave provided by the Employment Relations Act to attend the courses.

The courses are approved by the Employment Relations Education Advisory Committee which is made up of union, employer and education sector representatives. The committee also makes recommendations to the Minister on funding from the Employment Relations Education Contestable Fund.

So far the fund has supported fifteen organisations in developing and delivery of courses.

Margaret Wilson said she was pleased with the way the programmes are developing.

“Both unions and employers are working toward increasing their skills and knowledge of employment relationship matters and to have an effective voice in bargaining, which is what the Act is there for.”

NOTE:

The approved courses for which union members can use their paid leave provided by the Employment Relations Act are listed on the Department of Labour’s Employment Relations Service website: www.ers.dol.govt.nz/rights/erel/courses.html. This website also provides information on how to apply to the contestable fund. The Advisory Committee has called for applications for the next round of funding, which will close on 6 August.
