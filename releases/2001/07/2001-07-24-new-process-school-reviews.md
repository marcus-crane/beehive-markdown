Schools are being asked to comment on changes to the way they are reviewed by the Education Review Office.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard said the process followed the recommendations made by the ERO Ministerial Review Committee earlier this year.

"As a result of that review, ERO is revising the way it carries out reviews in schools and schools are being asked to contribute to that process," Trevor Mallard said.

"The aim is to make the whole review process as useful and constructive as possible for boards of trustees, principals, staff, students and their parents.

"The office has developed proposals for changes to the review process, and is sending these out to schools this week for comment.

"The proposals look at:

· a more participatory and flexible approach that would include discussion of priorities identified by the school that could be included in a review

· schools' nominating their own representative to be part of the review

· a framework to make it easier for schools to see what they are doing well and where they need to improve

"While some aspects of a review will change, ERO will continue to base its evaluations on evidence collected by review officers. Parents will still be able to get the same level of information from ERO about the quality of education being provided by the school.

"ERO reports will continue to be on the ERO website: www.ero.govt.nz, although, in line with a recommendation from the Review Committee, these are now public two weeks after the board of trustees is given its confirmed report.

"ERO is asking for comment on its proposals from principals, boards of trustees, school staff and communities, as well from organisations in the education sector.

"Those who wish to comment have until the end of August to get back to ERO. Reviews using the new procedures will be in place at the beginning of the 2002 school year," Trevor Mallard said.
