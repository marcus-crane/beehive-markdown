A review of New Zealand's energy policies by the International Energy Agency highlights the challenges posed by climate change, says Energy Minister Pete Hodgson.

Mr Hodgson and IEA executive director Robert Priddle released the IEA New Zealand 2001 Review today. The IEA, an autonomous body within the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), reviews the energy policies of member countries about every four years.

"The IEA is positive about many developments in New Zealand energy policy but its report highlights the size and complexity of the climate change issue," Mr Hodgson said. "It quite rightly emphasises the importance of developing a comprehensive and cost-effective policy response to global warming."

"The report comments on our current policies and programmes and makes recommendations. I am pleased to note that many of the recommendations are already part of the Government's policy, or are under active policy development."

IEA recommendations that have been or are being implemented include:

· Update energy sector outlook scenarios.

· Greenhouse gas emissions:  
\- develop a cost-effective package of policies and measures, based on all technically feasible options, for achieving our emissions target;  
\- develop measures such as emissions trading and credits for sinks;  
\- ensure methane emissions from agriculture and carbon dioxide emissions from transport, as well as energy sector emissions, are addressed.

· Give priority in the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy to improving efficiency of energy use in transport, domestic space heating, water heating and electrical appliances.

· Put in place new legislation ensuring the full benefits of electricity market reform are achieved, through competition wherever possible, and with appropriate incentives for industry self-governance, but with regulation by the Commerce Commission of the natural monopoly line businesses.

· Review the possible benefits of regulatory reform in the gas market.

The IEA report was prepared following a visit to New Zealand late last year by a team of energy experts from Finland, Australia and Canada and the IEA's headquarters in Paris. New Zealand was last reviewed in 1997.
