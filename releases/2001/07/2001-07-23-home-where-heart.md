Finance Minister Michael Cullen says a survey asking what brings Kiwis home reiterates the messages he was given by expatriates on his recent two week investment and briefing tour to the UK, Japan and Singapore.

The on-line survey by TMP Worldwide says those who have returned to NZ after working overseas are looking for the "good life" with family and friends.

The survey asked 750 people a series of questions on the reasons for working in NZ and overseas.

Lifestyle factors such as the easy access to outdoor pursuits (82%), reduced community and travel time (36%) and the favourable climate and environment (60%) were listed as the attractive features that brought expats home.

Dr Cullen says while he was in London he was able to meet with several hundred expatriate New Zealanders. "A substantial number of others remain committed to returning to New Zealand for lifestyle or family reasons, despite the opportunity to earn more overseas.

"In terms of a national identity I believe that, Kiwis are always Kiwis. Wherever we are in the world, we stay committed to the New Zealand way of life and we are proud to be New Zealanders

"Even among those who have made a more permanent home in the UK, there is obviously an ongoing commitment to New Zealand that we can draw on in line with the ideas emerging from the government/business talent initiative.

"We want to tap into the hearts and minds of our talented and successful expatriate New Zealanders.

"We want our young people to know that there are world leader kiwis out there. We want them as positive role models for New Zealand youth.

"We need to network and allow them to still contribute to the New Zealand's prosperity wherever they are in the world," said Dr Cullen.
