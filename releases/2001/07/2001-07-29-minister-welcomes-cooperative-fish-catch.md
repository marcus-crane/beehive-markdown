The Minister of Defence Mark Burton has welcomed the Royal New Zealand Navy's involvement in apprehending a vessel accused of illegal fishing.

"The HMNZS Manawanui located the Dong Wong 519 yesterday off the Marlborough Coast.

"Fishery officers who were aboard Manawanui boarded the Korean fishing vessel and discovered fish catch that had not been recorded in fishing returns.

"The Dong Wong 519, which is under charter to a New Zealand fishing company, has been ordered to return, under Navy escort, to Port Timaru.

"This joint Navy/Ministry of Fisheries operation is a great example of the benefits of cooperation between government departments," Mark Burton said.

"The recent Maritime Patrol Review identified the need for greater coordination to protect our maritime resources.

"Even greater efficiency will be achieved with the forthcoming establishment of the Maritime Coordination Centre in Trentham.

"The Maritime Coordination Centre will operate alongside the NZDF's new Joint Operational Headquarters, which I will be opening on Monday," Mark Burton said.
