Pete Hodgson, Convenor of the Ministerial Group on Climate Change, departs for Germany tomorrow to represent New Zealand at a world conference on climate change.

The conference is the resumed Sixth Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP 6.5 for short. The Sixth Session began at The Hague in November last year but was suspended when negotiations ended without result.

Ministers and officials at the conference will attempt to finalise rules for implementing the Kyoto Protocol, an addition to the Framework Convention that would set legally binding greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for developed nations. New Zealand's target would be to stabilise emissions at 1990 levels over the 2008-2012 commitment period.

"The Government's intention remains to ratify the Kyoto Protocol next year," Mr Hodgson said. "My aim in these negotiations is to work towards agreement on rules for implementing the Protocol. Key areas in which New Zealand wants to see progress are international carbon trading mechanisms, recognition of carbon sinks and compliance.

"New Zealand wants rules on these matters that are easy to understand and hard to break. We want a Protocol that has environmental integrity. We are under no illusions that progress at this meeting may be difficult given the approach being taken by the United States. But the New Zealand Government considers that the Kyoto Protocol is the only realistic opportunity the world has at present for a coordinated response to climate change."
