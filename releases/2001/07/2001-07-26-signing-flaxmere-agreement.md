Efforts to improve education in Flaxmere received a boost today with the signing of a new funding agreement for the Flaxmere Project.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard and Associate Education Minister Parekura Horomia were in Flaxmere today for the signing of the funding agreement with the Flaxmere cluster.

"This marks beginning of an exciting new phase in the Flaxmere Project," Trevor Mallard said.

"The project seeks to raise the profile of learning throughout the whole Flaxmere Community by establishing strong partnerships between homes, schools and the Ministry of Education."

Trevor Mallard confirmed that more than $800,000 will be made available over the next 12 months to fund a number of exciting initiatives. These will include:

· appointing and resourcing up to five home / school liaison staff across the cluster;  
· establishing a comprehensive research project to monitor project effectiveness and guide future project direction;  
· establishing a high-speed wireless radio network to facilitate data transfer between the project schools;  
· developing "MUSAC" database software to facilitate a shared database of student information across all five schools.  
· establishing a comprehensive "Computers in Homes" project. This aspect of the project has been made possible through a contribution of in excess of $180 000 from the Flaxmere Licensing Charitable Trust.

"I am delighted to see well-performing schools striving to expand the educational achievement for their students by working closely with their community, local Iwi such as the Te Taiwhenua O Hertaunga and Pacific groups.

"It is only through such partnerships, that barriers to learning that exist outside the school gate can be effectively targeted. The Flaxmere Project represents an exciting phase in developing strong partnerships between school, community and the Ministry of Education.

Trevor Mallard said he was pleased to see that the impetus for the Flaxmere Project had come from the schools in Flaxmere, working closely with their community.

Future initiatives for the project are likely to include a co-ordinated community education programme and the provision of quality after school programmes to further develop students' literacy, numeracy and computer skills.

The five Flaxmere schools involved in the Flaxmere Project are Flaxmere, Irongate and Peterhead Schools, Kimi Ora Community School and Flaxmere College.
