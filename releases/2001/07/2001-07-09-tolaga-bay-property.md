Minister of Maori Affairs Hon Parekura Horomia is distressed about the state of the Solander Street property in Tolaga Bay and said that the whanau is already taking immediate action about the situation.

Mr Horomia is the executor of an estate that has as its beneficiaries his niece and nephews, including William Crawford. The estate includes the property at 30 Solander Street Tolaga Bay.

As Executor, the property is held in Mr Horomia's name. Mr Crawford will be part owner of the property once the estate has been wound up and the property divested among beneficiaries. Mr Horomia said that the issues relating to the estate have been complex and have required substantial support from family to resolve over the past few years. However, those issues have been largely resolved and the estate is working towards being wound up and divested to its beneficiaries. Mr Horomia is not a beneficiary of this estate.

Mr Horomia said that it was agreed Mr Crawford could live in the house rent free on the understanding that he maintained the property. No rent has been received by the estate. Mr Horomia and his family have met all back rates and debts associated with the property. When approached by Mr Crawford for assistance to make repairs to the spouting, Mr Horomia gave finance for the work. That work was never completed.

"Every attempt has been made by the whanau to provide William and his family with a home during difficult times. William is my nephew and I really don't want to talk about members of my whanau in the media," Mr Horomia said.

"At no time have I been advised that the property was in need of significant repairs and I am distressed to be told of the current state of disrepair. Whanau are taking immediate action to remedy the situation. I have not received any correspondence or any repair notice form the Gisborne District Council about the property."
