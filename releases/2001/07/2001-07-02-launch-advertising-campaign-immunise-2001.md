Health Minister Annette King says this year's major immunisation campaign against measles, mumps and rubella is designed to prevent a major measles epidemic in 2002/03.

The Minister, who today launched media advertisements for Immunise 2001, said: "The last two measles epidemics in New Zealand occurred in 1991 and 1997. The cycle suggests another epidemic in 2002/2003 if we don't take steps now to make sure it doesn't happen."

Mrs King said that while most children recovered from measles without complications, some developed pneumonia, ear infections, serious diarrhoea or brain inflammation, and some could develop permanent disabilities.

"Seven people, mostly children, have died of measles in the past decade. None had been immunised."

Mrs King said the campaign was taking a new form because in February this year the Ministry of Health had rescheduled the second dose of the MMR vaccine.

"It is now considered more effective to give the two doses of the vaccine close together. The first dose used to be scheduled at 15 months, and the second at 11 years. Now the first remains at 15 months, but the second is scheduled at four years, before the child begins school.

"So this year's school campaign is aimed at all five to 10-year-olds so that they do not miss out. It's a catch-up campaign and all the more important because of that. Some children may have had their second MMR immunisation during the 1997 epidemic, but many did not."

Mrs King said the Ministry was also extremely keen to increase the rate of uptake of the first vaccine dose. "At the moment the rate is only about 75 percent. We need to boost that rate markedly for the sake of the good health of New Zealand children."

Questions and Answers on Immunise 2001

Q:What is "Immunise 2001" and who does it affect?

· The Ministry of Health is undertaking a major school based immunisation programme for primary school-aged children to prevent a Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) epidemic.  
· Children between the age of 5 and 10 will be immunised against measles mumps and rubella as a follow up to the vaccine they should have received at 15 months of age. The second dose of the MMR vaccine used to be given at 11 years of age but has now been changed to prevent a 2002/03 measles epidemic.  
· The Ministry wants to stop a measles epidemic because the disease can have serious consequences for children and adults. Immunisation is the only way of preventing measles and stopping epidemics.  
· All parents and caregivers with primary aged children will be asked to give their consent to immunisation.

Q:Is measles a serious disease?

· Measles is a serious and highly infectious virus infection.  
· Most children recover without complications, but some develop complications like pneumonia, ear infections, serious diarrhoea, or brain inflammation. Hundreds of children are admitted to hospital, and some develop permanent disabilities.  
· Seven people, mostly children, have died of measles in the past decade - none had been immunised.

Q:Why not use plain measles vaccine instead of MMR?

· If we gave a plain measles vaccine, we would need to give a mumps and rubella vaccine at some later stage. It is simpler for MMR vaccine to be given.

Q:Why is the programme being run in primary schools?

The programme will run through primary schools because:

· Previous immunisation programmes in schools have been successful and usually achieve high coverage.  
· Many children do not have a regular family doctor, but instead use after hours clinics or emergency departments, neither of which specialise in immunisation. A school based programme is the best way to achieve maximum coverage.

Q:Who will be running the "Immunise 2001 School Programme"?

· The MMR programme is being run by the Public Health Nurses of each District Health Board.  
· Public Health Nurses work with all state and most private primary schools in the country.

Q:What does the "Immunise 2001 School Programme" involve?

Briefly, the programme in each school should run as follows:

1\. The Public Health Nurse will contact the school to discuss the programme, provide this information pack for the school, staff and board, and make arrangements for the programme.  
2\. Information packs for parents will be given to the school to give to children to take home including the consent form. Parents will be asked to go through the information, complete the consent form and return it to the school.  
3\. The form asks parents:

· for permission (consent) to vaccinate their child at school  
· for information about their child's health and previous immunisation  
· who their family doctor is  
· if the child has already had their 2nd MMR vaccine  
· if the parents are intending taking the child to their own doctor instead

Even if parents want to take their child to their family doctor to be immunised, or do not want their child vaccinated at all, the consent form should be filled out indicating this and returned to the school.

§Packs will be available in English, Maori, Samoan, Tongan, Cook Island Maori, Mandarin, Tokelaaun, Niuean.

4\. After immunisation is given, children will be given an information sheet to take home. This lets the parents know that the child has had their immunisation, and what to look out for over the next few days as the vaccine takes effect.

Q: Is the vaccine safe?

§Serious reactions to the vaccine are extremely rare, but do occur. However, the risks of serious disease from not vaccinating are far greater than the risks of a severe reaction to the vaccination. Some 30% of measles cases result in complications of some sort.

§The MMR vaccine used in New Zealand is fully registered and approved by the Ministry of Health, and is widely used internationally.

§Side effects can occur with vaccination including slight fever, rash soreness at the site of the injection. This is normal and should not be a cause for alarm.

Q:Some people have suggested that there is a connection between autism and the measles vaccine. Has this been proven?

·Several large studies have been conducted using epidemiological data and the evidence dose not support the MMR/autism claims.

Q:How does the vaccine work?

§MMR vaccine is a live viral vaccine. It contains weakened ("attenuated") strains of measles, mumps and rubella viruses. The vaccine works by causing a mild infection which the immune system reacts to and overcomes without causing the severe complications of the natural infection. This prepares the immune system to react quickly if the child is exposed to the infection.

Q:Is immunisation compulsory?

·Immunisation is not compulsory in New Zealand and there are no plans of making it so. However, immunisation is highly desirable and we strongly recommend that children are fully immunised before starting school. There is a lot of thorough research showing that unimmunised children commonly spread these infections to younger family members.

Q:How will I know if my child has measles?

§ Measles can seem at first to be like a cold or a flu type infection. Children usually develop a high fever, cough, sore throat and red eyes. A rash will also appear which is usually first noticed round the back of the ears, or on the back. Your child will feel unwell and may be sensitive to light. These symptoms can be confused with meningitis, so check with your doctor or nurse.  
§ Many mild childhood infections produce rashes. These are sometimes mistaken for measles or called "infant measles". However, true measles is a severe illness for most children.

Q:Are mumps and rubella serious diseases as well?

·Mumps and rubella are also important viral infections, worth preventing because of the complications which the natural infection commonly gives. Immunisation is the best way of preventing both infections.

·The usual symptoms of mumps are fever and swelling of the saliva glands below the ear and under the jaw. It can also cause pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas, which produced digestive enzymes) and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), which can be very serious. It can lead to permanent deafness (usually on one side only).

·Rubella (previously called German Measles) is usually a mild illness, with mild fever and other symptoms, joint pains and a rash lasting a few days. If this was all it did, there would be no need for a vaccine. However, rubella infection during early pregnancy (before 10 weeks) produces severe birth defects. This "congenital rubella syndrome" used to be common during rubella epidemics, but has virtually disappeared with immunisation.

Q:Where can parents/caregivers get further reliable information about MMR and other vaccines?

Reliable information, based on good scientific studies, is readily available. Some New Zealand sources include:  
·The Immunisation Advisory Centre, which has a web site with useful information and links.www.imac.auckland.ac.nz  
·www.moh.govt.nz
