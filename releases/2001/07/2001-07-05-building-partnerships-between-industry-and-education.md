Building partnerships between industry and education

"Polytechnics are the engine room of a knowledge society," Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education) Steve Maharey told the official opening of WelTec - The Wellington Institute of Technology - today.

WelTec is the renamed Hutt Valley Polytechnic and incorporates all but three courses previously offered by the Central Institute of Technology at Heretaunga, but Mr Maharey says it is far more than rolling two institutions into one.

"The expanded organisation is a good example of modern and responsive education. It represents a fundamentally new and relevant method of delivering training in the Wellington region. The result is a 'staircase' of qualifications for students from open entry to degree and diploma qualifications."

Mr Maharey said a decision was made in the 1960s to separate trade certification from technical diploma and degree courses in the Hutt Valley. That may have been appropriate to the needs of the time but, nearly 30 years on, circumstances had changed.

"Now competition for resources was high and the challenge was to reduce the duplication of resources. WelTec was tailored to those needs and was worthy of continued central government support and investment.

"The breadth of the courses offered, the innovative delivery and the central location offers students a high degree of flexibility in an environment which makes learning very accessible."

"WelTec will also contribute to the development of Wellington as a smart, hi-tech centre and has made significant early progress in developing a strong partnership with local business as reflected in the provision of two industry scholarships - one in engineering and one in hospitality.

"These industries clearly have faith in the WelTec vision and are prepared to invest in their own futures by training the skills they need to grow and prosper," Mr Maharey said.
