The Government has released a new draft ICT strategy for schools.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard released the strategy at the Learning@School conference in Wellington today.

Trevor Mallard said the strategy reflected the Government's desire for ICT in education to extend and deepen educational experiences.

"A new Education Review Office report indicates the extent of the change. Schools are working towards using ICT to improve student knowledge, understandings, skills and attitudes. It is time to update our strategy to reflect that change," Trevor Mallard said.

"At the heart of the strategy is our vision for education. Other key elements include goals, sub-goals and action plans that will help us achieve this vision.

"The strategy uses the 1998 strategy as a base, but extends it to encompass the huge knowledge we have gained over the last few years about ICT in education.

"For example, it recognises that in order to be successful, ICT in education has to go beyond the school gate work in partnership with businesses and communities. This approach is already reflected in Government supported programmes like the digital opportunities projects and the computers in homes scheme.

"The new draft strategy encompasses what educational leaders have learnt about e-learning. There is more about student-centred learning and encouraging critical thinking.

"There is more of an emphasis on the importance of high quality leadership and a focus on professional development. That ties in with the Government's Budget announcement for principal leadership development and support.

"My vision for ICT in education is for all students, irrespective of their backgrounds, to develop the knowledge, understandings, skills, and attitudes to participate fully in society, to achieve in a global economy, and to have a strong sense of identity and culture.

"The Government is currently involved in a project called the Knowledge Wave. We want to raise New Zealand's sights to explore new ways to create future economic prosperity and social well-being.

"One aim is to spark a broad-based national discussion on how New Zealand can benefit from the pursuit and application of knowledge-based creativity and innovation. We believe that is the key to success in the global economy of the 21st century.

"Education is a key tool in that pursuit. I'm driven by my desire to ensure that all New Zealanders get the opportunity to ride that wave.
