The latest information on hydroelectric lake levels supplied to Energy Minister Pete Hodgson shows a slight decrease in storage and continuing modest inflows.

Mr Hodgson is getting regular information on hydro lake storage and is releasing weekly updates.

In the week to 8 July storage decreased from 73 per cent of the average for the time of year to 71 percent of average. Inflow to the lakes was steady at 67 percent of average.

Lakes Pukaki and Tekapo, which account for 60 percent of national hydro storage, remain low. At 8 July Tekapo was 46 percent full and Pukaki 51 percent.

Wholesale electricity prices rose again to more than 20c/kWh over the weekend, reflecting ongoing wariness amongst generators over the low inflows to the lakes.

"Current levels are significantly above those in the crisis year of 1992 for this time of year," Mr Hodgson said. "They are also significantly higher than this year's low point of 59 percent of average on 7 June.

"However storage and inflows remain sufficiently below average still to pose a modest risk of supply difficulties later in the year.
