"Competitive Auckland is an excellent initiative by Auckland's community and business leaders," says Minister Assisting the Prime Minister with Auckland Issues, Judith Tizard, who is attending the third and final Competitive Auckland forum tomorrow.

Prime Minister Helen Clark and several industry leaders will address more than 300 attendees at the forum on Thursday 26 July at the Aotea Centre.

Over the past five months, Competitive Auckland has developed a strategy to enhance Auckland as an internationally competitive business location, and promote the region as a great place to live and work.

The strategy focuses on six industries with high potential for growth - the tourism, marine, IT & C, education, food & beverage, and biotechnology sectors.

"I am pleased that the strategy has gone beyond simply indentifying the region's problems - we Aucklanders know well enough what they are," says Judith Tizard. "A more focused approach is crucial for the region to regain economic health.

One of the main issues identified in the strategy as affecting Auckland's competitiveness is the growing skills gap.

"We have achieved a low unemployment rate in Auckland, but what this means is we must now focus on increasing the skills base in the region to fuel the growth we need," says Judith Tizard.

"After a decade of neglect during which Auckland's competitiveness declined, this government is committed to dealing with the key issues facing the region.

"In terms of growth and innovation, that has meant initiatives such as the modern apprenticeship scheme, industry training, increased research & development funding and business incubator support programmes.

"I am also delighted with local initiatives to solve the skills gap such as the Auckland Chamber of Commerce website designed for new immigrants to register their skills.

"When we look at ways to grow our economy, this government has always emphasised the value of partnerships. I'm delighted that the business, education and local government leaders of Auckland have taken the same approach with Competitive Auckland.

"I am aware that Competitive Auckland's work has been mainly on a pro-bono or voluntary basis, and I would like to congratulate the hundreds of people involved in what has been a fantastic community project.

"I'm looking forward to the presentations tomorrow from industry leaders who will share with us their visions for implementing the Competitive Auckland strategy in their businesses.

"My vision as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister with Auckland Issues is that every Aucklander takes pride in living and working in a world-leading city. The Competitive Auckland strategy will ensure that we are using the abilities and talents of every Aucklander for the benefit of New Zealand."
