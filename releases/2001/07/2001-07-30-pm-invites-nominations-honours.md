Prime Minister Helen Clark today urged voluntary and community organisations to make nominations for the 2002 New Year honours list.

"Earlier this year I invited New Zealanders to nominate people who work tirelessly in a voluntary capacity to help others through welfare, cultural, sporting and community organisations.

"This year is International Year of the Volunteer and it would be appropriate for organisations to put forward our volunteers for consideration for an honour.

"Nominations close at the end of August, and in September the Government will be looking at the nominations received for inclusion in the next honours list, to be announced at New Year 2002.

"The response to my earlier calls for nominations has been encouraging. I know, however, that there are many people whose voluntary work within the community remains largely hidden within various groups.

"The honours system relies largely on the public making nominations and I urge those people who are aware of individuals who give freely of their time and resources to assist others to nominate them for consideration for an honour," Helen Clark said.

Nomination forms are available from Members of Parliament and electorate offices and from the Honours Secretariat, Cabinet Office, Parliament Buildings, Wellington.

The nomination form and information on the New Zealand Royal Honours System may be found on www.dpmc.govt.nz under "Honours Secretariat".
