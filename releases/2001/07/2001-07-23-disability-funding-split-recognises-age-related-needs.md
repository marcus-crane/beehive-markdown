The government's decision to separate disability support services funding into two streams acknowledges the different needs of older and younger people, Disability Issues Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

The decision separates DSS funding for people aged 65 and over from funding for those aged under 65.

Ms Dyson said both age groups would benefit from the funding split.

"The complex and serious health and disability needs of older people are not the same as the more stable needs of younger disabled people. The funding split acknowledges these differences and will enable us to focus better on each group."

Ruth Dyson said the decision arose out of the findings of the New Zealand Positive Ageing Strategy and the New Zealand Disability Strategy.

"Younger people's support needs typically relate to wider sectors such as housing, income, education and employment. The split will encourage a broader focus on disability issues, as emphasised in the disability strategy."

Ms Dyson said it was inappropriate to have demand driven funding for older people within the capped DSS budget of around $1.2 billion a year.

"Every year more of the budget is going into residential care for older people, which is driven by demand. This puts increasing pressure on the provision of general disability support services and essential equipment such as wheelchairs and hearing aids for younger people."

Ruth Dyson said older people would also benefit from the separation of funding.

"The Positive Aging Strategy has identified the need for a seamless transition between services in response to older people's changing needs. This integrated continuum of care model will be spelt out further in the Health of Older People Strategy, due to be released shortly."

Ms Dyson said all disability support services funding would stay within the Ministry of Health in the short term.

"The Ministry of Health will work closely with two lead district health boards, Canterbury and Northland, on how best to integrate services around the needs of older people.

"Funding for older people will only be devolved to district health boards when they can demonstrate their ability to provide an integrated continuum of care model."

The ministry is doing further work to consider long-term funding options for younger disabled people which promote their independence and participation in community life.
