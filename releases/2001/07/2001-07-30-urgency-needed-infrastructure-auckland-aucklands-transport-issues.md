Minister Assisting the Prime Minister with Auckland Issues, Judith Tizard, says it is time for Infrastructure Auckland to close the funding gap on the Britomart project.

"Infrastructure Auckland has been too narrow in its funding assessment. The Britomart project is a critical transport hub, and if it doesn't get built, then it's unlikely the other 58 stations will happen. The time for analysis is over and the time for action is now."

Judith Tizard, who is also the Associate Minister of Transport, says she was extremely disappointed that Infrastructure Auckland gave the Auckland City Council no choice but to withdraw their funding application for the Waitemata Waterfront Interchange.

"It is getting to the point where I may have to take the issue to cabinet to discuss legislative change to either abolish or reform Infrastructure Auckland, because if they won't do the job they should get out of the way of those who will.

"The Waitemata Waterfront Interchange has been agreed on as a priority by the Mayoral Forum. The regional land transport strategy hangs on it, and the agreement of the mayors is a major step in pulling the region's transport system together.

"Transfund has recognised the urgent need for public transport infrastructure in Auckland with a $20 million contribution to the Britomart project. Auckland City is contributing $133 million to the project for the benefit of the entire Auckland region.

"Now it's up to Infrastructure Auckland to close the funding gap."
