Social Security Act Amendments

"The social assistance system is simpler and more effective as a result of amendments to the Social Security Act brought in on 1 July," said Social Services Minister Steve Maharey.

The changes included the replacement of seven categories of the Community Wage with a work-tested Unemployment Benefit and a non-work tested Sickness Benefit.

"Anyone applying for a work-tested benefit will have a Job Seeker Agreement which will set out clearly their responsibilities, what the Department of Work and Income will do to help them into work and what they will do to help themselves.

"The new sanctions regime is much easier to understand and is targeted at serious non-compliance."

Mr Maharey said that over time, the government would also work to remove unwarranted discrimination in the benefit system, such as discrimination on the basis of gender.

"The government's objective is to give everyone the opportunity to benefit from the higher skill economy that is developing in New Zealand. As well as providing security, the money we spend each year on income support must become an investment in people's potential."
