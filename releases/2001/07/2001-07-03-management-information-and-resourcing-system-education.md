Making information in schools more manageable and useful has moved a step forward with the signing of an agreement to develop a management and information resourcing system.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard told the Learning@Schools conference in Wellington today that computer company Compaq would design, build and roll out the new system. This system will be fully developed in New Zealand.

"The integrated system will make it easier for information to be transferred electronically between schools and the Ministry," Trevor Mallard said.

"It will also include development of templates to make it easier for schools to report to parents and government.

"It will allow schools immediate access to their own school data which is held by the Ministry."

"I expect the changes to make life easier for school staff both in the administrative area and in helping with their core business of teaching and learning practice," Trevor Mallard said.
