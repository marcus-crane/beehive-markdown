Christchurch Customs staff receive East Timor medals

Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton today awarded medals to three Christchurch Customs staff who have served in East Timor.

"The work of our New Zealand Customs Service staff overseas has been of credit to this country and we can all be proud of their work and their commitment," said Jim Anderton.

In total, 17 Customs staff have worked alongside other New Zealanders as part of our commitment to the International United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). Three of these 17 Customs staff are currently on postings there.

New Zealand was the first country to respond to a call from the United Nations for assistance in establishing a Border Control Service in East Timor.

"In December 1999 the airport was about to re-open for commercial flights and there was an urgent need to provide basic Immigration and Customs services. Within three weeks there were five Customs officers in Dili."

Initially, New Zealand Customs Officers were involved in creating some order out of what one described as a "free for all" by establishing systems at the airport and the port in Dili. The job then evolved into advising and training the East Timorese.

"One of the great strengths of New Zealanders is our commitment to peace and to our neighbours. The work of these Customs staff shows again that we are prepared to help out where we can in the world."

Mr Anderton said he was particularly pleased to have the opportunity to meet the Christchurch officers.

"Those of us who call Christchurch home regard it as one of the most peaceful and pleasant cities in the world. To go from here to the chaos of East Timor must have been a tremendous contrast."

The East Timor medal has been approved by Queen Elizabeth II and recognises the contribution made by New Zealanders, both civilian and military, to the rebuilding of East Timor.
