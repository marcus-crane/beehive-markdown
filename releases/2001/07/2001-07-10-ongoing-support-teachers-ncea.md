Education Minister Trevor Mallard today announced that teacher professional development for NCEA will continue for the rest of the year.

"Teachers have now completed the professional development days," Trevor Mallard said.

"But there is still $2.64 million to provide extra support in areas of need which schools can fund through the School Support Services in each region.

"I expect the level of need to vary from school to school depending on how much previous experience staff have in each particular subject area.

"Most schools are on track with their preparation and planning for the implementation of the NCEA in 2002.

"However, for those schools, or teachers, who identify subject specific or implementation needs, assistance will be available.

"More than 700 subject specialists, nation wide, have been trained to facilitate professional development. School Support Services is also able to access specialists from this pool of expertise, to provide assistance directly where it is needed.

"Where schools require assistance with management and systems support in relation to the NCEA, they can request help through the New Zealand Qualifications Authority," Trevor Mallard said.
