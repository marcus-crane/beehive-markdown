Pacific Budget Initiatives Explained

A series of fono for Pacific communities to learn more about the Budget begins today.

Government Budget initiatives for Pacific people are the focus for four fono in Porirua, West Auckland, South Auckland and Hamilton involving Pacific Island Affairs Minister Mark Gosche in the next few weeks.

"These meetings give me the chance to meet with Pacific communities and it gives them the chance to find out first hand what the initiatives mean for them," Mr Gosche said today.

The fono will be held in:  
·Te Akapuanga Hall, Cannons Creek, Porirua, 2.30 pm 11 July (today)  
·Avondale College, 203 Rosebank Rd, Avondale, 10 am 12 July  
·Otahuhu College School Hall, Mangere Rd, Mangere, 2.30 pm 12 July and  
·Enderley Park Community Centre, 66 Tennyson Rd, Hamilton 11 am 20 July.

"There were some major Pacific funding plans announced in this year's Budget including $2 million for English as a second language assistance for Pacific students, more than a five-fold increase on last year, and $3.2 million for intensive home visits by health professionals – up nearly 150 percent on the previous year."

"Many of the funding ideas behind the Budget came from the Pacific community themselves. In the lead up to the Budget more than 5000 Pacific representatives from around the country identified their plans of action for the future."

"These programmes of action and government's willingness to work alongside Pacific peoples, signify a new partnership between Pacific communities and government."

"These fono will continue to strengthen that relationship."'
