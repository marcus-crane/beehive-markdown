Alliance deputy leader Sandra Lee has paid tribute to veteran trade union leader Frank Barnard whose funeral will be held in Auckland tomorrow (eds: 10.30am, Thursday 19 July, Saint Matthew-in-the-city, Auckland city).

"Frank Barnard's life embodied the finest traditional values of leadership, loyalty and strength in the face of adversity, " Ms Lee said.

"He was one of a group of 1951 lockout veterans who challenged the ruling regime at the height of its authoritarian powers," she said.

"He cemented a place in New Zealand history by earning widespread respect as the long serving President of the Auckland and Tomoana Freezing Workers Union, now the Meat union of Aotearoa.

"Frank Barnard was a personal friend," Ms Lee said. "He was a Freeman's Bay identity in Auckland, and even in retirement he defended the interests of working people by fighting against the privatisation of community assets."
