The Minister for State Owned Enterprises Mark Burton said he is seeking a satisfactory and swift outcome to the current issues involving the Board of New Zealand Post.

"I am taking this matter very seriously, and I have delayed my departure on a Ministerial visit to Australia for two days, in order to attend to this situation.

"I have tasked officials with gathering together all the relevant information.

"I intend to be in possession of all the facts, as my powers to act in regard to the boards of SOEs are limited in range, but serious in their consequences.

"While I appreciate the high level of public and media interest, I anticipate being engaged in meetings and consultations right through this evening and I will not be making any further comment today."
