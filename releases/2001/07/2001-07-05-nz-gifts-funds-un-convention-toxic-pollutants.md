Environment Minister, Marian Hobbs, today presented the visiting Head of the United Nations Environment Programme, Dr Klaus Töpfer, with $US30,000 to support work to reduce toxic pollutants worldwide.

New Zealand recently signed the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants which aims to protect human health and the environment from some of the world's most dangerous pollutants.

The cheque will go to the interim secretariat, established to hasten the adoption of the Convention by countries around the world.

"Our gift is a symbol of the New Zealand government's commitment to the UNEP and the valuable work it is doing, amongst other things, to reduce toxic pollutants worldwide," Marian Hobbs said.

"It is critical that New Zealand support this important work. Environmental problems don't recognise national borders and UNEP is working for a healthy planet. The money we are contributing today is a significant commitment for New Zealand to the overall programme."

The presentation was made at a luncheon at which Dr Töpfer appointed yachtsman/adventurer Sir Peter Blake a special envoy to the United Nations Environment Programme.

Marian Hobbs congratulated Sir Peter on his appointment.

"It is significant that the UNEP, a leader in international environmental endeavours, has recognised one of New Zealand's icons of leadership," she added. "Sir Peter's appointment reflects well on his achievements and the contribution both he and his new venture, 'Blakexpeditions', are making to our awareness of the world around us."

Dr Töpfer will visit Wellington tomorrow (Friday) where he will meet senior government officials, give an address on global environmental issues and visit the Karori Wildlife Sanctuary, the Otari Reserve,and the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research.
