Cullen meets Standard & Poors and Singapore International Airlines

Minister of Finance Michael Cullen said he had a good exchange of views with Standard and Poor's Asian headquarters in Singapore.

"There seems to be a good understanding of the fiscal and monetary policies of the New Zealand Government. Standard and Poor's are visiting New Zealand in August for their regular review but on the basis of today's meeting I am confident our present rating will be confirmed."

Dr Cullen also said he had had a meeting with Singapore International Airlines Chairman, Dr Cheong at the latter's request.

"Dr Cheong confirmed the details of the SIA request to government in relation to Air New Zealand. These details were the same as those already understood to be the case on the part of myself and the other key ministers", Dr Cullen said.
