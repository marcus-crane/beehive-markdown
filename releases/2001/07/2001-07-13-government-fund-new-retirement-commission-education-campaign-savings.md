"The government will provide $1.5 million a year on an on-going basis for a campaign by the Retirement Commission to improve how New Zealanders manage their money," Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey made the announcement at a Symposium on Saving and Retirement hosted by the Commission in Wellington.

"The Labour-Alliance government is committed to maintaining universal New Zealand Superannuation from age 65 at 65 percent of the after-tax average wage for a couple.

"The proposed New Zealand Superannuation Fund will anchor this objective. But it is also important that we save for ourselves if we want to maintain a higher living standard than the pension alone can provide," Mr Maharey said.

"Research results show that the campaigns run by the Retirement Commission have galvanised people into taking action. However many find their ability to save for their retirement is restricted by poor financial decisions or lack of long-term planning earlier in their working lives.

"The new education programme will emphasise the importance of good financial management throughout life."

It would be targeted at school age and tertiary students as well as at members of the workforce and would provide advice on such matters as:

\* setting goals to improve your earning capacity and net worth  
\* financial planning and budgeting  
\* managing debt  
\* saving for future needs  
\* selecting appropriate savings and investment vehicles.

Stage One would be launched in September, Mr Maharey said.
