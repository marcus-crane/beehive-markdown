Health Minister Annette King says District Health Boards need members who have a genuine interest in a wide range of health issues.

Nominations for the DHB elections open today, 27 July, and close at noon on 24 August. DHB elections will coincide with the local government elections on October 13.

Major health service decisions would now become the responsibility of individual communities, and Mrs King said it was important that DHBs had "a local voice".

"But candidates need to be clear that we do not want 'single-issue' people or advocates for any one group in society," she said.

"All members of the DHBs will be responsible for the health of the whole population. I hope that electors will be looking for people who have the objectivity and integrity to balance any of their own particular interests with the wider health and disability needs of the community."

Successive governments have appointed health boards, and Mrs King believes many have worked through difficult times and served with great diligence. She says board members have been extremely competent, and most have worked very hard.

"But it is time that local communities again elect the people they want to run local health services - they belong to the people after all.

"We are going to need many of the skills that past and current board members have, but we would like to see the boards strengthened by a greater mix of backgrounds and skills.

"The perspective of many cultural groups in our society would be very valuable on the boards. I have great respect for Maori, Pacific, Asian and other cultures and, when such people are represented, the boards will be stronger and more in touch with the health needs of the community."

Mrs King said she would like to see a range of people stand, because the people whose health was the poorest needed greater representation.

"Ideally the DHBs need members with skills in governance, health, community services, disability support and business. To gather all these skills, and others, will mean board members need to come from a wide variety of backgrounds," she said.

It would also be good to see more women standing for election. "Although we have improved the gender balance over the last year, there are still more than twice as many men on the district health boards as women. I'd like to see a better range of ages too - we need younger board members as well as more senior citizens."

This year the first-past-the-post system of voting for local body election includes DHB constituencies. This means there is provision for board members to be elected by local communities and special interest groups, and it allows rural areas to be represented.

"The system isn't perfect, but it will help to ensure that the members come from a wide cross-section of the community," Mrs King said.

"There are many people in our communities who could be excellent district health board members. I urge you to stand yourself or to support the nominations of the people you would like to see helping to make health service decisions."
