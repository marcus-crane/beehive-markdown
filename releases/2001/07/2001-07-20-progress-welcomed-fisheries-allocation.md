Maori Affairs Minister, and acting Fisheries Minister, Parekura Horomia has welcomed the news of progress in the allocation and distribution of the Treaty of Waitangi fisheries assets.

Mr Horomia made his comment in response to today's announcement by Te Ohu Kaimoana (Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission) that it will begin consultation over a proposed method of allocation before the end of the year.

"The Commission is aware of the intense pressure to allocate and I think the latest announcement is a good sign that progress is being made.

Te Ohu Kaimoana said it intends to develop a discussion document within the next few months and begin consultation before the end of the year. The Commission also said that it has been working on a number of options, including allocating pre-settlement assets and distributing the benefits from post settlement assets at the same time.

"This consultation round is important because the Commission must prove it has significant levels of support for the allocation model, before it can present the model to Government. I am also optimistic that the mediation process, facilitated by the Commission, will contribute to a sustainable solution," said Mr Horomia

Mr Horomia said he looked forward to the time when the wider Maori community will feel the benefits of owning around $900 million worth of New Zealand's fisheries assets
