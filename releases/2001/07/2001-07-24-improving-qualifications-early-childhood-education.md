The Government's programme for improved qualifications in early childhood education gained further impetus today.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced that five training providers have been contracted to assist up to 1,500 current staff to gain a Diploma of Teaching (Early Childhood Education).

The Auckland College of Education, Waiariki Institute of Technology, Wellington College of Education, Te Tari Puna Ora O Aotearoa/New Zealand Childcare Association and the Christchurch College of Education have all signed agreements to provide assessments and flexible study programmes.

Trevor Mallard said $2.25 million had been made available by the Government for the initiative. The funding is in addition to incentive grants and scholarships announced earlier.

"Research tells us that improving qualifications in early childhood will help considerably in our efforts to provide quality learning outcomes for our young children.

"That's why Cabinet made the decision last year to require 'persons responsible' in centre-based services and co-ordinators in home-based care networks to hold a Diploma of Teaching (ECE) or another qualification of an equivalent or higher level.

"In making this change, It was important to recognise the skills and knowledge of staff already working in early childhood services. The announcement today results from input by a small working party of people from the ECE teacher education sector.

"I am confident that it provides a fair way of helping people already working in the sector to update their qualifications to support the Government's aim to improve quality in early childhood education," Trevor Mallard said.
