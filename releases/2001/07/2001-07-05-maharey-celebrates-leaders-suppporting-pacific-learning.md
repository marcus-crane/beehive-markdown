Maharey celebrates leaders in supporting Pacific learning

"The government is committed to increasing participation by Pacific peoples in tertiary education," Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education) Steve Maharey told the annual Fono of the National Association of Tangata Pasifiki in Tertiary Education today.

Mr Maharey released Fakahoa Te Utuga: Supporting Pasifika Achievement, a document outlining initiatives taken in the tertiary sector to improve the recruitment, retention and performance of Pacific tertiary students.

The information was collected from seven institutions - six in the greater Auckland area \[home to 65 percent of the Pacific population in New Zealand], and one in Wellington \[home to about 15 percent.]

"All the institutions recognised the desirability of increasing Pacific student numbers given the demographics of their location. In this respect, recruitment strategies are seen to be important.

"We also need to provide appropriate role models by attracting Pacific teaching staff," Mr Maharey said.

"This year for the first time the government provided institutions with additional funding, in the form of a special supplementary grant, to provide increased support for Pacific students.

"We hope these grants will be used to emulate the best practices illustrated in Fakahoa Te Utuga," Steve Maharey said.

A similar booklet relating to Maori students - Hei Tautoko I Nga Wawata Maori - was released last month.
