Education Minister Trevor Mallard is encouraging people to make submissions to the Ministerial Working Party on Gifted Education.

The working party is providing the government with advice on setting up a policy framework for the education of gifted and talented students in early childhood and compulsory education.

"Many New Zealand schools are already meeting the needs of these students in positive ways, and a good deal of support is available to help them," Trevor Mallard said.

"However, we need to be able to guarantee that all gifted and talented students will have their needs met in mainstream schools. I have asked the working party to advise me on how we can best do that."

When the working party, chaired by Roger Moltzen of Waikato University, met for the first time recently it said it would welcome public submissions focussed around three key questions:

· What are the core principles that should underpin educational provision for gifted and talented students in New Zealand?  
· What should be the policy and funding framework for educating those students from early childhood education through to the end of secondary schooling, and what programmes and provisions should the government realistically support?  
· What level of teacher knowledge and skill is necessary for the framework to have maximum impact, and what steps need to be taken to achieve this?

"There are people who hold strong views about the education of children who have special gifts and talents and we want to hear from them," Trevor Mallard said.

The working party is to due to make its recommendations to the Minister of Education by 30 November 2001. Submissions should be sent by 18 July to: Working Party on Gifted Education, c/- Learning and Evaluation Policy, Ministry of Education, P O Box 1666, Wellington.
