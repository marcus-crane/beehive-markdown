Councils' performance in implementing the Resource Management Act has remained good for three years running, according to the latest Ministry for the Environment survey.

A number of councils have made improvements in their RMA performance and the number who consistently reported high-quality results from year to year has increased.

Environment Minister, Marian Hobbs, said the annual survey of local authorities, which she released today, was a useful indicator of how local government was meeting its RMA responsibilities.

"Many will have heard or read a great deal of anecdote about problems with the RMA," Marian Hobbs said. "While some of these claims need to be looked at further, hard data, such as that collected in this survey, shows that for many thousands of New Zealanders, getting a resource consent from their local council is far from difficult."

The fifth survey in the series covers the 1999 to 2000 financial year, with data based on information collected from New Zealand's 86 local authorities.

The report shows that for three consecutive years, only five percent of resource consent applications were notified, less than one percent of resource consent applications were declined and one percent of resource consent decisions were appealed. For the past two years, local authorities have been processing 82 percent of resource consent applications within statutory time limits, Marian Hobbs said.

Local authorities processed 48,045 consents during the year - 1107 less than the previous year, though applications for resource consents were down by 755 over the year before.

"The RMA is about protecting our environment from pollution and uncontrolled waste - not about impeding sensible development or stopping communities from making decisions on issues that affect them," Marian Hobbs said. "Clearly, local authorities and the RMA are doing a good job in achieving that much needed balance and communities are seeing the benefits."

A strong improvement was made in the percentage of publicly notified resource consents processed within statutory time limits, and increasing numbers of councils are adopting the good practice procedures promoted in the survey. These procedures are aimed at improving efficiency and consistency in resource consent processing.

"Councils are consistently meeting timeframes, which is not just good news for the community, it is also good for business."

Marian Hobbs acknowledged that some of the criticism of how the Act has been implemented may be valid and has encouraged local authorities to use the reported results to consider their RMA performance.

"We need to ask ourselves continually, 'what can be done better?' if we are to make the process work well, without compromising the quality of the environmental decisions we make."

This year, the Ministry for the Environment will undertake in-depth studies of aspects of performance under the RMA, while the council survey will now become biennial. First examples of these studies include a project with the Department of Courts to look at further ways to reduce delays at the Environment Court, and a project with the Ministry of Transport, Transit NZ and the Auckland Regional Council to look more closely at what causes delays for roading projects under the RMA.

"In some areas, we need to do more work to be certain that we are achieving the best possible results. These in-depth studies will allow us to identify where more attention might be needed," Marian Hobbs said.

Last month it was announced that the Environment Court would get an additional judge and extra funding of $2.1 million over three years to alleviate pressures on the caseload, and to help clear the current backlog.
