New Zealand will back the launch of a World Trade Organisation round later this year, and the Government is committed to widespread consultations on New Zealand's position, Acting Trade Negotiations Minister Phil Goff said today.

Cabinet agreed last Monday on New Zealand's objectives for the November WTO Ministerial Meeting in Qatar. Mr Goff said WTO members are currently discussing the possible issues to include in a WTO round.

"The main issue in Qatar will be whether to launch a new multilateral trade round. New Zealand will be supporting a new round. This is our major trade policy priority for the year.

"The stakes for New Zealand are high. Our exporters face continuing barriers to international markets, especially in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, which make up over 60 percent of our exports. That has an impact on our economic performance and ultimately on job opportunities for New Zealanders."

Mr Goff said Cabinet had endorsed objectives to guide New Zealand negotiations in Qatar. The Cabinet paper as agreed by Ministers was being released to provide the basis for consultations with the full range of stakeholders, including New Zealand business, unions, and non-government organisations with trade interests, he said.

"Right now, we're focusing on getting a round launched. The devil is always in the detail. When we know the agenda's scope we will be able to start consultations on the detailed negotiating positions required in each area. We will continue to consult at each step of the process after that," Mr Goff said.

The Minister urged anyone with an interest in trade issues to read the Cabinet paper.

Copies will be put on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade's website (www.mft.govt.nz) , and will be available from the Ministry's Trade Negotiations Division (phone 04 494 8500).
