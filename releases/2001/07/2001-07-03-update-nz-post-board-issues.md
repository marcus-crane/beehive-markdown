The Minister for State Owned Enterprises Mark Burton said he is dealing with the issues surrounding the New Zealand Post Board.

"Work is continuing today within my office, with my officials, and of course between Board members, in seeking a credible and durable solution.

"I will be making no further comment today, but I expect a clear course of action will be identified before I leave for Australia early on Thursday morning.

"However, at this stage, I would emphasise that all options continue to remain open," Mark Burton said.
