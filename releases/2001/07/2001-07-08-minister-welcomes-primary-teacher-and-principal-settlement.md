Education Minister Trevor Mallard welcomed the settlement of the primary teacher and principal collective agreements as a triumph of good process leading to great outcomes.

"The settlements reflect the importance of primary teachers as professionals, and principals as their professional leaders," Trevor Mallard says.

"Primary teachers and principals have negotiated more than just pay settlements. They have negotiated terms and conditions that will help teachers and principals excel, and therefore help enhance learning outcomes for students.

"Agreement on issues such as a tutor teacher allowance will encourage our most experienced teachers to help their new colleagues. Incentives to attract teachers to low decile and hard to staff schools will motivate teachers to work in areas of greatest need.

"Provision for paid study leave and sabbatical opportunities will also support teachers and principals to develop their skills and bring those skills back to the classroom.

"A government-subsidised superannuation scheme is another important part of the settlement.

"I am delighted at both the outcome of the negotiations, and the way in which the Ministry of Education and NZEI worked constructively through the negotiation process.

"The agreement is a triumph for teachers, and the good faith bargaining provisions of the new Employment Relations Act," Trevor Mallard says.
