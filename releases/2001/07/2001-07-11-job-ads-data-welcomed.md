Job ads data welcomed - Maharey

"The ANZ job ads series showing a sharp increase in advertising levels last month is another welcome indication that the unemployment rate will remain low," the Minister of Social Services and Employment, Steve Maharey, said today.

"National job ad numbers are now at a record high. This is good news for the economy, and for job seekers.

"It is also good news for the government as we try to lift the skills of the New Zealand workforce and to expand economic opportunity," Mr Maharey said.

The government provided another $56 million over four years in the 2001 budget to create an additional 17,000 industry training places. The budget also contained a $34.35 million regional and business development package and a $100 million capital investment fund.

"But there is a limit to what the government can achieve on its own. For best results, we need to work in partnership with a vibrant private sector," Mr Maharey said.
