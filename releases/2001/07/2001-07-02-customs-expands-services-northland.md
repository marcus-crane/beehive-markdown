Northland businesses will get more help with import and export rules thanks to a new position in the region which as part of the New Zealand Customs Service.

Acting Customs Minister Jim Anderton says regions need help to capitalise on their economic growth and the new Customs Service position is a sign of confidence in the economic future of Northland.

"Northland is a region where there is tremendous potential. The government is already involved in working in partnership with local people on a number of regional development initiatives.

"Basing a Customs officer in Whangarei will provide more practical help for growing businesses, " says Jim Anderton.

Customs has already built a working partnership with New Zealand Yachts in Whangarei, to facilitate the import of components for super yachts, under the FrontLine programme.

FrontLine sees Customs and individual businesses developing an understanding of each other's tasks and problems and looking for practical solutions.

Customs FrontLine co-ordinator, Deborah Bradley, starts work today.

Deborah has been with the Customs Service for over 20 years, working mostly in Goods Management. She says her experience in this area will enable her to assist new and existing businesses in Northland to better understand "what we do and how we do it".

"One of the exciting aspects of my new position is being able to meet our clients in person, so that I can better understand their business and how I can assist them to achieve their goals," says Deborah.

Dover Samuels, Under-Secretary for Economic Development and MP for Te Tai Tokerau welcomes the appointment, "This shows that this Government sees the importance of Northland and other regions for our overall economy. I know this will be of great benefit in assisting growing Maori businesses to export".
