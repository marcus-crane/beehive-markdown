Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton pays tribute to kiwi ingenuity and launches a new kiwi built airplane in Hamilton.

It's not every day that a New Zealand-designed and built aeroplane is produced.  
Pacific Aerospace has a proud record from its beginnings in the 1950s and is a successful New Zealand high-technology company.

Planes like the Fletcher top-dresser are almost as much a part of New Zealand's rural identity as Number Eight fencing wire. And the company has worked on componentry for companies like Boeing and Airbus, as well as for the ANZAC frigates and even the US Marines.

I pay tribute to you, because New Zealand needs more – far more – high-tech, high-value, high skill exports that the rest of the world wants to buy.

New Zealanders are the most creative and innovative people in the world. I'm told that the new aeroplane was designed by adapting ideas coming up from workers on the shop floor.

That is a typically New Zealand story, and it is part of the secret of our innovation: Practical people, prepared to give things a go.

As I understand it, it has been built to be rugged, simple and practical. That sounds like a description of New Zealanders ourselves.

I congratulate you for your success in creating this aeroplane and I pay tribute to the innovation and perseverance that has brought it about.

I want to close by assuring you that the Labour-Alliance Coalition Government is here to work in partnership with you in developing further opportunities.

The Government welcomes innovation and business success, and the jobs and export earnings that success will bring.

I am passionately committed to this country's success and the Government will play its role in helping you to succeed.

I wish you all the best for the success of this new aeroplane, and I am very proud to formally launch it.
