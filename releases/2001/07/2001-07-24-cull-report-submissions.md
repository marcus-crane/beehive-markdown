Health Minister Annette King says the Ministry of Health has received 51 submissions on the recommendations in the Helen Cull report on adverse events, including a number about the concept of a 'one-stop shop'.

A one-stop shop was one of the major recommendations of the Cull report, which Mrs King commissioned following publicity about patient concerns in Northland and elsewhere.

When releasing the report in March, she said that, under current arrangements, making complaints against health professionals was often cumbersome and confusing, because of the number of organisations that could be involved.

Mrs King welcomed the recommendation of a more streamlined complaints system, where complaints could be made "as easily, speedily and painlessly as possible", and called for submissions about the one-stop shop proposal and other recommendations.

She said today the Ministry had received a total of 51 submissions, ranging from amendments to the Health and Disability Commission Act and ACC legislation, to commentary on the current complaints processes and the concept of a one-stop shop. Included in the 51 submissions were 20 from professional organisations, 13 from members of the public, and six from community organisations.

Deborah Woodley, Manager Health Services Policy for the Ministry of Health, had informed Mrs King that these submissions had been summarised, and this summary was due to be sent to submitters and posted on the Ministry's website shortly.

Mrs King said an analysis of the summary had also been sent to the team working on the Omnibus Bill, which the Government intended to introduce this year, and she expected to receive a report on appropriate options and actions soon.

The Bill would be split into two parts, with the first part passed this year. That part was expected to deal with the immediate amendments proposed by the Cull report, including mandatory reporting of bad practice and temporary suspension of practitioners. The second half of the Bill would deal with less pressing issues.
