Confidence rebound augurs well for economy

"The seasonally adjusted rebound in the Quarterly Survey of Business Opinion to plus 16 percent in the June quarter is significant and bodes well for economic growth in the second half of this year," Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

"Manufacturers expectations about their export sales for the next three months have risen eight points to 38 percent.

"This suggests that the trade balance will remain strong following the record $3.23 billion export receipts recorded in May," Dr Cullen said.
