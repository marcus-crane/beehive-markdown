Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that Sir Peter Blake has been appointed a special envoy of the United Nations Environment Programme.

Helen Clark, who was speaking at a luncheon for Dr Klaus Töpfer, the visiting Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, said Sir Peter was the first New Zealander to be chosen as a goodwill ambassador for the UNEP.

"The appointment is a great honour for Sir Peter and New Zealand. It reflects Sir Peter's longstanding commitment towards the environment, as illustrated, for example, by his efforts in support of the international campaign to end commercial whaling, a cause New Zealand strongly supports.

"As a UNEP special envoy, Sir Peter will be at the forefront of global efforts to improve and protect the environment. The New Zealand Government is very supportive of his advocacy."

Helen Clark also jointly announced, with Environment Minister Marian Hobbs, a US$30,000 New Zealand government contribution to the UNEP programme to eradicate persistent organic pollutants, or POPs.

"New Zealand has already taken measures to stop the import and the domestic manufacture of persistent organic pollutants. We are now working on reducing their discharge into the environment from historically contaminated sites, and current industrial and domestic sources.

"New Zealand has a strong record on international environment issues. We strongly endorse and support the work of the United Nations Environment Programme to improve and protect the global environment," Helen Clark said.
