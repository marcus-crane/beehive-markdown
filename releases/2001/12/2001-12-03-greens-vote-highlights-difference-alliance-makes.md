The Greens’ abstention on the re-purchase of Air New Zealand and secure Superannuation emphasises the difference the Alliance makes in Government, Alliance leader and deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton says.

He was commenting on the Green Party’s decision to abstain on an Imprest Supply Bill tomorrow.

“This vote helps to emphasise the difference the Alliance makes in Government. The Greens’ decision to abstain shows that they will not help to achieve policies of public ownership and secure incomes for vulnerable New Zealanders.”

Jim Anderton said he doubted the Greens’ decision would affect the stability of the Government.

“The position of the Labour-Alliance Coalition Government will not change, so the Greens’ action is only symbolic, although the Greens have stridently increased their anti-Government rhetoric in recent days.

“They are entitled to vote for their policy, but it is difficult to see why the Green Party has a policy of opposing stable government, secure superannuation and public ownership of our airline.

“The Alliance does support a secure retirement income for all New Zealanders, and we support public ownership of Air New Zealand, so the Alliance will be voting for the Imprest Supply Bill.

“It is worth recording, again, that the Alliance’s participation in the Coalition Government has helped to make these policies possible,” Jim Anderton said.
