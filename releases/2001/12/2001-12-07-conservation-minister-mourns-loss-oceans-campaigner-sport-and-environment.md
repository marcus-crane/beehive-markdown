Conservation Minister Sandra Lee has added to the tributes being paid today to Sir Peter Blake who was killed in a shooting in Amazonia after his vessel was attacked by pirates.  
"It is a tragedy that Sir Peter's work as a global conservationist has been cut short, " Ms Lee said. "New Zealand mourns the loss of an oceans campaigner in sport and for the environment.  
"It is a tribute to Sir Peter that after being heaped with plaudits for his yachting triumphs, he chose to give something back to the natural environment that had sustained him during his sporting career."  
Sir Peter was still involved in New Zealand's defence of the America's Cup in 1997 when he took on the task of promoting international awareness of the environment, initially through the Cousteau Society, as Jacques Cousteau's chosen successor.  
Last year he founded 'blakexpeditions' to undertake voyages to sensitive areas of the world that are the key to the planet's ecosystem, with a mission to help protect life in, on and around the waters of the world through the production of television programmes and educational resources.  
Earlier this year, Sir Peter's environmental and conservation work was recognised when he was appointed a United Nations Environmental Programme special envoy.  
"The greatest accolade that people can give to Sir Peter, not just in New Zealand but throughout the world, is to heed his message that we all need to take greater care of our environment."  
Sir Peter's log entry for Thursday, which has been made public, includes the following comment: *"The quality of water and the quality of life in all its infinite forms are critical parts of the overall ongoing health of this planet of ours—not just here in the Amazon—but everywhere…"*
