The United States’ announcement today of its withdrawal from the Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty, signed between the US and the USSR in 1972, is disappointing, Disarmament and Arms Control Minister Matt Robson said today.

“The US decision signals that it is moving toward the implementation of the proposed National Missile Defence System, says Matt Robson.

“While we acknowledge the ABM treaty is an imperfect instrument for nuclear disarmament, our fear now is that the US decision holds the potential to see a new form of arms race based on 21st century technology, on earth and in space.

“It is important for all of the nuclear powers to now actively strengthen disarmament and arms control measures through the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which requires the nuclear powers to abolish their nuclear arsenal, so we can eventually eliminate the scourge of nuclear weaponry.

“New Zealand will continue to pursue our nuclear disarmament policies with our New Agenda partners and to make our views known to the nuclear powers,” says Matt Robson.
