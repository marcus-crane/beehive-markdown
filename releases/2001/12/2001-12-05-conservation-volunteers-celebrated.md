Minister of Conservation Sandra Lee today acknowledged the contributions of volunteers, as New Zealand commemorated International Year of Volunteers--2001.  
Ms Lee was in Christchurch at a ceremony held to recognise the achievements of about 2600 volunteers in the Canterbury region. The ceremony was one of a number of nationwide events, organised by the Department of Conservation to acknowledge the contribution of conservation volunteers.  
The United Nations designated 2001 as the International Year of Volunteers, which officially ends today on New Zealand's National Volunteer Day. The Department of Conservation joins other agencies and organisations, both nationally and internationally, to celebrate and acknowledge the work of volunteers.  
"Volunteers play a significant role in conservation within New Zealand and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their efforts. Nationwide, in the past year about 10,000 conservation volunteers worked for more than 23,000 days across the country. Volunteers come from all ages and backgrounds and bring a tremendous wealth of knowledge, skills and passion to the job," Ms Lee said.  
"Major conservation achievements have been made possible by the efforts of volunteers. This work helps conserve New Zealand's natural and historic heritage, not just for this generation but for generations to come."  
Canterbury volunteers who have regularly contributed their time and energy to conservation projects have been invited on a guided cruise of Lyttelton Harbour, aboard the 'Black Cat'.  
During the cruise, the Minister of Conservation will present volunteers with a certificate of appreciation, a letter of thanks from the Director-General of Conservation, and a small publication of volunteer insights, poems, experiences and profiles. The book is a tribute to the efforts, enthusiasm and dedication of all conservation volunteers.  
"As Conservation Minister, I find the commitment of volunteers reassuring as it shows that many New Zealanders care about protecting our natural taonga (treasures)," Ms Lee said.
