Helen Clark said today that the government would be working with Lady Pippa Blake and her representatives on arrangements for a memorial service in New Zealand to honour Sir Peter’s life and achievements.

“I have spoken with Pippa this morning. She is overwhelmed by the support which has come to her and her family from New Zealand and around the world.

“It is her wish that Sir Peter be buried in Emsworth, the village in South England where they have made their home together, and then she and her family intend to proceed to New Zealand for a memorial service in Auckland before Christmas.

“Dates cannot yet be precise because of her desire to see the crew of the Seamaster fly to the United Kingdom for the funeral.

“I have asked the Department of Internal Affairs to work with representatives of the family on arrangements in accordance with their wishes,” Helen Clark said.
