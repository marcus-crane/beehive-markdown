More than 7,000 children will be sharing their view of life in New Zealand with each other as part of the Agenda for Children programme, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

The youngsters, who all answered the Government's call to contribute to the Agenda for Children programme, are to receive a special booklet summarising all submissions to the project since it was launched in April 2001. Consultation on the Agenda for Children was jointly led by Social Services Minister Steve Maharey and Youth Affairs Minister Laila Harré and took place between April and June.

Steve Maharey said the Government was overwhelmed by the response.

"Nearly 7500 children and young people and hundreds of adults sent us their views and ideas. Children sent us drawings, videos, essays, activity sheets, and letters.

"The Agenda for Children was a practical way for the Government to help achieve its vision of New Zealand as a great place for children.

"It involved an extensive consultation phase including face to face meetings, focus groups, hui, fono and written submissions from children, young people and adults. The publications being released today (attached), one specially designed for children and a second one for adults who made submissions, complete the consultation phase and provide an opportunity to share what children, young people and adults had to say.

"The children had some really interesting things to say, like (for more comments see the summary):

- it's fun being young. We get to play, do sports and have fun in the way adults don't
- there is too much bullying in schools and playgrounds and on the streets
- more than anything else, we want more to do! Like playgrounds and skateboard parks, libraries and leisure centres and theme parks too.

"All responses are being considered as the Government formulates its plan of action. We look forward to reporting our response next year," Steve Maharey said.
