The government has announced a package of measures to help resolve the issue of a 1920s well that has been leaking water and gas under a New Plymouth home.

Associate Energy Minister Paul Swain says the Crown does not consider it has any liability in this matter but the situation needs someone to take action.

He said the government has already been helping in a number of ways.

“The government is meeting the rental costs of the family who have had to move out of their home while the problem is being sorted out, and in addition has contributed up to $12 000 to studies aimed at finding a way to fix the leak and likely costs.

“Cabinet has agreed, on an ex-gratia and without prejudice basis to meet 75% of the cost of re-plugging the well fixing the problem, providing the remaining 25% is met by other parties.

“Local MP Harry Duynhoven has been leading the charge on the issue, I am pleased that given Harry’s persistence we have arrived at this point.

“The Ministry of Economic Development is currently working with interested parties to select the best method to plug the well and obtain quotes for the work. This should be completed by the end of January.

“The government’s offer is designed to make fast progress. It is now up to the other parties involved to chip in the remainder so that we can get closure on this issue and some sense of normality for the family who have been forced out of their home.

“I have asked MED officials to work with the local MP Harry Duynhoven and the New Plymouth Mayor to coordinate contributions from the other parties,” Paul Swain said.
