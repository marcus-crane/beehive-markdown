Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said Maoridom is poorer for the loss of Te Arawa koroua Bishop Manuhuia Augustus Bennett and Ngati Kuri (Te Aupouri, Te Rarawa) kuia Dame Miraka Raharuhi Petricevich Szaszy.

“Manu Bennett and Mira Szaszy have both made such a significant impact in the development of their whanau, hapu, iwi and Maoridom as a whole. Their work so many areas that it is impossible to list. Suffice to say Mira was made a Dame of the British Empire and Manu was a member of the Waitangi Tribunal.”

“I was lucky enough to know both kaumatua very well and I was deeply saddened to hear the news of their deaths, especially within hours of each other.”

“Mira was always elegant, eloquent and commanded respect no matter where she was. In saying that she was never a pushover. Manu was born into a family of leaders. He as not afraid to give me wise counsel, for events like the Hui Taumata Matauranga in Taupo and the Young Maori Leaders Conference in Wellington”

“I, along with many people around the country, send my aroha to the families of both Dame Mira and Bishop Bennett.

Dame Mira will lie in state at Waiora marae at Ngataki (approximately one hour north of Kaitaia). Bishop Bennett will lie in state at Tamatekapua marae at Ohinemutu, Rotorua.
