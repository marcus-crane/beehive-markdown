Tourism Minister Mark Burton is today continuing his active support for Tourism in New Zealand, by officiating in Queenstown at the opening of a new development at one of New Zealand's best known tourism attractions.

A new viewing platform is being opened at AJ Hackett Bungy's operation at the Kawarau Bridge. This is the first stage of a planned $3 million visitor development at the site, which will include an underground visitor centre, offering a 'Virtual Bungy' experience.

"AJ Hackett is one of New Zealand's most innovative and respected tourism companies", Mark Burton said. "Kawarau Bridge was the world's first commercial bungy operation, and this new investment demonstrates the company's confidence in the future growth of the tourism industry. I share that optimism."

Tomorrow and Saturday Mark Burton will have meetings in Fiordland with the board of Tourism New Zealand, tourism industry leaders and senior travel and tourism business leaders from the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia.

"The New Zealand Tourism Strategy earlier this year identified the need for greater partnership between the public and private sector," Mark Burton said. "The impact of September 11th on global tourism has only served to reinforce this need.

"My recent tourism-related visits to China and Japan, the $2 million government funding boost for tourism promotion in Japan, the enhancements of Tourism New Zealand announced yesterday, and tomorrow's meetings with key industry players, are all part of this government's commitment to a partnership approach in Tourism".
