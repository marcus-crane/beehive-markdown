A $13.7m funding package for caregivers and foster parents has been announced today to rectify long term underpayments to families and organisations looking after children on behalf of the state.

Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said that during the development of Child, Youth and Family’s new care strategy the department identified that some caregivers have been underpaid. Around 4000 individual caregivers working directly with Child, Youth and Family may be affected by the issue along with some caregivers working with other non-governmental organisations around the country.

Steve Maharey said the government acted quickly once the underpayments were identified, providing $11.5 million for the reimbursement of caregivers for historic underpayments made since 1995 this financial year, and $2.2 million annually on an ongoing basis to make sure they are paid the right rate.

“Caregivers provide an incredibly important service to the community and it is essential that we reimburse them as quickly as possible.

“I am deeply concerned about this situation that has been going on for some years, but the government’s speedy funding injection shows that we are absolutely determined to put things right.

“At this stage it is not clear how much each individual caregiver will be reimbursed. Child, Youth and Family is currently undertaking a major exercise to liase directly with all the caregivers and caregiver organisations on its database to sort out the level of money owed for past services.

“The funding package agreed to by the Cabinet also means that all caregivers will receive the proper rates for current services in the future,” Steve Maharey said.
