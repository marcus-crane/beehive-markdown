Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia said I am pleased to acknowledge the appointment to the District Health Boards of the Maori representatives announced by Health Minister Annette King today.

“These appointments follow the first DHB elections. We have made signifcant progress towards ensuring that whanau, hapu and iwi participate in every level of the decision making in DHBs. Through the needs assessment process, service delivery, planning, evaluation and in governance processes.

“While acknowledging our achievements, both government and hapu and iwi must continue to improve the systems to ensure that manawhenua are able to exercise rangatiratanga and positively contribute to the health of whanau, hapu and iwi as well as all New Zealanders.

“While we know there are ways we can work smarter, to improve the processes I am pleased with this attempt at achieving some balance in the DHBs to ensure provision of health services are accessible to all.

“DHBs have responsibility for improving Maori health outcomes. To achieve this all DHBs need to develop close working relationships with the hapu and iwi of their region.

“We are engaging in a process of Maori health development that goes beyond supporting Maori providers of health services.

“Improvements in health will come from a healthy partnership, from sitting around the table together and addressing the broader determinants of health for whanau, hapu and iwi and the wider community,” said Tariana Turia.
