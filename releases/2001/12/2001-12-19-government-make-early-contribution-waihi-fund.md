Associate Energy Minister Paul Swain says the government will make an immediate contribution of $10 000 to the Hauraki District Council’s mayoral relief fund for those affected by the subsidence in Waihi.

“That contribution matches the combined contributions made so far by the Hauraki District Council and the Waihi Mining Company,” Paul Swain said.

“The purpose of the mayoral relief fund is to give the local Mayor seeding money to encourage donations from the public toward meeting the immediate needs of those affected.

“Such funds have proved to be a very successful mechanism for alleviating the immediate distress this type of event causes’

“The contribution announced today would not affect any other assistance that government, or other parties, may contribute later on,” Paul Swain said.
