The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister with Auckland Issues, Judith Tizard, today congratulated Biosecurity Minister Jim Sutton for taking action to get the Painted Apple Moth eradication programme underway.

“The Painted Apple Moth represents a great concern to Auckland,” said Judith Tizard. “If it spread, it could be catastrophic for Waitakere, for the Auckland region and for New Zealand.”

Jim Sutton said yesterday he would intervene by exempting the moth eradication programme from the Resource Management Act, meaning it will not have to complly with the Waitakere City Council’s district plan which includes a prohibition against low flying.

The technical advisory group has recommended targeted spraying as the best option. If targeted spraying was unsuccessful, the option of blanket spraying would remain.

“I congratulate Jim Sutton for regarding this as a serious biosecurity issue rather than a resource management process. I know that proper studies needed to be carried out, but there have been too many delays already.

"I'm thrilled with Jim Sutton's action. I know that both the Ministry of Agriculture and Waitakere City Council agree that it has helped bring certainty  
to a difficult situation.

“Everyone agrees that the Painted Apple Moth should be eradicated. It’s important that it happens as soon as possible.”
