The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has engaged an international executive search agency to find a head for New Zealand’s reformed overseas aid agency to be established on 1 July 2002, Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Responsible for Development Cooperation Matt Robson said today.

“The Government’s purpose in establishing the new agency is to build a recognised world leader in development cooperation, says Matt Robson.

“This marks a new direction. My concern is to achieve outcomes which are clearly of long term benefit to the peoples of our partner countries.

“The international search is consistent with the introduction of a new culture into New Zealand’s aid agency. One element of this is the provision of advice to the Government that is directly related to the elimination of poverty and to sustainable economic development overseas.

“The intention is to develop new perspectives and thoroughly modernise New Zealand’s approach to development cooperation,” says Matt Robson.
