A working party has been established to recommend appropriate minimum and maximum salaries for teachers with three-year pre-service teaching degrees and for those who have a degree as well as a teaching diploma.

The setting up of the working party fulfilled an agreement made during the negotiations for the teachers’ collective employment agreements, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

The working party will include representatives from the teacher unions, the NZEI and the PPTA, and from the employers.

“Teacher education providers have been advised of the Government’s wish to differentiate between commencing salaries for teachers with different qualifications,” Trevor Mallard said.

The working party will be convened by the Ministry of Education early next year and will be asked to make its recommendations to the Minister by the end of June. Any change to salaries will affect teachers who begin teaching from 2005.
