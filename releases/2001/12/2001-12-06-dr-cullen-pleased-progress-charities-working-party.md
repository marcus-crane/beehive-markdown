The Charities working party was appointed last month, met for the first time yesterday and is meeting again today.

It is being chaired by Sid Ashton of Ngai Tahu and will report back by the end of February on a registration, reporting and monitoring regime for charities seeking tax free status.

The working party was set up at the instigation of the charitable sector, and because this government has a commitment to consultation and partnership.  
Reaction to both the appointment and the composition of the group has been positive.

Many overseas jurisdictions have registration, reporting and monitoring regimes and our feedback through submissions to the Tax and Charities discussion document was that there is broad acceptance of the idea here.

But we want the best system possible so have asked the working party to come back to us with recommendations on design details, including a threshold to reduce the compliance costs for smaller charities.
