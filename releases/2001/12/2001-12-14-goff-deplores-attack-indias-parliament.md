Foreign Minister Phil Goff said he was appalled by the terrorist attack on the House of Parliament in New Delhi and sent New Zealand’s sympathies and condolences to the people of India.

“This was an outrage and a senseless act of violence. The New Zealand government strongly condemns terrorism in all its forms.

“The fact that the attack was directed at the seat of democracy in India is especially chilling. I am relieved to know that Prime Minister Vajpayee and his parliamentary colleagues are safe, but I am saddened that a number of police have lost their lives and others suffered injuries while defending the parliamentary complex.

“No group has yet claimed responsibility. Several leads are being investigated and we may know more in due course. I hope that this incident will not lead to a further escalation of tensions in that part of the world.

“Grave risks to regional security arise from the on-going volatility in parts of South Asia today. These underline starkly the need for extra determination to seek a peaceful solution to the entrenched problem of Kashmir dispute,” Mr Goff said.
