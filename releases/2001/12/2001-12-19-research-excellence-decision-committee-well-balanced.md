The broad make-up of the committee which will decide who gets a share of the government’s new Centres of Research Excellence fund has been welcomed by Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey.

The CoRE Fund was established in the Budget to establish specialist centres of research excellence which will operate at the leading edge of their field within the international research community. Operating expenditure of $40.6m over four years, and one-off capital funding of $20m for investment in strategic research assets this financial year, has been allocated for the fund which is being managed by the Royal Society of New Zealand. Forty-five applications for funding have been received.

Steve Maharey said the calibre of those appointed to the decision committee will ensure that the CoRE fund meets its aims to foster world class research focused on New Zealand’s future economic and social development.

“Research is fundamental to developing New Zealand as a knowledge society. The CoRE Fund is designed to encourage greater concentration and networking of high quality specialised research resources in the tertiary sector.

“To be successful, applications will have to demonstrate that they will support research that is of excellent (world class) quality, focused on New Zealand’s future economic and social development and that will lead to the transfer of knowledge.

“The decision committee brings together eminent New Zealanders from Maoridom, the research community and the tertiary education sector.

“It is expected that between three and six centres will receive funding in the first round. The successful candidates will be announced in early March,” Steve Maharey said.
