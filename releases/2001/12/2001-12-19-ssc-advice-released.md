Defence Minister Mark Burton has released advice received from the State Services Commissioner Michael Wintringham, following a preliminary review of allegations surrounding the accessing of Ron Mark's military service records.

The advice recommends that the Commissioner refer the preliminary report to the Chief of Defence Force, "as the appropriate authority to take these matters further."

"I met with the Commissioner this afternoon, and I have personally advised Mr Mark that I have accepted the recommendation made by the Commissioner," Mark Burton said.

"The reviewers, Messrs White and Ansell, advised the Commissioner that there were a number of issues they could not resolve, but which required further consideration.

"The Commissioner will therefore refer the evidence gathered to the Chief of Defence Force, for further action.

"These matters could require disciplinary measures, under the authority of the Chief of Defence Force, and must not be subject to political interference.

"It would therefore be inappropriate for me to make any further comment until the Chief of Defence Force has determined what action is now required."
