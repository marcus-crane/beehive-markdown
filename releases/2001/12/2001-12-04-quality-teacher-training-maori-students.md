Teacher education providers need to better equip beginning teachers to teach Mäori students, according to a Te Puni Kökiri report The Quality Of Teacher Training For Teaching Mäori Students released today by Mäori Affairs Minister, Parekura Horomia.

Te Puni Kökiri talked to teacher education providers, school principals, beginning teachers, teacher trainees and Mäori parents to determine how well they equip graduates to teach Mäori students effectively.

Mäori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia says that while some examples of good practice were found, generally most teacher education providers have a lot of work to do to ensure trainees develop the skills needed to teach Mäori students.

“Teachers play an essential role in shaping and developing student abilities, knowledge and attitudes. However low levels of achievement by Mäori in schools is not new and this report provides recommendations to help the education sector meet Mäori students’ needs. ” he says.

Mr Horomia said Te Puni Kökiri and the Ministry of Education have similar aims based around ensuring Mäori students can achieve to the best of their ability and both agencies need to assist providers to make improvements.”
