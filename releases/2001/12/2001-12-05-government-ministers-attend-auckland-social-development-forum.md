“The ministers who will attend the Forum with me are:

\* Parekura Horomia, Minister of Maori Affairs  
\* Laila Harré, Minister of Youth Affairs  
\* Mark Gosche, Minister of Pacific Island Affairs  
\* Lianne Dalziel, Minister of Immigration  
\* Ruth Dyson, Minister for Disability issues.

“Approximately 120 people from community organizations across Auckland have been personally invited to attend the forum. Ministers will participate in workshop sessions on social inclusion and social development; education, employment and community enterprise; immigration, refugee and migrant issues; children and young people; building healthy communities; and community renewal.

“The Auckland Social Development Forum is being hosted by Mayor Bob Harvey and the Waitakere City Council and has been coordinated by the Ministry of Social Development,” Helen Clark said.
