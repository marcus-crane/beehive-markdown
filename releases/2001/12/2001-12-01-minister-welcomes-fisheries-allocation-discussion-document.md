Mäori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia is welcoming today’s release of Te Ohu Kaimoana’s discussion document, He Anga Mua, on possible allocation models of the Mäori Commercial fisheries assets.

Mr Horomia said there are a number of steps that need to be taken before the future of the assets, currently worth around $900 million, can be finalised and today’s hui is one of the important milestones.

“I appointed the Treaty of Waitangi commissioners last July and gave them the deadline of August next year. There are some long standing issues that are being worked out and people must remain focused and fair. I can say that I am encouraged by my talks with the interested parties.”

Mr Horomia said he is pleased to be told by Te Ohu Kaimoana that information workshops about the document will be held over the next two weeks, followed up by consultation hui early next year.

“I want to urge Mäori people to attend the workshops and hui so that they can base their important decisions on as much accurate information as possible. They will also have several months to wananga the issues, before making their submissions by March 15 next year.”

“I, like everyone, am keen to see the benefits of owning such significant assets being shared by all Mäori people as soon as possible. This is a matter of strong leadership. I believe we are closer to allocation than we have ever been before however there is still some way to go and we need to keep ourselves focused,” said Mr Horomia.
