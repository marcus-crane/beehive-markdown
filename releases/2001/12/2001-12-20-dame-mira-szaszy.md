Prime Minister Helen Clark today expressed her sadness at the death of Dame Mira Szaszy and passed on her deepest condolences to her family and to her people.

"Dame Mira was one of Maoridom's most prominent figures and has made a huge contribution to her people through her life’s work on behalf of the community.

"She was an inspiration to many not only through her community work with organisations like the Maori Women’s Welfare League, but also through her personal achievements. In 1945 she became the first Maori woman university graduate.

“In addition to her role as an advocate and worker for Maoridom, she was a tireless champion on behalf of women, and, in particular, to advance the status of Maori women.

"On behalf of the government I extend my condolences to all Dame Mira’s whanau, and to her hapu and iwi in the Far North. which have lost one of their greatest daughters.

"Our thoughts are with the family at this sad time," Helen Clark said.

Dame Mira Szaszy was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1990 New Year Honours.
