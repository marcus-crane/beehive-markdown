PAID PARENTAL LEAVE Bill reaches parliament.

The Alliance’s Women’s Affairs Minister Laila Harre brought a Paid Parental Leave Bill into Parliament this year, introducing one of the most significant workplace reforms in decades.

The Bill provides 12 weeks paid parental leave for new mothers.

She told parliament that:

“Paid parental leave recognises that for our new workforce of mothers, childbirth requires time off work, and should be treated similarly to other periods of time of work for essential reasons. That is, it should be paid.”

Mothers entitled to unpaid leave under existing laws will be entitled to paid parental leave.

The payments are state funded.

Mothers can transfer all or part of their entitlement to their spouse or partner, if he or she is also eligible for parental leave. The Bill extends the definition of an “employee” to include homeworkers and the definition of “spouse” to include same sex partners. Paid parental leave will be available for adoptions.

The policy will cost around $57 million a year, around $40 million of which is new expenditure.

It is carefully designed to ensure that low income women have the greatest proportion of their incomes replaced during the 12 weeks. At the same time this is not a means tested scheme. The payment will fully replace the first $325 of a person’s ordinary gross earnings. For many low paid women this will mean no wages are lost by taking 12 weeks off to be with their babies. This maximum payment rate will be adjusted annually in line with average earnings.

People on paid parental leave will continue to have access to social assistance, including family assistance provided under the Income Tax Act, except that those eligible for the Parental Tax Credit will have to choose between that and paid parental leave.

http://www.alliance.org.nz/menu.php3?target=paid\_parental\_leave.php3

Paid parental leave is one way in which the Government is making progress towards reducing discrimination against women according to a draft report.

The report is about New Zealand’s progress towards implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).

Women’s Affairs Minister Laila Harré released the draft this week for public consultation.

It shows the Labour-Alliance Coalition Government has directly addressed some key concerns. These include:

· The announcement of paid parental leave

· Introduction of the Employment Relations Act http://www.executive.govt.nz/era/

· Introduction of the Property (Relationships) Act

· Increases to the adult and youth minimum wage

Other areas of progress include improvements to childcare subsidies and the childcare review, the introduction of a National Health Strategy, the ongoing development of a Women’s Strategy and a major pay equity project.

A copy of the draft report is available on the Ministry of Women’s Affairs website – http://www.mwa.govt.nz

LOCALLY-OWNED water and power companies to be more accountable

In another key Alliance pre-election policy before parliament this week…

Local authority trading enterprises such as those set up to retail water or power are to become more accountable.

A new law, the Local Government (Elected Member Remuneration and Trading Enterprises) Amendment Bill, was passed this week.

Local Government Minister Sandra Lee says it means LATEs, or local authority trading enterprises, would now be subject to the provisions of local governments equivalent of the Official Information Act.

They would have similar disclosure requirements to those operating for state owned enterprises during the past decade.

LATEs will also no longer be forced to ignore the plight of customers such as low income earners, beneficiaries or senior citizens who face losing their water or power supply through unavoidable misfortune.

Local authority trading enterprises can now operate beyond the strictly narrow commercial focus, and are able to take into account non-commercial factors such as the social consequences of their policies, said Ms Lee.

HEALTH FUNDING to increase by $3 billion over three years

An extra $3 billion is to be spent on health over the next three years.

The Government’s health funding plan comprises $400 million extra funding for health next year, $800m the following year and $1.2b the year after that - the equivalent of $400m of new funding each year.

Hospital managers have been asking for a shift from yearly to three-yearly funding and it allows district health boards to plan health and disability services with more certainty.

A significant part of the funding will be ring-fenced for primary health care, aiming at the sickest, the poorest, Maori and Pacific Islanders. It will help to phase out the community services card.

The Alliance believes the boost in health funding means the government is better positioned to meet the funding requirements for two Alliance priorities.

The Alliance is pressing for free doctors visits for school children and for a cancer control strategy in hospitals.

Alliance leader Jim Anderton said the increased funding means both policies are a step closer.

CLEAN SLATE legislation introduced

The Government has introduced a bill designed to allow people with minor convictions to put their past behind them if they stop re-offending for ten years.

The Criminal Records (Clean Slate) Bill allows those with convictions to have their criminal records sealed after a 10-year period, provided the conviction didn’t result in a custodial sentence or further offending.

The Bill is motivated by concern at the large group of New Zealanders who have committed youthful indiscretions. Decades later they are still living in fear that  
their convictions will be revealed, causing harm to their families, jobs and place in the community.

The Government says there comes a time when minor convictions are no longer of any public concern and people should be freed from the stigma of that offending and  
the fear of having it revealed.

The Bill will got to the Justice and Electoral Select Committee for public submissions.

CLAMP-DOWN on internet child porn and ban on some parallel imports

The government is cracking down on the import of objectionable material, such as child pornography, over the internet.

The Customs and Excise Amendment bill introduced to Parliament on Tuesday puts objectionable material imported by electronic transmission, such as over the internet, on the same footing as objectionable material imported in hard copy.

Acting Customs Minister Jim Anderton says anyone who imports objectionable material, such as child pornography, will be subject to the full force of the law regardless of the method of importation they use.

Under current law Customs officers investigating imports of objectionable books  
can't do anything about similar material in their computer which has been imported electronically.

The government is therefore amending the legislation to extend Customs' existing powers to cover material that currently slips through the net.

PARTIAL BAN ON parallel importing

The parallel imports of films, videos and DVDs will be banned for nine months from a title’s first international release.

The nine-month parallel importing ban will give the film distribution industry a period of protection to allow for the orderly release of films, videos and DVDs.

The ban will mean that retailers or alternative suppliers will not be able to legally import copies of a motion picture title without the permission of the local copyright holder or authorised distributor for a period of nine months after its first release anywhere in the world.

The ban will not apply to videos or DVDs imported for a person’s private or domestic use.

VETERANS' concerns addressed

Veterans will be able to work without losing their entire pension under legislation  
introduced to Parliament this week.

The War Pensions Amendment Bill (No 2) removes an anomaly in the law that meant veterans lost their entire pension immediately if they did paid work and in some cases voluntary work.

The bill also transfers veterans' pensions from social welfare legislation to war pensions legislation.

The bill actions government promises made in a veterans' package announced in April.

ATTRACTING IMMIGRANTS to the regions

Two local authorities will be given the opportunity to pilot an initiative aimed at using immigration policy to enhance regional growth.

Regional development Minister Jim Anderton says the pilots are aimed at providing links between regions seeking specific skills and investment, and potential migrants who can meet those needs.

“Our regions outside the Auckland area, stand to gain the economic and social benefits that come from successful migration and settlement,” Jim Anderton said.

UNIQUE ROCK FOREST saved

A unique stand of Auckland rock forest has been saved after DOC negotiated a settlement with the lands owner, a prospective developer and the local council.

Conservation Minister Sandra Lee say the 1.4-hectare site at Almorah Road in Epsom contains remnants of native forest on a 19,000-year-old basalt lava flow, the largest surviving patch of volcanic material thrown up by nearby Mt Eden.

What makes the site unique is that the trees, which include mature titoki, karaka, mahoe and pohutukawa, and the ferns are all growing through and over slabs and boulders of the volcanic rock.

In addition, a rare plant community can be found at the site, distinct from that found on Rangitoto lava flows.

The local native wildlife includes kereru, tui and other native birds. Several distinctive species of native snails are found here too.

Lava flow forests once covered a significant part of the Auckland Isthmus, but 5,000 hectares of continuous forest has sadly been reduced to a few remaining fragments.

DISAPPOINTMENT over US withdrawal from arms control treaty

The Alliance’s Disarmament Minister Matt Robson says the US announcement of its withdrawal from the Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty is disappointing.

The Treaty was signed between the US and the USSR in 1972.

“The US decision holds the potential to see a new form of arms race based on 21st century technology, on earth and in space.”
