Education Minister Trevor Mallard today announced the members of the New Zealand Teachers Council which comes into force from February next year.

The council will be chaired by Kathie Irwin. Other members are: Pembroke Bird, Lili Tuioti and Janet Kelly (Ministerial appointments); Graeme Macann (Post Primary Teachers Association) Elizabeth Patara (NZEI Te Riu Roa) and Barbara Arnott (New Zealand School Trustees Association).

After the council is established, elections will be held for one principal and three teacher representatives. In the interim, those positions will be filled by Peter Allen (secondary teacher) Marama Taiwhati (primary teacher) Karen Skett (early childhood teacher) and Nola Hambleton (principal).

The council was established through the Education Standards Act passed by Parliament in October. It takes over the role of the Teacher Registration Board but has broader responsibilities and wider powers.

Trevor Mallard said the formation of the council marked yet another very important step towards meeting the Government’s priority of raising the quality of education and providing a safe environment for students in schools and early childhood services.

“The council will enhance professionalism in teaching. In its key role of providing professional leadership, it will without a doubt have a positive impact on the standards of both teaching and learning.

“I’m looking forward to working with Kathie Irwin and other council members. I know that we all have the common desire to maintain and enhance both teacher professionalism and the standard of education in New Zealand.

“Kathie Irwin is held in very high regard in the education sector. She has a wealth of academic success and professional experience in education, in particular Maori education. This includes hands on experience in teaching, teacher education and educational research. Other council members have a wide range of hands-on experience and I am confident that as a team, they will make a valuable contribution to education in New Zealand,” Trevor Mallard said.
