Cabinet minister Pete Hodgson today announced further Government initiatives to maximise the benefits for New Zealand from the forthcoming release of The Lord of the Rings movies.

“These projects supplement those announced by the Prime Minister on November 7,” said Mr Hodgson, the minister appointed by Cabinet to oversee Lord of the Rings related projects. “We now have a broad range of initiatives to make sure we capture the maximum benefit for tourism, the New Zealand film industry and international understanding of this country’s exceptional creative talent and technology.”

The further projects are:  
\* A New Zealand screen industry production guide for international use, providing information on locations, infrastructure, film investment opportunities and New Zealand productions.

\* Promotional videos highlighting New Zealand talent, innovation and creativity, particularly in the cultural, film and high-tech sectors.

\* Expansion of the Film NZ website into a comprehensive portal for New Zealand film, film investment and tourism promotion.

\* Development of LOTR-themed New Zealand stands at upcoming international film trade markets – Locations Expo and American Film Market in Los Angeles, Production Guide in London and the Cannes Film Festival.

\* Technology and innovation workshops in Los Angeles, Silicon Valley and Seattle, showcasing New Zealand’s postproduction and digital effects capabilities.

\* An inward investment mission, bringing key decisionmakers in the international screen production industry to New Zealand to promote film opportunities.

\* An exhibition of New Zealand-produced LOTR models and props at a Los Angeles gallery, promoted to key figures in the US film production sector.

\* A New Zealand reception at Oscar time for senior US and other filmmakers to promote New Zealand as a production location.

The total budget for these initiatives is $875,000. A small number of further projects are still under consideration.

“New Zealand will be well represented in events in 14 cities over the next few weeks to coincide with the opening of The Fellowship of the Ring,” Mr Hodgson said. “The projects I have announced today will follow up this initial burst of publicity with a sustained effort to promote New Zealand talent and innovation to the world.”

Industry New Zealand and the Ministry of Economic Development will carry out an economic impact assessment of the Government’s LOTR strategy by May 2002.
