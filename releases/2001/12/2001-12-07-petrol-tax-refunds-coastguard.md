Search and rescue vessels are to be refunded the money they currently pay on petrol excise duty, Transport Minister Mark Gosche announced today.

Mr Gosche said the Coastguard had requested that it be given the same exemption on excise duty that is currently available to commercial vessels. Their  
case for the refunds had been strongly argued by East Coast MP Janet Mackey.

“Search and rescue organisations such as the Coastguard provide an invaluable service free of charge, and save hundreds of lives a year. It is only fair that these organisations get this exemption,” said Mr Gosche.

“While it is not a lot of money involved, probably about $30,000 a year, this will make a big difference to the Coastguard which is a voluntary organisation with limited funds.”

“In the International Year of Volunteers it is particularly appropriate that we support such a vital community service.”
