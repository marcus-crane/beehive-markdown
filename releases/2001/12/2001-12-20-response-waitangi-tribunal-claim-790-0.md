The Government has received the report from the Waitangi Tribunal on the Taranaki Maori claim following the restructuring of the dairy industry and will be considering it carefully, Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia and Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton said today.

Mr Horomia and Mr Sutton said it was unclear how long it would take before the Government would have a response to the report.

“We want to have a proper look at the recommendations.”
