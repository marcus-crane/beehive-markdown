Communications Minister Paul Swain announced today that Douglas Webb, an expatriate New Zealander, will be appointed as Telecommunications Commissioner within the Commerce Commission for a five-year term.

“Douglas Webb has excellent credentials to lead the implementation of the new regulatory regime,” Paul Swain said.

”His extensive experience will give the market confidence in his appointment.

“An international lawyer and Managing Counsel with the World Bank, he will bring a broad intellectual capacity to the position. He has first hand experience of the New Zealand legal and telecommunications environments. Since then he has gained wide ranging regulatory and public policy experience at the World Bank designing legal structures and determining appropriate regulatory systems for a range of countries.

“His previous work experience includes three years for the Asian Development Bank in Manila and 16 years as a partner at Rudd Watts & Stone (formerly Watts and Patterson).

“He will be well suited to making determinations through the use of a rigorous legal framework. He also brings extensive management and financial experience from the World Bank where he supervises over 160 staff and is responsible for the related budgetary and personnel issues.

“Although the Commissioner will perform a specialist role, he will receive full support from the Commission members and its staff. I believe that the appointment of Douglas Webb as Telecommunications Commissioner is a significant step forward for the operation of the telecommunications sector in New Zealand.

“I am also pleased to be able to appoint a New Zealander who has pursued a successful international career and is now returning home,” Paul Swain said.

Douglas Webb is expected to relocate from North America in March 2002.
