Health Minister Annette King says The Health Workforce: A Training Programme Analysis will be a useful resource in planning and other workforce-related projects.

The analysis has been carried out by the Clinical Training Agency, part of the Ministry of Health, which purchases clinical training for those who have already acquired their base qualification (post-entry clinical training). The report also includes an analysis of the workforce where reliable information is available.

"The report is intended as a resource for the many groups involved in health workforce including the Health Workforce Advisory Committee, the Ministry of Health, District Health Boards, and providers and accreditors of training," Mrs King said today.

"It does not provide all the answers; nor does it identify all the issues. However its content, when considered in light of some of the workforce issues we are grappling with right now, underlines the many challenges workforce issues pose for the agency and for the sector."

The report makes a number of recommendations, including a combined and coordinated approach from the agency, other directorates within the Ministry of Health, the Health Workforce Advisory Committee and sector stakeholders.

"All in all it offers a commonsense approach in an area where laissez faire has not served us well. I welcome its addition to the mix we are now developing in order to tackle some of our workforce problems.”

The report is available on the Ministry of Health’s website www.moh.govt.nz
