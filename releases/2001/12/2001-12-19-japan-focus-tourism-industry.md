The visitor arrival figures for November confirm that the government and the industry have been correct to focus on reviving the flagging Japanese market, Tourism Minister Mark Burton said.

Visitor arrivals for November were down by 9.7 percent compared to the previous November. Japanese visitor numbers fell by 48 percent, at 9,975 visitors, compared to 19,248 in November 2000.

"Tourism New Zealand and the tourism industry identified immediately after September 11th that there would be a major impact on Japanese travel," Mark Burton said.

"In response, I provided a letter of reassurance for use by Japanese travel wholesalers and last month visited Japan to speak with government and tourism industry leaders.

"A letter from Prime Minister Helen Clark was placed in major Japanese newspapers, and the government provided Tourism New Zealand with an additional $2 million for a major marketing campaign in Japan, partnered with Air New Zealand and other tourism interests.

"The result of these efforts will not show up immediately. But I believe New Zealand's reputation as a safe, attractive destination will allow us to maximise the opportunities when the Japanese do start travelling again."

Mark Burton also announced that the latest resource provided by the Tourism Research Council New Zealand (TRCNZ) would be released later this week.

"The \`Tourism Leading Indicators Model' draws upon the core tourism sector data sources to provide a broad overview of tourism and the changes and merging trends. This monitor will be produced monthly.

"It will allow the sector to quickly assess the effects of both short and long term events affecting tourism and therefore assist decision-making across the sector," Mark Burton said.
