Prime Minister Helen Clark will travel to the United Kingdom to attend the funeral of Sir Peter Blake.

The funeral is to be held on Friday afternoon (early morning Saturday NZT) in Emsworth, Hampshire.

“Sir Peter was a national hero. His yachting achievements brought fame to New Zealand and his passion for the environment saw him achieve international recognition.

“In my tribute to him at Friday’s funeral service I hope to be able to convey the depth of feeling New Zealanders had for Sir Peter and our support for his wife and family at this sad time.”

Sports Minister and Minister for the America’s Cup Trevor Mallard, who is in Europe attending the United Nations High Commission for Refugees conference in Geneva, will also attend the funeral.

Helen Clark said planning is under way for a memorial service for Sir Peter in Auckland. It is likely to take place towards the end of next week, to allow crew on the Seamaster to return from the Caribbean in time for the memorial service.

The Prime Minister will leave on Wednesday evening and arrive back in New Zealand on Sunday morning.
