7 December 2001Media Statement  
Grafton Gully Goes Ahead  
Embargoed Until 11.30am  
Construction on Auckland’s Grafton Gully project is expected to be underway next month, Transport Minister Mark Gosche announced today.

Mr Gosche was with Auckland Mayor John Banks at Grafton Gully, turning the first sod on the $2 million early works project to prepare the site for construction.

“This project will substantially improve the strategic link between Auckland’s lower Central Business District, the port area and the motorway so is a crucial part of getting the Auckland roading network right.”

“The link to the port is particularly significant for Auckland’s businesses as the Port of Auckland is crucial to Auckland’s commercial activity.”

“The final touches are being put to the construction contract now and Transit is confident that the main construction programme will be underway in January.”

The $68 million project will include extending State Highway 16A north to pass under Grafton Road and into Stanley Street, removing the current dogleg for people exiting the motorway.

The dogleg intersection from Stanley Street into The Strand will also be removed by extending Stanley Street to pass beneath the railway line and link back into the Strand.

A new link will run from Wellesley Street across the Gully over the port linkages to Grafton Road. Stanley Street will be widened and traffic lights installed at Alten Road. There will also be a free left turn provided from Stanley Street into Beach Road and an extra right turn from Beach Road into Stanley Street.

“This project represents a significant part of the solution to Auckland’s transport problems. Along with the progress on the Puhinui interchange, the State Highway 20 extensions, Spaghetti Junction and the North Shore Busway the complete transport picture is beginning to emerge after a long hiatus in major highway developments.”

Mr Gosche also announced that Auckland consultant Grant Kirby has been appointed to the new position of Auckland’s Transport Advocate.

“Grant will be responsible for making our plans for Auckland transport happen. He will work with all parties to remove the barriers to progressing those plans. He will report directly to myself and Associate Transport Minister Judith Tizard. ”

He will also keep aware of other exercises underway that directly or indirectly influence progress on Auckland transport projects.

As a consultant specialising in local government issues Mr Kirby has worked as project director of the Britomart project and was also appointed by the government as Commissioner of the Rodney District Council.
