A $100,000 lottery grant will help fund the Embassy Theatre restoration, the first stage of which is due for completion in time for the December 19 New Zealand premiere of The Lord of The Rings.

Announcing this today, Lottery Grants Board Chairperson and Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Steve Maharey said while The Lord of the Rings itself had not received any direct Lottery funding, Lotto players could nevertheless lay credit to the film.

“The New Zealand Film Commission, which receives the bulk of its money from the Lottery Grants Board, has invested $5 million over the years in the development of Peter Jackson’s film career.

“The Embassy Theatre is listed as a heritage building by the Wellington City Council and Trustees, who include Peter Jackson, plan to restore the theatre interior to the original 1920’s design where possible.

“The Embassy is a great choice for the premiere because its picture screen is still the largest in the country,” Steve Maharey said.

Wellington Central MP Marian Hobbs welcomed the grant.

"The Embassy is a fantastic asset for Wellington City and its people," she said. "We can all be proud that it will host the New Zealand-Australia premiere of the Lord of the Rings."
