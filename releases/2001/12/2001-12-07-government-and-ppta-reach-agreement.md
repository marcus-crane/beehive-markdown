Government negotiators and the Post Primary Teachers’ Association have reached an agreement to settle the secondary teachers collective agreement.

The package for settlement was finalised yesterday and will be put to PPTA members for ratification early in the first term of next year.

It includes provision for guaranteed non-contact time.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard and PPTA President Jen McCutcheon welcomed the agreement.

They said both sides were keen for an agreement to be reached before the summer break and they were pleased that the new school year would start with the prospect of a more settled environment.

Mrs McCutcheon said PPTA negotiators had worked hard to reach a settlement that would work for its members and gaining guaranteed non-contact time was a significant achievement.

“We have been striving for nearly 10 years to get our workload issues addressed in our employment agreement. Guaranteed non-contact time is a positive step towards achieving this.”

“While the pay is disappointing, the view of the PPTA executive is that the gains made on workload, which was identified by members as our main priority in this round, were worthwhile,” Mrs McCutcheon said.

Trevor Mallard said the package for settlement would provide for a positive start to the new school year.

“These have been lengthy negotiations and I would like to thank the negotiators for the time and effort they have put towards getting a package that both sides can agree to. The Mediation Service, established under the Employment Relations Act, also made a positive contribution to getting a result.

“I am especially heartened by the agreement that the PPTA will work co-operatively with government to help teacher recruitment and retention. Both teachers and the government want quality education in secondary schools and addressing the teacher supply issue together will help secure future quality,” Trevor Mallard said.
