Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said Independent Newspaper Ltd (INL) Scholarships to encourage more Maori into journalism is timely and needs to be commended.

Mr Horomia was asked to be guest speaker at the Maori journalism hui in Rotorua this weekend but had to decline because it clashed with the Labour Party Annual General meeting in Auckland.

The INL scholarships (worth $5,500) will cover course fees for up to four Maori students each year to attend any industry-recognised journalism course. After the successful completion of training, the recipients will also be guaranteed a year’s employment on an INL publication.

Mr Horomia said the constant negative coverage provided by the media of Maori issues often concerns him.

“There is a need for more Maori journalists in both Maori and mainstream media to ensure a more balanced coverage of Maori issues. I think that there are not enough journalists who know or understand the Maori world view, or even that there is a Maori world view.”

“As New Zealand society diversifies, it is becoming increasingly important that the media can accurately reflect the differences and similarities. I think that will be a major role of the Maori Television service and I hope that is seen in other media as well.”

Mr Horomia said INL needs to be commended for establishing the annual scholarships and its genuine commitment to encourage more Maori into the journalism profession.
