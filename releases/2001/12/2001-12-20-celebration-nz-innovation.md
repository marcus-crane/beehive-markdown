The biggest celebration of New Zealand innovation…ever.

‘Innovate’ will be a festival of innovation in Christchurch from 5-7 March next year, Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton announced today.

“Innovate will be an opportunity for innovators to come together, and for us all to learn how we can turn great ideas into successful businesses,” Jim Anderton said.

“Innovate will celebrate the achievements of our innovators - the people who have been successful in commercialising good ideas. It will aim to inform and inspire a new generation of innovators, and help to promote a culture of innovation in New Zealand.

“The Labour-Alliance coalition government's economic development policies are designed to unleash the creativity and innovation of New Zealanders. Innovate is another example of the government’s partnership approach to turning great ideas into commercially successful, job-rich, high value businesses.”

Much of the event, including an exhibition of innovation, will be open to the public. Innovate will feature plenary sessions, and inspirational guest speakers.

Innovative business will be able to attend workshops and spend time in individual sessions with business mentors, where they will discuss their ideas and get feedback from top business brains.

Innovate has been put together by the Ministry of Economic Development, Industry New Zealand and Te Puni Kokiri. Around 500 innovators are expected to join venture capitalists, community leaders, educators and industry associations for the event.

It will be held at the Christchurch Convention Centre and Christchurch Town Hall. Registrations will open on 21 January, with the detailed programme due to be revealed in mid-January. To register an interest in the event visit www.innovate.org.nz.
