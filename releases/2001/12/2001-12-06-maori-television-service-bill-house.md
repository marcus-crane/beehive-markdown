Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said he believed the Maori Television Service will enrich New Zealand society, culture and heritage even though its principal function is to promote te Reo Maori me nga tikanga Maori.

Mr Horomia tabled the Maori Television Service Bill in the House today, which, amongst other things, establishes the Service as a statutory corporation, outlines the functions of the service and the duties of the board and directors, and provides for the independence of the Service.

Mr Horomia said he believed the bill, and ultimately the Service, breaks new ground in a number of ways.

“The Bill confirms the partnership approach between government and Crown to the governance, accountability and general operation of the Maori television service. It charts new territory for the promotion and protection of te reo Maori me nga tikanga Maori. It provides a means of further safeguarding Maori cultural identity, and in so doing, key aspects of our nation’s identity.”

“The establishment of the Maori Television Service recognizes the need to take practical steps to protect and promote te Reo Maori. Television is an important means to inform, educate and entertain both Maori and non Maori alike. I see it as an important mechanism to promote Maori social, cultural and economic development,” said Mr Horomia.

The Minister said many people, friendly and unfriendly, are scrutinising every step of the process and things will not be easy. However the most important task is to ensure the best-possible innovative, entertaining, commercially-sound Maori television service is operating by mid next year.

The Maori Television Service Bill was referred to the Maori Affairs Select Committee, to report back on or before 28 March next year.
