Information Technology Minister Paul Swain has signed a formal agreement with his counterpart in India to forge closer business links between the two countries.

Paul Swain met with Indian IT Minister Hon Pramod Mahajan as part of his nine-day mission to Singapore and India to promote business opportunities – particularly in the IT sector.

The agreement was signed in Delhi on Friday 7 December.

“It is vital that New Zealand forge closer links with India, we want New Zealand to be firmly fixed on their business radar screen,” Paul Swain said.

“Among other things this agreement recognises the potential for extensive trade between the two countries in the IT sector and the need to tap the capabilities and opportunities in the sector.

“We are agreeing to exchange information, where appropriate, on legal, regulatory and policy approaches and industry development issues.

“And we are agreeing to discuss issues such as public key infrastructure, intellectual property rights and digital signatures.

“We are looking to explore the scope for the development of joint programmes designed to facilitate investment, joint ventures and other business activities in IT, telecommunications, e-commerce education and other knowledge-based industries.

“India is an IT powerhouse. It is one of the world’s foremost producers of IT skills and it is important that we work closely with this critical market,” Paul Swain said.
