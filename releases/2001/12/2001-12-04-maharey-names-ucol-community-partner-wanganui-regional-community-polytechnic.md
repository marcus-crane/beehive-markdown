Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education) Steve Maharey announced today that the Unversal College of Learning (UCOL) will be the community partner for Wanganui tertiary education.

The decision brings financial stability for the Wanganui Regional Community Polytechnic and ends uncertainty in the region. It also offers increased opportunities for students and extended professional opportunities for staff as well as a substantial regional input.

¡§UCOL was an appropriate choice. Their willingness to work with Wanganui is an important step for the region.

¡§After close consideration of the many submissions and ideas put forward by the community and Ministry officials, the logic for the UCOL option was compelling. The two polytechics are geographically close to one another and will now combine to offer a richer range of education to both communities.

¡§The decision also brings with it an investment into the Wanganui community of up to $48 million, the expected cost of the new partnership model.

¡§A number of provisions have been included in the interim UCOL business plan to ensure local interests are protected. An outline of the plan was presented to key community leaders and polytechnic staff last week. Further substantive dialogue will occur between the community and UCOL now that the decision has been made that they will that they will become a community partner with Wanganui to deliver tertiary education.

¡§The commitments I made to protect the interests of the Wanganui community are preserved in this agreement. These are:

„« A Community Charter outlining the relationship between the community and UCOL will be created. The Minister views this as a way the Wanganui community can get involved with developing guidelines for public tertiary education for the region.  
. . / 2  
„« A Regional Advisory Committee will further ensure that the local community has input into the provision of public tertiary education in Wanganui. The Minister intends that the selection of Committee members will reflect the importance he places on local involvement.

„« Wanganui representation on the UCOL Council is planned. It is anticipated this will be two Ministerial appointees from the Wanganui region as well as a Students¡¦ Association representative. As with the Advisory Council, the Minister intends representation to encourage community participation and involvment in UCOL¡¦s future. Wanganui residents will also be eligible for representation through a number of appointed Council members.

„« Clauses in the Heads of Agreement between UCOL and the Crown. These will set out, at a high level, UCOL¡¦s obligations to the Wanganui community.

¡§It is anticipated that the District Council will take the lead with UCOL to ensure the Community Charter is acceptable to the community.

¡§Wanganui has already demonstrated its ability to provide first class tertiary education in its chosen fields of expertise. With the stability and resources offered by UCOL this potential could be further developed and expanded to other fields,¡¨ Steve Maharey said.

Mr Maharey emphasised that the name of the Wanganui campus was of great importance. The name would be selected as the result of discussions between UCOL and the community. UCOL has already announced its intention to retain the name ¡¥Wanganui¡¦ and work towards bringing together dispersed campuses into a consolidated site. The Computer Graphics & Design School will continue to retain its academic relationship with Waikato University. There is also the possibility of the Schools of Fine Arts and Fashion being considered for this kind of relationship in the future. Both UCOL and Waikato have indicated the commitment to building this relationship further.

¡§By combining the resources of Wanganui Regional Community Polytechnic with UCOL we have secured first class tertiary education in Wanganui. This city is already recognised as a thriving arts centre and a welcoming community for out-of-town students. It can now look forward to a stable long-term future,¡¨ Steve Maharey said.
