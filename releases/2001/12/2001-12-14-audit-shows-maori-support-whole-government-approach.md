Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said an audit report by Te Puni Kokiri shows Maori families welcome the idea of collaborative case management by government agencies, but the service delivery process needs more work.

The Minister released the audit report of the Strengthening Families Programme at the launch of the Heartland Service centre brand in Wairoa today (Friday 13 December 1.30pm. Report recommendations attached).

Mr Horomia said Te Puni Kokiri’s effectiveness audit into the Strengthening families programme confirmed that a whole-of-government approach can be very successful.

“It is possible that a high risk family will deal with many contact people in a range of social service agencies at any one time. It makes good sense for agencies to coordinate their efforts and work together collaboratively when providing help and advice to these families.

“For example, within an hour of attending a collaborative case management meeting, one Mäori client was allocated a Housing New Zealand Corporation home. Working together can provide fast, effective and appropriate results – which is good news for people in need.”

“In saying that, more work needs to be done to ensure that the programme works to its full potential. The audit showed some agencies show variable levels of commitment and follow through. I will be working with my ministerial colleagues and their departments to review and implement relevant recommendations in the report.

In line with the ‘whole of government’ theme, Mr Horomia said Heartland Service centres are all about making government services accessible and available to people in provincial communities.

“The Work and Income office will be the base for the Heartland Service centre in Wairoa but it will also be the permanent contact point for Housing NZ, IRD (including Child Support) and the Maori Land Court. Other government departments will be invited to participate too so that there is a one-stop shop for government services.”
