The government today considered a range of measures designed to help the considerable effort being led by the mayoral team in Waihi to help local victims of subsidence.

Associate Energy Minister Paul Swain said that while the government considered that it had no liability in this matter – there was a human tragedy here and the substantial local effort needed crown support.

“Among the measures agreed at Cabinet today were to include the Civil Defence, Social Services and Employment Ministers and the Minister in charge of the Earthquake Commission in the process,” Paul Swain said.

“The Civil Defence Minister will ask his Ministry to coordinate a disaster recovery proposal involving all parties and he’ll be reporting back to Cabinet on that as soon as possible.

“The Social Services and Employment Minister will ensure that Work and Income and Child Youth and Family offiicals are able to provide help to evacuees where necessary.

“The Minister in charge of the EQC will be receiving a report on the likely covereage (or otherwise) by the EQC.

“In addition, once a report is received on issues relating to costs and the like, the government will consider making a contribution to the mayoral fund which has been established to resolve longerterm issues such as relocation of people who have lost their homes.

“This event is a human tragedy and it’s important that everyone pulls together to help these people – especially at Christmas time. I am sure a number of people will want to contribute, and I understand that people can make a donation at a local BNZ branch or throught the mayor of their local council. Any donations have been earmarked for the evacuees.

“The government has praised the way in which the incident on Thursday was handled so professionally and speedily.

“I congratulate the Mayor Basil Morrision, the Hauraki District Council, the mining company, police and other emergency services for the quick implementation of a contingency plan developed some time ago,” Paul Swain said.
