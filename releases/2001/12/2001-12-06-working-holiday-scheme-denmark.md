A working holiday scheme between New Zealand and Denmark will come into effect next February, Foreign Minister Phil Goff and Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel announced today.

A reciprocal working holiday arrangement was signed by New Zealand Ambassador to Denmark, Dell Higgie in Copenhagen this morning. The arrangement allows up to 200 18-to-30-year olds from both countries to spend up to a year living and working in the host country.

“We have a good relationship with Denmark and tend to share a common outlook on international matters. The scheme will allow young New Zealanders to get to know the country better. It will also build on people-to-people links that began in the mid nineteenth century through Danish migration to New Zealand,” said Mr Goff.

“New Zealand is already a popular destination for Danish tourists,” Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel said. “The working holiday scheme will allow young Danish travellers to spend a more time in New Zealand, with the chance to undertake incidental employment.”

The agreement with Denmark takes the number of working holiday arrangements with European countries to eight. Schemes are already operating with the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Italy and Sweden.
