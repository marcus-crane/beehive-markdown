Aid organisations like World Vision appreciate the offer of Hercules planes to assist with aid in Afghanistan, Minister in charge of aid, Matt Robson says.

Today World Vision contacted him to show their appreciation, and highlight the huge need for assistance in the distribution of food and relief aid.

World Vision is working very closely with the United Nation’s World Food Programme in North West Afghanistan, delivering food aid to over 500,000 people, with a budget of nearly $10 million.

“I met with an aid worker yesterday who has been working in Northern Afghanistan for nine years with all sorts of organisations. She has just finished an assignment with Unicef,” says Matt Robson.

“She paints a grim picture of life in Afghanistan. A quarter of all children die under the age of five. 30% of women die in childbirth.

“In the north there has been no secondary or tertiary education for twenty years.

“Although Kabul and other cities will be central locations in terms of the delivery of aid and assistence, she stressed the need not to neglect the rural areas.

“Rural areas in particular have been decimated. The trees have gone, used for firewood long ago. Animal diseases, including anthrax, are rife

“Afghan children have been traumatised. Many have seen a sibling, a parent or a member of their family die of preventable causes.

“The reality is, the Afghan people have been living at ground zero for decades. Now we have the opportunity to help them re-build.
