Volunteers from the Auckland Central Electorate are to be recognised by the New Zealand Government for their voluntary aid work overseas.

Auckland Central MP Judith Tizard will present Certificates of Appreciation to volunteers at a special function on Monday 10 December at the Grey Lynn Community Centre, to mark the United Nations International Year of Volunteers.

The Certificate of Appreciation formally acknowledges the contribution made by volunteers to New Zealand’s international aid efforts, and provides an opportunity to say thanks for their altruistic service.

New Zealand volunteers use their skills and expertise to deliver practical assistance in developing countries throughout the world. Doctors, nurses, teachers, engineers, computer programmers, agriculturalists and community development workers are among those who have given their time and energy to contribute to communities in developing countries.

Two of those to be recognised on Monday are Volunteer Service Abroad volunteer Carole Jones, and volunteer optometrist Yu-Shan Alice Ku.

Carole Jones spent three and a half years in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa, developing training resources and training community workers in adult education and local governance – so that communities could maintain basic infrastructure such as water supply and sanitation, once it had been set up.

“I worked with the Xhosa people – Nelson Mandela’s tribe – in an area with two of the biggest former homelands. People were put into these homelands in the 1970s and left with no water, no sanitation, no electricity, no roads, no nothing. When I arrived in 1995, not much had changed,” says Carole Jones.

“The bottom line is that water and sanitation is the difference between life and death. Children would die every summer of sanitation-related diseases like dysentry. What VSA was supporting was local government at its most basic level - empowering people to do it for themselves.”

Optometrist Yu-Shan Alice Ku spent two weeks in Labasa, Fiji this year as part of a group from Volunteer Ophthalmology Service Overseas that provided free eye tests, eye surgery and glasses that had been donated through Lion’s Clubs in New Zealand.

“It was the first volunteer trip I’ve done. I think we saw at least 1800 people in that two weeks. We would turn up at 8 o’clock in the morning to 120 patients sitting outside welcoming us,” says Alice Ku.

Both volunteers say they were richly rewarded for their service in many ways.

“The experience has definitely made me look at optometry in a different way,” says Alice Ku. “I’d been doing ‘normal’ eye testing for so long that I forgot to enjoy it, and when I went there, I saw the smiles, the gratitude. They weren’t really fussy about what the glasses frames look like. They just wanted to see properly.

“It makes you appreciate how important eyesight is, to be grateful for everything we have here, and not complain about little things.”

Carole Jones says that with many people in survival mode from day to day, it is a privilege to be able to make the choice to volunteer, and the benefits far outweigh the altruistic nature of volunteering.

“The financial rewards may not be there but life experience, developing skills, working and interacting with other cultures, the travel, the sense of adding value – these are intangible rewards. You can’t put a price on the things that I learnt about myself and other people through the volunteering experience.”

Judith Tizard says on their return home, volunteers help to enrich our own society through the benefit of their experience and the links they have built with people in other countries.

Meanwhile, the Auckland Central MP has welcomed the Government’s investment of a further $2.19 million over the next four years to support Volunteering New Zealand and the Volunteer Centre networks.

“The Government wants to see the momentum of the International Year of Volunteers continue in future years,” says Judith Tizard. “In Auckland, the new funds will benefit the regional volunteer centre, and support projects such as developing connections with Mâori, Pacific Island and ethnic community volunteers.”
