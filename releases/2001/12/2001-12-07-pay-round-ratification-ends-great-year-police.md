Police Minister George Hawkins has welcomed today’s final ratification of sworn and non-sworn pay rounds for police staff.

The settlement will give police a two percent increase from 1 December this year and a further one percent from 1 December 2002. The term of the agreement is from 1 December 2001 to 30 June 2003.

“Final settlement of the pay rounds ends a great year for Police, with crime down, resolutions up and police receiving the funding and resources they need from a government committed to bringing crime down.

“With wage issues settled up until 2003, police can focus on continuing to win the war again crime – that’s great news for New Zealanders,” said Mr Hawkins.
