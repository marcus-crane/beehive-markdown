Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced $290,000 of government funding for Waitangi Day community events around the country.

The funding covers 44 events ranging from a re-enactment of the signing of the Treaty at Mangungu Mission in the Far North to an event on the West Coast to take kapa haka performances to local nursing homes.

“The events celebrate the positive aspects of Waitangi Day - the coming together of the peoples of New Zealand in a treaty partnership.

“I hope all New Zealanders find the time to take part in the commemorations on Waitangi Day. It is the day on which we celebrate New Zealand’s special character,” Helen Clark said.

The 'Commemorating Waitangi Day Fund 2001' supports activities which acknowledge the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi and is designed to encourage a country wide participation in the commemorations.

The Fund is administered by the Ministry of Culture and Heritage which assessed applications under criteria such as encouraging community participation and achievement, promoting a cultural experience and event, and providing participants with an opportunity to learn more about the Treaty of Waitangi.
