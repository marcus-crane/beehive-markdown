Three people have been appointed to make up the board of inquiry into the proposed national Bovine TB strategy, Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton said today.

Mr Sutton said Jim Lynch, a senior lawyer, would serve as the board’s chairman. Mr Lynch practices resource management law and has extensive experience with similar bodies.

The other two members of the inquiry are Mary Clarke and Ted Tauroa.

Ms Clarke heads the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research’s Auckland office. Her strengths include economic and policy analysis and strategic thinking.

Mr Tauroa has tribal affiliations to Ngati Koroki/Kahukura (Tainui), Ngati Tuara/Kearoa (Te Arawa). Mr Tauroa is the iwi representative for the Maungatautari Ecological Island Reserve and a member of several Maori Land Trusts in the Te Arawa area, Rotorua. A Justice of the Peace, he has been in the dairy farming industry for many years. Mr Tauroa and his wife own a 100-hectare (330-cow) property at Pukeatua and he chairs a family trust operating a 250-hectare (600-cow) farm in the Cambridge district.

Mr Sutton said the inquiry was important for our multi-billion dollar beef, game and dairy industries.

“The inquiry needs to be completed as soon as possible.”

Between now and March next year, the board of inquiry is to hold public hearings in Wellington, Christchurch and Auckland, and will then prepare a written report including any recommendations to the Minister.

The 94 people who made written submissions on the proposed national Bovine TB strategy have been advised by the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry of the opportunity to be heard, and about half of them say they wish to appear at the hearings.

The board of inquiry will also give notice of the inquiry hearings in accordance with the Biosecurity Act.
