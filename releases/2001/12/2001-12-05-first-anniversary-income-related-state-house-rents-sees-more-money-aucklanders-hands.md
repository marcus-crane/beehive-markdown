Low-income state houses tenants in Auckland Central are on average $60 better off as a result of the government’s income-related rents policy, Auckland Central MP Judith Tizard said today.

Judith Tizard was commenting on the first anniversary of the policy, introduced in December last year to ensure that low income state tenants pay no more than 25% of their income on rent. Nationally about 53,000 households are paying an income-related rent.

“In Auckland Central, nearly 693 households are now paying an income-related rent, 90.8 per cent of all state house tenants in this area.

“With an average estimated saving of $60 a week per household that is $3120 a year that state house tenants now have to spend on other things like medical costs, better quality food and school trips. That is making a huge difference to those families.”

Judith Tizard, who is also the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister with Auckland Issues, said the introduction of income-related rents has been particularly good news for Auckland, where rent is often higher than in the rest of the country.

“Across the country, people have an extra $35 every week as a result. In areas of Auckland that figure is between $50-$60. In the Auckland Central Electorate alone, that equates to a total of approximately $2,162,160 million that low-income families have had available to spend in the local community compared to previously.”

“So not only is this good news for the families concerned, but also for local businesses.”

An additional benefit from income-related rents was that families are more stable as a result.

“Annual turnover of state houses is well down on previous years. Nationally the turnover rate has nearly halved in the last year and in Grey Lynn it was down to 11.1 in October compared to 18.2 at the same time last year.

“Families are not having to move because they can’t afford to pay the rent. The result is that children are not shifting schools so often and that has to have a positive impact on their schooling”.

Judith Tizard said that income related rents was one of a raft of measures this government was implementing to improve the lot of state tenants.

“This year alone we are putting more than $122 million into maintenance of thousands of state houses, on top of $116 million spent last year.

“We are also helping more low income families into state houses by substantially increasing the number of state houses. There are already nearly an extra 700 state houses since we became government.

“The Labour-Alliance government’s overall goal is to build a fairer, better, more secure society. A safe and affordable home is just one of the steps towards achieving this.”
