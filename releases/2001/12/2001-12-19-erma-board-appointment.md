A biologist with specialist knowledge in business and the environment, Dr Lin Roberts, has been appointed to the Environmental Risk Management Authority (ERMA), Environment Minister, Marian Hobbs, announced today.

Dr Roberts replaces Mrs Helen Hughes, former Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, whose term expires on 31 December. The appointment is for two years.

Marian Hobbs said the completion of Mrs Hughes' term presented an opportunity to re-evaluate the balance of experience and knowledge on the Authority to ensure it is well set up for its future work.

"Having an experienced biologist on the Board will be particularly useful in assisting the work ERMA is doing, especially in relation to its responsibilities with regard to genetic modification," Marian Hobbs said.

ERMA is an expert body established under the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act. Its primary purpose is to protect people from the risks of hazardous substances and new organisms by assessing, approving or declining applications to import or manufacture new organisms and hazardous substances.

In approving a hazardous substance, ERMA can set comprehensive controls on the use, handling, transport, storage and disposal of the substance - controls that everyone must abide by.
