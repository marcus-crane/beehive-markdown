An enhanced partnership between the public and private sector will result from changes to the formal structures and processes of Tourism New Zealand, the Minister of Tourism Mark Burton announced today.

The Minister announced the Government's response to the New Zealand Tourism Strategy recommendation for a "new" Tourism New Zealand, at this evening's official opening of Tourism New Zealand's head office in Wellington.

"I believe the changes will encourage further joint ventures, like the multi-million dollar marketing initiative in Japan I announced last week, involving Tourism New Zealand, travel wholesalers and Air New Zealand," Mark Burton said.

Tourism New Zealand will continue as a government-funded agency, with the key role of promoting New Zealand as a tourism destination overseas. But the private sector is to be formally consulted on Tourism New Zealand's proposed strategies, plans and projects.

The new Ministry of Tourism, which comes into existence in January, will monitor and evaluate Tourism New Zealand's effectiveness in consulting with and involving key tourism sector groups.

In addition, the Tourism Industry Association, regional tourism organisations, key tourism industry players and Maori tourism interests will be asked to put forward nominations for future appointments to the Board of Tourism New Zealand.

"We have consulted and listened carefully to people from throughout the tourism industry since the Tourism Strategy was formulated earlier this year, on the best way of enhancing the operations of Tourism New Zealand," Mark Burton said.

"The industry made it clear that while it wanted to further improve its relationship with Tourism New Zealand, it did not want to see fundamental restructuring.

"That response is reflected in the government's decisions.

"The enhancements announced today will ensure that there is even strong cooperation and coordination across the tourism sector in marketing New Zealand to the world."
