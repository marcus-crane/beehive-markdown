19 December 2001Media Statement

An independent review into civil aviation medical standards was released by Transport Minister Mark Gosche today.

The review by Wellington barrister Bruce Corkill and Dr Simon Janvrin, Chief Medical Officer of the UK Civil Aviation Authority, recommends that varying levels of cardiovascular risk assessment for pilots and air traffic controllers take into account age and health profiles.

It also recommends the “one per cent” rule for the aviation industry be raised to a two per cent threshold.

The one per cent rule relates to cardiovascular risk assessment and provides a threshold beyond which further checks or health intervention may be necessary. It has been widely criticised by the aviation industry.

“This report is vital to ensuring pilots and air traffic controllers meet certain medical standards so that safety is not compromised by poor health.

“A few months ago we passed legislation to help rebuild the aviation medical system. These recommendations will further strengthen that system,” said Mr Gosche.

“There has been a lot of work done already this year to mend relations between the Civil Aviation Authority and the aviation industry, and the implementation of the review’s recommendations will help continue that process,” he said.

The recommendations will be incorporated into a new draft Rule Part 67 and consultation on this rule is expected in the New Year.

Copies of the report, the submissions received and the process followed are available at the Ministry of Transport’s website: www.transport.govt.nz.
