Disarmament and Arms Control Minister Matt Robson is seeking more information from NATO and European Union countries following reports about troop exposure to depleted NATO uranium shells used in Bosnia, Kosovo, and the Gulf War.

“New Zealand will be watching developments closely as the answers will help establish whether there is a case for restricting or banning these weapons because of their impact on people and the environment,” Mr Robson said.

“Due to the timing and nature of New Zealand deployments in the Gulf, Bosnia, and Kosovo, on the basis of the information we have to date such exposure is not likely to be an issue for us.”

National investigations are taking place in European countries. Independent of these, a United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) study, involving a team of scientists from several countries, is currently underway.

Depleted uranium was used extensively in the 1991 Gulf War, and to a much lesser extent by NATO in Bosnia in 1994 and 1995, and in Kosovo last year.

Depleted uranium is a dense and heavy metal with low level radioactivity, but a degree of chemical toxicity if ingested.

It can be incorporated into missile, shell and bullet casings and tips, has considerable penetrative power because of its density, and can burn on impact. Depleted uranium is also used in armour plating to increase its strength.
