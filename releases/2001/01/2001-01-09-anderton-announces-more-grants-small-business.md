"New Zealanders are clearly brimming with new business ideas," said Acting Prime Minister Jim Anderton today announcing more winners of Industry New Zealand Enterprise Awards.

Fifteen more awards were announced today from across the country covering things such as porcelain dolls, hydroponics and computer innovation.

"There will be even more grants announced over the next two months as the growing number of applications are processed," said Jim Anderton,

"Any businesses that need help to grow and create new jobs should take advantage of the support and advice available from Industry New Zealand," said Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton.

"This Labour Alliance Coalition Government has created and launched the Enterprise Awards Scheme through Industry New Zealand. This means small businesses and entrepreneurs can apply for 50% of the total costs of a project, and the current scheme will fund up to $10,000 in any one year," said Jim Anderton.

The first two rounds of 37 Enterprise Award winners were announced in September and November 2000, with grants ranging in value from $800 to $10,000.

"This is Kiwi ingenuity in action! These grants and the whole jobs machine have been created by this Government to foster the 'Kiwis-can-do attitude' and get this country working, said Deputy Prime Minister, Jim Anderton.
