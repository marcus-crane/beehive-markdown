Prime Minister Helen Clark said today she would spend Waitangi Day in Wellington and Auckland.

"In Wellington the Wellington City Council and the Wellington Tenths Trust are again organising a Waitangi Day programme on the city's waterfront, and I will be present for part of the day," Helen Clark said.

"I also intend to visit the cultural event in Manukau City."

Helen Clark said that there were many events throughout New Zealand on Waitangi Day supported by local iwi, councils and many ethnic and cultural groups.

She urged the public to attend events in their local area and make the day a positive occasion for all New Zealanders.

Helen Clark said that on Thursday 1 February and Friday 2 February she would be visiting Maori health and social service projects in Northland
