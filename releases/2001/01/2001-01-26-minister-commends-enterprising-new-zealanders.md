A worm breeding co-operative, a cable car manufacturer and a footwear designer are among winners in the latest round of Industry New Zealand Enterprise Awards, Associate Commerce Minister Laila Harré announced today.

Speaking to the Franklin Small Business Enterprise Centre, Laila Harré said the awards are an integral part of the Labour-Alliance coalition's fresh approach to small business development.

"The Enterprise Awards fit snugly with the Alliance's commitment to job creation, and that's why Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton has taken a personal interest in tailoring them to meet the needs of New Zealand entrepreneurs.

"With jobs comes economic activity and personal fulfilment, and this will have positive spin offs into many of the social policy areas the Alliance is also keen to progress.

"Small and medium enterprises are a critical part of our economic framework. More than 40% of all New Zealanders work in small and medium enterprises, and 96% of businesses in New Zealand employ 19 or less full time staff," she said.

Earlier this week Jim Anderton announced that the amount businesses can be awarded for any one year has doubled, increasing from $10,000 to $20,000.

Other improvements include to the scheme:

\* Work on environmental standards can now be funded

\* A new category for eco-efficiency projects

\* Grants are now available for prototype material costs; international trade fair stand hire and the production of artwork and design

\* Companies with a turnover of less than or equal to $5 million a year and fewer than 20 full time staff are now included

\* Grants are available to help firms do work needed for international quality certification, benchmarking and systems evaluation

The new Industry New Zealand brochure on the scheme will be available next week.
