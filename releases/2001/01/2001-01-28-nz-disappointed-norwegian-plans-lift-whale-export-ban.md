Prime Minister Helen Clark today said she was very disappointed by Norway's plans to lift its ban on exports of whale products.

Norway has announced it intends to permit the export of whale blubber and other whale products stockpiles.

"This move by Norway is totally contrary to the wishes of most International Whaling Commission countries, including New Zealand, who are opposed to commercial whaling and trade in whale products," Helen Clark said.

"Norway has attempted to give its whaling activities legitimacy by applying a reservation to the International Whaling Commission's moratorium on commercial whaling, and a reservation on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species' articles banning trade in certain whale products.

"In short, Norway is stepping outside the framework the IWC has established to protect whales.

"As an IWC member, New Zealand encourages Norway to drop its reservations and embrace the moratorium on commercial whaling and trading whale products."

"Norway's action is contrary to the spirit of the IWC, and I have asked New Zealand's representatives at The Hague to make our views known to the Norwegian government," Helen Clark said.
