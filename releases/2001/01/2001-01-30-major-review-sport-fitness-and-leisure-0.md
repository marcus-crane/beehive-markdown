Sport, Fitness and Leisure Minister Trevor Mallard has today released a major review into sport, fitness and leisure.

Trevor Mallard said the report was the most comprehensive look at the sector since the 1985 "Sport on the Move" report which resulted in the establishment of the Hillary Commission.

"The Government's main objectives for sport, fitness and leisure are to increase participation and promote excellence. The terms of reference focused around these objectives and I asked the Taskforce to clearly define a vision for the sector that will meet the needs of New Zealanders over the next 25 years.

"This was a huge task and I would like to thank the chairman John Graham and the other taskforce members for the time, commitment, and energy they have put into producing this report.

"I'd also like to thank staff who worked on the report, and the hundreds of organisations and individuals who made written and oral submissions.

"There are obviously financial and other practical considerations to take into account before the Government responds to this report. The recommendations in the report traverse a large number of government agencies and I am seeking advice from those agencies and organisations before Cabinet discusses a formal response to the report.

"But not only does this report contain recommendations to the Government, it contains a recommendation to all New Zealanders to become more active. I hope people will take this seriously.

"Overall, it is important to note that the report does not provide a short-term quick-fix solution. The Government's response to this will be implemented over several years with the aim of reaping the rewards over several decades," Trevor Mallard said.

The review is available of the Executive Government website from 3.30pm at www.executive.govt.nz/minister/mallard/taskforce.
