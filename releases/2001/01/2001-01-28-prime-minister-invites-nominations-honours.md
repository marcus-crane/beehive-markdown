Prime Minister Helen Clark is asking New Zealanders to make nominations for the honours lists again.

"In March the Government will be looking at the nominations it has received over the last six months to make a selection for inclusion in this year's Queen's Birthday Honours, to be announced on 4 June 2001.

"This year is the International Year of the Volunteer. I welcome the nomination of people who work tirelessly in a voluntary capacity to help others, through charitable, cultural, sporting, and community groups.

"In July last year I asked members of the public to put forward the names of those persons who, in a variety of ways, often quietly and with little or no reward, make a difference by helping others in the community.

"The high number of nominations was most encouraging and many of the nominees were subsequently recognised in the New Year Honours list.

"The honours system relies largely on members of the community making nominations. I encourage those people who are aware of individuals who give freely of their time and resources to assist others in the community to nominate them for consideration," Helen Clark said.
