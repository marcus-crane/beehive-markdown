The Minister of Defence Mark Burton said the New Zealand Army is enlisting four experienced officers who have served with Fiji's military forces.

"The officers are well known to the New Zealand Defence Force and have served with the NZDF in the past. Three of them trained with our Army in New Zealand, and one trained in Australia.

"Careful checks have been made and none of the four officers had any involvement with last year's coup in Fiji. Two of the officers were serving with the New Zealand battalion in East Timor at the time, and one was serving as an instructor in New Zealand. The officer who was in Fiji has been commended for his loyal actions during the coup.

"All four officers approached the NZDF.

"Enlistment of experienced personnel into the NZDF from other countries is a long established practice, and a robust process is used to identify suitable candidates.

"Personnel have been enlisted recently from Canada, Malaysia and the United Kingdom.

"This is not the first time former members of the Fiji Military Forces have been enlisted into the New Zealand Army. Fiji officers have served us very well in the past and the four officers being enlisted now will be welcome additions to our Army."
