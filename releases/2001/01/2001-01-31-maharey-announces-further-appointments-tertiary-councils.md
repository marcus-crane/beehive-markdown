New Government appointees to university, polytechnic and college of education councils were announced today by Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey.

Tertiary institution councils have the responsibility under the Education Act for the governance of New Zealand's thirty-eight public tertiary institutions. The councils are composed of community, industry, staff, student and Ministerial representatives and appointments. Mr Maharey said that the new Government was making the appointments to tertiary institution councils to strengthen their ability to respond to the local needs of their communities and ensure the quality of their programmes.
