Transport Minister Mark Gosche has welcomed the news that last year's road toll was the lowest in 36 years.

"New Zealand motorists are taking the road safety message seriously – everyone needs to be congratulated in getting our road toll down: the lowest we have ever had in three decades," said Mr Gosche.

In 2000 462 people were killed on New Zealand roads – 47 less than 1999. In 1964, 428 people died in car crashes.

Given the increasing numbers of cars on New Zealand roads the lowering road toll was good news.

However Mr Gosche said the news also highlighted the need for all motorists to step up their vigilance and care when driving.

"Since we began recording our road toll thousands of families across the country have buried loved ones who were killed in car crashes," said Mr Gosche.

"Since 1995 that has meant 3107 mums and dads, sons and daughters who never made it home. Tens of thousands of others have been maimed and injured in car crashes."

"The fiscal price is staggering but the price paid by those left behind, our families and communities is immeasurable, permanent and unacceptable."

"Today's news heralds changing attitudes to road safety in New Zealand."

"But we can do better and we can work to make sure that our roads are as safe as possible."

In June the Labour-Alliance Coalition Government announced a new $152 million road safety package that saw the first increase in road safety education spending in six years. The new funds included more money for community education projects and the new Highway Patrol, which was launched in time for Christmas.

"I would like to pay credit to our road safety educators, Land Transport Safety Authority, police officers and other individuals who work to make our roads safer for all motorists," said Mr Gosche.

"Their job is to save lives and our latest statistics prove that they've been successful."

"The holiday period is yet to finish and I would like to once again urge all motorists to take it easy on our roads and to drive to survive this year."

"Let's all make it home after the holidays."
