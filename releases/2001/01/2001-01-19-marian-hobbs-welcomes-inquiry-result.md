The MP for Wellington Central Marian Hobbs has welcomed the release of two reports which confirmed her eligibility for claiming a Wellington accommodation allowance before the last election.

The Parliamentary Service and the Higher Salaries Commission have both confirmed that the claims made by Ms Hobbs were within the conditions applying under HSC determinations.

"I sought advice from the Parliamentary Service as to my allowance entitlement and acted upon that advice," she said. "I am pleased that the investigations have supported my actions."
