The Government has appointed Tracey Tangihaere, Chief Executive of Te Runanga O Turanganui A Kiwa to the Board of Career Services, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Career Services is a government agency which provides career advice, planning and information and promotes the importance of career planning. Mr Maharey said Ms Tangihaere's experience working with industry, educators, and Maori training providers would be a valuable asset for the Board.

Ms Tangihaere, appointed for a three year term, is the Chief Executive of Te Runanga O Turanganui A Kiwa, an Iwi Development Agency for Te Aitanga a Mahaki, Ngai Tamanuhiri, Rongowhakaata. She has previously worked as registered nurse, community employment advisor, and consultant.

"Access to quality careers information and guidance is an essential tool for all New Zealanders in the modern economy.

"Ms Tangihaere’s extensive experience and links to the employment and career development sector will be of great benefit to the Board and to the development of Career Services", Steve Maharey said.
