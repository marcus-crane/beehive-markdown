Conservation Minister Sandra Lee has announced that contractual work valued at more than $400,000 havs been let to upgrade visitor facilities and improve public access to unique wildlife on Ulva Island, in Stewart Island's Paterson Inlet.

Ms Lee praised the Ulva Island Conservation Trust for its "substantial fundraising efforts" to enable DOC to authorise upgrading a 4.5km pathway through forests dominated by rimu, southern rata and kamahi, and the provision of two new shelters as well as the production of a new self-guide brochure for future visitors.

"Local media describe Ulva Island as 'accessible magic'," Ms Lee said. "Visitors are likely within moments of landing to find a weka tootling alongside them to check their footwear, while saddleback birds, Stewart Island robins, kakariki and kaka dart through the foliage above."

Ulva Island Trust chairman Peter Goomes has acknowledged "generous donations" from the Community Trust of Southland ($100,000), the Minister of Tourism ($35,000), the Les Hutchins Conservation Foundation ($20,000) and the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand's Stewart Island branch ($8000).

Ms Lee said the contracted work was expected to be completed by June 2001.

The 267-hectare island was declared rat-free in 1997 after an intensive eradication programme.
