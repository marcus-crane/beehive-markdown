The wood industry is one of the ripest opportunities for New Zealand's economic development, Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton said today.

He chaired a meeting of the wood processing industry steering group at his official residence in Wellington, Vogel House, today. The informal meeting with about thirty sector invitees was followed by a barbecue at Vogel House.

Jim Anderton says better wood processing holds the potential to unlock vast opportunities from our forestry resources.

"Every raw log shipped overseas is an economic failure. We have to turn those logs into processed products, including paper and finished wood products such as pre-built houses, furniture and manufacturing componentry.

"The Government is committed to working in partnership with the forest industry to remove the obstacles to further wood processing in New Zealand and today is one of the ways we are showing it."

The wood processing sector meeting and BBQ is the first in a series Mr Anderton intends to host with selected strategic industries.
