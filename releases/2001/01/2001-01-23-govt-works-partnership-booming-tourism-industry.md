The Government will continue to work in partnership with the tourism industry to maximise benefits from the very positive outlook for the industry, the Minister of Tourism Mark Burton said.

Mark Burton was responding to the Tourism Industry Association's Tourism Outlook Survey.

"50% of the tourism operators surveyed expect to employ more staff and more than two-thirds are expecting increased profits.

"Tourism is now a key driver of economic activity in New Zealand.

"The Government's responsibility is to ensure this growth is sustainable on all levels – economically, culturally, socially and environmentally. During 2000, I worked with the industry to build up the positive relationships necessary to ensure a cooperative and coordinated effort.

"The development of the New Zealand Tourism Strategy is the key to this approach.

"New Zealand has never had a proper strategy to manage the continued growth of the tourism sector, and the implications of that growth," Mark Burton said.

"The New Zealand Tourism Strategy is at the heart of the Government's vision for the industry – and in partnership with the tourism industry, local government, Maori and conservation interests, excellent progress is being made."

Mark Burton said he expects to receive the draft strategy at the end of March.
