The New Zealand Defence Force will receive an advance delivery of new tactical mobile radios next month.

In August last year, as part of its commitment to rebuild the capability of the New Zealand Defence Force, the Government approved the purchase of more than 1800 radios for the New Zealand Army and the Royal New Zealand Air Force.

The Ministry of Defence has successfully negotiated the early delivery of 70 hand-held radios and 14 multiband radios. This first batch will arrive in late February. The balance of 585 hand-held radios is scheduled for delivery later in the year. The radios include encryption and frequency hopping to avoid detection.

The Minister of Defence Mark Burton has checked out the new digital hand-held radios, which are a fraction of the size and weight of the Vietnam War era radios currently in use in East Timor.

"The tactical mobile radios are a key component of the Government's determination to provide New Zealand forces with the equipment they need to work effectively," Mark Burton said.

"This is particularly important in relation to New Zealand’s operational deployments, such as peace support operations with the United Nations."

Ministry of Defence project manager Steve Hollett said in addition to the 655 hand held portable radios, the range of communications equipment includes manpacks and vehicle mounted radios including 786 Very High Frequency (VHF), 361 High Frequency (HF), and 51 specialised tactical multiband radios.

"The new Light Armoured Vehicles and proposed new Light Operation Vehicles will be fitted with variances of the new radios. The combination of radios will provide medium and long-range communications including satellite communications for specialised uses by both the Army and the Air Force."
