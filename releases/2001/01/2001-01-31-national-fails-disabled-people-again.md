The National Party's latest reshuffle shows its complete disregard for the rights of disabled people, Minister for Disability Issues Lianne Dalziel said today.

"In her new line-up, Jenny Shipley has not bothered to appoint anyone as the spokesperson for disability issues," Ms Dalziel said.

"One in five New Zealanders has a long term disability. Yet, once again, National has chosen to ignore the needs and rights of this sizeable section of the population.

"At a time when the Labour-Alliance Coalition Government is developing a national disability strategy and working closely with disabled people to remove the barriers which stop them participating fully in society, National has not even bothered to acknowledge the importance of addressing disability issues in today's society.

Unfortunately, this is simply another example of National's outdated attitudes towards disabled people and their failure to keep up with national and international trends."
