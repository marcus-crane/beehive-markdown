Acting Prime Minister Jim Anderton is expressing sympathy for the Marlborough community after fires in the region and says the Government is ready to consider a role in assisting the community to recover.

Rural Affairs Minister Jim Sutton and MAF are watching the situation closely and are being kept informed.

About 25 properties have been affected by the fires, with damage of more than $4 million.

"All New Zealanders will be sympathetic to the plight of a community affected at this very distressing time of the year," Jim Anderton said.

"This was a very large fire and it is fortunate that no one was killed or any houses lost."

Jim Anderton said the Government would not just sit on the sidelines and wish the local community luck.

"The Government is waiting to hear back from Federated Farmers with a full assessment of the damage and then we'll work with the Marlborough council and community organisations.

"The most expensive damage suffered has been to fencing, and if the local community requires it then the Government could consider making available Taskforce Green labour for fencing repair work.

"It is important for the affected region to know that the Government recognises that there is a significant problem and that the Government is ready to consider the best role it can play," Jim Anderton said.
