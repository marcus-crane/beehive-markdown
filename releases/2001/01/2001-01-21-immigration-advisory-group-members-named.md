Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel today named the six people appointed to a newly formed immigration Ministerial Advisory Group and the four members of a Refugee sub-group.

The group has been set up to provide additional advice to the Minister on the community's views on immigration policy and practice.

"I am pleased to announce that William (Bill) Milnes, Dr Ashraf Choudhary, Parthasarathy Bhagavathula (Partha Sarathy), Samuelu Sefuiva, Patrick O'Connor, Trudie McNaughton and Karen Te-O-Kahurangi Grant will make up the membership of the new Ministerial Advisory Group.

"In addition, we have appointed Patrick O'Connor, Heval Hylan, Abbas Mohammed El-Shiekh and Zeinab Hussein on to the advisory group's Refugee sub-group.

"Collectively these people will provide a sounding board for specific aspects of Government immigration policy. This will help me in my role as Minister of Immigration to better understand what barriers exist to effective implementation of policies Government seeks to introduce.

"In deciding on the make-up of these groups, we sought individuals who collectively offer a broad perspective covering all aspects of immigration and settlement policy, " Lianne Dalziel said. Ethnic Affairs Minister George Hawkins will join Lianne Dalziel at the Group meetings.

The Advisory Group has its first meeting on February 21, 2001.

"The additional creation of a Refugee sub-group takes into account the special needs of refugees resettling in New Zealand."

The Population Conference held in 1997 recommended setting up the advisory group.
