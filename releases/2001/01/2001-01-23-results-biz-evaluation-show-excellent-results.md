"The BIZ and BIZinfo schemes are really helping Kiwi business, but new research shows us some changes may be needed", said Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton.

"Over 31,000 people and 7,000 businesses have been supported and this evaluation shows that BIZ works but can work better. The Government is assessing the programme to make changes which will be announced early this year.

A seven volume evaluation of the BIZ and BIZinfo programmes that advise and assist business was released today.

"This is the most comprehensive evaluation carried out on a New Zealand industry assistance programme, and it will be invaluable in looking at ways this Labour Alliance Coalition Government can tune the jobs machine to create sustainable employment and businesses," said Jim Anderton.

The full results are available on the Ministry of Economic Development website.  
BIZ has two streams: -  
· a general information service available to everyone through call centres and local BIZ shops and  
· a management upskilling stream targeted at improving the skills of managers of small and medium businesses.

The evaluation was carried out by an independent consortium made up of BERL (Business and Economic Research Ltd), the National Research Bureau, and the New Zealand Centre for SME Research at Massey University.

The research which ended up as seven volumes covered:  
· a survey of 800 small and medium businesses throughout NZ on their awareness of the BIZ programme and its services;  
· interviews with 32 of the 44 BIZ providers on the programme;  
· interviews with 800 clients of the BIZ programme;  
· a mystery shopper survey of the BIZ call centres and BIZ shops;  
· a review of the contract management and administration of the programme by MED; and  
· a set of in-depth interviews with groups of Maori and Pacific peoples who had used BIZ services.
