"Last year she imagined Pacific Islanders climbing in her windows at night - this year she is imagining cabinet papers," says State Services Minister, Trevor Mallard.

"Jenny Shipley still hasn't learnt the difference between fact and imagination. A central part of being opposition leader is being bright enough to check your facts and not to say the first thing that comes into your head.

"She claimed the issue of state sector bonuses was discussed at a cabinet committee meeting in August. Two papers on wage bargaining went to a cabinet committee in August. They related to collective employment agreements for secondary principals and caretakers and cleaners. Neither of these agreements has a bonus component.

"State sector chief executives have been briefed by both the Prime Minister and the State Services Commissioner about the need for frugality within the public service. They have also been reminded of the need for a fair and transparent remuneration system. Bonus payments - especially those made on a department wide basis - are unlikely to fit those criteria.

"While she was State Services Minister, Mrs Shipley set up a system whereby bonus payments and other ad hoc remuneration systems took the place of good faith bargaining and transparent contracts.

"She has left us with an unsatisfactory situation and this government is sorting it out.

"Perhaps Mrs Shipley should make a late new years resolution to check her facts before she blurts forth again," Trevor Mallard said.
