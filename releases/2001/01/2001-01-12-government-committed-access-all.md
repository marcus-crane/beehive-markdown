Acting Prime Minister Jim Anderton today released a number of reports and information on Government activity to reduce inequality in New Zealand.

The reports cover economic development, commerce, communications, tourism, research, science and technology, and the Public Trust.

"The reports show that the Labour Alliance Coalition Government is committed to improving opportunities for individuals, businesses, communities and regions. The reports include the Tairawhiti Development Taskforce report which is an example of how an entire region is being assisted, benefiting all those who live in the area through improved economic performance.

"Also released is information on the range of programmes and assistance available through Industry New Zealand. When the Labour Alliance Coalition Government created Industry New Zealand in October 2000 it was to support industry and businesses and help anyone overcome barriers to business development and to improve employment opportunities.

"The whole of New Zealand benefits when regions and industries are performing well, and when every member of our community can participate and add value to our society," said Jim Anderton.

The material released includes monitoring reports that went through the cabinet committee on closing the gaps.

"Fighting inequality requires a wide range of initiatives and these reports show the Coalition Government is seriously addressing many of them," said Jim Anderton.
