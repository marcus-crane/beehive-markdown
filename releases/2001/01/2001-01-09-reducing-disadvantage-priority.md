Minister Trevor Mallard today released reports which underline the government's commitment to helping disadvantaged New Zealanders.

The reports cover the Education, State Services, Education Review Office, Sport Fitness and Leisure portfolios, as well the National Library, Trevor Mallard said.

"Through the 'eighties and 'nineties the rich-poor gap in this country widened alarmingly.

"This government is committed to fighting inequality across the board, which is why we have programmes that specifically target disadvantaged groups. For example, in education, we have increased funding for the discretionary grants scheme to provide buildings for early childhood education, launched study support centres in schools and a modern apprenticeships programme.

"Our greatest investment in education aimed at reducing disadvantage is a $52m boost to Targeted Funding for Educational Achievement (TFEA), made possible with the removal of bulk-funding. This is ongoing funding into a programme designed by the National Party. The extra funding will flow into schools from this year.

"TFEA provides additional funding to schools based on socio-economic indicators such as parental education level, income and employment status. It helps schools meet the additional challenges of educating children from disadvantaged homes. Schools in areas made poorer by the former National government have benefited the most.

"While tackling disadvantage across the board, we also recognise that a one-size-fits-all approach doesn't work.

"The government is acknowledging that Maori and Pacific peoples fared worst as the rich-poor gap widened, by funding capacity-building programmes.

"That will enable Maori and Pacific communities and their organisations to raise the aspirations and living standards of their people by doing it their way.

"The material being released today includes reports on the initiatives that have been through the cabinet committee on closing the gaps.

"These initiatives, along with other programmes aimed at fighting inequality, demonstrate that we are committed to governing in the interests of all New Zealanders

"This is a long-term strategy and we cannot expect results overnight, but it is critical that we make a start now," Trevor Mallard said.
