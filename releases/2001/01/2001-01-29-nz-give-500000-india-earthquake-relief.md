Cabinet today agreed that New Zealand will make a contribution of $500,000 towards relief efforts following the catastrophic weekend earthquake in India, Prime Minister Helen Clark and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Phil Goff announced today.

The earthquake has been called the worst ever disaster in India, with a reported death toll of over 20,000 and many more missing and injured. Many villages have been almost totally destroyed with serious damage to services throughout the state.

"The grant reflects the magnitude of the disaster and also acknowledges the close links between New Zealand and the state of Gudjarat from which many Indian families in this country originally migrated from.

"The Government has already sent a message of sympathy and condolences to the Indian Prime Minister, on behalf of all New Zealanders," Helen Clark and Phil Goff said

The funds come from the New Zealand Official Development Assistance Programme's disaster relief allocation.

At this stage no reports had been received of any New Zealanders being involved in the disaster, but the New Zealand Embassy in New Delhi was still seeking to confirm this.
