Minister of Police Hon George Hawkins today announced statistics that show the lowest level of recorded burglary since 1982.

Police provisional statistics show burglary offences have dramatically reduced down from 74,490 recorded burglaries for the 1999 calender year to 66,525 for the year 2000.

"This result displays the lowest recorded burglary rate since 1982 - that's an 18 year low," George Hawkins said.

"This result proves that the Labour/Alliance Government's anti-burglary policies are working.

"I want to applaud all Police for their commitment and hard work in cracking down on burglary and associated crime.

Burglary resolution rates have also improved to 15.8% - the best resolution rate in 12 years.

Household burglaries, in particular, have fallen by 13.9% from 47,621 in 1999 to 41,003 in year 2000.

Similarly, car conversions are also down by 14.35% from 25,680 in 1999 to 21,995 in year 2000.

"The statistics demonstrate an established trend of crime reduction. The statistics also show that the Government's results orientated approach to policing is working.

"Police have responded to the Government's anti-burglary policies. This Government said from the day it came into office that it would reduce burglary. We have delivered on that commitment," George Hawkins said.

"My message has been consistent. Burglary is a high priority crime. This is because burglary is clearly at the centre of the criminal culture. If we take burglary seriously, and both the Government and the Police do, then the criminal community is exposed.

"The previous National led government considered burglary a low priority crime. It was preoccupied with a glitzy corporate mirror-glass image - gazing down a hole called INCIS. They ought to be reminded of that.

"In contrast, this Government has focussed on law and order. In last year's Budget, this Government provided Police with $86 million more dollars than the previous government did. I have provided Police with more resources than any previous Minister of Police.

"Police ought to be applauded for this crime reduction result. They have responded to the Government's insistence that burglaries be attended to within 24 hours. Police teams dedicated to reducing burglaries and apprehending criminals are professional and clearly achieve results," George Hawkins said.

"I am satisfied that the Police are well positioned to continue this 'results orientated policing' to crack down on criminals and catch crooks," George Hawkins said.
