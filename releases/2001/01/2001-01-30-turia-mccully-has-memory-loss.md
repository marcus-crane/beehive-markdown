It is interesting that Murray McCully would be so critical of work his party instigated when in government, says Associate Minister of Corrections Tariana Turia.

"His recent attacks on policy development such as the Corrections Department Treaty of Waitangi policy and rehabilitation programmes development show that National is continuing to fumble over its policy direction.

"National started this work well before the 1999 Election and now as they sit stagnating in opposition, it seems they are willing to attack anything that promotes participation by our whanau hapu and iwi in their own development, even if it was National who began the process.

"In fact Murray McCully was in Cabinet when this work was being done and should have known about it and we didn't hear him complaining then. To do so now is a bit rich.

"Over half the inmates currently are of Maori descent, so it is important that the Department of Corrections has a solid Treaty of Waitangi policy as well as developing productive relationships with iwi to assist them in reducing this figure.

"This work is part of the government's overall effort to reduce the number of Maori entering prisons by developing stronger relationships between the Corrections Department and whanau, hapu and iwi.

"These relationships are based on mutual respect and focused on the positive development of the inmates, so they can productively contribute to society.

"I believe the work being done by Corrections Department is extremely important in reducing the numbers of Maori in prisons through successful rehabilitation.

"Why does Murray McCully not want our prison inmates to gain the skills to participation fully and productively in our society. This attack demonstrates Murray McCully's lack of credibility," Tariana Turia said.
