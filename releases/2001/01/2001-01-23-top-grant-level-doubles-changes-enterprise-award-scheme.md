"I am pleased to announce changes to the Enterprise Awards Scheme to make it even more successful, including a doubling of the top grant level from $10,000 to $20,000," said Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton.

"In the few months since the Awards Scheme was launched we have made approaching 100 grants to help create jobs and give business a kick start. The changes are designed to make the Jobs machine even more successful and meet the needs that New Zealand entrepreneurs have,

The Scheme is run by Industry New Zealand.

Grants have been up to $10,000 for the development of business plans, marketing assistance, feasibility studies, obtaining specialist advice and other services.

"It is important that the Scheme is streamlined to make assessment of applications quicker, and that grants are available for things which aren't being covered, particularly factors such as envirnomental awards," said Jim Anderton.

Jim Anderton announced today:  
1\. Businesses can now be awarded up to $20,000 for any one year, instead of $10,000.  
2\. The work companies do on environmental standards can now be funded. (For instance, grants could be awarded for firms working towards Bio-Gro or similar certification, or on environmental impact monitoring).  
3\. Grants can also be made available for, Prototype material costs, International Trade Fair Stand Hire and Production of Artwork and Design.  
4\. We've put a sharper focus on small business with the Awards now covering companies with a turnover of less than or equal to $5 million a year and fewer than 20 full time staff.  
5\. There is a new category for eco-efficiency projects. (For instance, awards could be granted to cover the development of cleaner waste reduction programmes.  
6\. We're backing business and operational excellence by making grants available to help firms do the work needed for international quality certification, benchmarking and systems evaluation.

"When the Labour Alliance Coalition Government created Industry New Zealand in October 2000 it was to support industry, regions and businesses and overcome a range of barriers to employment and business development. The Enterprise Awards Scheme is an important part of this jobs machine," said Jim Anderton.
