A former chairperson of the Children's Television Foundation, Dr Bronwyn Hayward, of Christchurch, has been appointed to the Broadcasting Standards Authority, the Minister of Broadcasting, Marian Hobbs, announced today.

Dr Hayward’s appointment is for three years and fills a vacancy on the board left by the resignation of Ms Rosemary McLeod.

The Broadcasting Standards Authority is an independent statutory body established under the Broadcasting Act 1989. It hears complaints, issues advisory opinions on broadcasting standards and ethical conduct to broadcasters, encourages the development and observance of codes of broadcasting practice, and conducts research on matters relating to broadcasting standards.

"Dr Hayward, as a researcher, lecturer, community advocate and consultant in public communication and public policy, brings a great deal of experience to this role," Marian Hobbs said.

"She has a good understanding of the ethical issues relating to creating conditions for effective public debate, freedom of speech and the media, and children's and the community's rights in broadcasting.

"In 2000 she initiated the Parliamentary Forum on Children and the Media that was chaired by the Commissioner for Children, and in 1999 facilitated a South Island forum of community groups, advertising, broadcasting and government agencies to negotiate codes for advertising and broadcasting with regard to children."

Dr Hayward has a PhD in public policy and is a private consultant in communication and public policy.
