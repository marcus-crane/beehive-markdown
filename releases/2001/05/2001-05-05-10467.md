Education Minister, Trevor Mallard has welcomed the National Party's acceptance of the Government's senior school assessment policy.

"I am delighted that Mr Brownlee has convinced Mrs Shipley and his other colleagues to support the continuation of the NCEA. This provides certainty to students, parents and teachers alike.

"I also welcome Mr Brownlee's support for the scholarship component of senior school assessment which I foreshadowed last year.

"National's 'new ideas' on assessment, have simply confirmed the status quo," says Trevor Mallard.
