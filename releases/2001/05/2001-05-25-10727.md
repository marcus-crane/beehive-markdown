Kiwi expertise and knowledge has been recognised in the awarding of a USA contract to build a $480 million satellite-based air traffic control system, the Minister of State Owned Enterprises Mark Burton said today.

"I want to congratulate Airways New Zealand for their successful involvement in bidding for this major project," Mark Burton said.

"It is a good example of a New Zealand SOE having developed skills and abilities which are internationally credible and competitive."

Airways is involved in a Lockheed Martin-led consortium that will replace Oceanic air traffic control systems at three FAA centres that handle oceanic traffic in international airspace over the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

The fully computerised satellite-based system will give international airlines the ability to request re-routing at any point along their journey to make the most of wind patterns, keep flight times to a minimum and reduce fuel costs.

"The Government expects SOEs to run as efficient and successful companies," Mark Burton said. "For some, this will include exploring new business opportunities overseas, to fully utilise their intellectual capital and realise maximum benefits for New Zealanders.

"In winning this major contract, and by being among the final three contenders to run Britain's National Air Traffic Services, Airways has firmly established itself as a world leader in air traffic management," Mark Burton said.
