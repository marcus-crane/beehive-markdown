"The current attacks on my personal life are being driven by some who want to discredit me politically," said Cabinet Minister Sandra Lee today.  
"I am also appalled that people close to me are being dragged into the political arena," she said. "I'm the politician, not them."  
Ms Lee was commenting on recent media reports about her partner and her former senior private secretary.  
"Whatever the personal attacks my opponents mount against me, I will continue to remain staunch in defence of my political beliefs and those of my party and the Labour-Alliance coalition government," she said.  
"I am entitled to a personal life just like any other Member of Parliament."  
Ms Lee said she would be making no further comment on these issues today.
