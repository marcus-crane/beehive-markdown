Pacific Education Ministers from more than a dozen countries will be meeting for two days in Auckland next week, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

Trevor Mallard said the Ministers will be accompanied by their heads of department to the forum next Monday and Tuesday (May 14-15).

"It will be a great honour for me as Minister of Education in New Zealand to welcome such an important contingent of visitors," Trevor Mallard said.

"I hope that it will lead to much stronger education relationships throughout the region."

Day one of the forum will focus on Pacific Education : Where to Now?, while day two will consider the financing and delivery of quality basic education.

"We all have one thing in the foremost of our minds, and that's the education of our young people," Trevor Mallard said.

"I also welcome to opportunity for New Zealand some of our experience and expertise with our neighbours.

"For so many Pacific nations to be participating in the same forum will be a perfect opportunity to explore at first hand the collaboration that can take place in the best interests of us all."
