The first ex gratia payments have been made to New Zealanders who were held prisoners by the Japanese during World War Two, the Minister of Veterans' Affairs Mark Burton announced today.

The Government announced last month that it would make ex gratia payments of $30,000 per person to ex-prisoners of war and civilian internees of Japan, or their surviving spouses.

"The conditions in Japanese prison camps during World War Two were horrific," Mark Burton said. "The payments are recognition of the extraordinary hardships endured by New Zealand prisoners of war and civilian internees.

"People who think they may be eligible have been asked to contact the Office of Veterans' Affairs, and the first batch of applications has now been processed.

"Five payments have been made. Cheques for $30,000 have gone to two Navy veterans, one Airforce veteran, and two civilians."

Mark Burton said it is thought that around 150 people may be eligible for the payment, but only 26 applications have been received to date.

"We will be continuing to liase with the RSA and other veterans' groups to seek out and advise people of their entitlement."

Claim forms can be obtained by telephoning 0800 483 8372. Claims need to be lodged by 23 April 2002.
