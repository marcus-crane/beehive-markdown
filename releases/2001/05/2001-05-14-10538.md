An application from Virgin Blue to operate on both the Trans-Tasman and domestic New Zealand routes has been received by the Minister of Transport Mark Gosche.

"I have received a letter from Virgin Blue outlining their request that the New Zealand Government allow them to operate under the Open Skies Agreement with Australia," said Mr Gosche.

"I have asked my officials to meet with Virgin Blue management to progress this request as soon as possible."

"We will also be seeking urgent discussions with the Australian Government who we understand have received the same documentation," he said.

"I look forward to positive discussions taking place with Virgin Blue who are keen to ensure competition expands in the New Zealand aviation market."
