The Minister of Police, George Hawkins, has signed off initial funding for an advertising campaign designed to attract between 600 and 700 new police recruits by 30 June 2002. Mr Hawkins said the new recruitment campaign, which begins on Friday, will particularly target women, Maori, Pacific Island and Asian peoples. "It is essential that the Police reflect the makeup of our community" said Mr Hawkins. "We have set optimum targets for each of those minority groups and I am looking forward to seeing how this campaign improves their representation." "In the term of this Government we have seen crime drop and resolutions improve. I am determined to see pressure kept on crooks and with these new recruits the New Zealand Police will be stronger than ever" said Mr Hawkins. The next wing of 60 Police recruits is due to enter the Police College next week.
