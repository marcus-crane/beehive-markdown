"The judgement speaks for itself"

The Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Margaret Wilson says the decision of the High Court in the Ngati Ruanui case speaks for itself.

"This case, like so many other differences, now belongs in the past. We can now proceed to the historic signing of the Deed of Settlement on Saturday and move forward to a new, positive and productive relationship between Ngati Ruanui and the Crown".
