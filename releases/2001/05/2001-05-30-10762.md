Racing Minister Annette King today introduced a new Racing Bill in Parliament.

Mrs King said the Bill, which will merge the Racing Industry Board and the TAB to form a new New Zealand Racing Board, reflected a great deal of hard work from the industry.

“The Bill is a real feather in the cap for the industry and is a credit to the excellent working relationship the industry developed with officials from Internal Affairs. The Bill will have its first reading in mid June and will then be sent to the Government Administration Select Committee for public submissions."
