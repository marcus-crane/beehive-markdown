Minister of Fisheries Pete Hodgson said today that the fishing company Sealord is selling none of its fishing vessels, contrary to allegations made by New Zealand First leader Winston Peters in Parliament today.

"I have been informed directly by the company that it has no plans to sell any of its vessels," Mr Hodgson said. "In fact it has just expanded its fleet with the addition of the Kiwa, which adds an extra 80 jobs."
