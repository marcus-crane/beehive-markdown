Govt to Create Special Food Administration Portfolio

The Government will create a special Food Administration Authority to safeguard New Zealand's food safety standards and reputation as a safe food exporter, the Acting Minister of Agriculture, Michael Cullen, announced today.

"Currently the Ministry of Health is responsible for administering food regulations within New Zealand while the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry administers food exports.

"We are going to integrate these functions within a single semi-autonomous agency attached to MAF. The agency will be serviced for administrative purposes by MAF but a new portfolio will be created so that it has its own Minister.

"It will also have its own Vote, its own policy capability and its own advisory board.

"Its responsibilities will include standard setting, liaising with local government authorities in running hygiene checks on public eating places and controlling the entry of new foods into the New Zealand market," Dr Cullen said.

The change would require legislation, a timetable for which had yet to be set.
