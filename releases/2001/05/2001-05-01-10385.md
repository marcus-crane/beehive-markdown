"New Zealand music has both a cultural and an economic benefit for New Zealand, and plays an important role in our community," said Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton, whose own family is full of musicians both classical and popular.

"Our music helps define who we are as New Zealanders. We have as much talent as Ireland which has music industry exports worth around $600 million a year," said Jim Anderton.

"We need to be proud of our people and our achievements. Music is an important part of those achievements," said Jim Anderton.

Jim Anderton said the last New Zealand album he bought was Neil Finn's "Try Whistling This.'
