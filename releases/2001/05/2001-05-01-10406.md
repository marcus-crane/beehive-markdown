The interim Code of Good Faith has held up so well under the Employment Relations Act that the Minister of Labour Margaret Wilson has decided to approve it without amendment.

The Code tells employers, managers, employees and unions what is expected of them to work within the Good Faith provisions of the Employment Relations Act.

The members of the Good Faith Bargaining Committee, representing employers and employees, have recommended that the interim Code of Good Faith should constitute, without amendment, the final Code.

Margaret Wilson says she will gazette a notice stating that the Code would continue in its present form.

"As a result, even more so than under the interim Code, employers, managers employees and unions will have certainty about the approach required of them, and a clear guideline to follow".
