The Minister of Police, George Hawkins, has confirmed that all Highway Patrol vehicles are being equipped with link-line radios. Link-line radios allow Police to remain in radio contact when they are in remote areas where there is no portable radio coverage, or when they are required to work away from their vehicles. The Highway Patrol, which was announced by Mr Hawkins in last year's Budget, is a specialist group to police New Zealand's state highways.

Eventually the Highway Patrol will boast 225 staff and 183 vehicles. Mr Hawkins said the process of equipping the existing 82 Highway Patrol vehicles with link-line radios will be completed within the next three weeks. New Highway Patrol vehicles provided from 1 July 2001 will arrive in the police districts already equipped with link-line radios. "I want to ensure the safety of Highway Patrol staff, who often work in difficult circumstances" said Mr Hawkins
