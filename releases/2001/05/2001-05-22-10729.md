Taupo MP and Minister of Tourism Mark Burton says he is thrilled that Taupo has three finalists in the 2001 New Zealand Tourism Awards.

The Award finalists have been announced at the Tourism Rendezvous New Zealand (TRENZ) tourism trade show in Christchurch.

Mark Burton opened TRENZ on Sunday evening at a function attended by more than 1400 tourism operators, buyers and media representatives.

"I am delighted that Taupo is well-represented in this year's tourism awards," Mark Burton said.

"Lakeland of Taupo is a finalist in the Motels, Motor Inns, Motor lodges and mid-range Hotels category.

"Taupo Tandem Skydive is a finalist in the Adventure category.

"And the 2001 Ironman is a finalist in the Conventions, Incentives and Events category.

"This deserved recognition reinforces Taupo's reputation for quality accommodation, exciting attractions and as a welcoming venue for major events.

"I also want to congratulate Destination Lake Taupo and all the local tourism operators who have participated in TRENZ.

"I might be biased, but I thought the Taupo display made one of the biggest splashes at TRENZ, and I have no doubt that a sizeable chunk of the billion-dollars worth of business done at the trade show will flow back to our region," Mark Burton said.
