Prime Minister Helen Clark today welcomed the President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Dr Johannes Rau, to New Zealand.

Dr Rau is scheduled to arrive in Wellington at 2.55 pm today and will be in New Zealand until Wednesday.

His activities include laying a wreath at the National War Memorial, visiting a sheep station near Queenstown, and attending a state luncheon in his honour at Parliament Buildings.

"Dr Rau's visit will also focus on the important economic and educational links between Germany, one of the world's powerhouse economies, and New Zealand," Helen Clark said.

"On Wednesday Dr Rau will visit Auckland University, where he will give the keynote address at the inauguration of the German Academic Exchange Service lectureship.

"This occasion will also see the opening of the German Information Centre on Research and Studies in Germany.

"The relationship between Germany and New Zealand, both governed by social democratic governments, is a warm one and I hope that Dr Rau and his wife Christina enjoy their brief visit to our country," Helen Clark said.

Helen Clark will call on Dr Rau in his suite at Wellington's Parkroyal hotel at 4.30 pm tomorrow.
