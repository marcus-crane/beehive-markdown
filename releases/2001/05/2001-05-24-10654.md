The Pacific Business Trust gets a $500,000 increase in the budget.

Pacific Island Affairs Minister Mark Gosche said the new funding would help the trust assist Pacific businesses nationwide and focus on skills unique to Pacific people, particularly in design, fashion and the arts.

"Pacific art is a dynamic, unique and growing sector whose artists need support and advice.

"The Government's commitment to help develop Pacific businesses shows that we are prepared to lead economic and social transformation throughout communities to build a stronger economy, society and future for all New Zealanders," Mr Gosche said.

The Pacific Business Trust is an Auckland-based crown entity that provides low-interest loans and business development advice to Pacific businesses and scholarships for young people.
