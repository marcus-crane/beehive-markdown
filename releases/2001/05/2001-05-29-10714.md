Customs to fast track checks on imported oil filters

Acting Customs Minister Jim Anderton today asked Customs to work with importers to ensure there are no delays in importing diesel engine oil filters.

"It is important for New Zealand to have a sufficient supply available for engines that are affected by diesel additives.

"I have asked Customs to confirm that tariff checks and other customs actions are handled as quickly as possible.

"The Government has a responsibility to try and ensure that our businesses and regions are not affected by any problems with fuel additives and this move is an integral step in a 'whole of government' response to these problems," said Jim Anderton.

The New Zealand Customs Service will work with New Zealand companies such as Gough, Gough and Hamer and Fleetguard to ensure that their replacement supplies of filters are identified and facilitated.
