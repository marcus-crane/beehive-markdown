Police Minister, George Hawkins is encouraging Maori community leaders to play their part in changing the face of the New Zealand Police.

"I am absolutely committed to ensuring that the New Zealand Police are just as diverse as the community they serve" said Mr Hawkins.

Mr Hawkins recently announced funding for a new police recruitment drive designed to attract 600-700 new police recruits by June 2002. That campaign will particularly focus on increasing the number of women, Maori, Pacific Island and Ethnic police officers.

"The Police are doing a great job – recorded crime has fallen to a ten year low. With more police who better represent our community we can get even tougher on crime" said Mr Hawkins.

"The Police recruitment drive will make use of ethnic media, but Maori leaders are in the ideal position to take this recruitment message to their communities. The more police reflect the community, the better they can serve that community" said Mr Hawkins.
