The Act Party has used taxpayer funds to promise to remove cell-phones from prisons, when they are already strictly prohibited.

Corrections Minister Matt Robson says he is at a loss to know why the Act Party is spending taxpayer money that way, after last week condemning 'taxpayer funding of political parties.'

Act makes the claim in a pamphlet called 'We're standing up for you'.

"Cellphones are banned in prison because they can be used to arrange crimes, harass victims and organise escapes," Matt Robson said.

"Only last week I launched the Corrections Law Review. It made it plain that cellphones are strictly prohibited in prison and likely to remain so. Even I had to give up my cellphone when I visited a prison last Friday.

"Of course, from time to time cellphones do get smuggled into prisons.

"If Act has some new ideas about how the prohibition can be enforced better, then they could make a submission to the Corrections Law Review. It is free and it would save the taxpayer thousands of dollars worth of colourful leaflets.

"Of course Act doesn't have new ideas. It is swaggering about making empty promises about a crack-down.

"The Party that says it wants Truth in Sentencing doesn't seem to be interested in Truth in its Pamphlets," Matt Robson said.
