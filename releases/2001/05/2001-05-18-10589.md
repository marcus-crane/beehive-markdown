The Acting Prime Minister, Jim Anderton, paid tribute to Betty Wark and her life's work today.

"I knew Betty for many years as a strong and determined worker for the many people that society rejects," he said.

"On the outside she appeared as a gentle kuia, but she was made of steel, as she needed to be, to help the people who had been hardened by the tough road of life."

"Betty was a person who will leave a real gap for the poor and dispossessed," Mr Anderton said. "One of her most admirable qualities was that she never sought either laurels or advancement for herself personally, but rather advancement and assistance for society's underdogs."

"She battled to the end for those people, and all New Zealanders will be saddened at her passing."
