Health and Safety submissions released

The Minister of Labour, Margaret Wilson, today released a summary of the submissions made in response to her discussion paper on health and safety in employment.

177 written submissions were received; 98 from employers; 18 from unions; 24 from health and safety professionals; and the remainder from interest groups, academics and researchers.

"Many of the submissions, predictably, reflected the interests of the sectors putting them forward. The value of the submissions is that they identify the various sectors' particular concerns. This now enables me to try to address these concerns in policy recommendations to Cabinet.

"I anticipate having further discussions with the principal stakeholders in the issue - especially employers and unions - before the matter is referred to Cabinet committees.

"At this stage it is intended to refer the matter to Cabinet by the beginning of July," said Margaret Wilson.
