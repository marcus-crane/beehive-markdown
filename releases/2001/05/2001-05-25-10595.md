Associate Tourism Minister Parekura Horomia said he is delighted that Budget 2001 has funding to support Maori regional tourism.

Mr Horomia said tourism is a key area of development for Maori and the funding of approximately $1 million dollars over the next three years is a good start to increase Maori participation in the billion dollar industry.

Mr Horomia said Maori are at the heart of the cultural tourism industry of New Zealand and they have also developed some world leading initiatives such as Whale Watch in Kaikoura.

"Whale Watch is an example of how an initiative can turn around a community and there is great potential for similar successes in other communities".

Mr Horomia said the New Zealand tourism strategy launched in Auckland last week emphasised the importance of increasing the participation rate by Maori at all levels of the industry - from service provision and delivery, through to management and board level.

Budget 2001 funding will allow for five Maori regional tourism organisations to use $338,000 in the next financial year. Similar funding is set aside for the following two years.
