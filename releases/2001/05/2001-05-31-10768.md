Associate Justice Minister Margaret Wilson has announced in-principle decisions by the government to establish a new Human Rights Commission and to address the issue of government compliance under the Human Rights Act.

The decisions are:

\* The new Human Rights Commission will keep the same name, will include a new post of Race Relations Commissioner, and take up the tasks previously performed by the Race Relations Conciliator  
\* The Bill of Rights Act is to be used as the anti-discrimination standard for the government – except in employment law and related areas. The Human Rights Act will continue to apply in the private and community sectors.

Margaret Wilson says the decisions announced today are the first step.

"The next stage is to bring draft legislation to parliament. There will be time for public discussion and submissions. It is important that the new law be in place before the end of the year because the government's exemption under the Human Rights Act expires on December 31".
