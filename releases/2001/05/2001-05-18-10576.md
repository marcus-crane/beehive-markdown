The Minister of Internal Affairs, George Hawkins, has been informed that the Casino Control Authority is seeking costs against a group that has opposed the Hamilton casino.  
The group unsuccessfully took court action against the grant of a casino licence to the Riverside Casino in Hamilton.  
"I appreciate that this decision is frustrating for the group, which has battled hard against having a casino in Hamilton" said Mr Hawkins "however, as the Minister of Internal Affairs I do not have the authority to intervene in such decisions."  
"The granting of casino licences and all related matters are the sole responsibility of the Casino Control Authority" said Mr Hawkins.
