Maori Affairs Ministers Parekura Horomia and Tariana Turia today announced a $15 million whanau, hapu, iwi and Maori communities' development Direct Resourcing Fund.

"Our people have long sought direct resourcing. This Government is delivering on that aspiration.

"Maori communities, formerly restricted to service delivery within heavily prescriptive central government contracts, will have greater control of their own development," Mr Horomia and Mrs Turia said.

The fund builds on the success of the Capacity Building and Tahua Kaihoatu \[Maori Provider Development Fund] initiatives and will be managed by Te Puni Kokiri \[Ministry of Maori Development.]

The $15 million will be spread over three years: $3 million in Year One, $6 million in Year Two and $6 million in Year Three \[2003-04].

"Whanau, hapu, iwi and Maori communities have identified their own priorities and drawn on their own skills to develop highly innovative solutions. They will be able to apply to the fund to develop those initiatives, providing greater opportunities for self-determination and acknowledgment of the rangatiratanga of hapu and iwi.

"New Zealand and New Zealanders can only benefit from these developments", Mr Horomia and Mrs Turia said.
