Housing New Zealand's waiting list has dropped and National MP David Carter knows it, Housing Minister Mark Gosche said today.

"Housing New Zealand's waiting list dropped from 11,492 on the 1 February, 2001 to 9,058 on the 28 February, and as at the 31 March stood at 8,260," said Mr Gosche.

This information was provided to Mr Carter in answers to recent parliamentary questions which are attached.

"The figures show Housing New Zealand's waiting list has dropped because we have housed 2,756 families and households this year alone."

(1,059 in March, 879 in February and 818 in January, 2001)

"We are also actively reviewing the waiting list and some applicants have indicated they no longer require housing or have been unable to be contacted. Housing New Zealand telephones and writes to people on their waiting list and applicants are only removed from the list when they cannot be found."

"Housing New Zealand cannot allocate a state house to an applicant they cannot find. However people can always reapply at any time."

"Mr Carter has made wild allegations in parliament that the waiting list was up to 14,000 despite having had information on a regular basis from my office."

"The current waiting list also contains existing Housing New Zealand tenants who have applied for a transfer to another property."

"This Government knows that there is tremendous need for housing in our communities amongst people who have suffered under the previous regime of market rents and the wholesale sell-off of more than 11,000 state houses nationwide."

"It is ironic that Mr Carter complains about a waiting list of 8,260 that would not exist if his Government had not sold all of those properties."

"This Government is working to meet the ongoing demand by better management of the allocation process and by increasing stock numbers."
