The public broadcasting charter for Television New Zealand has been approved by the Government and will be implemented from July 1, 2002, the Minister of Broadcasting, Marian Hobbs, announced today.

"The charter is similar to that of our other public broadcaster, Radio New Zealand and sets outs objectives and goals for TVNZ's broadcast content," Marian Hobbs added.

About 170 submissions were received after the draft charter was published for public consultation. More than 70 per cent supported it in general.

"These submissions were analysed independently and worked through with TVNZ," Marian Hobbs said. "We now have a more concisely expressed document."

She is asking Parliament's Commerce Select Committee, which is currently reviewing Radio New Zealand's charter, to consider how both charters could be monitored to ensure the broadcasters meet their obligations.

"I am aware that TVNZ has also been considering how monitoring might be achieved," she said.

"The charter establishes the standard we wish to reach in public broadcasting on television.

"Decisions on how the charter goals will be reached, including the structure of TVNZ, cost and method of funding, will be made soon.

"I would expect the implementation of the charter to be gradual."
