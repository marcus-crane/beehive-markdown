The Minister for the Environment, Marian Hobbs, has announced a  
series of hui to discuss environmental issues and policies with iwi and  
Maori around the country.

"The Ministry for the Environment, which is organising these hui, will be  
joined by the Maori Heritage Council of the Historic Places Trust," the  
Minister said. "The Ministry hopes to discuss matters of national  
interest such as water management and the Rio+10 programme, along with  
specific issues of concern to the local iwi.

"Iwi have indicated to the Ministry they want more information on  
environmental issues which affect their area. The first of the nine hui  
will be with northern iwi, hapuu, kaitiaki and environmental  
practitioners at a hui at Roma marae, this Thursday May 10. In the  
North they have asked to cover issues such as waste management,  
biodiversity issues such as possum control, water quality and, marine  
farming.

"The Ministry is aware that each area has its own set of needs and  
priorities. As officials move through the country they expect to see  
different priorities emerge."
