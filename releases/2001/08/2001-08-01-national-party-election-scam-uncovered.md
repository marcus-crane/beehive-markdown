All electors who are permanent residents of the Taupo electorate have every right to be outraged at what appears to be a secret scam promoted by the National Party leadership, Taupo MP Mark Burton said today.

"I've been told that National plans to ask its well-off supporters who have holiday homes in the Taupo region, to enrol in the Taupo electorate for the next general election, rather than in their normal place of residence.

"National obviously fears that it can't earn enough support from the people who permanently live in this electorate – so Mrs Shipley is trying to 'ship-in' the voters."

Mark Burton and Justice Minister Phil Goff challenged the National Party on this issue in Parliament this afternoon. There was no denial from the opposition benches.

"This misguided policy from Jenny Shipley and "new broom" Michelle Boag is a desperate and futile tactic – and it is against the law," Mark Burton said.

"It is a blatant attempt to undermine the right of the people of Taupo to determine who their representative to parliament should be. I know that local people will be outraged.

"I will be campaigning for re-election next year on the government's record and on my record as a committed local member of parliament. I'm happy to be honestly judged by my constituents on that basis," Mark Burton said.

"Dirty tricks from Jenny and Michelle certainly do not faze me."
