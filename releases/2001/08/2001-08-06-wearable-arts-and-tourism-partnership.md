Tourism Minister Mark Burton is hosting a function at Parliament this evening at which the Prime Minister Helen Clark will launch an exciting new partnership between tourism and culture.

Nelson-based Wearable Arts is to be promoted overseas by Tourism New Zealand as one of this country's premier cultural tourism attractions.

"Wearable Arts began 14 years ago as a promotion for an art gallery in Nelson," Mark Burton said. "Now the annual show attracts around 700 entries from all over the world. It's become a New Zealand cultural landmark.

"This government has emphasised the importance of partnerships – tonight we are celebrating a marketing and media partnership between Tourism New Zealand and Montana World of Wearable Arts.

"This arrangement is a good example of Tourism New Zealand working to broaden the visitor perception of New Zealand, by highlighting the country’s sophisticated mix of people and culture.

"Tourism New Zealand has had a relationship with Wearable Arts for several years now, using them on several occasions in offshore events promoting New Zealand. Now a long-term arrangement has been entered into. Wearable Arts will be used as part of an international marketing campaign for the next three years.

"This is a very appropriate and timely development, as Wearable Arts is evolving the show to a permanent facility. The new World of Wearable Art complex being constructed in Stoke, near Nelson, will turn New Zealand's unique fashion extravaganza into a year-round visitor attraction."

A private Nelson investor has supported the complex, with the government contributing a tourism facilities grant of $150,000.

"It is a wonderful combination of cultural creativity, business acumen, and community support," Mark Burton said. "The government is proud to be working in partnership with Wearable Arts, and this new marketing arrangement with Tourism New Zealand will ensure we showcase it to the world."
