Police Minister George Hawkins has come out in support of police action in the case of a convicted paedophile living in Kilbirnie.

Last week police delivered leaflets in the man's neighbourhood, alerting residents to his convictions and the fact that he is living close to the Strathmore School and Kindergarten.

"This case has generated a lot of public interest, and accordingly I have been briefed by the Police Commissioner on both the Police policy on this type of action, and on the considerations that led to the leaflet drop in Kilbirnie," said Mr Hawkins.

"I am satisfied that the Police take a very cautious approach towards publicising the presence of offenders and that the decision to do so in the Kilbirnie case has only been taken after very careful consideration.

"This unusual step is taken in very few cases, and has only been taken in this case because, on balance, the local police believed it was necessary to protect the safety of children in the area," said Mr Hawkins.
