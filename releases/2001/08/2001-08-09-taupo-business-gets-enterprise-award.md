Taupo MP Mark Burton has congratulated a Taupo company for its innovation which has seen the company earn government financial support.

Southern Fertiliser Company Limited has received an Industry New Zealand Enterprise Award.

"Southern Fertiliser has received $8,662 to assist the company in the marketing of targeting fertiliser for agriculture," Mark Burton said.

"Company director John Davis has created a service that has not been widely available to landowners before. By sitting down with a client, he creates a total fertiliser plan that is specifically tailored to the needs of both the land and the stock.

"I know that John believes the financial assistance from Industry New Zealand will make a real difference to his company's prospects.

"'Smart' businesses like this are the key to New Zealand's future and the government recognises that it has a role to play in supporting them.

"I encourage other businesses in our region to also apply to Industry New Zealand if they have an innovative product to market and develop," Mark Burton said.
