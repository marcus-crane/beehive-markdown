The New Zealand Embassy in Brazil opened its doors for business this week, Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Phil Goff announced today.

“The opening of the new Embassy represents an important step to enhancing our relationship with Brazil, and is an important aspect of the Government’s Latin America Strategy,” Phil Goff said.

The Latin America Strategy was launched by Prime Minister Helen Clark almost exactly a year go.

“The strategy has been developed to improve the depth and breadth of New Zealand’s relationships with Latin American countries through increased political relations and foreign policy cooperation, enhanced people-to-people linkages and improved trade and economic links.

“Having New Zealand representatives on the ground in Brazil at the new embassy will undoubtedly raise New Zealand's profile there.

“Provisional figures show New Zealand exports to Latin America in the year to June 2001 have increased by 83 percent to just over $1.2 billion. With a population of 165 million people, Brazil is among the world’s top 10 economies and is the South American continent’s largest. In short, Brazil offers enormous potential for New Zealand.

“The embassy enables New Zealand to establish day to day dialogue with Brazil on matters of mutual interest.

“This includes working together in the WTO to progress the Cairns Group aim of liberalisation in international agricultural trade. New Zealand and Brazil are also among the seven New Agenda group working together for nuclear disarmament.

“We also wish to work more closely together on the Antarctic Treaty System and United Nations issues, Mr Goff said.

Helen Clark proposes to officially open the new embassy in Brasilia during her four-country Latin America visit in November.
