Electricity consumers will soon be able to take problems with their electricity company to a new Electricity Complaints Commissioner.

Electricity industry representatives met in Energy Minister Pete Hodgson's office today to sign a memorandum of understanding on the establishment of the complaints scheme, which is required by the Government's Power Package electricity reforms.

"Many consumers have had poor service from power companies and their complaints have not been dealt with effectively," Mr Hodgson said. "That is about to change. The Complaints Commission service will be free, and consumers will be treated fairly because the scheme is independent from the industry."

Consumers will be able to complain to the Commission if they cannot resolve a dispute with their company over things like billing and disconnection. They may be awarded compensation if it is found they have been treated unfairly.

"The Electricity Complaints Commissioner won't be a remedy for all the problems in the electricity industry, but it is a valuable service for consumers, lines companies and retailers," Mr Hodgson said. "Consumers will get good value from the scheme and it will help to improve industry practice overall."

The Commissioner will refer to a Code of Practice that has been developed to ensure that dealings between companies and consumers are fair and reasonable. This Code will be subject to review after 12 months to ensure that it is working as effectively as possible for consumers.

The Government is committed to monitoring the scheme to ensure that it is working for consumers.

Foundation members of the scheme are Genesis Power, Meridian Energy, Mighty River Power, Delta, Dunedin Electricity, Counties Power, The Lines Company, Vector, Centralines, Scanpower, UnitedNetworks, Orion, Westpower, Electranet, Northpower, TrustPower, Otago Power, The Power Company and Electricity Invercargill. Other companies are in the process of signing up to the scheme and the steering group is optimistic it will achieve full industry coverage, as required by the Government.

Mr Hodgson said the scheme had already had a high level of consumer input during its development. Consumer groups and the Ministry of Consumer Affairs were consulted over its design.

"I'm pleased to see equal representation of consumers and industry on the commission that will oversee the scheme. Making this work will be an important step for the electricity industry in regaining the trust and confidence of consumers."

Mr Hodgson said he expected the scheme to be operational well before Christmas, providing a suitable Commissioner could be found and engaged without undue delay.
