Foreign Minister Phil Goff has launched the latest United Nations handbook which the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade publishes and distributes to various organisations world-wide.

This year's edition is particularly special, as the cover has been designed by a third- year student from the Massey University School of Design, Fine Arts and Music in Wellington.

"I'm delighted to announce Grace Yen-Yin Lin's design was chosen from several submitted by students at the School.

"Grace moved with her family to Palmerston North six years ago from Taiwan.

"Having her design on the cover of the UN handbook provides potentially enormous exposure around the world," Mr Goff said.

Grace's design suggests the many different ethnic groups around the world through its use of maps, colours and children's faces.

MFAT has published the handbook annually since 1961. It is widely regarded as a succinct and informative guide to the structure, activities, and membership of the UN and its subsidiary bodies.

"UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan describes the handbook as 'one of the most useful user-friendly tools at the UN'. Handbook subscribers from around the world clearly value the information it contains.

"MFAT has published the handbook since 1961 and that symbolises New Zealand's long-standing, practical commitment to the UN. It is referred to as the informal "bible" of the UN and is used by a wide variety of groups such as diplomats, foreign ministry officials and non-governmental organisations around the world," Mr Goff said.
