The Minister of Maori Affairs, Hon Parekura Horomia, said the process to appoint directors of the new Maori television service is independent and transparent.

Mr Horomia said accusations made by the Opposition in the House today were mischievous and ill-informed.

Mr Horomia refuted claims that he had entered into a deal with Derek Fox to appoint Mr Fox as the chief executive of the new Maori television service with a salary of $350 000.

"This is not correct. I have chosen to put out a press release to this effect because I do not want to be distracted by rumour and innuendo from the important task of getting the Maori television service up and running."

"There isn't a lot of time. We have to appoint seven directors to the interim board by the first week of September and then have the Maori television service on line by June of next year. To make this work, we need the best possible candidates appointed to the interim board."

Mr Horomia said I have therefore instigated a process to seek expressions of interest from as many talented Maori as possible.

"Derek Fox, as an eminent Maori broadcaster, is one of the many people who has been approached."

Once we have all of the expressions of interest, two appointment processes will take place. Four directors will be appointed by the Electoral College. Three directors will be appointed by myself and my ministerial colleagues.

"Once the interim board of the Maori television board has been appointed, the directors will appoint their chair and also their chief executive. Let me repeat the directors will appoint the chair and also the chief executive."

"You can see therefore that there is no way that I could appoint the chief executive of the new Maori TV Service."
