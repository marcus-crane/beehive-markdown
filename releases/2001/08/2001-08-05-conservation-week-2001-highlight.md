This week is 'Conservation Week', but featured activities will run beyond the standard seven day period.

Conservation Minister Sandra Lee says Department of Conservation supported activities throughout the country will focus on the natural and cultural features that have stemmed from New Zealand's geological isolation from other global land masses.

"DOC is recognising that our isolation has produced plant and animal species found nowhere else in the world apart from New Zealand with a raft of planned activities to celebrate, investigate and explore aspects of this uniqueness under the umbrella title of 'Unique New Zealand--Te Whenua Ahurei'.

"New Zealand's plant and animal life evolved special and unique characteristics because it developed in an environment that was free from browsing and predatory mammals, and isolated by the sea.

"Primeval forest trees and plants that died out in other larger lands continued to flourish here. Some of our birds became flightless and ground-dwelling. They adapted themselves to ecological niches that elsewhere in the world would have been filled by mammals. Even the tuatara survived, the sole remaining member of a reptilian order that disappeared elsewhere about 100-million years ago.

"Our environment remained unmodified for millions of years, and thousands of years after human habitation had altered much of the rest of the world. The threat to our unique biodiversity has been addressed in the New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy and by the commitment of unprecedented remedial funding by the government. This year's Budget has allocated a record $226.35m for conservation, an increase of $8.27m from last year.

"Culturally too, New Zealand's heritage has a unique history that began with Polynesian settlers here more than a 1000-years ago, and continued with more recent Pakeha migration during the past 250-years. The separate and combined histories of these cultures weave a unique story that will also be explored, celebrated and debated during this year's Conservation Week."
