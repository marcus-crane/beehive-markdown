Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Phil Goff will represent New Zealand at the annual Pacific Islands Forum’s Post-Forum Dialogue Meeting in Nauru from 18 - 21 August.

This meeting is followed every year by a Post-Forum Dialogue with the region’s external partners, including major overseas aid donors.

“These talks are crucial for Forum members and countries with interests in the region to engage on a variety of issues, from environmental concerns and fisheries to development and economic issues.

“Forum members particularly welcome Indonesia’s participation in the dialogue for the first time this year.

“Discussions with Indonesia are likely to focus on issues of common concern to forum members and dialogue partners alike, such as developments in West Papua," Mr Goff said.

The post-forum talks enable the 11 dialogue partners (Canada, China, European Union, France, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, United Kingdom, United States) to engage with forum members on forum matters.

It is also opportunity for forum country representatives to take up particular issues with individual dialogue partners. This year is the 13th Post-Forum Dialogue.

Prime Minister Helen Clark is currently at the annual Pacific Islands Forum Leaders’ Meeting, also in Nauru.

Mr Goff departs for Nauru at midday on Saturday 18th August and returns the afternoon of Wednesday 22nd August.
