Key appointments to the new transition body to form the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) were announced today by Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey.

Dr Andrew West, Chief Executive of the New Zealand Qualifications Authority, has been appointed Chair of the Transition TEC. Associate Professor Kaye Turner, currently Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) at the University of Waikato, has been appointed as Deputy Chair.

Mr Maharey said the appointments, and related announcements also made today, demonstrate that the Labour-Alliance Government is serious about acting on the consensus evident at the Knowledge Wave conference to position the tertiary sector as a leading driver of economic and social transformation.

"The Chair and Deputy Chair of the Transition TEC will play a key leadership role in reshaping the tertiary education sector to meet the new challenges of our growing knowledge society.

"The Transition TEC will act as an ‘establishment board’ for the permanent TEC which will be established next year to improve the relevance and cost effectiveness of the tertiary education system. It will also act as an ‘advisory board’ during the further development of the Tertiary Education Strategy and an enhanced system of charters and profiles for all publicly funded providers and industry training organisations

"Dr West has an extensive knowledge of the tertiary education and research sectors and of the interface between tertiary education and industry. He has advised successive governments on the reform of the public science system leading to the establishment of the CRIs and subsequently headed the very successful Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences.

"The Government was impressed by his demonstrated ability to successfully manage multiple relationships. We are confident he will be able to build respect amongst business, tertiary sector and other stakeholder groups to successfully communicate the vision of the reforms and achieve change.

"Kaye Turner brings extensive New Zealand and international practical academic and management experience in the tertiary sector. Her combined legal and management background equips her well to be closely involved in the development of policy designed to effect sector and institutional change.

"Dr West and Ms Turner take up their positions this month. Once the permanent TEC is established it is intended to appoint Dr West and Ms Turner permanently into these roles," Steve Maharey said.
