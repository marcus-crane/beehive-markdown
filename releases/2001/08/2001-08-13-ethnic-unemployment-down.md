Ethnic Affairs Minister George Hawkins has welcomed the latest reduction in unemployment, which includes a substantial drop in unemployment among Ethnic New Zealanders.

Overall, unemployment for the June 2001 quarter fell to 5.2 percent – a 13-year low.

"The rate of unemployment for Ethnic New Zealanders fell to 8.7 percent in the June 2001 quarter – down from 11.6 percent a year ago," said Mr Hawkins.

"Ethnic New Zealanders are benefiting from important policy initiatives pursued by the Labour Alliance Government.

"The Government has demonstrated its strong support for Ethnic New Zealanders through policies such as improving funding for ESOL, supporting better settlement and refugee resettlement outcomes, and investing in the economic development of regions throughout New Zealand.

"More and more employers are realising that Ethnic New Zealanders are often highly qualified and have valuable experience and expertise to offer.

"My challenge to employers is to keep working with the Government to reduce Ethnic unemployment even further," said Mr Hawkins.
