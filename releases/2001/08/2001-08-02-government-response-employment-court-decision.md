The Attorney-General, Margaret Wilson says the Crown's case was always about competence. Clothes and other issues to which so much attention has been given were not significant.

"The government was always confident that its actions were within the law. The decision makes clear that there was no breach of the employment agreement. The Employment Court has put irrelevant issues to one side and looked at the actual employment relationships which existed.

"The effect of today's decision is to bring closure. For the government, the decision means business as usual and a continuation of progress towards improved social services and policy development."
