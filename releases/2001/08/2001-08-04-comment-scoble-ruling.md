The full-entitlement policy introduced by the Labour-Alliance government ensures that beneficiaries are now informed of the full range of assistance available to them, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey was commenting on the decision of Justice Doogue that a Lower Hutt woman who did not receive accomodation assistance she was entitled to should have had her eligibility explained to her.

"DWI has been given clear instructions by the Government that it is to inform beneficiaries of the full range assistance they are eligible to receive," Mr Maharey said.
