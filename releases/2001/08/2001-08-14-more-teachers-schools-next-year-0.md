The Government will fund 350 more full time teacher equivalents as the next step in implementing recommendations in the school staffing review.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard said schools will receive an increased staffing entitlement in time for the beginning of the first term next year. Most, although not all, schools will receive some increase in entitlement. The extra staff will cost about $27 million each year.

Final details on how the additional staffing will be distributed is will be determined after consultation with the sector

"This is the second step in an ongoing process of staffing improvements across all parts of the school sector. The first step was the 160 new full time teacher equivalents in small rural schools this year. As well, many schools have chosen to use money redistributed as a result of the end of bulk funding to fund extra staff.

"Further staffing increases for 2003 will be considered as part of the usual Budget process next year.

"The shape and timing of staffing improvements in future years, however, are dependent on fiscal conditions. Implementation of further staffing improvements will proceed at a pace that the New Zealand economy can sustain."

Trevor Mallard said the ultimate aim of staffing increases were to improve learning in schools.

"Schools will be free to make their own decisions as to the best use of the added entitlement staffing, taking into account their own particular circumstances," Trevor Mallard said.

Schools will be advised of their provisional staffing entitlements for 2002 in September, as part of the usual process.
