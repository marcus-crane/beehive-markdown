The Honourable Ruth Richardson, Sir Gil Simpson, Cardinal Healthcare staff, ladies and gentlemen … Good morning and thank you for inviting me here today to present Cardinal Healthcare's Trade New Zealand Export Commendation.

This Commendation is a direct result of Cardinal Healthcare's hard work, inventiveness and success in exporting. This company has so much to be proud of - it is a tremendous export success story.

In just five years you have grown foreign exchange earnings from nothing to $7 million last year.

And that is just exports to Australia - just think what will be achieved now that the company is expanding its focus into the United Kingdom, Canada and beyond.

Cardinal Healthcare is successfully winning business internationally from much larger and better-resourced competitors - you have a great product and you know how to market it.

I understand that in Australia Cardinal Healthcare has quickly become a market leader in the very competitive IT healthcare industry.

Not only is Cardinal Healthcare providing jobs for some of our brightest IT minds, it is earning valuable foreign exchange for our country in the process.

Using the Jade technology platform, Cardinal Healthcare is developing and marketing technology solutions that capitalise on a global trend toward the decentralisation of healthcare.  
That decentralisation is bringing with it an increasing need for better-integrated healthcare.

As I am sure you well know, today's health systems are seeing patient care being provided by a variety of organisations and professions. I strongly believe that collaboration and cooperation in the health sector, rather than the competitive doctrines of the 1990s, will provide better standards of health services around the whole country.

Cardinal Healthcare's technology is helping health professionals provide the best possible healthcare by giving them a single, electronic view of a patient.

Cardinal Healthcare's technology is also easy to use - crucial when health professionals are not necessarily IT savvy or when a district nurse, for example, has to access information in the patient's home by using a handheld computer.

Another important element of the software is strict security controls, which assure people their files are electronically secure.

The rapid and growing success of Cardinal Healthcare's international business reflects success in developing products that are functional, offer value for money, and are relevant to the needs of today's health industry.

Cardinal Healthcare's marketing arm has also demonstrated considerable talent, placing an emphasis on building relationships. That includes working in partnership with key clients - the result is a win-win situation all round - one where you can be assured you are developing a product the client wants, and the client gets a product custom-made for their needs.

I also note with interest that the New Zealand origin of your technology is considered an asset by countries such as Canada, which perceives Australasia as being the world leader in community-based and mental healthcare services.

Companies like Cardinal Healthcare prove New Zealand's expertise extends beyond land-based industries into the high-tech, knowledge industries.

The New Zealand software industry generates nearly $400 million of export earnings for the country. It's an industry that benefits from a number of unique Kiwi characteristics.

New Zealanders have a 'can-do' attitude and an innovative approach to problem-solving, borne of our long history of isolation and self-reliance.

New Zealand is currently not widely recognised as a source for quality software products - internationally or by the wider New Zealand public. But this perception is changing as companies like Cardinal Healthcare continue the charge into foreign markets.

Cardinal Healthcare's considerable achievements to date are a credit to the people who work for this dynamic company.

I note that, since you started in 1997, staff numbers have increased from five to 25 developers today, based in Christchurch and Melbourne.

Those developers provide the 'grunt' for your aggressive product development strategy, a strategy that will be vital to ensuring Cardinal Healthcare's technology remains leading edge.

Congratulations once again to everyone involved with Cardinal Healthcare. I'm delighted to be here to celebrate it with you.

I would now like to present the Cardinal Healthcare Trade New Zealand Export Commendation to Sir Gil Simpson, chief executive officer of Aoraki Corporation.
