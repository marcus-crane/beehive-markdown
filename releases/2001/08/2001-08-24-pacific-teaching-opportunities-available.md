August 24 2001Media Statement  
Teaching Opportunities Available

Pacific Island Affairs Minister Mark Gosche today urged Pacific people to consider applying for teaching scholarships in the next few weeks.

The $10,000 TeachNZ scholarships target Pacific and Maori people, encouraging them and rural people into early childhood education, primary or secondary teaching. Applications close on 10 September.

There are 425 scholarships available this year, of which 115 are for Pacific people.

"This is a great opportunity for any Pacific person who has ever thought about teaching as a career. TeachNZ are looking not just for school leavers and university students, but also for mature people or recent graduates wanting a change or looking to return to paid work after raising a family."

In addition new $7-10,000 trainee allowances are available to all graduates or near graduates accepted for training in key subjects, including te reo Maori, maths, physics, computing, and physical education.

Information evenings on the scholarships are to be held around Auckland next week:  
·Monday, August 27, Dining Room MIT Marae, Otara Rd, Manukau  
·Tuesday, August 28, Lions Club (White House) Edmonton Rd Te Atatu, West Auckland  
·Wednesday, August 29, Grey Lynn Primary School, 44 Surrey Cres, Grey Lynn.

More detail about the scholarships is available from 0800 TeachNZ (0800 832 246), or from local training providers. A website, www.teachnz.govt.nz, also offers more information.
