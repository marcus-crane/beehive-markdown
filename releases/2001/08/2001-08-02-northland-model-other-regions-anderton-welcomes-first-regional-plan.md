"I am pleased to launch the Northland Regional Plan, the first plan developed from the Industry New Zealand Regional Partnerships Programme initiated as part of the Government's jobs machine," said Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton in Northland today.

"The way that Northland mayors, iwi and the people of Northland have approached this plan is a model for all the regions of New Zealand in how to co-operate and develop region-wide thinking.

"This is particularly significant as Northland has born the brunt of regional decline more acutely than many other regions.

"I congratulate all of you who have been involved in the development of this strategy which will guide Northland for ten years.

"The missing partner in regional development for over 25 years has been the government and I am again committing central Government to working with you as partners in Northland. Now that you have a strategic economic development plan, and we have worked with you to develop it, we will continue to be there," said Jim Anderton.

Northland is the first region to be eligible to qualify for funding under stage three of the Regional Partnership Programme which was launched on 4 July 2000.

Fourteen regions have secured grants in the previous three rounds amounting to $1,300,000. To date $2,220,500 has been committed to 19 regional partnerships.
