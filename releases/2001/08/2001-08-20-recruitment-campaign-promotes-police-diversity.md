The Police Minister, George Hawkins, says a new campaign of television, radio and print advertisements unveiled today reflects a new approach to police recruitment.

The campaign, which Mr Hawkins formally launched this morning, is designed to attract more Maori, Pacific Island, Asian and female police recruits.

"I am absolutely committed to ensuring that the New Zealand Police are just as diverse as the community they serve."

"The advertisements feature the stories of real police men and women from different ethnic groups – the key message of the campaign is that policing is a career for New Zealanders from all walks of life," said Mr Hawkins.

Mr Hawkins also reminded leaders of Maori, Pacific Island and Asian communities that they have a role to play, by encouraging members of their communities to pursue policing as a career.

"The support and encouragement of community leaders is vital if we are to achieve true diversity in the Police."

"I wish the Police every success with the new campaign, and look forward to seeing the results of it in future Police College intakes," said Mr Hawkins.
