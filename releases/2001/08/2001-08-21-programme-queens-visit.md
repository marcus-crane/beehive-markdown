Prime Minister Helen Clark today released the official programme for the Queen's visit in October.

The Queen, who will be accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, will arrive in Auckland from Adelaide on Friday 12 October and spend the weekend of 13-14 October at Taupo.

The official visit begins with a welcome ceremony at Parliament Buildings in Wellington on 15 October and runs until Friday 19 October, concluding with a garden party in Auckland. There are also engagements in Christchurch and Dunedin.

"The programme will provide an appropriate opportunity for New Zealanders to mark the impending golden jubilee of the Queen's reign," Helen Clark said.
