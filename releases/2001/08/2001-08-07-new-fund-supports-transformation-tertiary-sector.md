A new $35m fund is being established to assist public tertiary providers to adapt to the changing tertiary environment, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey announced today.

The Tertiary Education Strategic Change Fund will support initiatives taken by tertiary institutions, individually or collectively, to adapt during the establishment of the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) and ahead of the implementation of the new funding and regulatory system. It will operate during the 2002 calendar year and totals $34.7m (comprising $18.1m in operating expenditure and $16.6m for capital expenditure).

Mr Maharey said the fund would enable tertiary institutions to determine how they intend to operate within the new strategically-focused tertiary education sector and to define the unique contribution they wish to make within that environment.

"Tertiary education and research are powerful tools which we must harness effectively if we are to achieve economic and social transformation in New Zealand.

"New Zealand's tertiary education sector has been through a difficult decade of declining public investment and a single-minded focus on student enrolments. The time has long since come to get some strategy back into the system.

"The Tertiary Education Strategic Change Fund demonstrates that the Government is prepared to back this objective with significant additional investment.

"Public tertiary institutions will be eligible for funding from 1 July 2002, the intended date of the formal establishment of the TEC. In order to access funding institutions will need to demonstrate how they are preparing to operate in the new environment," Steve Maharey said.
