The government is still considering all options for youth radio, Broadcasting Minister, Marian Hobbs, said today.

Commercial radio stations have mounted an advertising campaign opposing a state-funded youth radio network.

"No decisions have been taken," Marian Hobbs said. "We are aware there are strong views on the various options being considered for meeting the radio needs of young people. This was obvious at the Youth Radio Forum we ran last year.

"I am going to bring interested parties together again to try to find a way forward.

"The government is committed to enhancing radio services for young people and to encouraging a range of radio choices for them, particularly for those in rural areas who do not have the choices of their urban counterparts."
