The Minister of Tourism Mark Burton said today that the latest research commissioned by the Tourism Research Council of New Zealand (TRCNZ) has confirmed the growing contribution of the Tourism sector to the New Zealand economy.

Tourism in New Zealand is now officially measured as a $13.2 billion dollar industry.

Key findings of the Tourism Satellite Account have been released by Statistics New Zealand, covering the years ended March 1998, 1999 and 2000. Statistics New Zealand undertook this work on behalf of TRCNZ, which was established by the government last year.

"The Accounts highlight the remarkable growth in the tourism sector," Mark Burton said. "Between 1997 and 2000, annual tourism expenditure increased by $1.7 billion to $13.2 billion. Tourism directly and indirectly now makes up 9.7% of New Zealand’s GDP.

“The growth in tourism has created thousands of jobs. There are over 94,000 full-time equivalent jobs directly related to tourist activity, and based on the ratios established in TSA97, it is estimated that an additional 69,000 people are indirectly employed providing goods and services.

"That’s 163,000 jobs, or one in every ten jobs in New Zealand.”

"The latest results demonstrate the wide impact of tourism throughout the New Zealand economy," Mark Burton said. "Tourism expenditure is spread across many sectors including:  
\* Air passenger transport - $3006 million pa  
\* Other transport - $1460 million pa  
\* Retail sales - $2828 million pa  
\* Food and beverages - $1498 million pa  
\* Accommodation - $1114 million pa

“This research will help the tourism industry, central and local government and related sectors make informed decisions about tourism development over the next decade," Mark Burton said.

"The Government is committed to ongoing support for core tourism research, such as the Tourism Satellite Account, through the TRCNZ.”

“The TSA results are just outstanding. Tourism is clearly a key driver of the New Zealand economy and these figures emphasise the importance of having a long-term Tourism Strategy to guide in the sustainable development of this increasingly vital sector of the economy," Mark Burton said.

At next week's Tourism Conference in Rotorua, Mark Burton will give a 'progress report' on the work being done to address the key recommendations of the Tourism Strategy.
