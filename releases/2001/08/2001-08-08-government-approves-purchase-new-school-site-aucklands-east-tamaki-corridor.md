Education Minister Trevor Mallard and Finance Minister Michael Cullen have approved the purchase of a four-hectare site for a new school in the growing Auckland suburb of East Tamaki.

Trevor Mallard said the Ministry of Education had been negotiating for a site in the East Tamaki corridor to cater for anticipated residential growth in the area.

"East Tamaki is one of the fastest growing suburbs in the country. What used to be farms and lifestyle blocks are now filling up fast with suburban housing and families. The purchase of this site ensures that in the future we can build a new school to meet the needs of students in the area."

Trevor Mallard said the proposed opening date for the new school is 2004, but this may be revised if the rate of growth in the area changes.

A new primary school, Willowbank, opened in the area at the beginning of the year, with a new secondary school also planned to open in 2004. In addition, the Ministry is looking for another three sites in the East Tamaki corridor to cater for further growth in the primary school-age population.

"Last year a report was released which assessed school capacity in the Auckland region over the next 50 years. It showed that the Government is well placed to meet increasing demand for schooling provision across Auckland. The meeting of milestones such as the opening of Willowbank School, planning for new secondary schools and the purchase of this site, are evidence of a rigorous forward planning strategy to meet future demands on the Auckland schooling system."

Trevor Mallard said sufficient land had been purchased to allow for an early childhood education centre on the Baverstock Road site.

"We want to make provision for early childhood on all new school sites as part of our initiatives to increase participation in early childhood education," Trevor Mallard said.
