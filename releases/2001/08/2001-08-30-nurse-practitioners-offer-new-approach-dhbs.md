Health Minister Annette King has challenged District Health Boards and providers to take advantage of the opportunity offered by the advent of nurse practitioners.

Nurse practitioners are ideally placed to deliver many programmes and services required to achieve the objectives of the Primary Health Care Strategy, Mrs King told delegates at the start today of a two-day nurse practitioners workshop in Wellington.

"Employing nurse practitioners will provide highly skilled team members who can work collaboratively or independently in either a hospital or community setting. They will also demonstrate two of the key concepts of the new public health system - innovation and collaboration - within or across all levels of the health sector."

Mrs King said nurse practitioners would be registered nurses, with substantial clinical experience, who had undertaken postgraduate training and had been individually assessed and approved by the Nursing Council.

"The nurse practitioner role offers an approach that builds on existing personal health services, but also provides a preventative educational role. They advocate health promotion and disease prevention, can look beyond treating the ailment and consider non-medical intervention, and encourage self-care. They are also able to diagnose health problems and, in designated scopes of practice, to prescribe medication.

"That is not to say nurse practitioners will replace medical practitioners. International research shows that nurse practitioners and medical practitioners need each other. Patients will benefit from their complementary skills. Research clearly supports the provision of nurse practitioner services across all areas. It has been argued internationally that employing Nurse Practitioners fully could save 20 per cent of the primary health care budget."

Mrs King said the advent of the role would also mean that New Zealand's highest level nurses would no longer have to leave nursing and go into management to advance their careers. The nurse practitioner role offers, for the first time, a clear clinical career pathway for nurses in clinical practice, and should encourage more highly skilled nurses to stay and work in New Zealand.

"I expect the health sector to embrace the advent of the nurse practitioner. My challenge to you all is to make it happen."
