The Government is to review the Training Opportunities and Youth Training programmes Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey announced today.

"Together Training Opportunities and Youth Training presently account for over $188 million of government expenditure. It is important that we ensure a quality spend, and quality outcomes.

"The objective is to undertake a 'first principles' review to establish future objectives for these programmes, and ensure that they meet the educational and employment needs of those people with significant histories of unemployment and/or no or low qualifications.

"The purpose of the review is to establish the appropriate future objectives for these programmes, and how we can improve their contribution in meeting the educational and employment needs of people with significant histories of unemployment and/or no or low qualifications. In the eight years since the Training Opportunities programme was established there have been many developments both within the community and government that have affected the way in which services are provided to such people.

"The Government considers it timely to consider the effect of these changes on these programmes. It is important to ensure, given our current understanding, that these programmes are best meeting the needs of this group.

"I have appointed a team to lead the review, comprising both experts from the education, and the training for employment sector, and representatives of key Government agencies. The terms of reference for the review, which I am also releasing today, were drawn up following consultations with stakeholders. I am confident that this review, led by a group of people bringing such expertise and knowledge about the issues facing the target groups for Youth Training and Youth training, will produce positive recommendations for the Government to consider," Steve Maharey said.
