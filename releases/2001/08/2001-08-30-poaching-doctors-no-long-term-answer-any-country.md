Health Minister Annette King says she will write to her UK counterpart Alan Milburn, reminding him that no Commonwealth country will benefit in the long term from poaching each other's medical professionals.

"I discussed this issue with UK Permanent Secretary for Health Nigel Crisp in London in May, and I am disappointed now to learn of a global British campaign to recruit 10,000 doctors," Mrs King said today.

"Britain knows New Zealand does not have a surplus of doctors, and it also knows many other Commonwealth countries are far worse placed than either of our two countries.

"Yet just last night Claire Ward, the UK Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of State for Health, assured me British Prime Minister Tony Blair had ruled out recruitment campaigns in countries that had shortages.

"This is a problem that needs international cooperation. One country trying to exploit the resource of another to fix its own short-term problem will impact negatively on the health sectors of both countries. We all need to make ourselves rewarding places for doctors and nurses to work."

Mrs King said her discussions in London followed an earlier debate in Geneva among Commonwealth Health Ministers attending the World Health Assembly.

"They all agreed with me that the issue of recruitment should be put on the agenda for the Commonwealth Health Ministers conference in Christchurch in November. That meeting will discuss draft protocols aimed at preventing poaching and at providing a managed way for all our health professionals to gain overseas experience if they want it.

"It is pointless for Commonwealth countries to poach from each other. We have to look, as New Zealand is doing, at sustainable ways of building our workforce."

Mrs King said a stocktake on New Zealand's workforce would be published by the Health Workforce Advisory Committee in December.
