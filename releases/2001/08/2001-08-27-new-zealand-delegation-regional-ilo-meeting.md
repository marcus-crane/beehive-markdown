Labour Minister Margaret Wilson is leading the New Zealand delegation to the Asian regional meeting of the International Labour Organisation this week.

The ILO is a tripartite body bringing employers, unions and government representatives together to agree on employment standards and human rights issues related to work. New Zealand has been a member of the ILO since its establishment in 1919 and is currently a member of the ILO governing body.

Other New Zealand representatives to the meeting in Bangkok are Anne Knowles of Business New Zealand; Ross Wilson, of the CTU; John Chetwin and Lisa Goodman of the Department of Labour; and Alan Williams of the New Zealand Embassy, Thailand.

"New Zealand is hoping to see this week's meeting set a direction for the next four years for the practical work of the ILO - providing technical assistance to countries in the region and promoting fundamental rights at work," said Margaret Wilson.
