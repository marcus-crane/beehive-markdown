Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton today announced the seventh round of Industry New Zealand Enterprise Awards taking the number of awards made to over 200.

The seventh round of Industry New Zealand Enterprise Awards has 29 recipients taking the number of grants awarded to 203 since September 2000 when the awards started.

"It is significant in that in less than a year we have been able to award 200 grants for small enterprises," said Jim Anderton.

"The Labour Alliance Coalition Government is determined to work to build new business and capitalise on business ideas, the Enterprise Award Scheme is available where advice alone is not enough.

"The number of internet and technology companies capitalising on knowledge industries shows that the knowledge wave is alive and well among entrepreneurs and New Zealand small businesses," said Jim Anderton.

Awards for ideas in this round which are using knowledge or seeking intellectual property protection include: a digitally interactive music machine, a prototype for a new tig welding machine; an e-commerce strategy for a tourism website, intellectual property protection for new software, and certification for a new sawmill.

Other awards in this latest round were for business ideas including marketing for a pesto making company, a fridge shelf runner, development of an ice slurry machine and a stability device for small boats.

Entrepreneurs or small business owners can receive a maximum of $20,000 from an Industry New Zealand Enterprise Award, which can be used to fund up to 50 percent of the cost of a project.

Small businesses and entrepreneurs interested in Enterprise Awards and other services and support from Industry New Zealand can look at the website www.industrynz.govt.nz.
