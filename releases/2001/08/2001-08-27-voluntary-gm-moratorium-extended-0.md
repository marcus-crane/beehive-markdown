The voluntary moratorium on applications for release and field testing of genetically modified organisms will be extended to October 31, Environment Minister, Marian Hobbs and Science Minister, Pete Hodgson, announced today.

The moratorium was to end this Friday but the New Zealand Life Sciences Network representing the biotechnology industry and research groups has offered to continue it until midnight on October 31.

"The moratorium was set to end three months after the Royal Commission reported, thus giving the government time to consider the commission's findings. But the Royal Commission was given an extension of time and reported almost two months later than planned.

"The government has already announced it would give a considered response to the Royal Commission's report by the 31st of October. Continuing the moratorium preserves the status quo and enables the government to make decisions without options being reduced.

"The government is grateful for the responsible position taken by Life Sciences Network," the Ministers said.
