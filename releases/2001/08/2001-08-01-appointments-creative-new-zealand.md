Other appointments to the Arts Board are Alastair Carruthers, Chief Executive of Chapman Tripp in Wellington, Graeme Gorton, who retired as General Manager of the Theatre Royal, Christchurch, in February, and Judith Fyfe, a solicitor and past lecturer in oral history at Victoria University.

Current members of the Creative New Zealand Council, Dr Marilyn Waring and Ngahuia Te Awekotuku have been re-appointed, each for a term from 1 July this year until 31 October 2003.

"I am delighted that these people have all agreed to serve on Creative New Zealand boards. They bring an impressive range of skills and experience to their positions. I am confident that Creative New Zealand will be well served by its new, and re-appointed members, " Helen Clark said.

Creative New Zealand encourages, promotes and supports the arts in New Zealand. It has an Arts Council and two boards, the Arts Board and Te Waka Toi each with seven members.
