A wealth of data has been released recently, all of it pointing to strong economy in which growth is becoming increasingly broad-based.

The latest ANZ job series has job ads at an all-time high, prompting the ANZ chief economist to project further strong gains in employment over the coming months and a drop in unemployment to below 5 per cent.

Unemployment is already at a 13 year low. Full-time employment is already 3.4 per cent up on the same time last year. And the labour force participation rate - at almost 66 per cent - is at its highest in five years.

The trade balance is now showing a stable surplus with exports in June up 22.6 per cent on the previous year.

And demand is picking up in the domestic sector as rising wages increase household budgets.

Building consents, seasonally adjusted, were up 9 percent in the June quarter. Retail sales rose 2.3 per cent in the quarter, and 6.9 per cent in the June year.
