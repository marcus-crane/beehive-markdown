"The amendments to the Electoral Integrity Bill recommended by New Zealand First will be considered by the cabinet and both government caucuses," the Leader of the House Michael Cullen said today.

"We will report back our decision to New Zealand First once these deliberations have occurred."

As the House was in recess next week, neither the cabinet nor the caucuses would be meeting. Their first opportunity to consider the issue would be the following week, Dr Cullen said.

New Zealand First is proposing that Clause 55D be altered to replace the words *will or may undermine public confidence in the integrity of the electoral system or parliamentary process with has, and is likely to continue to distort the proportionality of Parliament as determined at the last general election.*

The party is also asking whether the 2005 sunset clause should remain.
