Harnessing the power of the internet and other computer-based learning modes is the aim of a $1 million New Technology Project now underway, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey was meeting today with the newly-appointed E-Learning Advisory Group and took the opportunity to update them on the New Technology Project which was allocated funding in the June budget. Up to $1 million has been provided for cost-shared basis for projects that increase employees' access to industry training through the use of new technologies, such as computer- or web-based training.

Mr Maharey said the funding demonstrates the Government's inclusive vision for skills development.

"Building a knowledge society means lifting skills of all New Zealanders. The New Technology Project demonstrates our commitment to build those skills on factory floors across the country as well as in university and polytechnic lecture theatres.

"The New Technology Project aims to strengthen the capacity of industry to capitalise on technology-enabled learning to develop and maintain a skilled workforce.

"The key objectives of the New Technology Project are to:  
\* expand employees' access to industry training;  
\* promote generically applicable learning solutions for employees who otherwise have limited access to industry training;  
\* promote the development and implementation of new technology within and across industry; and,  
\* stimulate cross-industry expertise on innovative technology practices.

"Skill New Zealand is currently seeking expressions of interest from Industry Training Organisations to access the funding from the Project. Applications close on 17 September 2001", Steve Maharey said.
