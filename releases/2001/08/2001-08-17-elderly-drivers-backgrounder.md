Elderly Drivers - Backgrounder

Current Situation

The previous government provided a subsidy to help those drivers getting their general licence, but refused to give any assistance to the elderly, who are often on low incomes and whose licence is frequently the key to their mobility.

Those over 75 currently pay $37.50 to renew for five years, and those aged over 80 pay $36 to renew for two years. In addition those over 80 pay $41 to sit the older driver practical test, and all those over 75 require a medical certificate when they renew, which costs approximately $40.

As a result drivers aged 75 or over are charged more for a licence that lasts two years than the rest of the population are paying for a 10 year licence.

What will change?

· The price of a licence for older drivers is likely to fall from $37.50 (drivers aged 75-79) or $36 (aged 80 or more) to about $18.30.

· Older drivers will be offered one free re-test if they fail their first driving test.

· The price of an older driver test will be kept to the current price of $41 rather than rising to match the actual costs involved, which would have taken it to about $49.

Why the changes?

These initiatives  
· aim to ensure that older drivers retain their driver's licence as long as practicable, to maintain their independence, mobility and ability to participate in the community.  
· recognise that older drivers are often less able to absorb price increases compared to the general population.  
· acknowledge that older drivers are more frequently in contact with the driver licensing system, compared to any other category of drivers, because they have to renew every few years.

What more is to come?

The government plans to improve older drivers' ability to apply for a "conditional licence". Currently a conditional licence can be applied for after a driver fails the older driver test. However no conditional licences have been issued. The government proposal will allow older drivers the choice of either sitting a full older driver test and gaining a licence without restrictions, or undertaking a more straight forward conditional licence test and having a licence with restrictions. These restrictions may include limiting drivers to low-speed zones and driving during the day.

Some improvements are also being implemented to make the older driver licensing regime more user-friendly. These include more support before and after the practical driving test for older drivers and more education programmes.

As well, the auditing of driver testing officers has been improved. This will answer older drivers' concerns that testing officers were being too harsh on older drivers and failing too many in the older driver test.
