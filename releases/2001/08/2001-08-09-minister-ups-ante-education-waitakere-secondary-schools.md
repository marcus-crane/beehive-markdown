Education Minister Trevor Mallard visited Kelston Boys High School today to announce a major new initiative to enhance the education provided by secondary schools in Waitakere City.

Eight secondary schools -Henderson High School, Kelston Boys High School, Kelston Girls High School, Liston College, Massey High School, Rutherford College, St Dominic's College, and Waitakere College - have signed a Heads of Agreement in partnership with the Ministry of Education to work together on the Waitakere Secondary Schools Academic Enhancement Initiative.

"There is only one route to success in schools: raising the level of achievement of the students," Trevor Mallard said.

"This takes single-minded determination and strong leadership. The Waitakere Secondary Schools are showing this determination and leadership.

"In the first 18 months, support will be available for developing the initiative and for finalising and implementing specific school action plans. The focus will be on improving education achievement.

"The intention is to make Waitakere City secondary schools the schools of choice for Waitakere students.

Trevor Mallard said he was pleased that the impetus for the initiative had come from the schools. He congratulated them for taking up the challenge to help themselves and to work together in partnership with the Ministry of Education.
