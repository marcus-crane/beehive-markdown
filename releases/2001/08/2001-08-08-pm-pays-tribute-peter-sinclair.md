Prime Minister Helen Clark today paid tribute to Peter Sinclair, saying he made a tremendous contribution to New Zealand broadcasting.

"Peter was the consummate professional, able to switch effortlessly between radio and television, between commercial and public service broadcasting.

"His music shows in the 1960s and 1970s helped to showcase the huge talent of the emerging New Zealand pop music industry. Later he starred in programmes like Mastermind and University Challenge.

"His hallmark was his grace, style, and unflappable manner. This showed through not only in his broadcasting, but also in the columns he wrote chronicling his illness over the past few months.

"Peter will be sorely missed."

Peter Sinclair was made an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to broadcasting in the Queen's birthday honours in June.
