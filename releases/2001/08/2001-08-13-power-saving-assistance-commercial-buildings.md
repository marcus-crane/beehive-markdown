Energy Minister Pete Hodgson today announced a new scheme to help large commercial buildings save electricity.

Starting today, the Government will fund site surveys of large commercial facilities with floor areas over 10,000m2 or electricity consumption of more than two GWh a year. Major industrial and manufacturing sites are exempt from the scheme, as electricity retailers are discussing power savings with them directly.

The site surveys will identify immediate electricity savings opportunities available to building owners, facilities managers and tenants of larger commercial, retail, accommodation, tertiary education and public service buildings.

"There are around 300 - 500 really large buildings in New Zealand and they account for nearly 30% of the total electricity used in the commercial sector," Mr Hodgson said.

"The Government believes it is worth targeting this sector to achieve considerable electricity savings. This is another way for us to take a leadership role in helping New Zealand save electricity for the next 10 weeks."

The scheme is being managed by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA).

Property owners and managers who believe they could benefit from a survey are being asked to select an energy surveyor and register their survey applications with EECA.

"Several electricity retailers have agreed to support the scheme, including by assisting customers to implement the recommendations," Mr Hodgson said.
