Jobs machine succeeding

It's working.

That's the verdict of Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton on the Government's Jobs Machine after visiting a highly successful Auckland manufacturer today.

And he is challenging New Zealanders to welcome success and innovation.

De'Amalfi Survival Ltd received a $9,675 grant in the first round of Industry New Zealand Enterprise Awards a year ago. It received a further $20,000 award in July.

The grants have helped the company to develop export markets for its high-tech safety helmet. With assistance of the grant De'Amalfi has won export orders in Holland, the US, Germany, Spain, Australia and Russia. The company expects to get orders of up to $60 million from the US market alone.

Without the assistance of Industry New Zealand, the helmet would almost certainly have gone to investors in Australia or Korea.

"The success of De'Amalfi, with the assistance of Industry New Zealand, shows that the Government's partnership approach to developing job-rich, high-value, high-skill new export industries is working," Jim Anderton said.

"New Zealanders are almost embarrassed about celebrating success. At a time when there are numerous challenges for our economy, I am challenging New Zealanders to see that we are meeting those challenges."
