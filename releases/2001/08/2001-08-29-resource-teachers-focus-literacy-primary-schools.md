More than one hundred teachers are already playing a key role in the Government's effort to help schools to identify and improve the reading and writing standards of children who might otherwise be left behind, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

Trevor Mallard said the Ministry of Education was holding regional seminars focusing on professional development for the resource teachers who specialise in literacy. The teachers are now working with clusters of primary schools throughout the country.

Their jobs were established this year in response to the call from the Literacy Taskforce for a nationally co-ordinated system of literacy interventions.

"Every child should be able to read and write," Trevor Mallard said.

"These resource teachers are there to help see that this happens."

"Now that the team of specialist itinerant teachers had been established, the Government's job is to see that they are given professional support through a series of seven regional seminars. These are focusing on professional development and on strategies that could be used to develop their relationships as mentors within schools.

"Next year, a two-year training course will be available to enable the resource teachers to increase their qualifications. Work is also continuing on establishing a permanent group of literacy resource teachers who will focus on Maori," Trevor Mallard said.
