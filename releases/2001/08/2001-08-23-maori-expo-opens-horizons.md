Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said Auckland's Maori Expo "Kia Tu, Kia Maia" is a chance for Maori to seize the day and new opportunities.

The Expo is expected to attract more than 50 thousand people through the Aotea centre site today. Mr Horomia said he is delighted to see the range of options now available for Maori, both young and old.

"Maoridom knows it needs to upskill its people. Events like the Expo present the vast array of options available and opens the eyes of many to the opportunities that are out there. That's not to say it will be easy or inexpensive, but being aware of the opportunities is the first step to a new future."

The Minister of Maori Affairs Mr Horomia said as resources return to iwi, it is important for Maori to participate at all levels in all areas so they can manage and control their own resources.

"Maori have always had significant assets in agriculture and forestry. We now own a large proportion of the fisheries industry and are breaking into new areas such as tourism. We are also increasingly running our own health, education and social services. I hope visitors to Maori Expo use the information they collect to become computer experts, doctors, accountants, doctors, lawyers, doctors, artists, communicators and all other occupations promoted throughout the day."

Mr Horomia, who is also the associate Minister of Education, was pleased to see the high levels of interest in the information campaign "Te Mana – Ki te Taumata". He said the showcase items including singer Hinewehi Mohi and the Maori Popstars group Aaria was evidence of the exciting skill and talent around. Finally he congratulated the vision of Auckland University of Technology who has run the biennial event since 1975

General Information Re: MAORI EXPO 2001

Event  
Maori Exposition 2001 - Kia Tu Kia Maia  
Thursday 23 August 2001 – 9.00am to 3:00pm  
The Aotea Centre & Square, Queen Street, Auckland City  
Admission: FREE

Vision  
A nation, which actively cultivates, supports and celebrates individual and collective Mäori success.

Mission  
To raise the public profile of Mäori success in a broad cross-section of enterprises and endeavours with two outcomes in mind:

\* To encourage even more Mäori to ‘seize’ the opportunities on offer through quality education, and

\* To improve the awareness and encourage the pride of wider multi-ethnic New Zealand in the modern achievements of Mäori.

Background  
The Mäori Expo is an initiative of the Auckland University of Technology (AUT) and is co-hosted by The Edge. It is a biennial event with the first being staged in 1995 ‘He Taonga Te Reo.’

The Exposition is essentially AUT’s acknowledgement of Mäori achievement at the most modest level to the highest strata in the widest range possible. The various showcases, which include music, fashion, drama, education, business, cultural sport, sculpture, carving, art/craft, politics, information technology etc acknowledges Mäori advancement in a growth mode that appears unstoppable.

It is indeed the hope of the university, that through (demonstrating) presenting an opportunity of this nature – that enable budding Mäori achievers to display their future potential; that their efforts to date are celebrated with pride – may in someway assist in realising a greater dream for their people.

Scope  
‘Kia Tü Kia Maia’ distinguishes Mäori who have taken up the challenge and achieved excellence. This message is embodied in six ‘showcases’ on view for a one-day period, as follows:

The Stage- profiling the vast talent and potential of cultural and contemporary artistes of Te Ao Mäori; experienced and youthful

Strands of the Community - profiling individuals and organisations serving the community

New Horizons - profiling Mäori at the leading edge of information and communication technology, animation and film.

New Perspectives - presenting political, professional and celebrity opinion (panel discussion)

New Expressions - profiling artists, designers and sculptors.

New Directions - profiling the diverse opportunities available through tertiary education.

In addition, we are privileged to present:

E Tu - carving and sculpture exhibition  
Wero - contemporary art exhibition - mau taiaha  
Sanctuary - Roma Potiki puppets

Target Group  
We expect to attract an audience of 55,000 people, predominantly Mäori from greater Auckland to the far regions of Northland. While there is a significant focus on tertiary opportunities the event attracts those from kohanga reo (pre-school) right through to kaumatua/kuia (elders).

This is not an exclusive event and is open to all people who acknowledge ‘partnership’ and desire a successful Aotearoa for all the nation’s people.
