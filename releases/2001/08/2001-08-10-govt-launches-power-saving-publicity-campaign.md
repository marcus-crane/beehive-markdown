New Zealanders are being urged to call 0508 SAVE IT to get help cutting their household electricity use by 10% over coming weeks.

The free call line is part of the Government's national electricity saving publicity campaign beginning on Sunday (August 12).

Energy Minister Pete Hodgson says the key message is "if you're not using it, switch it off."

"We need to make the 10% savings target to avoid an electricity crisis, so we are urging all New Zealanders to switch it off or turn it down as long as that doesn't endanger their health or safety."

Mr Hodgson said he was very pleased with the public response so far to his call for power savings. National savings of 11.9 percent yesterday brought the average savings over the past 7 days up to the 10 percent target.

"If New Zealanders keep saving power at this rate our chances of avoiding blackouts later are good, even if the latest forecasts for low rainfall in the South Island hydro catchments hold true."

The publicity campaign will use five television commercials, screening first on Sunday and running over the next month to six weeks. Fronted by television DIY man Dave Cull, the commercials give householders practical tips about how to save electricity around the house.

Viewers can call 0508 SAVE IT for a free household energy efficiency video that has more detailed information on how to conserve power and cut the household power bill.

Billboards will be used in two locations each in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, and advertising will appear in both community and metropolitan newspapers. Radio stations have been sent electricity saving tips to broadcast on their community noticeboards.

The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) is running the campaign. EECA has also posted a web page on the 10% electricity saving challenge (www.eeca.govt.nz).
