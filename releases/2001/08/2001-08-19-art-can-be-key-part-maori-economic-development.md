Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said Maori arts and culture could play a key part in the economic development of Maoridom.

Speaking at the presentation of the Waka Toi Awards in Auckland on Saturday night (18 August), Mr Horomia said it is an exciting time for Maoridom, with a rapidly increasing demand for Maori art in nationally and internationally.

"The unique profile of Maori art is becoming an intrinsic part of New Zealand's identity, and that can be used to retain and promote Maori heritage and also to sustain economic growth."

"But Maori designs and imagery have often been used and abused by others, for commercial purposes and without benefit to Maori. Finding the right balance of using traditional knowledge as the basis for contemporary work is another challenge ahead."

Mr Horomia said there for some time now been a growing call for Maori to develop and manage and own their art enterprises.

"It is important that Maori become increasingly involved at all levels of this exciting industry, just as we must in all industries. I believe a growing knowledge and appreciation of Maori images and design will ultimately help create a better understanding within our society."

The Minister of Maori Affairs paid tribute to the winners of the annual Waka Toi awards.
