Associate Minister of Education Parekura Horomia said the report reviewing the relationship between the Crown and Te Kohanga Reo National Trust shows good faith on both sides.  
Speaking to the report in the House today, Mr Horomia said the Government is seriously committed to improving the way it works with the National Trust for the benefit of the children in kohanga reo.  
"Representatives of both the National Trust and the Crown have worked hard to produce a consensus report on some longstanding and tough issues. They entered the discussions in good faith."  
Issues raised in the report include the Trust's Property Putea policy and the future relationship between the Government, the Trust and Maoridom.  
Mr Horomia said he supports the thrust for a more cooperative working relationship between the Ministry of Education, Te Puni Kokiri and the National Trust, in line with the whole of government approach.  
"It’s now up to Government to provide a response to the report’s recommendations in equally good faith. I will be asking the Ministry of Education and Te Puni Kokiri to plan a way forward.”  
The associate Minister of Education said kohanga reo have played a significant role in the New Zealand education system over the last 20 years.  
"The short term aim is to better meet the needs of tamariki (children). A longer-term aim is to better the needs of kohanga reo, which are often wider than education. In the end, this is an important initiative to accelerate Maori development."
