Ministers today confirmed that the best offer available to Corrections Association of New Zealand (CANZ) is already on the table. This offer has already been accepted by the PSA and other staff.

Trevor Mallard, Minister of State Services, and Matt Robson, the Minister of Corrections said it was essential that staff seriously considered the offer at the forthcoming stopwork meetings.

“Some CANZ members have apparently been under the misapprehension that industrial action will force the Government to provide funding. This is impossible.

“We have assessed the offer the Department has made to staff. It represents a 3.1% increase over two years. In the context of other settlements and in a situation where there are no recruitment and retention issues, we believe the offer is fair and appropriate.

“CANZ is asking for a 7.7% increase over one year, but there is simply no more funding to meet an increased pay demand," says Trevor Mallard.
