Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark today announced the appointment of Peter Hubscher and Jo-Anne La Grouw to the Board of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra.

Helen Clark also announced that Peter Walls and Joe Pope had been reappointed to the Board.

"New board members Peter Hubscher and Jo-Anne La Grouw will bring a fresh and innovative outlook to New Zealand's premier orchestra and I congratulate them on their appointments.

"I thank Peter Walls for his continued valuable contribution to the NZSO and I am very pleased that he has agreed to serve for a further three-year term.

"Joe Pope, whose marketing expertise has also served the orchestra well, will serve a further one-year term.

"After serving on the NZSO board since 1996 Elmar Toime is retiring. With his financial expertise and business acumen, Elmar's contribution was an outstanding one and I thank him for his dedicated service to the orchestra," Helen Clark said.

Peter Hubscher, of Auckland, is the Chief Executive of Montana Wines.

Jo-Anne La Grouw, of Rotorua, is a key sponsor of the Lockwood Aria competition in New Zealand, and is an experienced business person and fund raiser.
