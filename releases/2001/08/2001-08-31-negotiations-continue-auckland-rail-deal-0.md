31 August 2001Media Statement

“Negotiations for the government to buy Tranz Rail's Auckland rail corridors and infrastructure assets are continuing,” Finance Minister Michael Cullen, Transport Minister Mark Gosche and Tranz Rail managing director Michael Beard announced today.

Good progress had been made but there were important issues still to be worked through by both parties. This meant the 31 August deadline contained in the Memorandum of Understanding between the government and Auckland would not be reached.

"It is more important to get the deal right than to make the deadline," they said.

“Although the timetable will run over, the government remains fully committed to ensuring that Auckland gets the rail corridors access it needs to create a rapid passenger transit system," the ministers said.

“We are also discussing with Tranz Rail arrangements to ensure train services will continue after the existing contract expires on 30 June, 2003. These discussions will continue."
