Assessing new entrants is now playing a major role in ensuring that young New Zealanders get a flying start when they first go to school, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.  
School entry assessment - covering numeracy, oral language and emergent literacy -- has been used in primary schools since 1997.  
Trevor Mallard today released a report which captures the ideas and experiences of both teachers and principals since entry assessment was introduced. It analyses the experience gathered from over 30,000 assessments.  
"Assessing children a few weeks after they are first enrolled is now helping primary schools to customise their programmes and organise their classes so they closely suit the needs and ability of their new entrants.  
"This new analysis will help teachers even further to accurately identify the skills and understandings that their new entrant children already have, about the experiences they have had, and about the ways that they prefer to work.  
"It shows how teachers can then evaluate and adjust the support that is provided for their new entrants, and that this in turn will help them to build on the children's strengths."  
Today's report showed, for example, that:  
· Girls, on average, score consistently higher than boys on each of the assessment areas  
· While Pacific and to a lesser extent Maori new entrants do not, on average, perform as well as their Pakeha and Asian counterparts, children from all ethnic backgrounds do get high scores.  
· While students starting school in low socio-economic areas do not, on average, perform as well as those in higher socio-economic areas, new entrants from schools in all deciles do get high scores.  
"This gives us a really good national picture of the range of skills and competencies of children entering school, " said Trevor Mallard.

"Everyone who has participated in this work, both inside and outside the classroom, can be satisfied that they have made a positive contribution towards the formulative education of young New Zealanders.  
"This national picture at the beginning of school also complements the information we get on students later on, through the likes of the National Education Monitoring Project and the international comparative studies," Trevor Mallard said.  
The report is being sent to all primary schools this week.
