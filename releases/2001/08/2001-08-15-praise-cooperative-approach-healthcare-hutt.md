Health Minister Annette King says she is delighted at the cooperative approach Hutt Hospital and the newly renovated Lower Hutt After Hours Medical Centre have taken to managing patients with acute medical problems.

Mrs King this morning unveiled a plaque at the refurbished centre, which has an arrangement with Hutt Hospital's Emergency Department to help manage patients at peak times.

"I am very encouraged by the cooperative arrangement that has been reached between the two facilities. They have worked together with a mutual interest in effectively managing patients with acute medical problems," she said.

"This is a good example of how the establishment of District Health Boards has encouraged community-initiated and community-focused approaches to delivering health services."

The centre was opened 10 years ago to provide after hours medical services for people of Hutt Valley, and, more recently, Wainuiomata. With the rapid growth of services, and the demand for quality improvements, directors quickly came to the conclusion that they needed to expand and improve the centre.

The renovations have involved four months of work, and one challenge posed by the refurbishment was to ensure the centre was open for business every night in a sterile and fully functional environment.

"Credit had to go to the cleaning staff and tradespeople for making sure this was possible throughout those four busy months," Mrs King said today.

The centre now has four dedicated consulting rooms, with an extra nursing treatment area, and enlarged reception and waiting area.
