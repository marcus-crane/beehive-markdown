You might become world famous next month. The Computers in Homes project is a finalist in the "Stockholm Challenge 2001".

The Stockholm Challenge looks for the best ideas to open up for families the opportunities that modern technology can bring.

One of the things we have learned from the ICT Strategy over the last three years has been that in order to be successful, ICT in education has to go beyond the school gate and work in partnership with businesses and communities.

Smart Newtown is a prime example of a community working together.

Computers in Homes is happening in Porirua, Panmure, and in remote rural areas of the East Coast.

Funding for the first project has officially ended but it was so successful that it is carrying on under its own steam.

The children and the parents wanted the benefits of ICT in education.

They took great advantage of the training sessions and soon learnt to do really complicated things.

Some people got promotions and jobs because of their new computer skills. For one person it was their first ever job.

One grandfather was so impressed that he bought his grandchildren a new computer so the recycled computer could be passed on to another family.

At Newtown School you've already set up your own very impressive website.

The computers that you are getting have come from the Wellington City Council after being cleaned out and checked over by the recyclers.

Lots of people want to be part of the project. Although only 25 families are getting one of the recycled computers, everyone will be able to be involved.

Others will be able to get online at the cyber-study support centre at school or through one of the four community hubs being set up by the Council. You will find your whole community is buzzing.

Pretty soon some of you will be chatting with family in other parts of New Zealand or in your home countries just as easily as if they were here at school.

You'll be able to email friends and even email your home-study to your house to save carrying it home.

Your parents will be able to read the latest school newsletter on line and let the school know if you are sick or having trouble with something.

You've had some exciting training sessions from Wellington High School in the suite set up by Massey University. These are important partners in this project.

I'm looking forward to seeing your names again in the future when you enrol at a polytech or university.

Your teachers have also had lots to learn - not just about computers but also about how to use them to make learning better.

With this opportunity comes some responsibilities. You have all signed up to working as a unit. You will need to help each other out at home. We want everyone in your family to benefit.

Do remember your lessons about using the internet safely. I don't want to hear later on that you have let people misuse your computers or that you've had a bad experience.

Sometimes you'll be the learners, sometimes the teachers.

Your families will also be helping other families to learn. Passing on what they know. Helping others with their learning.
