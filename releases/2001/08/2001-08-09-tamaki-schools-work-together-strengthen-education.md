Education Minister Trevor Mallard today visited Point England School today to announce a major new initiative to strengthen the education provided by schools in the Tamaki area.

The Tamaki Achievement Pathway Initiative involves a cluster of 13 schools working collaboratively to improve the educational achievement of the students in their area.

The schools are Glen Innes Intermediate School, Glen Innes School, Glen Taylor School, Glenbrae School, Panmure Bridge School, Point England School, Ruapotaka School, St Patricks School, St Pius Christian School, Tamaki College, Tamaki Intermediate School, Tamaki Primary School, and Te Kura Kaupapa Puau Te Moana Nui-a-Kiwa.

"The Tamaki Achievement Pathway is a targeted project to improve student achievement across all schools in the cluster. Pacific Islands and Maori students making up approximately 80% of the roll in the Pathway schools. The focus will therefore be on enhancing the quality and effectiveness of the schools to educate Maori and Pacific students.

"These schools have recognised the importance of developing solutions to address the particular barriers to the educational achievement of their students"

Trevor Mallard said that in the next 18 months, the Government would support initiatives such as the establishment of a communication system between boards, school management teams and school communities, and to develop a co-ordinated curriculum across all schools in the cluster."

"The intention is to ensure that all students in the area achieve the best possible educational outcomes through the development of a co-ordinated academic pathway for them from pre-school to tertiary.

"I want to see this project resulting in more choices for Tamaki students and more community involvement in their learning achievement. This will be supported by the provision of better communication resources and targeted professional development for the teachers.

"I am delighted that the needs of this community have been identified through a new monitoring process being developed by the Ministry of Education. This process aggregates information currently held by the Ministry so we can develop supportive action plans which can be put in place across clusters of schools," Trevor Mallard said.
