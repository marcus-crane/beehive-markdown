This week (20 - 26 August 2001) is Library Week. The Minister Responsible for the National Library, Marian Hobbs, says it provides an opportunity to raise the profile of libraries throughout New Zealand and to showcase their services and facilities.

The week is sponsored by LIANZA , the Library and Information Association of New Zealand Aotearoa.

"One of the important themes of Library Week is the notion of librarians as the 'ultimate search engine'," Marian Hobbs said. "This captures the essence of the growing role of librarians in an information-rich world.

"Information literacy is fast becoming an issue, as many people struggle with the excess of information made available by technology. With such a wealth of information available electronically, I believe that librarians' skills are more crucial than ever.

"Libraries have a key role in improving adult literacy. They can provide a welcoming place for people to access information, assisting with education and training, shaping and motivating positive attitudes to literacy, and providing content that is pitched to the particular needs of this community.

"As technology develops, Library services and resources are becoming increasingly specialised and diverse.

"The challenge for librarians is to harness the power of technology to help deliver information further and faster than ever before.

"This week is a chance to celebrate our libraries and experience how they're adapting their role to provide ever more exciting and innovative access to information," Marian Hobbs concluded.
