Health Minister Annette King says pharmaceutical companies will become subject to tighter controls in terms of advertising their medicines direct to consumers.

"Over the past five years direct-to-consumer drug advertising (DTCA) has become increasingly common. The increased prevalence of direct advertising has raised concerns among health professionals about a range of issues, and these concerns led to a review that began last year," Mrs King said.

"After considering submissions made during the review, including those from consumer groups and organisations like the New Zealand Medical Association, and after receiving advice from the Ministry of Health, I have decided such advertising should continue to be allowed, but with tighter regulation."

Mrs King said at present medicine advertisements must comply with a number of different laws, industry self-regulation, and the Code of Therapeutic Advertising introduced by the Advertising Standards Authority in 1996. Medsafe, a division of the Ministry of Health, monitored compliance.

Mrs King said the principle of industry self-regulation would continue, but over the next year there would be consultation on a number of options for changes to the law.

"It is recommended by the Ministry that legislation regulating DTCA should be strengthened to ensure advertisements provide balanced information to consumers. Any changes that occur could be undertaken either as an amendment to the Medicines Act 1981, or in relation to work being done on a new Therapeutic Products Act. "

Mrs King said some changes that had been suggested include:  
· Only allow advertisements in broadcast and print media (drug companies are now also promoting drugs by writing to individual patients, running competitions, giving free offers and paying for doctor visits).  
· Banning brand names of drugs on vehicles.  
· Banning sponsorship of events using the brand name of a drug.  
· Fines could be increased for not complying with legislation and regulations.  
· Specify the length of time to be allocated to mandatory risk information in television advertisements, as well as the font size.  
· Require voice-over of risk information, a mandatory requirement in the United States.

"The debate around direct-to-consumer advertising has been extremely vigorous. Making evidence-based policy is not easy, as there is little empirical evidence to support either side of the debate, and the views on both sides of the debate are diametrically opposed.

"However, there is some evidence to show DTCA does increase doctor visits and prescriptions, and I believe that health professionals in New Zealand will support industry self-regulation provided we ensure tighter rules."
