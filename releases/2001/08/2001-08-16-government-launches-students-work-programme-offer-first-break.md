As part of the launch of the new SNAP programme Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton and Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey today visited **MSO Design** in Wellington.

Founded in 1977 - MSO Design offers full creative and production abilities for print, advertising and new media projects. Partners Mark Whitecliffe and Jamie Macleod recognise the importance to graduates of getting that vital ‘first break’ and have taken a pro-active approach towards hiring graduates. Within a team of 12 - MSO currently employs four Design graduates.

“We were approached by Karen Larsen midway through 2000 as she was in her second-to-last year of a four year Bachelor of Graphic Design course at Massey. To help her gain valuable work experience, Karen offered to work free at MSO during her holiday break, however, once we viewed her portfolio and gauged her enthusiasm we were pleased to employ Karen on a flexible part-time basis. We have a policy of not using free labour,” Mark Whitecliffe said.

“Now in her final year of studies, Karen has proved to be an invaluable member of our design team. Averaging 15hrs a week, she has gained a great deal of ‘hands on’ production experience essential for her future career. She has also contributed up-to-the-minute design ideas to the knowledge pool within the studio. Thanks to Karen’s dedicated and professional approach to the role we have offered her a fulltime design position within MSO and we look forward to working with her in 2002,” said Mark.
