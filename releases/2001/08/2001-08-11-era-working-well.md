The Minister of Labour Margaret Wilson says the Employment Relations Act is working well, nine months after it came into effect.

Releasing a Labour Department analysis of the operation of the Act until the end of June, Margaret Wilson said she was particularly pleased with the service provided to employers, managers, employees and unions by the Mediation Service and the Employment Relations Service.

In the 9 months after October 2 the Mediation Service received more than 4,700 requests for assistance – an average of 530 per month. Most (55.7%) were about personal grievances. Other issues included recovery of wages (8.6%), bargaining and good faith (7.1%).

Only about 14% of cases are recorded as "not settled" at mediation. Most cases are completed within 6 weeks. Nearly all are completed within 12 weeks.

Margaret Wilson said the Labour Department, through its info-line, mediators and inspectors had answered more than 165,000 inquiries in the 9 months.

"There was – of course - an increase in inquiries as the new law came into effect but overall the level of inquiries is not much more than the number received during the equivalent period in the last year of the old law. The increase, of less than 10%, shows that the new law has been well understood and that the Labour Department's communications have been effective.

Most enquiries continue to be about holidays and related entitlements.

"The ERA didn't deal with that issue. A further report is expected soon from an advisory group of union and employer representatives set up to review the Holiday Act," said Margaret Wilson.

At the end of June 139 unions were registered and union membership totalled 319,660 or 22.1% of wage and salary earners and 17.7% of the total employed workforce. This is an estimated increase from December 1999 of 17,255 or 5.7%.

New unions (enterprise based) make up 28% of registered unions – but combined membership is less than 1% of union members.

"The good faith, mutual trust and understanding promoted by the Act has been welcomed in by employers and employees. With the new law working so smoothly, we're now past the point of wondering what all the fuss was about – in workplaces around the country the fuss itself has been long forgotten," said Margaret Wilson.
