The Minister of Corrections, Matt Robson, and the Minister of State Services, Trevor Mallard, today confirmed that the Government will take all necessary steps to ensure the security of prisons if industrial action occurs.

Ministers said that on 20 July 2001 the Corrections Association of New Zealand (CANZ) gave notice to the Department of Corrections that it was going to take industrial action in support of pay claims.

Negotiations had been ongoing for some months and there is already an agreement with the other union, the PSA. The same deal is on offer to CANZ.

Ministers have assessed that the Department's offer to CANZ is fair. It represents an increase of 3.1% over two years costing $3.8 million. CANZ is seeking a 7.7% increase over one year costing $7.7 million.

The government has not appropriated any further funding for a pay settlement.

We can assure the public that the country's prisons will be secure if there is any industrial action. The Department will be supported by the Defence Forces and the Police.
