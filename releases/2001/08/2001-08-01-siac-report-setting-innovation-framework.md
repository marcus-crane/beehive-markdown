The council, chaired by a leading figure in management and industry, Rick Christie, was appointed last year by Helen Clark to provide advice on how to best position New Zealand as a knowledge-driven economy and society.

The report was released at the opening session in Auckland of the Catching the Knowledge Wave conference, which is exploring new ways to create economic prosperity and social well-being.

Helen Clark said the report by SIAC was an important element in the government's commitment to economic transformation aimed at fulfilling a vision of a more innovative, skilled, creative and enterprising nation.

The government is now seeking feedback from across all sectors on the seven challenges identified in the report, called An Innovation Framework for New Zealand, as work continues towards the production of an action plan.

The seven challenges outlined in the report are:

\* Reward 'can do', risk taking and success  
\* Educate for a knowledge economy  
\* Become a magnet nation for talent  
\* Generate wealth from ideas and knowledge  
\* Excel globally  
\* Network, collaborate and cluster  
\* Take an investment-driven approach to government

Helen Clark said it was critical to engage with a wide range of New Zealanders over the report so that a shared vision emerged on how to secure the country's future success.

"There is now an eight-week period for people to make submissions so that we can gauge reaction to the innovation framework, and determine whether other issues should be added," Helen Clark said.

"The government is committed to a partnership approach in the drawing up of a comprehensive action plan for lifting our economic performance.

"The report sets the goal of building within the next twelve months a national movement for revitalising our economy with the support of business, educators, local government and other community leaders.

"As the report notes, innovation provides New Zealand with the best opportunity to lift its game. It is about making ourselves more visible in a crowded world.

"But as we work through the process of fleshing out the framework that is being presented today, the government will continue the work it has begun on transforming the economy. There is simply no time to waste.

"The talent and investment initiatives are being developed. Industry and regional strategies have been set in motion through Industry New Zealand. The reshaping of the tertiary education sector to provide a stronger focus on quality and excellence is under way.

"We have set out on a process of rebuilding this country's economic base.

"The SIAC report, along with initiatives like the Knowledge Wave project, are important contributions to that process.

"I thank Rick Christie and the SIAC team for a stimulating report and now look forward to interested parties having their say," Helen Clark said.
