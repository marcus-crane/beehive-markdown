The 2020 Community Trust, the Ministry of Education and the Wellington City Council were commended today by Education Minister Trevor Mallard for their co-operative efforts in taking twenty-five Wellington families into the computer age.

"The Computers in Homes project has opened the lives of these families from Newtown Primary School along with many others to an opportunity that they would probably not even envisaged," Trevor Mallard said.

The families selected in Newtown have each been given a recycled computer, free internet connection for six months, technology training by a member of staff from Wellington High School , and technical support from students at Massey University. Each family has contributed $50 to the project.

The computers were donated by the Wellington City Council and recycled by Computer Access New Zealand (CANZ).

Computers in Homes began as a pilot project in 2000 at Cannon's Creek School in Porirua and Panmure Bridge School in Auckland. So far, a total of one hundred families, many of them in remote country areas, have been given the opportunity to participate.

"Not only is this giving these families and their children access to the benefits that modern technology can bring, it is raising their educational expectations," said Trevor Mallard. "Some who may otherwise have never considered the possibility of tertiary education have had their sights raised to such an extent that study at a university has become a very real possibility."

At Newtown the Computers in Homes project is part of the wider community development project known as Smart Newtown.

"One of the things we have learned from ICT education is that in order to be successful, it has to go beyond the school gate and work in partnership with businesses and communities," said Trevor Mallard when he visited Newtown School for today's announcement. "Smart Newtown is a prime example of a community working together."

And he told the school: "You just might become world famous next month. The Computers in Homes project is a finalist in the 'Stockholm Challenge 2001'. This global initiative is to identify the best ways of opening the lives of families such as those in Newtown to the opportunities that modern technology can bring."

The Ministry of Education and the 2020 Communications Trust is also working with the Tuhoe Education Authority in establishing a Computers in Homes project for 125 families at Mäori-medium schools on the East Coast.
