The Lottery Grants Board has decided to lighten the administrative load on the country's volunteer fire fighters with a special one-off technology grant of $81,511, Board chairperson and Internal Affairs Minister George Hawkins announced today.

The grant will enable the United Fire Brigades Association to establish a nationwide computer network, which will provide a significantly improved method of recording and monitoring the service and training records of volunteer fire fighters, he said.

"Currently the information is collected in a paper-based system and then manually loaded into a computer database which is very labour intensive and inefficient."

Mr Hawkins said an added advantage to volunteer brigades is they will be able to access their own records and produce a wide variety of reports that currently require a lot of manual effort to produce.

The grant had been made as part of the Lottery Grants Board's continuing commitment to the International Year of Volunteers, he said.
