Auckland Girls Grammar has been named Goodman Fielder School of the Year, also winning the best secondary school category of the awards, in a ceremony in Wellington last night.

The Auckland Central secondary school was awarded $10,000 cash for its category win, and a further $40,000 for being the overall winner.

Labour MP for Auckland Central Judith Tizard is delighted with the win.

"This is fantastic news. Auckland Girls has proved it is a cut above the rest.

"It was no mean feat to make the list of finalists, given the high standard of entries received for the awards."

Judges for the Goodman Fielder School of the Year Awards looked at a range of criteria, including academic progress, fundraising and budget management, cultural & sporting progress, teacher involvement, social, health and environmental programmes, and how the school works with the local community.

" Auckland Girls Grammar has successfully identified the elements of the school that have contributed to this recognition of all-round excellence.

"I would like to congratulate the principal, Liz Thomson, all the staff and students of Auckland Girls, and the local community for supporting the school. We can be justifiably proud of having a school of this calibre in our electorate."
