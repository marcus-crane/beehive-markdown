Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton says Dannevirke's success in reducing its crime rate highlights the importance of investing in regional development.

Dannevirke's crime rate has dropped dramatically this year, and local police say a major contributing factor has been the halving of the unemployment rate in the area.

"We are seeing the success that flows right across the community from the lowest rate of unemployment in thirteen years," Jim Anderton said.

"When people have jobs, they don't have much time to make trouble.

"More jobs are good for the people who get the jobs, but it is also good for the rest of the community. It means less crime, fewer social problems and people feel more secure in their homes.

"Dannevirke's success has to be repeated across every region of New Zealand," Jim Anderton said.
