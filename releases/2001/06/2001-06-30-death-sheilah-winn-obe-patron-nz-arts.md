Prime Minister Helen Clark and Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Judith Tizard today expressed their sadness at the death of Sheilah Winn, and paid tribute to her longstanding patronage of the arts in New Zealand.

Sheilah Winn died on 27 June, aged 84.

"Through her unstinting financial generosity and encouragement, Sheilah Winn has supported a wide range of artistic endeavour in New Zealand, from theatre, to weaving, to literature," Helen Clark said.

"Wellington's Hannah Playhouse, one of the capital's most enduring artistic institutions, owes its existence to the support of Sheilah Winn in the 1960s.

"More recently, Sheilah Winn helped to fund the weaving of the embroidered stage hangings which now adorn the new Globe Theatre in London.

"Sheila Winn also established the Katherine Mansfield scholarship in Menton, France, which since its inception has supported many of New Zealand's most successful writers."

"Many other examples of Sheilah Winn's generosity have not been publicised, reflecting the modesty which accompanied her generosity," Judith Tizard said.

"Our sympathy goes out to Sheilah Winn's friends and family at this sad time."
