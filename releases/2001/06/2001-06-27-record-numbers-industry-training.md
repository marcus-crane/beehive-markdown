Record numbers of New Zealanders are now participating in Industry Training, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Trainee numbers grew from 56,000 in January 2000 to nearly 63,000 people by the end of 2000, an 11 percent increase. The information comes from a new Skill New Zealand report, Industry Training 2000, which Mr Maharey released today.

"Ensuring access to quality, relevant industry training is a major commitment of the current Government. An additional $79 million was allocated to industry training in our first two budgets and we have established a new $42 million flagship Modern Apprenticeship programme.

“This report shows the benefits of industry training are being extended to a wider range of New Zealanders than ever before.

"Nearly 63,000 individuals and more than 22,000 employers across many industries were involved in industry training in 2000.

"The report also details that the characteristics of industry trainees is changing.

“Maori and Pacific peoples now account for nearly a quarter of people participating in Industry Training. Their participation rate has nearly doubled over the past five years. Participation by women has also increased. In 1996, just 13 percent of all trainees were women, this increased to 22 percent in 2000.

“These statistics demonstrate the significance of the workplace as a place of learning. Over 6,000 National Certificates were achieved last year. For many industry trainees this is their first experience of educational success and a powerful motivation to keep learning.

"It is also pleasing to see that industry contributed $27 million of the cash cost of Industry Training (30% of the total cost). These industry contributions indicate that the system is meeting the needs of employers and trainees and is valued by them,” Steve Maharey said.
