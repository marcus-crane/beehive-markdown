Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton, Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Transport Minister Mark Gosche received a briefing this afternoon from Singapore Airlines Chief Executive, Dr Cheong Choong Kong on the Air New Zealand Board meeting today.

The Government is now awaiting a formal written proposal from Air New Zealand.

"It would be unhelpful to make any further comment," the three ministers said.
