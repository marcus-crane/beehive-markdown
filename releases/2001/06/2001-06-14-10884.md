Anderton to seek further Napier-Gisborne rail update

Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton will ask Tranz Rail for an update on its plans for the Napier-Gisborne rail line.

The final draft of the Tairawhiti Integrated Transport Strategy will be completed this month.

Jim Anderton says the Ministry of Economic Development believes that job losses on the line and service reductions are not inevitable.

"There may have been some communication difficulties and there remain a number of options for the future of the line, and both the government and Tranz Rail are working on the issue.

"Above all, Tranz Rail has assured the government that it has no plan to close the line in the near future, therefore there does not seem to be an immediate threat to the workers' jobs.

"I will be meeting with Tranz Rail next week to get an update on this issue," Jim Anderton said.
