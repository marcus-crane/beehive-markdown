Associate Energy Minister Paul Swain says the government shares concerns about the sulphur levels in New Zealand diesel and agrees that current levels are out of step with European countries.

"For the first time in 10 years the government is reviewing these and other petrol and diesel specifications," Paul Swain said

"The review will be ensuring that we have fuel that suits modern engine technologies as well as ensuring that it complies with up to date quality, safety, health and environmental standards.

"We intend to make changes early next year.

"A likely outcome of that review is sulphur levels phased down over 5 years to a maximum of 50 parts per million- this is what is occurring in other countries.

"In the meantime, whilst the review is being concluded, I have called on the industry to come up with an interim solution that is acceptable to all New Zealanders.," Paul Swain said.
