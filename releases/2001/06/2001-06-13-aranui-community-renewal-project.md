Aranui support grows

A community renewal project in the Christchurch suburb of Aranui is attracting widespread support, Housing Minister Mark Gosche and Christchurch East MP Lianne Dalziel said today.

The Aranui project, a joint undertaking between Housing New Zealand and the Christchurch City Council, is the first of several such projects envisaged for communities where there are a high number of Housing New Zealand properties.

“Community renewal is aimed at empowering communities. The project focuses not only on improving the community's housing needs but also on their employment, training and social services needs,” Mr Gosche said.

A Housing New Zealand property is being converted as a community information centre. The City Council has also employed a Community Consultation Co-ordinator who is based at the centre, along with Housing New Zealand’s tenancy managers. The Department of Work and Income is also investigating using it as a base, Mr Gosche said.

“Housing New Zealand wants to build meaningful partnerships with local communities, to make them more vibrant, vigorous and viable.

“Although new to New Zealand, community renewal models are well tested overseas where they have been highly effective in meeting community needs.

“The Aranui project, although in its early stages, has excited and encouraged many local community members to volunteer their time and energy.

Local MP Lianne Dalziel said she is thrilled with the opportunity the approach has offered Aranui.

"My electorate office is in Aranui, and I feel very connected to the project and I support it 100%," she said.
