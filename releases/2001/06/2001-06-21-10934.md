Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton, Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Transport Minister Mark Gosche met tonight with the acting chairman of Air New Zealand, Dr Jim Farmer, and the company chief executive, Gary Toomey, and two independent directors.

They received a broad proposal in writing from Air New Zealand.

"More detail will be needed to flesh out the proposal and we agree it will take some time to work through.

"Any eventual decision will go before the full cabinet," the ministers said.

"There will be no further comment at this stage."
