"Transport Minister Mark Gosche and I will be meeting with Canterbury, Otago & Southland over next two months to ensure that the best case possible is made to West Coast Railways and Transfund for the development of the Southerner service," says Judith Tizard.

Associate Transport Minister Judith Tizard and Labour MP for Dunedin South, David Benson-Pope, met with representatives of West Coast Railway and the Otago and Southland communities in Dunedin today to discuss the future of the Southerner passenger rail service.

The Southerner runs between Christchurch and Invercargill. It is part of the Trans Scenic passenger rail network, which is the subject of an exclusive negotiation deal between Tranz Rail and Australia's West Coast Railway.

"West Coast Railway's optimistic statements about the Southerner have been very encouraging, and we took it as a postive sign that, as the prospective buyer of the rail service, they came to Dunedin to meet with the local community."

"This is just the first in a series of meetings Mark Gosche and I will be holding with regional councils around the country who have an interest in the sale of Trans Scenic, so that we can all work to ensure that the best passenger services are available throughout New Zealand."
