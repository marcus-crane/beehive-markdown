The Grey Lynn Neighbourhood Law Office has received a $50,000 cheque from the government to fund a resource management advisory service.

"I'm pleased to hear that the Grey Lynn Neighbourhood Law Office has been one of the first successful applicants for this funding," says Auckland Central MP Judith Tizard. "It will help to improve public awareness of planning and development issues in central Auckland.

"It's important for people to understand what the Resource Management Act is and why we need it. It's great that the work of local advisory services such as the Grey Lynn office has been recognised in this way."

The Ministry for the Environment awards grants for resource management education and advisory services through its Environmental Legal Assistance funding scheme.

Minister for the Environment, Marian Hobbs, presented the office with a $50,000 cheque on Thursday, while in Auckland to launch a new 'easy to use' guide to the Resource Management Act.

"The guide and the funding are a good start to improving people's knowledge of the RMA," says Judith Tizard. "The funding for the Grey Lynn Neighbourhood Law Office will help people in Auckland Central to get free or low-cost advice about planning issues at a crucial time in their planning process - at the beginning, rather than later in the development when the costs are higher."
