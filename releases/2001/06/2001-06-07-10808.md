Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark today paid tribute to composer Douglas Lilburn, who died yesterday, saying his contribution to music in New Zealand was immense.

"Douglas Lilburn was an inspiration to many New Zealand musicians, as a teacher, mentor, composer, philanthropist and, perhaps above all, father figure.

"His contribution was such that he was made a member of the Order of New Zealand in 1988, New Zealand's top honour limited to twenty persons at any one time.

"His achievements were many. He was emeritus professor of Victoria University. He established the first electronic music studio in the southern hemisphere. He won numerous prizes for his compositions. Amongst his many works was his Aotearoa Overture which was performed in London to mark New Zealand's centenary.

"Above all, he was New Zealand's foremost contemporary composer. His work was instrumental in developing a distinctive New Zealand musical tradition.

"As Prime Minister and as Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, I extend the government's condolences to the Lilburn family," Helen Clark said.
