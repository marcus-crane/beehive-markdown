Environment Minister, Marian Hobbs, says an Opposition call for an inquiry into the storage of chemicals on trucks is premature.

New regulations under the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act take effect on July 2 and explicitly take into account the risks to the environment as well as other hazards such as flammability, she said.

Other complementary initiatives recently undertaken by the government include a major rewrite of the Land Transport Rule for dangerous goods. This encompasses the proper packaging of those substances, the segregation of loads to avoid chemical cocktails in the event of accidents, and the proper provision of information, including what to do in emergencies.

"The HSNO Act and its regulations are designed to work in tandem with the transport rules," Marian Hobbs said. "These initiatives will all help address the risks of transporting hazardous substances.

"Education of all sectors affected by the new system for hazardous substances is currently under way.

"Everyone involved in transporting these substances must understand their obligations and carry them out, including being properly prepared for emergencies when they do happen."
