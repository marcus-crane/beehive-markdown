"I am delighted to learn that Auckland Girls Grammar has been named a finalist in the 2000 Goodman Fielder School of the Year Awards," says Labour MP for Auckland Central, Judith Tizard.

"I am told that the judging panel was particularly impressed by the achievements of Auckland Girls Grammar. It's no mean feat to make the list of finalists, considering the high standard of entries received for the awards."

Judges for the Goodman Fielder School of the Year Awards look at a range of criteria, including academic progress, fundraising and budget management, cultural & sporting progress, teacher involvement, social, health and environmental programmes, and how the school works with the local community.

"It is encouraging to see so many schools prepared to take the time to enter such a competition, and I congratulate Auckland Girls for successfully identifying the elements of their school that have contributed to their outstanding achievements and all-round excellence."

Auckland Girls Grammar is one of three finalists in the Secondary School Category of the awards. The school's principal and a student representative will attend a special ceremony in Wellington on Wednesday 27 June, at which the five category winners and the overall winner for the 2000 awards will be announced.

"I wish Auckland Girls Grammer the best of luck for the final awards ceremony," says Judith Tizard. "Auckland Central is proud of Auckland Girls Grammar, and on behalf of the electorate I congratulate the school for this recognition that it is one of New Zealand's leading schools."
