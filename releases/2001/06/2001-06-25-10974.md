New Zealand’s next Ambassador to the Islamic Republic of Iran will be Niels Holm, Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced today.

Mr Goff said New Zealand’s relations with Iran were mainly trade-based, with the resource-rich nation seen as a key trading partner in the region.

“Iran is one of our largest markets in the Middle East for agricultural exports like dairy and wool products.

“These will remain important but there are also excellent prospects to build on recent sales by our telecommunications technology sector. Trade in services also offers good potential,” Mr Goff said.

He said the embassy plays an important role assisting potential New Zealand businesses entry into Iran’s heavily regulated market. The Tehran post was established in the mid-1970s and is the longest standing New Zealand mission in the region.

Mr Holm will also be accredited as High Commissioner to Pakistan.

He joined the Department of Trade and Industry in 1979 and was Private Secretary to Hon Warren Cooper and Hon Mike Moore. He joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in 1988 and is currently Deputy Director of its APEC Division.

He has had two postings to Tokyo and also served in Manila.

Mr Holm takes up his position in November, replacing Warwick Hawker.
