New Zealand will contribute $150,000 to the International Red Cross for relief work in Peru following the weekend earthquake there, Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs (Official Development Assistance), Matt Robson, announced today.

“The earthquake was a disaster of significant magnitude with a current reported death toll of 55, many injured, and serious damage to services," Matt Robson said.

“New Zealand’s contribution will help the Red Cross mobilise immediate relief efforts in cooperation with Peruvian authorities.

“The New Zealand Government has already sent a message of sympathy and condolences to the Peruvian President on behalf of all New Zealanders,” Matt Robson said.

He said no reports have been received of New Zealanders being involved in the disaster at this stage, but the New Zealand Embassy in Santiago is seeking to confirm this.

New Zealand’s contribution comes from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade Official Development Assistance programme's disaster relief allocation.
