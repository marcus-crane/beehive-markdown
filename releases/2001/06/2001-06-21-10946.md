Transfund's announcement this evening of more funding for Auckland roading and transport projects is a sign of real progress on the region's congestion issues, says Minister Assisting the Prime Minister with Auckland Issues, Judith Tizard.

As part of Transfund's National Roading Programme, nearly $189 million will be spent in Auckland this year on roading and passenger services in the region - an increase of 10.4 per cent on last year.

This includes the investigation and design stage of the upgrades to Spaghetti Junction, the road links between the motorway and the Port via Grafton Gully, and funding for a flyover on State Highway 20 at Puhinui.

"Investigations into projects that could relieve congestion in critical transport corridors like Spaghetti Junction could lead to a further investment of $1.1 billion into Auckland's roads and transport initiatives," says Judith Tizard, who is also the Associate Minister of Transport.

"There is still a long way to go, but it's great that eighteen months through this term of government, Auckland's transport issues are finally being addressed with the start of the funding they need."

"This will benefit the rest of the country, as Auckland's traffic congestion is estimated to cost $800 million a year to New Zealand as a whole."

The government is also working in partnership with local government in Auckland to improve passenger transport, by negotiating to buy the rail corridors in the region. Judith Tizard and Transport Minister Mark Gosche expect the Government to make decisions on longer term land transport policy over the next few months.
