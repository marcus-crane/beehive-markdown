"I am delighted that the Lotteries Commission has been able to maintain current funding levels for the agencies that foster arts and film in New Zealand," says Associate Arts, Culture & Heritage Minister Judith Tizard.

There will be no cuts in Lottery funding for Creative New Zealand, the New Zealand Film Commission, the New Zealand Film Archive and the Arts Foundation.

Internal Affairs Minister and Lottery Grants Board chairperson George Hawkins says current funding levels for these key statutory agencies have been maintained by using Board reserves to top-up the Lotteries Commission's projected profit figure for the 2001/02 financial year.

"The work that these four arts-related agencies do is imperative for maintaining New Zealanders' sense of identity and well-being," says Judith Tizard. "I am thrilled that the Lotteries Commission has enabled these organisations to keep doing the wonderful work they do."

"Ruth Harley, the Chief Executive of the Film Commission, told me last night it's the best news she's heard in weeks. The sense of relief in her office is heartfelt."

The list of allocations for the four key arts and film agencies is:

New Zealand Film Commission $8.801 million  
Arts Foundation $1 million  
Creative New Zealand $20.31 million  
Film Archive $.65 million
