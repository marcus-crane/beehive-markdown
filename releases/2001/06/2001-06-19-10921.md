New Zealand will make a one-off $100,000 contribution to the International Labour Organisation’s International Programme for the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC), Associate Foreign Minister Matt Robson and Labour Minister Margaret Wilson announced today.

The contribution will help IPEC and its worldwide movement to eradicate child labour.

The announcement follows Margaret Wilson’s attendance at the ILO’s 89th convention in Geneva and her signing of the Instrument of Ratification of ILO Convention 182 on the worst forms of child labour. It covers all forms of slavery, prostitution and pornography; the use of children for illicit activities, and work 'likely to harm the health, safety and morals of children'.

Convention 182 calls for enhanced international cooperation and/or assistance including support for social and economic development, poverty eradication programmes and universal education.

IPEC estimates that approximately 250 million children between five and 14 years of age are working in developing countries; 120 million full time.

Matt Robson and Margaret Wilson said the contribution is in line with the New Zealand Overseas Development Assistance framework to reduce poverty, support human rights activities and improve the quality of life of men, women and children in developing countries.
