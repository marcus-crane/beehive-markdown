"The Tax Review has delivered a tough-minded and radical analysis which should spark a 'first principles' debate on taxation in this country," Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

Dr Cullen was commenting on the launch of the Review's issues paper. The Review will now conduct a second round of consultations before reporting finally to the Government in October this year.

"The Review was asked by the Government to explore a series of questions but was accorded complete independence in how it approached its brief and in the conclusions it formed.

“As I have stated previously, no proposals for significant change will be implemented without first seeking a mandate from the electorate through the 2002 general election,” Dr Cullen said.

"I hope the ideas canvassed by the Review can be debated seriously without reflexive position-taking.

"The Government has never indicated that we would expect to pick up all the Review's recommendations and has always hoped that all political parties will feel free to draw on the final report as a resource.

"Accordingly, I intend to refrain as much as possible from commenting on any of the specific issues the inquiry has raised. We need a broad discussion involving many voices so I would encourage individuals and organisations to make submissions to the Review," Dr Cullen said.

The issues paper and further details about the Tax Review are available on the Review’s website: [http://www.taxreview2001.govt.nz](http://www.taxreview2001.govt.nz/).
