New Zealand's exotic disease response system was implemented today after  
the report of a potential disease outbreak in the King Country.

Acting Biosecurity Minister Marian Hobbs said the Government took the  
report extremely seriously and measures to combat any potential disease  
spread had been implemented immediately.

Examination by Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry-contracted vets at both  
the Universal Beef Packers' Te Kuiti meatworks and the Taihape farm where  
the affected animal came from showed no evidence of infectious disease. In  
the absence of any infection, it is likely the healing wounds seen on a  
single animal were the result of trauma or the animal eating a caustic  
substance.

Agriculture and Biosecurity Minister Jim Sutton, speaking from China, said  
he was "tremendously relieved" that the animal had no disease and that the  
exotic disease response system had worked well.

"I express my thanks to those responsible members of the media who heard  
about the response but held off till confirmation, so as not to needlessly  
panic people."
