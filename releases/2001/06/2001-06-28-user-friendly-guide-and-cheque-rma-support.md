Fifty thousand dollars and a new 'easy to use' guide to the Resource Management Act were a good start to improving understanding of the RMA, the Minister for the Environment, Marian Hobbs, said today.

The minister will launch the new guide – The Resource Management Act and You: Getting in on the Act – at a function at the Auckland City Council today. The guide aims to demystify the RMA for the average New Zealander.

"There is a real concern that people don't understand what the Resource Management Act is and why we need it," Marian Hobbs said. "People know even less about how it affects them or what they should do when it does. This down-to-earth guide, should go some way to overcoming this."

A Ministry survey late last year showed that while many people have heard of the RMA (79 percent), few understood it well or had participated in it. People were also confused about the roles of city, district, and regional councils.

The guide uses plain language and examples to outline the basics of the Act and the opportunities for people to become involved.

The Resource Management Act and You: Getting in on the Act is publicly available at all councils, community law centres, Citizens Advice Bureaus, BizInfo centres and from the Ministry for the Environment.

Marian Hobbs will also present the Grey Lynn Neighbourhood Law Office with a $50,000 cheque to fund a resource management advisory service.

Through the Environment Ministry's Environmental Legal Assistance funding scheme, the law office is one of the first successful applicants for resource management education and advisory services grants.

"This funding provides an avenue for the public to obtain free or low-cost advice about a planning issue when they first get involved – rather than at the end when the cost of the process is higher," Marian Hobbs said.
