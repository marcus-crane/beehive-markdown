Construction of a Puhinui interchange will mark the end of years of "horrendous" peak hour snarl ups, Transport Minister Mark Gosche and Associate Minister Judith Tizard announced today.

The two Auckland MPs started digging on the $20 million project this morning, surrounded by the peak hour traffic that the roundabout is notorious for.

"South Aucklanders and those travelling to Manukau will particularly welcome this development, as will all those who have ever travelled from Pakuranga and Howick to the airport and risked missing the plane because of the congestion."

"This is one of Auckland's major roading trouble spots, so we are delighted that relief is finally in sight."

As well as relieving congestion the interchange also marks the first step in a project to link the Southwestern motorway (SH20) and the Southern Motorway (SH1).

The interchange is scheduled to be completed by May 2003.
