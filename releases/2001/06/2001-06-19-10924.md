The legislation to implement the Government's decision to revoke the apple and pear export regulations from October 1 this year was introduced into the House today, Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton said.

This Apple and Pear Industry Restructuring Act Repeal Bill will give growers a choice of exporters who will all compete on an equal footing.  
Mr Sutton said the bill would be referred to the primary production select committee later this month, where there would be the opportunity for members of the public to make submissions.

He said it was expected to be passed into law in September.

"The pipfruit industry is actively reorganising itself for this change and is considering whether it should apply to come under the New Zealand Horticulture Export Authority Act 1987 (the HEA Act) or whether it would prefer to operate within a normal commercial environment.

"Recent grower meetings have discussed the two possible structural options for the industry (i.e. no specific legislation, or prescribing pipfruit under the HEA Act to provide for export licensing). Views among the pipfruit industry on these two options are mixed."

Mr Sutton said that despite this, growers and exporters were working together to address industry good issues and, together with MAF, were working to afeguard the integrity of New Zealand pipfruit exports.
