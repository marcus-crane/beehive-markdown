Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia has welcomed the Maori Fisheries litigants back to the country, with another call for the parties to sit down together to resolve their differences.

Te Ohu Kaimoana, Treaty Tribes and other parties have just returned from the Privy Council in London. The Privy Council heard evidence and arguments on iwi representation and allocation of fisheries. A decision is likely in the next couple of months.

Maori Affairs Minister, Parekura Horomia, said there is intense frustration amongst Maori over the amount of time and money wasted on litigation.

"The Privy Council decision will not resolve all fisheries allocation issues. There are wider issues that should be resolved by Maori, rather than Law Lords."

Mr Horomia said he is hopeful that the parties will continue to participate willingly and constructively in the mediation process facilitated by Te Ohu Kaimoana and Justice Sir Rodney Gallen.

"Allocation is a priority for me. Maori own a significant share of New Zealand's fisheries assets, yet those at the grassroots are getting little or nothing out of it. It is up to the people who manage assets on behalf of Maori people to work together to find sustainable solutions."
