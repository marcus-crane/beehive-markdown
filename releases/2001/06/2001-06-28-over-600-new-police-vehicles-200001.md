The Minister of Police, George Hawkins, said today that extra funding of $2.812 million for police vehicles brings the total invested this year to $17.66 million (incl GST).

"The significant spend on vehicles this year is another example of focussed spending by the Labour Alliance Government. We are serious about providing the Police with quality resources so that they can continue with their excellent work in reducing crime.

"The National Government took a very different approach - instead of boosting spending on police vehicles, they were happy to cut spending on vehicles as a way to bankroll the failed INCIS computer system.

"Underfunding of resources by the previous government resulted in an ageing and unreliable fleet of vehicles - for example, only 140 vehicles were replaced in 1996/97" said Mr Hawkins.

Mr Hawkins said that the latest funding allocation would buy another 75 vehicles, resulting in a total of more than 600 new police vehicles this year.
