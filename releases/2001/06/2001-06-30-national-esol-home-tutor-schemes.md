INTRODUCTION  
I'm delighted to be here today to open the National ESOL Home Tutor Schemes' Conference 2001, "Value in Volunteers". My colleague, Lianne Dalziel sends her greetings. She is the Associate Minister responsible for ESOL and refugee education. These responsibilities fit in well with her immigration portfolio. My responsibilities include adult and community education (adult literacy) so there're synergies here as well. And since we're a friendly co-operative cabinet - two heads thinking about your issues is better than one.

The theme of your conference is most appropriate in this the International Year of Volunteers. The Government recognises the essential role community sector volunteers play in helping deliver a wide range of services supported by government funding.  
In fact let's turn that around the other way. Before governments there were volunteers and then governments filled in the gaos. But the pendulum swung too far to where volunteers became an add-on. But neither should volunteers be seen as replacements for government service; rather we should be working together for a fair and just society.  
I must acknowledge the generosity and commitment of the more than 3,000 volunteer tutors who are such a strength in the ESOL Home Tutor Schemes. You do a fantastic job in committing to help new New Zealanders. As trained volunteers you offer the bridge of friendship and language and social support. It makes such a difference to the resettlement of refugees and migrants. The gain is, of course, two-way - the tutor/learner relationship provides an enriching experience for both parties.  
simple issue, food; no ESOL tutor's cookiung ever remains the same.  
The welcome this morning exemplified the richness, diversity and what we can learn.

GOVERNMENT AND THE VOLUNTARY AND COMMUNITY SECTOR  
The Government recognises the importance of the voluntary and community sector in fostering individual and community development and in providing pathways into further lifelong learning. We also recognise that there is always room to build on strengths and to strive to achieve even more.

In August 2000, we established the Community and Voluntary Sector Working Party to consider "the scope of a proposed agreement between government and Iwi/Maori, community and voluntary organisations".

This Working Party presented its report to the Minister responsible for the community and voluntary sector, Steve Maharey, earlier this year. "Communities and Government - Potential for Partnership," identifies five key issues which need to be addressed in the relationship between government and the community sector:  
\- 1.There are concerns about the relationship between the Crown and iwi. This is characterised by Maori desire for self-determination and control over their own resources and the policies affecting the future and well-being. The PM's clear statement: if you are the receiver of services, you should have a say in how services are delivered - you know what works (the same for ESOL).  
\- 2.There's a sense within the sector of having been excluded from key policy decisions and a desire for a more participatory style of government; as activists you have the experience and information.  
\- 3. There's frustration at all levels and across a wide range of organisations with government funding arrangements and in particular opposition to a contracting model; more time spent on administration than on the work you volunteered to do.  
\- 4.There's concern about the health and strength of Iwi/Maori, community and voluntary organisations and their ability to pursue their own goals; and again the admin drains the fervour, energy and enthusiasm.  
\- The fifth issue addressed by the voluntary sector working party, a more general concern about the "culture of government" - the attitudes and behaviour of government agencies and officials and their lack of understanding of iwi and the community sector.

To develop a pathway for developing the relationship between government and community organisations the Working Party on Community and Volunteer sector proposes:  
\- 1.several immediate actions to jump-start the rebuilding. These include developing a database of community sector people able to help develop policy and undertake public sector related research; ensuring there's sufficient resourcing for government agencies to engage effectively with iwi and community sector representatives;  
\- It suggested a mechanism for broadly addressing relations between Iwi/Mäori and the Crown and the implications of the Treaty of Waitangi in government relations with communities and community organisations;  
\- It recommended the development of a Statement of Intent by the current government, setting out the principles and values on which government agency and attitudes should be based; and  
\- a second phase programme of relationship-building comprising four strands:  
v developing participatory democracy  
v reviewing resourcing and accountability relationships  
v strengthening the community sector  
v and, cutting across the first three, work to improve the ability of central government to understand and work with community organisations.

These broad areas of concern, and proposals for a way forward, are in many ways very similar to some of the key goals for adult and community education which have been developed by the Adult Education and Community Learning Working Group, including:  
\- adult and community education recognised as a valued and integral part of the tertiary education system;  
\- developing the capability of the adult and community education sector to deliver effective education programmes; knowing what is effective; testing its effectiveness; training the teachers.  
\- strategies to increase Maori participation, and advance Maori development through adult and community education; and  
\- effective ways for the adult and community education sector to meet the educational needs of communities.

ADULT ESOL STRATEGY  
ESOL education is the area, dear to your hearts. We are seeking to build on current strengths and improve our strategic approach.

The appropriate provision of ESOL education is critical to successful resettlement. We need to ensure the availability of ESOL programmes to best suit learners' needs where and when they need them. Key issues are accessibility, affordability and programme quality.

The Ministry of Education is beginning work on the development of an adult ESOL strategy. The strategy will ensure that:  
\- all New Zealanders have an adequate level of English language so they can participate fully in all aspects of life - including work, family and the community - and develop their full potential;  
\- there are policies and structures to assist all refugees' literacy and fluency in English; and  
\- we achieve, particularly for refugees, an improved strategic approach to ESOL that is adequately resourced, accessible, includes quality standards, and measures results.

This work does not stand alone, but is part of a range of initiatives which seek to address these and related issues. We know that we can do more to improve migrant and refugee settlement outcomes.

SETTLEMENT SERVICES PILOTS  
English language training for those whose first language is not English is a key priority for the Government's migrant and refugee settlement policy. We recognise that an adequate level of English is essential to assist migrants and refugees adapt successfully to their new lives in New Zealand as quickly as possible. Then they can achieve the fullest possible participation in New Zealand's economic, social and cultural life.

Adults who attain an adequate knowledge of English as a second language are better able to operate in the workplace, to use their specialist skills and knowledge as employees and to act as effective advocates for their communities. Those with a sound working knowledge of English are able to access the information and services they need to make decisions. This will help maintain family stability, make them successful role models for their children, assist in their children's educational achievement and to participate in and contribute to the well being of the country.

Settling migrants is not always easy. There can be difficulties in finding satisfying employment and settling into local communities. This has prompted calls for more leadership from the Government, particularly for a comprehensive settlement policy. As an interim response, the Cabinet agreed in 2000 that half a million dollars from the migrant levy would be used to fund settlement services pilots. The pilots include trials across a broad range of potential services, and we sought innovative approaches from the community to deliver the pilots.

I am delighted that the ESOL Home Tutor Service Wellington, and Wellington's Multicultural Centre for Learning and Support Services (MCLaSS) are among the organisations being contracted to carry out the pilots. These organisations will be involved with pilots in areas including support for groups working with refugee claimants, resident refugee family orientation courses, and resident migrant settlement services.

Settlement services pilots will be used to inform further development of settlement policy and services. They will have the additional advantage of delivering some results sooner than initiatives undertaken once a full strategy has been agreed. Evaluation of the pilots will begin in September 2001.

ESOL FUNDING  
The total amount received from migrants for pre-purchased ESOL training  
since the programme began in 1999 is $8.3 million. To date (25  
June 2001) $1.4 million of this has been paid out to ESOL providers.

The programme is in a period of rapid growth with the majority of payments  
received from migrants ($5.7 million) and made to providers ($1.15 million)  
occurring in the past 12 months. We expect this growth to continue as  
migrants arrive and settle. (All figures provided are GST inclusive.)

It is important to note that there will always be a delay between payment of  
the pre-purchase fees and taking up training. Migrants have three years (or  
in some cases three-and-a-half years) in which to take up their training. Of  
those migrants who have taken up their training to date, the average length  
of time from migrants signing their agreement with Skill New Zealand, to  
taking up training is around 8 months.

A large proportion of migrants who have pre-purchased training have not yet provided Skill New Zealand with a contact address, which could indicate that they have not yet arrived in the country. We will not be able to calculate the rate of uptake until the programme has been operating for at least three-and-a-half years.

To deal with the slow uptake problem Skill New Zealand has been working with the New Zealand Immigration Service to find ways to promote ESOL training to migrants once they have arrived in the country. This has included placing advertisements in Asian community newspapers in Auckland and in the Internal Affairs' "Ethnic News". An 0800 number is available for migrants to access more information about the training available. Course directories have been translated into Korean, Chinese and Japanese. Once Skill New Zealand has New Zealand contact addresses for migrants, we send course directories advising them on training options in their region and reminder letters encouraging them to take up training.  
The most recent quarterly report from Statistics NZ and NZIS includes ESOL for migrants. At the end of March, 1928 people had pre-paid (compared with 514 as at 31 March 2000).

By the end of March 2001, 511 migrants had participated in training (121 had used all of their entitlement). On average, people's English capabilities had improved by the equivalent of about one level on the International English Language Test (IELTS).

The numbers participating in training have increased considerably over the 200/01 financial year. People who pre-purchase from off-shore have three and a half years after arriving in New Zealand to start English tuition. (People who pre-purchase on shore have 3 years from their date of approval). This policy started on 30 November 1998.

ADULT LITERACY STRATEGY  
No doubt you will be aware that some refugees and migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds also need to improve their general literacy, as well as their skills in the English language.

The International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) in 1996 revealed that approximately 10 percent of adult New Zealanders have a first language other than English - around 200,000 people between 15 and 64 years of age. About 70 percent of this group have a level of literacy below that required to cope easily with the varied range of printed material found in everyday life and work. Those born overseas had a considerably higher percentage at the very lowest level of literacy, and could be expected to experience considerable difficulties in using any of the printed materials encountered in everyday life and work.

About one quarter of those surveyed for whom English was not their first language were from Pacific Islands ethnic backgrounds, and one half were from other ethnic groups (that is not Pacific, Maori, or pakeha). Only 35 percent of those whose first language is other than English were employed, compared with 57 percent for the rest of the population

On 7 May 2001 I launched the adult literacy strategy. This strategy presents a long term approach to achieve three key goals of:  
\- Increasing opportunities for adult literacy learning;  
\- Developing capability of adult literacy providers to deliver high quality education; and  
\- Improving quality systems to ensure that adult literacy teaching programmes in New Zealand are world class.

The adult literacy strategy signals a change in government policy on adult literacy, a move to more government leadership. It is part of the broader national literacy & numeracy strategy, which provides a comprehensive, single overview of the development of literacy and numeracy from early childhood, through the early school years to senior secondary school, and adult life and work.

Our aim is to build a robust adult literacy learning network that will ensure consistent access to high quality programmes and the best learning outcomes available. This will open opportunities and ensure everybody has the chance to meet challenges, and succeed to the best of their abilities.

The Ministry of Education will lead the implementation of the Strategy, providing a sense of direction and strategic planning, and co-ordinating the development and promulgation of standards and best practice models that will underpin the systems which will ensure quality learning is available.

CONCLUSION  
Language is tightly interwoven with society and culture, and when the language component is weak, settlement will inevitably suffer - to the detriment of all concerned. This is where the contribution of the ESOL Home Tutor Schemes is so important. I commend you for the valuable work you do in promoting the interests, and catering for the needs, of learners from language backgrounds other than English.

I know that many learners have difficulty meeting the costs of learning English in formal class settings, and this is where the Home Tutor Schemes come into their own. The network of 25 well set-up and nationally co-ordinated Schemes throughout the country is only possible with the involvement of well-trained, willing volunteer tutors.

I would again like to thank the trained volunteers for their commitment, time, and energy, and to extend these sentiments to all of those involved in the ESOL Home Tutor Schemes including the learners for their commitment to becoming new New Zealanders. I wish you well with your conference.
