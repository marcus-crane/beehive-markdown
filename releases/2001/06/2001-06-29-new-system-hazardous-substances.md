A new system for managing hazardous substances safely comes into force on Monday, the Minister for the Environment, Marian Hobbs, said today.

"The 'hazardous substances' part of the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms (HSNO) Act 1996 is a major advance in protecting people's health and the environment from the harmful effects of many substances that are essential to our daily lives," Marian Hobbs said.

"The new regime will ensure effective risk-management of hazardous substances in line with international best practice. It will cover all hazardous substances from the time they are imported or manufactured through to disposal of residues.

"One central agency, the Environmental Risk Management Authority, will now make decisions on which new hazardous substances can be introduced to New Zealand and will set controls to ensure that they are used safely. A key feature of the new system is that the public may have input into the process of assessing hazardous substances and setting controls.

"At first those who have been managing hazardous substances in accordance with the current laws will notice little change. It will be business as usual until ERMA New Zealand works through the process of transferring many thousands of existing substances to the new system. Changes in the way existing substances are controlled will take effect with this transfer," the Minister said.
