Acting Maori Affairs Minister Sandra Lee says Maori will mourn the passing of former Maori Affairs minister and Deputy Prime Minister Duncan MacIntyre.

"I offer condolences to the MacIntyre whanau on behalf of all the Maori he worked with and for during the past 40 years," Ms Lee said. "New Zealand has lost a statesman, and Maori have lost a friend."

"E te whanau pani. Kua hinga to Rangatira. Kua mahue koe me to pouri. Ki te rongo i te mahana o te iwi."

(To the bereaved family, your Rangatira has died. Even though you are left with sadness, may the warmth of the people embrace you)
