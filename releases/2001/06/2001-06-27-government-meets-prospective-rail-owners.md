Transport Minister Mark Gosche and officials today met with representatives of West Coast Railway, the prospective owners of the Tranz Scenic network.

Mr Gosche said the meeting with WCR Managing Director Don Gibson and Gary McDonald was very useful.

"The company has a very positive approach and are enthusiastic about investing in and growing the company."

"We are very keen to work with the company, and with regional government and unions, to see what can be done to provide transport alternatives on marginal routes."

The meeting was one of a series planned between the government and the company, Mr Gosche said.

"Tomorrow the Associate Minister of Transport Judith Tizard and Dunedin South MP David Benson Pope will meet with WCR and the local community in Dunedin to look at options for the future, and next week I will meet Napier Mayor Alan Dick and other local representatives in Napier on this issue."

In addition government officials would have ongoing discussions with rail representatives to assess the options in each area on a case by case basis, Mr Gosche said.
