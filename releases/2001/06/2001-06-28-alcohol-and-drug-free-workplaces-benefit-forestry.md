28 June 2001Media Statement  
Treatment Works week June 24-30

Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton is welcoming efforts to reduce alcohol and drug misuse in the forestry and wood processing industry.

A new initiative announced on yesterday is the East Coast Forestry Industry Group Alcohol and Drug Free Workplaces Charter which includes education and rehabilitation. The group is made up of key forestry companies on the East Coast.

The Charter follows work done on the Tairawhiti Development Taskforce and the Government initiated Wood Processing Industry Steering Group.

There are also union led education programmes to help workers identify their issues and support them in taking action.

"I am pleased that all parts of the wood processing industry are taking the lead on the issue of forestry workers with drug and alcohol dependency," said Jim Anderton.

"The Wood Processing Industry Steering Group has identified that worker alcohol and drug abuse is a barrier to economic growth which can be addressed.

"Workers with alcohol or drug dependency need to be encouraged to solve their problem. Industry and union support can make workplaces safer and these efforts need to be welcomed.

"The concentration on creating a safer working environment through these measures can result in fewer accidents and improved morale.

"It is appropriate that there is a Forestry Industry announcement during Treatment Works week which focusses on addressing the drain on our community and economy from alcohol and drug addiction," said Jim Anderton.
