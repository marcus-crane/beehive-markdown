June 25 2001Media Statement  
Pacific Island Road Safety Target

New Zealand's first Pacific road safety video ever made by the Pacific Island community for the Pacific Community was launched by Transport and Pacific Islands Minister Mark Gosche in Porirua today.

Our Children Our Future is designed to use in discussion groups run by community health educators and others working to reduce the Pacific Island community's road toll.

"Pacific children are 14 times as likely as other children to be injured as passengers in cars. About 289 Pacific people are hospitalised from road crashes each year. Nearly one third of casualties are children – a much higher proportion than the general population," Mr Gosche said.

The $40,000 video project grew out of a need identified by Porirua's language nests for a resource which would capture the attention of people caring for Pacific people, and act as a catalyst for discussion of road safety issues.

"The video became a reality with funding from the Land Transport Safety Authority, using money the government made available last year to enable more road safety projects to be undertaken within Maori and Pacific communities."

The video is available in Samoan or English with another five versions available with key written messages in Fijian, Niuean, Tongan, Tokelauan and Cook Islands Maori.

The Porirua City Council and the Pacific People's Health programme of regional public health have also been involved, along with the Whitireia Polytechnic Film and Television Course which provided practical support.

"Our Children Our Future is a shining example of what communities can do when empowered to act. It is a testament to the creativity and skills in Porirua's Pacific communities, to their commitment to the safety of their children and to their ability to form strong road safety partnerships," Mr Gosche concluded.
