It was too early to know how proposed safeguard action by the United States against steel product imports would affect New Zealand, Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton said today.

The United States Administration has asked its International Trade Commission (ITC) to initiate a Section 201 safeguard investigation into imports of a broad range of steel products.  
Mr Sutton said the ITC had to investigate and make recommendations, and then the United States Administration would decide how to respond to those recommendations, bearing in mind of course, the United States's obligations  
under the World Trade Organisation.

"New Zealand's concern is that we export into the United States market a variety of steel products that come within the ambit of the ITC investigation."

Mr Sutton said officials would talk to steel exporters to establish the major areas of concern and how the ITC's hearings should be handled. Steel exporters can contact the Foreign Affairs and Trade Ministry's Americas division (through 04 4948500) if they have interests in the United States market.

Mr Sutton noted that the ITC had 120 days from 22 June to announce its injury findings. During that time the ITC will hold a public hearing and receive briefs from interested parties. If the ITC found injury, it would then have 60 days to make recommendations to the President about a remedy. The President would subsequently take a decision.
