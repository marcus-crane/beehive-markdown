High quality education is critical not just for the children of New Zealand but for the social and economic wellbeing of the nation, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

New Zealand Schools - Nga Kura o Aotearoa 2000, the annual report on the schools sector was tabled in Parliament this week.

Trevor Mallard emphasised the vital role that schools play in helping all children to succeed, irrespective of their backgrounds.

"The schools sector report reflects what this Government is doing to focus clearly and effectively on the task of encouraging and supporting students to become successful and motivated learners," Trevor Mallard said.

"Last year the Government saw through important administrative changes which drives home the need for both policy and practice to concentrate on the educational progress and achievement of all students.

"This approach is underpinned by the articulation of standards, the work on literacy and assessment, and the implementation of information and communication technology strategies."

Trevor Mallard said success required getting many things right, including:

· Explicit understandings about what children could and should be expected to achieve at school;

· Students successfully participating at school and effectively engaging in learning;

· Effective monitoring of their progress, so they could be guided, challenged and supported as they went;

· Schools providing safe, stimulating and effective learning environments;

· The best possible teachers;

· Parents and families effectively supporting and encouraging their children;

· Strong relationships between schools and their families and communities.

"The report tells us about how well our students are doing and about the issues that existed in our school system in 2000," Trevor Mallard said.

"It has regard to all of the factors and influences I have mentioned, all of which are important in leading our children to success. It identifies initiatives that are being followed to raise the achievement and effective participation of all children. After all, schools are accountable to the community, and this is their report card to that community."
