There will be no cuts in Lottery funding for the agencies that foster sports, arts and film in New Zealand, Internal Affairs Minister and Lottery Grants Board Chairperson George Hawkins announced today.

This means a total allocation to the Hillary Commission for Sport Fitness and Leisure of $30.89 million while Creative New Zealand receives $21.31 million (including $1 million for the Arts Foundation) and the New Zealand Film Commission’s share is $8.801 million.

"We have managed to maintain current funding levels for these key statutory agencies by using Board reserves to top-up the Lotteries Commission’s projected profit figure for the 2001/02 financial year,” Mr Hawkins said.

The Board has also decided to maintain existing funding levels to Lottery distribution committees that have an on-going client base.

Mr Hawkins said that small reductions have been made to lottery distribution committees which fund one-off projects, but he is hopeful that the impact of those reductions will be lessened by community trusts, some of which are in a healthy financial position.

"We may see an improvement in profit levels next year with the introduction of the new state lotteries, but there are no guarantees" said Mr Hawkins. "In the meantime I am pleased that the Board has worked together to minimise the impact of reduced lottery profits on the valuable work of our community bodies."
