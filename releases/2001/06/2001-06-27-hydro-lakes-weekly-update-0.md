The latest information on hydroelectric lake levels supplied to Energy Minister Pete Hodgson shows a further slight increase in storage from modest inflows.

Mr Hodgson is getting regular information on hydro lake storage and is releasing weekly updates.

In the week to 25 June storage increased to 73 per cent of the average for the time of year. Last week it was 69 per cent. Inflow to the lakes was 67 per cent of average, compared to 78 per cent the preceding week.

Mr Hodgson said the continuing low levels of the lakes feeding the Waitaki system remained a cause for concern. Lakes Pukaki and Tekapo, which account for 60 percent of national hydro storage, remain close to their minimum levels. At 25 June Tekapo was 47 percent full, up from 45 percent last week, while Pukaki remained 50 percent full. The net increase in storage for the Waitaki system over the week was 1 percent.

Wholesale electricity have fallen from their peak of around 23c/kWh on 11 June to around 17c/kWh.

"Storage and inflows remain notably below average for this time of year and continued improvement will be necessary to bring further downward pressure on wholesale prices, " Mr Hodgson said.
