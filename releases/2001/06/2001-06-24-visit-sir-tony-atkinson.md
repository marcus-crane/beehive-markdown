Sir Tony Atkinson, Warden of Nuffield College, Oxford, begins a visit to New Zealand tomorrow to brief ministers and government officials on trends in European social policies, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Sir Tony is at the forefront of international economic research, advice and analysis of social policy in Europe and the United Kingdom. His visit to New Zealand from 25 June to 9 July is sponsored by the Ministry of Social Policy, and the Australasian Econometrics Society, with assistance from The Family Centre Social Policy Research Unit.

Mr Maharey said Sir Tony's visit provides an opportunity to talk through the progress being made by the New Zealand Government to build a more inclusive society, in relation to developments in Europe. He is scheduled to brief the Cabinet on European developments to better integrate welfare and economic policies tomorrow.

During his time in New Zealand, Sir Tony will also conduct a number of seminars for community groups, and government officials. He will give a presentation on ‘The Economy and the Welfare State’ at the Museum of New Zealand, Te Papa, to an invited audience that will also be addressed by the Prime Minister Helen Clark.

Much of Sir Tony’s work has been concerned with social policy issues in the United Kingdom and Europe. He has also written extensively on public sector economics, taxation, poverty and income distribution, and explored the relationship between a strong welfare state and economic growth.

Sir Tony is currently chairing a Group established by the Government of Belgium in conjunction with its forthcoming Presidency of the European Union. The group is preparing a report on Social Indicators as part of the process of taking forward the European Social Agenda, following the Lisbon Summit in March 2000.

Before becoming warden of Nuffield College, Sir Tony was Professor of Political Economy at the University of Cambridge and Chairman of the Suntory Toyota International Centre at the London School of Economics. He is a Fellow of the British Academy, and has been President of the Royal Economic Society, the Econometric Society, the European Economic Association, and of the International Economic Association. He is an Honorary Member of the American Economic Association.
