The Associate Minister of Justice, Margaret Wilson, says Jenny Shipley should tell Maori voters whether she agrees with Murray McCully's attack on the Maori option process.

"The Maori option is a process laid down in a law passed by a National-led government of which Murray McCully was a part. He now calls his own law 'racist', and urges the government not to spend money on telling people about their democratic rights.

"All voters are targeted by campaigns run by the Electoral Enrolment Centre. Because Maori can choose to change the type of roll they are on every five years it's important to make sure they know their rights. That's what the campaign is about.

"Murray McCully somehow thinks we'll be better off if people are not told about their democratic rights. He's wrong, and his leader has a responsibility to make her party's position clear, so that Maori voters can see just where National stands".
