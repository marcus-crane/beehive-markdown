Pacific representatives from eight regions throughout New Zealand have completed plans of action on how they will strengthen their communities and work in partnership with Government Pacific Island Affairs Minister Mark Gosche announced today.

"More than 5000 Pacific people's representatives from around the country have been involved in identifying their plans of action for the future and developing partnerships with local and central Government," he said.

"Thirty Government agencies and local Government representatives from each region then responded to these plans and I am pleased to announce that 80% of the responses can be actioned within current budget baselines."

Mr Gosche said the process had strengthened the partnership between Pacific communities and Government.

"Statistics tell us that Pacific peoples are more likely to suffer from poor health, unemployment, low-incomes, low educational achievement and substandard housing than other New Zealanders."

"This is a status quo that our communities and our country cannot afford to continue: by 2050 more than a third of all New Zealanders will be of Polynesian descent so we must act now," said Mr Gosche.

Mr Gosche accepted the first Pacific programme of action from Pacific community representatives who live in Manukau City.

Manukau's Pacific programme of action includes:

§ Increased Pacific Early Childhood Education services  
§ Strengthened links between schools and our Pacific communities  
§ A Pacific Disability Support service, with a special focus on our Pacific children  
§ A Pacific vision and hearing screening programme targeting our Pacific children  
§ More Pacific health workers  
§ Larger and more culturally appropriate housing  
§ More Pacific policemen and women  
§ Victim Support Groups which understand our Pacific victims' needs

Eight regions with the highest Pacific populations in New Zealand were chosen for the capacity building pilot, they were: Auckland City, Manukau City, North Shore, Waitakere City, Hamilton, Hutt Valley, Porirua and Christchurch.
