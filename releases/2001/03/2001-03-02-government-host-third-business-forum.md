Business leaders from several North Island regions have been invited to a forum with government ministers to identify initiatives that will help improve New Zealand's economic performance.

The forum, to be held in Hamilton on 8 March, follows on from the Auckland business-to-government forum in October and a similar event in Christchurch last month.

Prime Minister Helen Clark said the forums demonstrated the importance that the government attaches to developing and maintaining an ongoing dialogue with business to improve New Zealand's economic performance.

"The Hamilton forum continues our pragmatic efforts to work with business to identify and implement policy initiatives which will help stimulate the economy and improve further the social climate in New Zealand.

"The feedback we have had from the October and February forums indicates that business leaders appreciate the opportunity to have a say and contribute towards a better future.

"The government needs to work with producers of wealth to build a sustainably growing economy for the long term, which produces ever more sophisticated goods and services and guarantees New Zealanders high standards of living.

"This government acknowledges that there are limitations on what governments can achieve on their own. That is why we actively seek partnerships across the economic sectors and society as a whole," Helen Clark said.

The forum will be held in the Beattie Rickman Centre in Hamilton on Thursday 8 March, starting at 11.45 am.

Ministers who will be attending include Helen Clark; Jim Anderton, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Economic Development and Industry and Regional Development; Michael Cullen, Minister of Finance and Revenue; Steve Maharey, Minister of Social Services and Employment; Jim Sutton, Minister of Agriculture and Trade Negotiations; Trevor Mallard, Minister of Education and Associate Minister of Finance; Pete Hodgson, Minister of Research, Science and Technology; Margaret Wilson, Minister of Labour; Lianne Dalziel, Minister of Immigration; Mark Burton, Minister of SOEs and Tourism; Paul Swain, Minister of Commerce, Communications and Information Technology; Matt Robson, Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade; and Mark Gosche, Minister of Transport. Business leaders invited are from a range of sectors. About 100 participants are expected to attend.

Like the earlier Auckland and Christchurch forums, it will be a private function at which Chatham House rules will apply. There will be a media briefing after the forum
