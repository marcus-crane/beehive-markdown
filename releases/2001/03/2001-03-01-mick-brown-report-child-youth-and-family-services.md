Mick Brown's report on the Department of Child Youth and Family Services was right to restate the importance of the Report produced by John Rangihau and others in 1989.

"Mick Brown indicated very clearly that the Puao te Ata Tu report lead by the late John Rangihau be revisited and that some of the thoughts and ideas which were part of that report be looked at again. I totally support the sentiments expressed by Mick Brown.

"It is unfortunate that it has taken 10 years for government to recognised the signfiicance of this document. Significance which the Maori community has always kept to the forefront.

"Puao te Ata Tu has always been important to our whanau, hapu and iwi. Despite its age, and it is only a teenager, fourteen years old, it remains every bit as relevant today as it did when it was first prepared back in 1986. At that time Rangihau himself suggested to the then Minister, Dame Ann Hercus that she be 'the helmsperson, the navigator and the guide for your Maori people in a new age through and beyond the year 2000'.

"What prophetic words, here we are in the year 2001 and Puao te Ata Tu is seen again as heralding a new dawn.

"Puao te Ata Tu was prepared after full consultation with whanau, hapu and iwi before the report was written. It is one of the few policy that accurately represents whanau, hapu and iwi aspirations for their own social development.

"There are some who suggest the framework in Puao te Ata Tu can be successfully used across the social policy sector. I believe that this may well be worth considering.

"I am committed to seeing the re-implementation of Puao te Ata Tu. This is a commitment I have made to Maori social service providers, who themselves are totally committed to the re-implementation of this document," said Tariana Turia.
