Around 10,000 inquiries handled every year and still going strong.

Manurewa MP George Hawkins has offered his congratulations to the volunteer staff at the Manurewa Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB).

"This week is Citizens Advice Bureau Awareness Week. I want to pay tribute to the volunteers at the Manurewa CAB who volunteer their time to give information and advice about all sorts of problems, all of which is free," Manurewa MP George Hawkins said.

The Manurewa CAB handles about 10,000 inquiries every year.

Under the leadership of long-serving supervisor Pat Goodchild, the Manurewa CAB is a valuable resource within the local community.

"Pat and her team are a wonderful asset. The residents of Manurewa are very lucky to be able to have their advice and receive answers relating to many common issues such as legal, personal, housing and vehicle ownership queries," George Hawkins said.
