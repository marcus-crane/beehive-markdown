Regionalisation of the Department of Work and Income (DWI) will deliver more jobs in the Waikato Region and better tailor DWI's services to the region, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Mr Maharey released the 2000/2001 DWI regional plan for the Waikato Region at a function on Raungaiti Marae at Waharoa, accompanied by Waikato Regional Commissioner Katrina Ings.

Increased local flexibility was the principal recommendation of the Hunn Report ordered by the Government last year to refocus DWI and improve its services. As an initial response, each of DWI's 13 thirteen regions were asked to prepare regional plans summarising the alternate employment approaches they intend to pursue to get more beneficiaries into paid work.

Mr Maharey said the Waikato Regional plans is based on two important foundations.

"The first is that one size does not fit everybody. It is not for someone in Wellington to determine what the appropriate mix and range of services is or that services in the regions must be organised according to a standard formula. Regionalisation means finding what works best for Waikato beneficiaries and employers.

"The second principle embodied in this plan is DWI's commitment to partnership. The only way that we can find out what is going to work for a region, a community, a family or whanau, or indeed for an individual beneficiary or job-seeker, is to actively work with them.

"The new partnership involving Ngati Haua, the Department of Work and Income, the Community Employment Group of the Department of Labour, and Te Puni Kokiri is a good example of the type of approach we want to back.

"The project aims to develop the management capacity of 20-25 people of Ngati Haua Iwi, and this is linked to the return of land that is currently leased to Iwi management. Over a 2-3 year they will gain the necessary qualifications to manage Ngati Haua lands.

"The Department of Work and Income's contribution will involve:  
„h seconding a work broker to help identify the 25-30 members of the Iwi who will participate in the project;  
„h providing that all DWI clients participating are in a relationship with the one case manager; and,  
„h maximising the full range of income and work services for those on the programme," Steve Maharey said.
