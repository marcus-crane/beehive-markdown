Transport Minister Mark Gosche today announced he had appointed Suzanne Sinclair as Chairperson of the Road Safety Trust.

The Road Safety Trust funds community safety initiatives, training, education and other activities that benefit road safety. It is funded from a share of the sale of personalised number plates.

Suzanne Sinclair has a wide experience with community groups. She has served on the Auckland Housing Allocations Committee of the Housing Corporation, the Auckland Institute of Technology Council and the Auckland War Memorial Museum Council. She is a Justice of the Peace and holds the New Zealand Commemoration Medal and the Women's Suffrage Centennial Medal.

"I am pleased that a person with such an impressive background of service in the community has agreed to make her experience available in the public sector," Mr Gosche said.

"And I want to acknowledge the contribution of the retiring Chairperson, Margot Mains, for the considerable knowledge she brought to the Road Safety Trust".
