Two representatives have been appointed to the Biosecurity Council, acting Biosecurity Minister Jim Sutton said today.

The appointments of Craig Lawson and Wren Green, with their alternates of Bob Diprose and Mick Clout, were a fulfilment of Labour's pre-election promises, Mr Sutton said. Labour's manifesto said the council's membership would be expanded to include representatives of primary production industries and environmental organisations.

Mr Lawson, from the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission, is the principal primary production appointment to the council, with Mr Diprose, from the Poultry Industry Association, as his alternate. Dr Green, an environmental consultant, is the principal environmental organisation representative, with Dr Clout, from Auckland University, as his alternate.The appointments are for a term of three years.

Mr Sutton said the two new appointments would increase the council's membership to 13. The other council members are: an independent chairperson, the chief  
executives of the Department of Conservation, and the Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry, Health, Maori Development, Fisheries, the Environment, and Research, Science and Technology, or their delegates; the manager of MAF's Biosecurity Authority; the chief executive of the Environment Risk Management Authority or delegate; and a representative of the regional councils.  
The council's role is to co-ordinate strategic policy advice on biosecurity to the Government.
