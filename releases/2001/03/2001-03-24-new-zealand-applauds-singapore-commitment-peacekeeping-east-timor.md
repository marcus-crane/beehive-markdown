The Minister of Defence Mark Burton has warmly welcomed the announcement from Singapore that a 70-strong infantry combat group from the Singapore Armed Forces will join the next New Zealand Battalion in East Timor.

The infantry group will join New Zealand Battalion 4 when it deploys in May. Some of the Singaporean soldiers will train at Linton Army Camp before deployment to East Timor.

"This is an excellent development and I applaud the Singapore Government for their commitment to regional security and peace," Mark Burton said.

"On a personal level, I want to thank Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence Dr Tony Tan, and the Minister of State for Defence David Lim for their friendship and the close working relationship we have been able to develop.

"This deployment to East Timor underlines the long, strong and credible security relationship we continue to have with Singapore. As Dr Tony Tan stated when making today's announcement in Singapore:

"The Singapore Armed Forces and the New Zealand Defence Force have a longstanding and excellent working relationship, and this cooperation between us in support of maintaining peace and security in East Timor is another milestone in the development of this important relationship."

"I look forward to building further on that relationship during Dr Tan's visit to New Zealand," Mark Burton said.
