MPs from all over the country will be taking on volunteer duties over the next week as a gesture to the International Year of Volunteers.

Minister of Internal Affairs Hon George Hawkins said he is delighted more than 50 MPs are going to take part in the Volunteer challenge.

"The idea is for MPs to spend at least four hours helping out in our communities," George Hawkins said.

"Not only will this give MPs a greater appreciation of the wonderful work carried out by volunteers, but it is also hoped we will encourage other New Zealanders to follow our example."

The MPs volunteer challenge is also timed to help publicise Volunteer Awareness Week which runs from March 11 to 17.

"For example, my Cabinet colleague and karate exponent Mark Burton will be helping out at the NZ Ironman Contest while I will be doing volunteer work painting out graffiti in my Manurewa electorate.

"The challenge is meant to be "fun and meaningful" and the MPs' voluntary duties will reflect this," George Hawkins said.
