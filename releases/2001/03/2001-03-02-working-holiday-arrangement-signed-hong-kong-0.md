The arrangement to implement a Working Holiday Scheme between New Zealand and Hong Kong was signed today in Hong Kong by Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton and Hong Kong Secretary for Education and Manpower Fanny Law.

Mr Sutton, who is visiting Hong Kong briefly to discuss trade matters on his way back from Japan, said the scheme was an excellent one. "Working Holiday Schemes open the way for young people to learn about different cultures and countries during holiday travels where they can undertake limited employment and study. This will provide a channel for the expansion of links between our two economies and deepen our people-to-people links."

The Working Holiday Scheme with Hong Kong was agreed between Hong Kong's Chief Secretary Anson Chan and Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel and Foreign Affairs Minister Phil Goff, during Mrs Chan's visit to New Zealand last November.

Ms Dalziel said the arrangement was to come into force from April 1. It aimed to have 200 visas in both directions initially, with a review of the quota in two years. It will allow people between 18 and 30, without accompanying children, to visit for up to a year. During this time, working holiday makers will be allowed to take up incidental short-term employment and study for up to  
three months. Applications for working holiday visas are invited from now.

Application forms for Hong Kong visas are available directly from the Hong Kong Immigration Department. New Zealand also has working holiday schemes with Britain, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Ireland, the Netherlands, France, Italy,Germany, and Canada.
