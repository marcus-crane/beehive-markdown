Minister of Energy Pete Hodgson says he is pleased with the progress being made by the electricity industry in establishing the new governance structure required by the Government's Power Package.

Mr Hodgson released today the second report from the Electricity Governance Establishment Committee, chaired by Hon David Caygill, together with his response.

"A high level governance design has been completed and an amalgamation of the operational rules has commenced. A communication strategy is being implemented to ensure effective consultation with interested parties.

"I am pleased with progress on the key measures to be put in place to ensure that self-governance is workable in electricity. Good progress has been made to meet many of the Government's objectives. Other matters that the Government wishes to see progressed are on a work programme to be addressed after the immediate phase of work is advanced. This is encouraging, and I acknowledge the very significant effort involved for the industry.

"I have, however, taken the opportunity in my response to the Electricity Governance Establishment Committee to highlight areas on which I am interested to see more detail as work proceeds. I look forward to reviewing progress on these matters."
