Carter should come clean on 10,000 state houses  
National's housing spokesman David Carter should come clean on the 10,000 state houses he says his Government built, Housing Minister Mark Gosche said today.  
"This week Mr Carter told Television New Zealand's Breakfast Show that National built 10,000 state houses," he said.  
"The trouble is Housing New Zealand records show National sold 13,000 for profit of $1 billion - but there's no mention of the 10,000 extra houses Mr Carter says National built."  
"Where are they?," asked Mr Gosche.  
"Mr Carter should come clean and tell us where they are."
