Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey this afternoon clarified the emergency hardship assistance available to students over their summer holidays.

A statement issued today by the Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association this afternoon claimed that no financial assistance is available to students not in receipt of term-time allowances. Mr Maharey said this is inaccurate.

"The Emergency Unemployment Benefit (EUB - also known as the Community Wage Student) is available to students who do not find work over the summer.

"Students can get the EUB on two grounds:

Those full-time students who receive students allowances during term time are automatically entitled to receive the EUB. Over the past summer 35% of full-time students were eligible to receive the EUB on this basis. Students who will be receiving allowances but whose course hasn't started are also eligible.

All other students can apply for hardship assistance from the Department of Work and Income which is provided on the basis of need. Last summer 1,985 students received this assistance.

"It is important that the students are not misinformed about the availabiltity of financial assistance over the summer since this might discourage otherwise eligible students from applying," Steve Maharey said.
