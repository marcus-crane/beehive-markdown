New Zealand welcomes the decision of the Fiji Court of Appeal, which has declared that the country's interim Government is illegal and that the1997 Constitution is valid, said Foreign Minister Phil Goff. "The message from the panel of distinguished judges from around the Pacific region is clear - Fiji must return to constitutional government and the democratic process.

"I was encouraged by the statement made to the Court by the interim administration last week which said it would use its best endeavours to promote a return to constitutional legality if its appeal was dismissed," Mr Goff said. "I was also encouraged by the commitment made before and during the Court case by both military and police that they would uphold the rule of law. "It is important that extremist elements not be allowed again to use violence to undermine democracy and the rule of law," Mr Goff said.

The Minister has had a letter delivered to interim Prime Minister Qarase encouraging his administration to comply with the decision of the Court, so that Fiji returns to constitutional government without delay. "I have expressed to Mr Qarase that if the Courts' ruling is acted on, I am confident Fiji will once again take its rightful place in the Commonwealth family of nations. New Zealand would be willing to provide whatever assistance we could to help facilitate an early return to democracy.

"If the interim administration responds positively to the decision of the Court of Appeal, New Zealand will re-examine the sanctions we have in place. However, before the Government does this there must be clear evidence of steps to return the country to democracy," said Mr Goff.
