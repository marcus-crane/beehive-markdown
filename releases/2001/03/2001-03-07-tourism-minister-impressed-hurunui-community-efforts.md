The Minister of Tourism Mark Burton has applauded local efforts to encourage sustainable tourism growth in the Hurunui district.

Mark Burton spent Wednesday in the Hurunui, opening the new Hurunui Academy for Tourism and Rural Studies in Culverden, and meeting with the Hanmer Forest Recreation Liaison Group and the Hanmer Springs Business Association.

The Minister is staying overnight at the Heritage Hotel in Hanmer.

"I have travelled a lot around New Zealand since becoming Minister of Tourism," Mark Burton said. "This government strongly believes in a partnership approach and I have made it a priority to see first hand the community based efforts to develop regional and local economies.

"The Academy is an outstanding example. The concept, I understand, came from a local examination of two important issues that occur in rural areas – the loss of young people to cities and the shortage of a suitably trained labour force for local industries. In Hurunui, these industries were identified as tourism and dairy farming, and so these were adopted as the focus of the Academy.

"The people of Hurunui have a world-class thermal attraction and a valuable range of other activities and hospitality services in their region," Mark Burton said.

"Now, with the establishment of the Academy, the community is investing in ensuring mutually beneficial outcomes – jobs and increased skills for the local people and trained local staff for the tourism sector. A healthier community is the result."
