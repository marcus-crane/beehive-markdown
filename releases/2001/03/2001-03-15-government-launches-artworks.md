A new programme which prepares young people for careers in the digitial arts industry was launched today at Auckland's Moving Image Centre by Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey.

Moving Image Centre is one of a number of arts organisations which are to establish the Government's Artworks scheme. Artworks creates real paying jobs in the creative industries by supporting new and established businesses. The programme offers the creative industries an opportunity to showcase the employment poential of the sector:  
by providing arts related workers the oppportunity to get real paying jobs in the sector;

by increasing the level of artistic and business-related skills in the sector;

by investing in the strength of arts organisations so that they can offer real paying sustainable jobs; and,

by increasing the profile of the creative sector and its economic potential.

"We are very keen to give young and emerging artists the skills they will need to develop sustainable careers in the creative sector.

"The Moving Image Centre is an excellent example of the type of organisation which Artsworks is designed to support. It sits at the cutting edge of the digital arts industry and is an excellent learning environment. CEG will help with business planning, the development of new curatorial training opportunities and marketing.

"In short, the Government is backing businesses in the creative sector to ensure they have a long-term sustainable future and can offer real paying jobs for designers, other artists and a wide range other support staff positions.

"The arts and arts based organisations do provide viable avenues to employment. The Government's Artworks programme bridges the gap," Steve Maharey said.

Other arts organisations contracted by CEG to date to develop Artworks programmes include the Cleveland Living Arts Centre and the Dunedin City Council (Dunedin), Toi Mana Art Gallery and Blah Blah Entertainment Trust (Christchurch), Pablos Arts Studio and Arts Access Aotearoa (Wellington), Exhibit Art and Craft Collective and Korou Kore Marae (Northland).
