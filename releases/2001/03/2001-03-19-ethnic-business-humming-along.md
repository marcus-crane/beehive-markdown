Minister for Ethnic Affairs Hon George Hawkins said steady economic growth, lower unemployment and strong consumer confidence is benefiting Chinese business-people.

Continuing his tour of Ethnic businesses, George Hawkins was impressed with the determination of small business leaders to participate in the stronger economy that is growing under the Labour and Alliance Government.

"Our Ethnic community is getting on with the business of doing business. People are working hard and making a profit," George Hawkins said.

The tour of Ethnic businesses continued with George Hawkins visiting a panel beating shop, a computer network service provider firm and manufacturer of commercial and household cleaning products.

The three businesses are owned and operated by Chinese New Zealanders and based in Mt Roskill, Auckland.

"We can see first-hand the determination of both employers and employees to make a go of things in a competitive workplace environment.

"Ethnic businesspeople are hardworking, dedicated, energetic and committed to sustaining profitable businesses in this country.

"I am pleased that the Chinese businesspeople I have spoken to are supportive of the co-operative relationship that the Government is developing with small businesses within the community," George Hawkins said.
