Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton in Whakatane today for a regional development visit inspected some revolutionary kiwi software that allows people to create their own TV schedule by retrieving selected television programmes from the internet.

He was offered the opportunity to see a schedule of rugby games over the next week that he would like to have the time to see.

The software is the product of an innovative NZ development company Ownguide.tv.

"New Zealanders are highly innovative. Ownguide.tv is another excellent example of this," said Jim Anderton.

"The good news is that New Zealand regions can compete with cities any where in the world thanks to the internet and electronic networks," said Jim Anderton.

The company and software have attracted international interest.

"New Zealanders with limited resources can design and create technology breakthroughs that large international workshops haven't even thought of," said Jim Anderton.

Jim Anderton said that Ownguide.tv hopes to have fifty New Zealand staff by the end of next year, as well as having offices overseas.

The service is free to users and the company has already signed agreements with major TV networks including Sky TV.

"I welcome new jobs being created through Kiwi innovation," said Jim Anderton.
