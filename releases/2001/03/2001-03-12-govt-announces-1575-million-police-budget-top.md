Minister of Police Hon George Hawkins has announced that the Government has provided Police with an extra $15.75 million (GST inc).

Some of the additional funding will be used to meet the December 2000 wage round settlement.

"This extra funding ensures additional training of Police recruits continues and also manages the Police baseline," George Hawkins said.

The package also provides Police with the necessary additional funding to purchase high quality forensic services from ESR. This will increase crime resolution and improve efficiency in investigation.

"While the Government is providing this additional money, I have insisted that tax payers' money be used wisely," George Hawkins said.

"The $15.75 million package demonstrates the Government's commitment to ensuring the Police continue to produce results in reducing recorded crime and resolving higher percentages of crimes.

"This funding is on top of the $86 million extra funded since the Labour/Alliance Government came into office. That totals over $100 million extra for Vote Police since the Labour/Alliance Government came into office," George Hawkins said.

"Contrast this to the National-led government. Bill Birch created the Police review that was designed to slash $50 million from the Police budget. Add to this how Bill English, as Finance Minister in 1999, said in Parliamentary questions, that he planned to cut $24 million off the Police budget in year 2000.

"If National got back in at the last election the police would be bankrupt by now," George Hawkins said.

"The Labour/Alliance Government inherited the legacy of that cut-and-be-damned administration. We also inherited a Police organisation suffering the fallout effects of INCIS and all the excesses that that brain-drained idea caused.

"This Government is results orientated and is committed to ensuring that the Police organisation is focussed on its core purpose, and is provided the appropriate resources necessary to reduce crime and crack down on criminal offending.

"The additional $15.75 million funding package demonstrates this Government's commitment in the battle against crime," George Hawkins said.
