Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey is applauding a new training programme for New Zealanders working in the hospitality industry which was launched in Auckland this afternoon.

Mr Maharey formally opened the new Académie Accor which joins four similar training schools in Australia. The Académie provides hospitality training for employees of the Accor Group of companies, the largest accommodation and hotel group in the world and owners of the Novotel, Ibis, Mercure and Sofitel hotels and the Eurest catering franchise.

The Académie has been developed in conjunction with the Hospitality Standards Institute and its qualifications and programmes will be accepted on both sides of the Tasman. All training materials, workbooks and assessments have been developed to match both Australian and New Zealand National Qualifications

Mr Maharey said it is important that New Zealand-earned qualifications have portability across the Tasman.

"The relationship between Australia and New Zealand has been very much in the news recently, and some would suggest that we no longer have the degree of integration and indeed cooperation in terms of labour market and vocational education and training issues.

"The opening of the Académie Accor suggests otherwise.

"In December 2000 four academies were opened in Australia, and I understand that those involved with this initiative have worked closely with the Australian Académie and the Australian National Training Authority (ANTA) to ensure consistency in programmes and qualifications on both sides of the Tasman".

Mr Maharey said that the Academie Accor initiative was an excellent example of the kinds of initiatives foreshadowed in the consultation paper on future policy options for industry training released earlier in the week.

"The opening of the Académie Accor gives me a clear sense of the potential that remains to be realised in so many other industries.

"The Government released a discussion paper on industry training yesterday which is about realising that potential.

"Having a highly skilled workforce, capable of continuously learning and acquiring new skills, is key to increasing economic prosperity and social cohesion. People’s knowledge and skills shape our economic prosperity, and play a large part in determining our income as a nation, and the incomes of the individuals, families, and firms within our national economy and society," Steve Maharey said.
