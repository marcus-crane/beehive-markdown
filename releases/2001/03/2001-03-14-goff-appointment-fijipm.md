Foreign Minister Phil Goff commented this evening on the appointment of Ratu Tevita Momoedonu by acting President Iloilo as Prime Minister of Fiji. "This makes it clear that acting President Iloilo has accepted the resignation of interim Prime Minister Qarase and his interim administration. This is in line with the decision of the Court of Appeal which ruled that the Quarase administration was illegal," said Mr Goff.

"The most constitutional stance would be the reconvening of Parliament and for Parliament itself to choose who should be Prime Minister. "New Zealand will watch closely over the next few days to see whether today's appointment is followed by progress along the constitutional path towards the restoration of democratic government in Fiji," said Mr Goff
