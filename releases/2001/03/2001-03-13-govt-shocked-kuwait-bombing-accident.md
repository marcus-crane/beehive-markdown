Prime Minister Helen Clark and Defence Minister Mark Burton today conveyed their sympathy to the families of a New Zealand military liaison officer and the Americans killed during a training exercise in Kuwait.

"Our immediate thoughts are with the parents of the New Zealand Army Major John McNutt, and his colleagues in the New Zealand Defence Force.

"This is a terrible accident and the New Zealand government is certainly expecting an urgent explanation as to how a large bomb was dropped in an area of a training range where observers were based.

"We are shocked that a training exercise could go so horribly wrong.

"This tragedy reminds us that deployment of New Zealand defence personnel overseas is never without risk," Helen Clark and Mark Burton said.
