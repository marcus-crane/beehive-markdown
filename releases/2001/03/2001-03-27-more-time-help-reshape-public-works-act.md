New Zealanders have an extra two months to have their say on the review of the Public Works Act, says Minister for Land Information, Matt Robson.

The deadline for Review submissions has been extended following requests made at hui and public meetings around the country.

The public now has until 31 May to make a submission on the public issues and options discussion paper.

"Over the past couple of months we’ve conducted extensive public consultation on the review. Some of the key discussions have evoked exactly the sort of vigorous debate we hoped for," says Matt Robson.

"But it's clear that, in view of the significance of the Public Works Act, people want more time to digest the issues and have their say. So we’ve responded by extending the submission deadline."

The Public Works Act has provided the legislative backbone to New Zealand’s infrastructure.

It has enabled land to be acquired, either by agreement or by compulsion, for the construction of roads, airports and railways, hospitals and schools, water and electricity supplies.

"A comprehensive review is overdue because New Zealand has undergone significant economic and state sector reform since the current legislation came into force. Many of the provisions date back to late 19th and early 20th century, so they need to be scrutinised to see whether they are still relevant and required," says Matt Robson.

"Also, the growing importance of the Treaty of Waitangi has put the Crown’s land-related activities under greater scrutiny.”

After 31 May all on-line, written and oral submissions will be analysed and will inform the policy options to be presented to the Cabinet.  
The review is likely to take until 2002 when the Government is expected to introduce a Bill to Parliament.
