Northland will benefit from new skilled jobs and increased export earnings with the opening of Carter Holt Harvey's new log processing mill near Whangarei, Prime Minister Helen Clark said today.

The Prime Minister today officially opened Carter Holt Harvey's new laminated veneer lumber plant at Marsden Point.

"The jobs and economic activity which flow from this initiative are good for Northland," Helen Clark said.

"New Zealand urgently needs new investment in wood processing. This country has a reputation as an exporter of logs. But our economy benefits more if the wood products we export are first processed into value added goods.

"Over the next decade, the amount of wood available for milling and export will increase significantly as New Zealand's commercial forests reach maturity. The government is committed to working alongside industry and regional New Zealand to spark more investment in wood processing.

"The government, in consultation with industry, is currently developing a Wood Processing Strategy. Eleven government agencies are involved. lnfrastructure deficiencies will need to be corrected to ensure that regions have adequate roading to be able to cope with the increased forestry traffic.

"Another issue we are investigating is how to overcome workforce skills shortages. The government and industry are looking at what must be done to build up the skill base.

"More investment in wood processing industry presents new opportunities for areas like Northland, and also the central North Island, the East Coast and Eastern Bay of Plenty. The potential for growth in semi-skilled and skilled jobs for these regions is immense and the government is working with industry to ensure we maximise the opportunity," Helen Clark said.
