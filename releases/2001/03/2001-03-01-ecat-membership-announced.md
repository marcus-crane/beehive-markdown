Information Technology Minister Paul Swain today announced the membership of the government's core E-Commerce Action Team - or ECAT.

"ECAT is one of the initiatives the government promised when we launched our E-commerce Strategy late last year," Paul Swain said.

"ECAT will be a partnership between government, business and the broader community and will provide support for the government's e-commerce strategy.

"ECAT will have two principal roles; helping to advance the government's e-commerce strategy, and encouraging and promoting the adoption of e-commerce within the private sector.

"It will have a key role in promoting the uptake of e-commerce across sector and industry groups, and regions. So in choosing members I've looked for organisations which can have a multiplier effect across the economy, and individuals with a strong and practical understanding of e-commerce.

"I am delighted that we were able to attract such a high calibre of people to the core membership of ECAT.

"I want the ECAT core group to be a catalyst for the development of an ECAT network and web site.

"Such a network, powered by the Internet, will be a way for champions of e-commerce to link together to share ideas, information and resources.

"The ECAT network will be open to all groups who want to get their members on board with e-commerce. I hope to announce the make up of that network shortly.

"The E-Commerce Action Team will hold its first meeting on 6 March in Wellington," Paul Swain said.
