The Associate Minister of Justice, Margaret Wilson has announced the appointment of Bruce Slane as temporary Race Relations Conciliator.

The appointment follows the end of Dr Rajen Prasad's five-year term.

Ms Wilson said a temporary appointment was being made to allow time to complete a permanent appointment to the position. Mr Slane's appointment is until mid-April.

"There are a number of well-qualified people who have expressed an interest in the position. Although the government has been considering changes to the structure of Human Rights Institutions, race relations conciliation will continue to be a critically important function".

Bruce Slane practised as a barrister and solicitor in Auckland in the firm of Cairns Slane. He is a former President of the New Zealand Law Society (1982-85) and was the first and only Chairman of the New Zealand Broadcasting Tribunal (1977-90).

He is the first Privacy Commissioner appointed under the Privacy Act 1993. He has held office since April 1992.
