"In recent years, Russell Crowe's talents have become increasingly recognised and he is regarded as one of the finest film actors in the world.

"Winning the Oscar for Best Actor for his role in The Gladiator cements his position and is just reward for many years of work. He was considered unlucky to miss out last year for his role as the tobacco industry whistle-blower in The Insider.

"The Academy Awards have seen a number of New Zealand winners in recent years, with the likes of Anna Paquin and Jane Campion.

"This award is further illustration of the burgeoning film industry in New Zealand, and of the sheer quality of New Zealand's creative talent," Helen Clark said.
