Improving care and protection services for children through Child, Youth and Family is a Government priority, the Minister for Social Services and Employment Steve Maharey said today.

“Children who come into or need State care and support deserve and will get effective help,” said Mr Maharey.

Mr Maharey was commenting on the release today of the Government response to the report by former Principal Youth Court Judge Mick Brown on his reviews of Child, Youth and Family procedures, Care and Protection is about Adult Behaviour: The Ministerial Review of the Department of Child, Youth and Family Services (the Brown Report).

“This is a searching and thought provoking report into the Department and the extreme and diverse pressures it works under. The Government has accepted the thrust of the report 's recommendations and is now working to implement the recommendations.them.

“Child, Youth and Family social workers deal with some of the most difficult and at times heart-rending cases that can be imagined. However that is all the more reason for us to ensure the Department has the professionalism and support that it requires.

“There is a huge amount to be done in a wide range of areas. Mick Brown’s report provides a clear platform and direction for change.”

The report includes 57 recommendations ranging from the very specific to the very general. Overall they suggest two interconnected approaches for bringing about needed change - increased resources from the Government and changes to the culture and operation of the Department (see attached ‘Key points of the Government Response’).

Mr Maharey said the Government has agreed to five areas of immediate action to improve the Department’s performance:

the development of a blueprint for the whole care and protection sector;  
care management;

organisational performance and capability;  
organisational change to support the Department’s performance; and,  
staff training and development.

Work on the development of the blueprint for the care and protection sector, including devolution of the non-statutory functions of Child, Youth and Family and responsiveness to Maori is already underway.

The Department is in the process of finalising a detailed action plan to implement all the Brown report recommendation. As implementation of key recommendations in the report is largely dependent on 2001 Budget decisions this plan will not be publicly available until the Budget has been presented.

“As a Government we are committed to a continuing improvement in social services. The Department’s funding will be reviewed annually, taking into account the external pressures that influence demand for its services.

“This year the Government has already made a clear commitment in the Budget Policy Statement to invest in Child, Youth and Family this year so that the Department is able to provide effective service to children and families. Initiatives in this area are well advanced and will be announced when Budget decisions have been made.”

Child, Youth and Family has been working this year on a number of areas to improve its capability, and to reduce the number of unallocated cases in line with the Brown report recommendations.

These include appointing 38 practice managers to provide professional leadership, re-directing existing resources to those areas in greatest need, and working with voluntary sector agencies to establish a more collaborative approach to the management of cases that do not require a statutory response.

Last year the Government invested significant new funds into Child, Youth and Family to build its capacity. New initiatives included:  
an additional $36million boost to the Department's budget baseline to give it long term financial security and to reverse the precarious financial situation it had been left in the previous Government;

funding for an additional 22 social workers;

work to introduce a system of professional registration for social workers to ensure safe practice in the social work occupation, protect the public from poor social work practice, and maintain high levels of professionalism and accountability in the social work occupation;

a $5.4m injection to enable the Department to purchase additional care for at-risk children;  
and,  
a $2.25m package to contract community organisations to run family violence prevention public education programmes.

“The Government's goal through these short and long-term actions is that,, together with community support, Child, Youth and Family will build the public credibility it deserves to carry out its vital work for those children most in need of our care and protection,” Steve Maharey said.
