Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that the best projection for the timing of re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere of the Russian space station, Mir, is 6.20 am on Thursday.

"The re-entry, however, could be as early as Wednesday and as late as Friday," Helen Clark said.

"Predictions cannot be precise because of the uncertainty of atmospheric conditions."

The Prime Minister said that the Russians had endeavoured to find the most remote place on Earth for the splashdown. The target location is 4000 kilometres east of Stewart Island.

"The satellite re-entry committee will be meeting again on Monday to update officials on the situation.

"New Zealand embassy staff in Moscow are interacting closely with Russian officials and have been invited to the control centre there to follow events.

"Warnings are being issued to planes and sea craft to avoid the re-entry area," Helen Clark said.
