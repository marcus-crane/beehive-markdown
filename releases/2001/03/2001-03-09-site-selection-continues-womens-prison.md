One of the sites on the shortlist for the new Auckland Regional Women's Prison is now unavailable, says Minister of Corrections Matt Robson.

The Department Of Corrections confirmed today that the Price Road site is unavailable, as the vendor is negotiating with another buyer.

Analysis continues of the other site on the shortlist, Roscommon Road.

"Until that analysis is complete and the Department reports to me, I am in no position to decide whether or not to seek a designation for the site under the Resource Management Act," says Matt Robson.

"The site selection process is about finding the best possible site in consultation with the public.

"As I have always said, I will not make any decision until I have all the facts and submissions before me. The analysis of Roscommon Road is not yet complete, so I cannot make a decision on its suitability.

"I would follow the same process whether there was one site or multiple sites on the shortlist."

Matt Robson expects to be able to make a decision on the site for the women's prison by the end of March.
