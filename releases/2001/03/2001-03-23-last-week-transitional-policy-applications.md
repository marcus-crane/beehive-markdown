Overstayers have until 5pm Friday, March 30th, to legalise their stay in New Zealand under the Government's Transitional Policy, Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel said today.

After that time, overstayers will be asked to leave New Zealand or they will be removed.

"Time is critical now for people who haven't done anything to legalise their status, to do something about it," Lianne Dalziel said.

"People who qualify - including well-settled overstayers, who have been in New Zealand for at least five years, OR who have a New Zealand spouse, OR a New Zealand-born child - need to apply now if they haven't done so already.

"For those who have been unable to lodge their applications because they are awaiting an overseas Police Clearance or who do not have their passport, they need to contact the Immigration Service now.

"I am pleased to note that more than 3,500 people have applied to date, but those who do not qualify should leave the country immediately.

"Anyone who does not qualify under Transitional Policy and who has overstayed their visa or permit, will incur a five-year ban from re-entering New Zealand if they are removed.

"This Policy has been the Labour-Alliance Government's humanitarian response to long outstanding issues surrounding long-term overstayers," Lianne Dalziel said.
