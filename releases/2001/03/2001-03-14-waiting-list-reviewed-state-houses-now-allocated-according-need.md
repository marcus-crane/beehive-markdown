Under the Social Allocation System the existing waiting list for state houses is being reviewed to make sure applicants still wish to be on it, Housing Minister Mark Gosche announced today.

"All state houses are now allocated on need - this was not the case under the previous Government. People on the old waiting list - the majority of whom had applied under the previous Government's system - now need to know this and to decide whether they still wish to remain on the list," he said.

"All applicants need to understand that state houses are now allocated first to those at risk and in serious housing need."

"Already since the Government's new social allocation system was introduced in December, 2000 around 2,500 families with urgent housing needs have been housed in a Housing New Zealand property."

The new social allocation system means that the waiting list is actively reviewed. The process of reviewing applications on the waiting list received prior to 1 December, 2000 is expected to be completed by the end of April, 2001.

Since last December, applicants on the old waiting list have been contacted and asked if they wish to remain on the waiting list and be assessed under the new social allocation system. If they do not respond within a specified time frame their applications will cease. However tenants have the opportunity to reapply at any time.

As a result the waiting list has declined due to a number of applicants from the old waiting list either: indicating they no longer required housing; or are unable to be contacted. The waiting list has also declined due to applicants being housed.

As at 28 February, 2001 the Housing New Zealand waiting list had 9,058 applicants.
