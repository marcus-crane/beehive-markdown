Prime Minister Helen Clark today presented the newly-created East Timor Medal to New Zealanders from a range of organisations who have served in East Timor.

"This new medal will recognise the outstanding contribution made by many New Zealanders, in both a civilian and military capacity, to the reconstruction of East Timor since June 1999.

"New Zealand personnel in Timor have worked in arduous and dangerous situations, separated for months at a time from their friends and families. The East Timor Medal is a small but significant measure of thanks from the New Zealand Government for their work on behalf of the world's newest nation.

"Initially the East Timor Medal will be awarded to just over 2000 personnel from the New Zealand Defence Force, and nearly 100 from the New Zealand Police, New Zealand Customs Service, Department of Corrections, New Zealand Fire Service, Te Puni Kokiri, and United Nations volunteers and contractors.

"I congratulate today's recipients. They are: Dr Andrew Ladley (civilian legal adviser), Brigadier Martyn Dunne (New Zealand Army), Able Electronic Warfareman Greg Gatley (Royal New Zealand Navy), Lance Corporal Alphoncisse Pryor (New Zealand Army), Flight Lieutenant Heather Peart (Royal New Zealand Air Force), Constable Lance Rollo (New Zealand Police), Mrs Keely Chitty (New Zealand Customs Service) and Mr Mel Tihore (Department of Corrections).

"There will be ongoing awards to those who become eligible."

Helen Clark said that the new medals arrived in New Zealand recently and arrangements are being made for them to be engraved with the other recipients' names before being awarded.

The medal, designed by Herald of Arms Phillip O'Shea, is struck in silvered metal and bears an effigy of he Queen within the inscription "Elizabeth II Queen of New Zealand".

The reverse bears a representation of the head of a kiwi overshadowing a map of East Timor with below the words "East Timor". In the top right of the field is a sprig of olive leaves, the symbol of peace.

The ribbon consists of a wide central green stripe with red, black and white stripes either side. The colours are those of New Zealand (black and white) and East Timor (green and red).
