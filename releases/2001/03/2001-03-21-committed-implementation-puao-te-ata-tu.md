I am absolutely committed to seeing the implementation of Puao te Ata Tu says Social Services and Employment and Maori Affairs Associate Minister Tariana Turia today.

In response to a queston in the House today by opposition social services spokesperson Bob Simcock to the Minister of Social Services and Employment Hon Steve Maharey.

"Whanau, hapu and iwi have never waivered from the principles, ideals and recommendations of Puao te Ata Tu.

"It is recognised in academic circles as perhaps the most complete social policy document which truly reflected the beliefs ,values and aspirations of Maori people.

"It is probably for that reason that this social policy document has never been forgotten.

"It is a model created by the previous Labour government which all governments would do well to replicate. It was a bottom-up policy document. This coalition government again embraces bottom-up solutions.

"I believe that thinking, caring people will again support the implementation of Puao te Ata Tu. It is as relevant today as the day it was written.

"As Retired Youth Court Judge Mick Brown has recently stated 'failure to run with the constructive vision of Puao te Ata Tu is a sad indictment on all those involved', ' Tariana Turia said.
