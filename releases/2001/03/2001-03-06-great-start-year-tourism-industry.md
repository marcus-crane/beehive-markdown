The Minister of Tourism Mark Burton says the latest international visitor arrival figures illustrate that the tourism boom is continuing.

Figures from Statistics New Zealand show that almost 198,000 visitors arrived in New Zealand in January, a substantial increase of 17 percent on the previous January.

"It's a great way to start the year," Mark Burton said.

"Last year international arrivals contributed an estimated $4.7 billion to the New Zealand economy – an increase of $837 million on the year before.

"The January figures indicate that we can expect an even stronger performance in 2001.

"The mood in the industry is very positive and I am pleased with the enthusiastic involvement of tourism operators in the current development of a New Zealand Tourism Strategy," Mark Burton said.

The New Zealand Tourism Strategy is a joint project between the Government and private sector interests. The first draft of the Strategy document is due to be completed by the end of the month.
