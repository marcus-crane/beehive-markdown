Minister of Police Hon George Hawkins announced today a $13.2 million (GST exclusive) new Police vehicle package.

This $13.2 million package will enable the Police to purchase approximately 404 new six-cylinder vehicles. The new Police vehicles will be fitted out as LPG duel-fuel vehicles.

"It is important that frontline Police officers are equipped with reliable vehicles that are suitable to the urgent nature of frontline operations," George Hawkins said.

"This latest package demonstrates the Government's commitment to ensuring Police are provided with the tools and equipment required to continue successes in cracking down on criminals.

"During this current financial year, the Government has already provided Police with $4.3 million to purchase125 new Police vehicles.

"Today's announced $13.2 million package will purchase around 404 new Police vehicles. That's a total of 529 Police vehicles this year alone. This is on top of the 83 leased Highway Patrol vehicles already acquired. More Highway Patrol vehicles are due this year.

"Now that shows a Government that is committed to providing for its frontline Police officers," George Hawkins said.

The past National government ran down the Police vehicle fleet:  
· In 1996/97 financial year National purchased just 140 Police vehicles.  
· In 1997/98 financial year National purchased just 188 Police vehicles.

"During 1996/97 and 1997/98 financial years National carved into the Police vehicle budget, slicing it to a third of what it was during the 1994-1995 period. Consequently, the Police vehicle fleet aged," George Hawkins said.

"National then poured money into INCIS, its grandiose pipe dream. National clawed away at resources that should have been spent on providing Police with essential equipment like Police vehicles.

"National's latest Police spokesperson Tony Ryall was on the team that drove the INCIS project. Tony Ryall ought to explain why he sat-silent while millions of dollars were drained from frontline policing.

"This Labour Alliance Government is committed to re-equipping the Police to ensure it continues to improve and produce results.

"National's Tony Ryall should explain why his party neglected the Police vehicle fleet," George Hawkins said.
