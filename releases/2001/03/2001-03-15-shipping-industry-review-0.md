The report of the Shipping Industry Review was released today by the Minister of Transport Mark Gosche.

Mr Gosche welcomed the report which made recommendations to Government on what could be done to increase New Zealand's participation in shipping and maritime services.

"The review team made a thorough investigation of the New Zealand shipping industry and consulted closely with representatives from various sectors of the industry, including ship owners, shippers, manufacturers and unions. Over eighty submissions were made to the review, which is an indication of the high level of interest shown by many interested parties."

The recommendations made in the review team's report cover the following areas:

· Special tax arrangements;  
· Better use of current maritime training institutions;  
· A closer partnership between the shipping industry and the Royal New Zealand Navy;  
· A Commerce Commission investigation into alleged monopoly pricing by ports;  
· Taking advantage of potential benefits to the industry from 'hubbing';  
· Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations and coastal shipping opportunities;  
· Minimising the compliance costs of regulations on shipping;  
· Ratifying International Labour Organisation conventions on shipping; and  
· Improved collection and reporting of shipping and cargo related statistics.

The review team's recommendations will now be considered by a special Ministerial Committee. The committee will be chaired by Mr Gosche, the membership list is as follows: Prime Minister Helen Clark; Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton; Finance Minister Dr Michael Cullen; Associate Education Minister Steve Maharey; Minister of Trade Negotiations Jim Sutton; Labour Minister Margaret Wilson; Defence Minister Mark Burton; Commerce Minister Paul Swain; Statistics Minister Laila Harre; and Associate Transport Minister Judith Tizard.

The review team was chaired by Mr Ian Mackay, a former Chair of the Maritime Safety Authority, and included five other members representing a broad cross-section of the shipping industry:

· Mr Rod Grout (President NZ Shipping Federation, Managing Director Pacifica Shipping Ltd);  
· Mr Dave Morgan (National President NZ Seafarers' Union);  
· Mr Trevor Smith (Chairman NZ Shippers Council);  
· Captain John Deeney (practising master mariner); and  
· Graham Cleghorn (Board member of NZ Manufacturers Federation).

"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Chair and each of the individuals on the review team for their important contributions and for their effort and hard work in producing the report in such a short period of time."
