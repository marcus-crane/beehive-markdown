The Minister of Local Government Hon Sandra Lee has welcomed the election of a new Mayor and councillors for the Rodney District Council, almost a year after she replaced the previous councillors with a Commissioner.

"The people of Rodney have chosen their elected representatives, and I wish them all well for the future," Ms Lee said.
