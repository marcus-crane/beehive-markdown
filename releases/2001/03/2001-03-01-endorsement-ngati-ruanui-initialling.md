The Minister of Maori Affairs the Hon Parekura Horomia paid special tribute to Ngati Ruanui and to his colleague the Hon Margaret Wilson at the initialling of the deed of settlement for Ngati Ruanui. Mr Horomia said negotiations are often not an easy task and must be undertaken with goodwill on both sides. "It is also important to ensure that people behind the negotiations are always kept informed. Unanimous support at any one time is unlikely so there must always be the opportunity for those who don't agree to change their minds and come on board later." The deed of settlement will now be taken back to the wider whanau of Ngati Ruanui who must endorse the settlement before it goes any further. The Minister of Maori Affairs looks forward to the settlement of the claim, which will then release resources for Ngati Ruanui to continue with its plans for the future development of its people.
