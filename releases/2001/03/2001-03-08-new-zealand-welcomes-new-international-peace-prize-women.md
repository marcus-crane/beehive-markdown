Acting Women's Affairs Minister Sandra Lee says New Zealand welcomes the launch of the Millennium Peace Prize for Women, the first award of its kind to honour women for peace-building, to mark International Women's Day today.

The Millennium Peace Prize was developed jointly by the United Nations Development Fund for Women, UNIFEM, and the London-based International Alert organisation, with six prizes to be presented in New York later today. Prime Minister Helen Clark was co-chair of the international judging panel.

"It is highly appropriate that one of the inaugural prizes will be presented to the Leitana Nehan Women's Development Agency for the community building work it has carried out on war-torn Bougainville, where New Zealand peacekeepers have served with distinction," Ms Lee said. "Women in our region are getting long overdue recognition for making a difference in helping to resolve conflicts".

Ms Lee said $100,000 of New Zealand official development assistance had supported Leitana Nehan directly and through Oxfam during the past three years. Additional New Zealand funding had been allocated towards the Director Helen Hakina's travel expenses so she could attend today's New York presentation.

In 1992, Leitana Nehan began programmes, under the slogan 'Women Weaving Bougainville Together', to rebuild the trust that had eroded between neighbours and communities who supported opposing sides during the conflict.

Ms Lee said the Agency had since built up a strong volunteer network, initiating anti-violence workshops focussing on domestic violence and helping boys and young men to see that the guns and violence of their childhood were not a necessary part of their futures. It also supported small income generating projects to enable many women to provide for the basic needs of their families, and to prepare them if required to serve as the head of their households.

Other Millennium Peace Prizes would be presented later today to individuals or representatives of groups from Kosovo, Pakistan, Colombia and Rwanda.

"UNIFEM focuses on areas of strong interest to women everywhere such as strengthening the economic capacity of women and promoting women's rights and the elimination of violence against them", Ms Lee said.

"UNIFEM is also concerned to ensure that women do not bear the brunt of the negative effects of globalisation such as poverty, the impact of conflict, and international trafficking in girls and women."

"While New Zealand is not a developing nation targeted by UNIFEM, as one of the Associate Ministers of Maori Affairs, I am naturally supportive of any organisation that provides positive models for empowering women, and Maori women in particular," she said.

Ms Lee said International Women's Day, which celebrated women and their struggle for equal rights, was originally observed to commemorate a strike by women workers in New York City garment and textile factories on 8 March 1857.

The United Nations designated 8 March as International Women's Day during International Women's Year, in 1975.
