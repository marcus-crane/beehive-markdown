The Minister of Tourism Mark Burton said today that he expects to receive a copy of the draft New Zealand Tourism Strategy by Easter.

The Tourism Strategy Group, with representatives from the tourism industry, local and central government, Maori and conservation, has been developing a draft 10-year strategy for sustainable tourism development.

"The Strategy Group has consulted widely, and has attempted to balance the demands of tourists, the needs of the industry, the environment, the views of the general public and role of the government," Mark Burton said.

"I have been advised they wish to take another couple of weeks to finish the draft document.

"The Tourism Strategy Group set out to deliver a plan for collaborative, positive action, and I look forward to seeing the results of their endeavours", Mark Burton said.
