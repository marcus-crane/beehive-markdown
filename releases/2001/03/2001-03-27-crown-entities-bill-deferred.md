State Services Minister Trevor Mallard and Associate State Services Minister Margaret Wilson announced today that the preparation and introduction of the Crown Entities Bill has been deferred.

The Ministers said the Government wanted to first consider ways to improve State sector performance and responses to the State Sector Standards Board report.

Cabinet will be considering a report on improving performance, by the Minister of State Services, later this year.

“After the Commission has reported back, the Government will consider the need for legislation,” the Ministers said.

“There are a number of policies that this Government has approved relating to all Crown entities that organisations will comply with, regardless of legislation. This includes the disclosure of remuneration over $100,000 in annual reports and consulting the State Services Commissioner on chief executive contracts and board fees.

“It means the situation regarding Crown entities is much clearer than it was two years ago.”

Ms Wilson will be writing to Crown entities about the deferral of the Bill, including an assurance that entities will be consulted on any steps that Government may take on policy or legislation in the future.
