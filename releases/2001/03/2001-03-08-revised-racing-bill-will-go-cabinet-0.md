Racing Minister Annette King will take a revised racing bill to the Cabinet this month, and if the Government approves the bill it will be introduced to Parliament in the next few months.

Changes to the draft bill have been made after extensive discussions with the three code chairmen and industry sectors.

“I have talked to a wide range of racing people. Their response to the bill, which effectively merges the TAB and the Racing Industry Board, has been generally favourable, but there were some concerns about the appointment processes," Mrs King said.

“After constructive discussions this week with the codes we have agreed on some changes to those processes. I think the changes will clear the way for broader industry support for the new legislation. I am, therefore, pleased to put the bill forward to my colleagues knowing it is endorsed by the industry.”
