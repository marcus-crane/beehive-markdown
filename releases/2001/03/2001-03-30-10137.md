Today is the last chance to vote in the school trustee elections.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard is reminding parents of schools where an election is being held that they still have time to vote.

"If people who have not yet voted get their votes to the school or the returning officer by mid-day today, their vote will still count," Trevor Mallard said.

"I urge all parents to take part in this process and so far it appears that many have.

"So far this year's school board of trustees election process has been a huge success.

"Not only did all schools get enough nominations to form a board, but early indications show that this election will have a much higher return than the previous one.

"The willingness of communities to take part in the election processs is a reflection of the power of self-managed schools.

“New Zealand is an international trailblazer in terms of community involvement in schools and it is pleasing that so many people have taken the importance of the role to heart. This is the fifth election since the system started in 1989, and this month has shown that the initial enthusiasm is still very strong," Trevor Mallard said.
