People with disabilities have the right to the same employment opportunities as the rest of the population, Minister for Social Services Steve Maharey and Minister for Disability Issues Lianne Dalziel said today.

Both Ministers were speaking at the launch of EMERGE Supported Employment Trust at Parliament. The trust, which has been set up with the help of funding from the Department of Work and Income, aims to provide supported employment in the mainstream workforce for people with disabilities in the Wellington region.

"The Government is committed to reducing the barriers experienced by people with disabilities in participating in society, including by providing employment and training opportunities.

"As a Government we are very pleased to support the goals of the EMERGE Supported Employment Trust to provide employment of reasonable duration for people with disabilities," Steve Maharey said.

"I believe that everyone is entitled to realise their potential in life," Lianne Dalziel said.

"In employment terms, that means that people with disabilities should be allowed to have aspirations to work in open employment, that they receive an adequate income for that work and that they receive the support they need to get jobs and to keep them."

The Ministers said employment opportunities for people with disabilities would be a key goal of the New Zealand Disability Strategy, which would be launched shortly.
