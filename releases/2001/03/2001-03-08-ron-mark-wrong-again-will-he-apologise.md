Minister of Police Hon George Hawkins is dismayed that once again New Zealand First MP Ron Mark has got his facts wrong.

Ron Mark claimed in this morning's Christchurch Press newspaper that he and the public had been misled.

He alleged last year that gangs were stealing firearms to order using information that should only be available to Police through the Wanganui Computer.

"Last year I asked the Police to investigate Ron Mark's allegations. The Police investigated and they found them to be totally incorrect.

"But Ron Mark has raised this issue again, saying that he has not been told the truth.

"He really ought to get his facts right before he goes around frothing at the mouth, scare mongering among the country's media," George Hawkins said.

"This morning I again asked Police to clarify this situation. They have done so.

"I have been assured by Police that Ron Mark's allegations are completely false. The statement in the Christchurch Press that information obtained from the Wanganui computer was firearms related and that that information was passed on to gangs is incorrect," George Hawkins said.

"The Police have given an absolute assurance that information passed on by a Police officer had nothing to do with firearms, it related to a motor vehicle and was passed on to an individual. That Police officer subsequently resigned from the Police.

"Ron Mark ought to apologise to the Police for his wild accusations that could undermine public confidence in Police officers," George Hawkins said.
