Community volunteers are rightly often called this country's unsung heroes - and they now have both a camellia and a postage stamp named in their honour.

Minister of Internal Affairs Hon George Hawkins said thousands of volunteers throughout New Zealand work hard for their communities - often without acknowledgment.

"The Camellia, named "Volunteer", commemorates this International Year of Volunteers and is a reminder of the hard work that thousands of people do for the betterment of this country," George Hawkins said.

"The stamp, issued by New Zealand Post, is also a great way to promote awareness for the work of volunteers in our communities," George Hawkins said.

The Camellia, "Volunteer", was bred by Mark Jury, a Taranaki Camellia grower.

New Zealand Post's latest stamp series features the camellia. The series was released yesterday and highlights six flowers bred in New Zealand.

"Having a stamp commemorate the Year as well strengthens an appreciation of the work that volunteers do," George Hawkins said.

The Camellia has taken 10 years to trial and to build stocks up. It will be released in June this year.

Volunteering Waikato, the Waikato Volunteer Centre, had been working closely with the breeder to ensure the camellia could be available as a symbol to mark the Year:
