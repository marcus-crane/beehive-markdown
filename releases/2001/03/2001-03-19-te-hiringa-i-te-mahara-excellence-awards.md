The Associate Minister of Education, the Hon Parekura Horomia said information technology, if handled properly, could reduce inequalities and raise Maori student achievement across the entire curriculum.

Mr Horomia presented 12 Maori teachers with excellence awards as part of Te Hiringa I Te Mahara Information and Computer Technology (ICT) Professional Development programme. The presentation ceremony was conducted by video conference and linked 10 different sites from Christchurch to Kaitaia.

Mr Horomia told participants that he was keen to see Maori participating in decision making at all levels and that technology could play a major role for Maori.

"I want to see Maori at the cutting edge of the e-technology era. Information technology can reduce inequalities and raise student achievement across the entire curriculum. It can also help overcome problems of distance and isolation especially for small rural schools."

100 Maori teachers from Wharekura and Maori boarding schools are currently part of the teacher development programme. The award winners were selected for their total participation, enthusiasm to learn and implement the new technology and for their support to colleagues. The associate Minister of Education personally congratulated each of the award winners over the air waves.

"Maori teachers have a major role in encouraging Maori students and their families into the information technology industry. It is the way of the future and if Maori want to be decisionmakers in the future then they must learn to use new technology."
