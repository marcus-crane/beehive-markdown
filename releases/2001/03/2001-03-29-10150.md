Prime Minister Helen Clark and Defence Minister Mark Burton have extended their sympathies to the family and colleagues of the naval technician who died today on board the HMNZS Te Mana.

Helen Clark and Mark Burton said they were very saddened to learn of the death of 21-year-old Shane Michael Stratton.

"This is deeply distressing news for the family, colleagues and friends of Able Marine Technician Stratton and our thoughts tonight are with them.

"It adds to what has been a tragic beginning to 2001 for the New Zealand Defence Force after the recent deaths of New Zealand servicemen in East Timor, Australia and Kuwait."

Helen Clark and Mark Burton said the Royal New Zealand Navy would begin an investigation after the Te Mana berthed tomorrow at Devonport Naval Base.
