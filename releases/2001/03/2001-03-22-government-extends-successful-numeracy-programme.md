More than 400 new schools will be using a new way of teaching mathematics this year following a successful evaluation of the programme in the 83 pilot schools, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

Trevor Mallard released the evaluation report of the "Count Me In Too" programme this afternoon and said it had been enormously successful.

"The $1.5 million pilot focussed on teachers of year one to three students and improved teacher confidence through improving their understanding of mathematics content knowledge and pedagogy.

"It was centred around the number strand of the curriculum statement in particular early number knowledge and the mental strategies that children use to solve number problems.

"The evaluation report shows that overall children advanced at least one stage on each of the five aspects of the Learning Framework in Number. The framework enables teachers to more accurately identify the number development and learning needs of children.

"The Government has extended the project this year into the Early Numeracy Project. It will involve more than 2,000 teachers and 50,000 children in about 400 schools from throughout the country. As well, we have extended the work being done for older children in the Advanced Numeracy Project for teachers at Years Four to Six. The cost of these projects this year is about $7.2 million.

"The changes are part of a longer term strategy that will enable all primary teachers to participate in professional development to improve their teaching of mathematics.

"It is vital to later learning that children get a good start in basic numeracy. Government-supported numeracy initiatives in schools provide a solid base to provide New Zealand school children with the necessary good start," Trevor Mallard said.
