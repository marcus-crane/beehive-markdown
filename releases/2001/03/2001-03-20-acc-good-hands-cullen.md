ACC in good hands -Cullen

Accident Insurance Minister Michael Cullen is confident the ACC portfolio is in safe hands with its new Minister, Lianne Dalziel.

"Lianne Dalziel has been a shadow spokesperson for Accident Insurance in the past. I have every confidence in her ability to continue driving the government's commitment to a fair and sustainable scheme for managing personal injury by minimising both the overall incidence of injuries in the community and the negative impact of injury, including economic, social and personal costs."

"I have enjoyed working with ACC and Labour Department officials in my capacity as Minister. I am especially pleased to be able to hand over the portfolio knowing that the issue of double billing is now behind us," Dr Cullen said.
