Prime Minister Helen Clark said tonight she was deeply distressed at the terrorist attacks carried out in the United States earlier today.

She described the attacks as acts of cold-blooded and utterly incomprehensible violence that would shock all New Zealanders.

"New Zealand's thoughts tonight are with President George Bush, his government and the American people, who have borne the brunt of this outrage. We are also deeply concerned about the fate of people of all nationalities, including New Zealanders, who may have been caught up in this horrific violence.

"There can be no tolerance of such deliberate and cowardly acts of terrorism. It is important that the international community now work together to fight the scourge of terrorism. New Zealand will do whatever it can to help."

Helen Clark learned of the devastating events in the United States as she was en route to Europe to attend a progressive governance heads of government conference in Sweden and make official and business calls in Italy and France.

"In the light of these devastating events I am now returning to New Zealand on the first available flight.

"My thoughts tonight are first and foremost with our families who may have families or friends caught in this tragedy," Helen Clark said.
