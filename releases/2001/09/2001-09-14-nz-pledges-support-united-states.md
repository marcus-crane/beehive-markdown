Prime Minister Helen Clark said today she had written to President George Bush to express New Zealand's revulsion at the terrorist acts committed against the United States.

Helen Clark said she had also expressed New Zealand's support for efforts by the United States and the international community to combat terrorism and to bring to justice the perpetrators of Tuesday's attacks in the United States.

The United States has called for a concerted international effort in response to the attacks in New York and Washington.

"The United States will be considering what responses it needs from friends around the world. We have yet to receive any specific requests, but New Zealand will help in any way we can.

"We are passing on that message to the White House.

"New Zealand condemns any form of terrorism. The attacks against the United States were attacks against all civilised nations. New Zealand is determined to do its bit," Helen Clark said.
