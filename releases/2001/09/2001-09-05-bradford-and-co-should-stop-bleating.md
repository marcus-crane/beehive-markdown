"Max Bradford, Ron Mark and Owen Jennings should stop bleating and wait for the government's announcements," Defence Minister Mark Burton said.

"I have seldom seen such an outpouring of self-serving political point scoring as was demonstrated in the House today.

"I am determined that a range of defence issues – some historical, some current - be dealt with thoroughly and in the most appropriate manner.

"Given the failure of the previous Minister to deal with any of these issues – indeed he contributed to the unhealthy environment – I make no apology for considering carefully the advice of the Chief of Defence Force, Crown Law, the Auditor-General and the State Services Commissioner.

"I will be making an announcement this week, because this government is committed to fixing the legacy of National's decade of neglect. Outbursts from opposition MPs are quite irrelevant," Mark Burton said.
