A condolence book is to be made available for New Zealanders to sign following the terrorist attacks on the United States yesterday.

"All of us in New Zealand have been shocked and appalled at the carnage and destruction caused by the terrorist attacks in the United States yesterday," Acting Prime Minister Jim Anderton and Foreign Affairs Minister Phil Goff said.

"We know that New Zealanders will want to express their sympathy to the American people and those directly affected by the attacks.

"We have invited the Mayors of city councils throughout New Zealand to make a condolence book available in town halls or their offices for people to express their grief and sympathies over yesterday's events.

"These books will be presented to the American Embassy in Wellington.

"The American Embassy has also placed a condolence book outside their embassy in Thorndon, Wellington for those who wish to show their sympathy in this way," Ministers said.
