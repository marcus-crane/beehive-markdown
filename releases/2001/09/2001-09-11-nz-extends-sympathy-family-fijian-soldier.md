The Minister of Defence Mark Burton has extended the condolences of the New Zealand government to the family of a Fijian soldier killed in a truck crash in East Timor.

"I understand that 11 other Fijian soldiers were injured, some seriously, and they are receiving appropriate treatment for those injuries," Mark Burton said.

"The Fiji company is an integral part of the New Zealand battalion which has responsibility for the south-west sector in East Timor.

"While the threat from militia has diminished, the terrain and weather conditions are in themselves very challenging. We already know that all too well. Two New Zealand soldiers have also lost their lives in road crashes in East Timor.

"This latest tragic death is a reminder of the dangerous and difficult task facing those who are entrusted with preserving the peace in East Timor," Mark Burton said.
