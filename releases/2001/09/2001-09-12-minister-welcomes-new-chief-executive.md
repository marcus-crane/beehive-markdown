Sport, Fitness and Leisure Minister Trevor Mallard welcomed the appointment today of Nicholas Hill as chief executive designate of the new recreation and sport agency.

Trevor Mallard said Nicholas Hill brought a strong mix of private sector and government experience to the role. This would be invaluable in bringing about a more integrated approach to building a healthier, more active and successful sporting nation.

"One of the most significant findings and challenges of the Graham Report was that we need greater integration, co-ordination and co-operation within the recreation and sport sector. The chief executive will have a key role in leading the sector towards a common vision for creating a healthy and more active nation," he said.

"I am sure that Nicholas Hill's track record in leadership and strategic thinking, combined with the skills and experience of the organisation's board, will give the new agency a powerful advantage as it leaves the starting blocks."

The recreation and sport agency is being set up following the report of the Ministerial Taskforce into Sport Fitness and Leisure (the Graham Report). It will integrate key functions of the Hillary Commission, the New Zealand Sports Foundation and the policy arm of the Office of Tourism and Sport.
