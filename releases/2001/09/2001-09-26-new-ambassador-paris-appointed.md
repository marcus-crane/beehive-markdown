Career diplomat Adrian Macey would be New Zealand's new Ambassador in Paris, Acting Foreign Affairs Minister Jim Sutton announced today.

Mr Sutton said the current relationship between France and New Zealand was excellent.

“New Zealand and France cooperate closely on maritime surveillance and disaster relief operations in the Pacific and we have also worked together on a number of peacekeeping missions, including in East Timor.

“France is a major political and economic force not just in Europe but globally. It is very much in New Zealand's interests to continue to expand the range of contacts we have."

Mr Sutton said Dr Macey would also serve as New Zealand's Permanent Representative to the OECD, which is based in Paris. The combined responsibilities for France and for the OECD make Paris an important post for New Zealand.

Dr Macey holds a PhD in French. He was the first New Zealander to attend the prestigious Ecole Nationale d’Administration (ENA), the training institution through which have passed most of France’s top civil servants and many political leaders.

He joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in 1975. He is currently Principal Trade Negotiator and Director of the Ministry’s Trade Negotiations Division, responsible for the WTO and other issues.

He was previously New Zealand’s Ambassador to Thailand from 1996 until last year. His earlier postings include to Paris, Apia and Geneva, as well as a secondment to the State Services Commission.

Dr Macey takes up his appointment to Paris early next year and replaces Dick Grant who is returning to a Deputy Secretary position in Wellington.
