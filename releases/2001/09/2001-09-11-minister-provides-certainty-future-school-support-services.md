Education Minister Trevor Mallard today delivered on an election promise, providing government funding under a rolling three-year contract to secure the future of the country's School Support Services.

Not only that, but the services will get their first funding increase since 1989.

The School Support Services (formerly known as the School Advisory Services) are the major source of professional advice and support to principals and teachers in the areas of leadership, management and curriculum.

Trevor Mallard said since 1989 the services, based at the six colleges of education, had existed hand-to-mouth on short-term contracts and with their funding capped.

"This situation was untenable. For 12 years, the service has had to operate in an atmosphere of uncertainty which has forced staff reductions and made staff retention very difficult.

"The Government is committed to providing a non-contestable nationally co-ordinated advisory service to support our principals and our teachers.

"This will be achieved by moving to three-year rolling contracts with the Colleges of Education for the provision of these services."

Trevor Mallard announced that a 10% funding increase ($2.14 million including GST) for the School Support Services will take effect from 1 January 2002.  
That will take the funding for the services to $23.54 million a year.

"The further development of a high quality service that is responsive to the needs of our schools will be supported by these decisions," he said.
