23 September 2001Media Release

Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton today has asked local Mayors and Councils if he can reschedule his regional visit to Hawke's Bay for 6 and 7 December.  
Jim Anderton reluctantly postponed his scheduled visit for the 13th and 14th of September because of his duties as acting Prime Minister when the United States was attacked by terrorists.

"The Hawke's Bay is a very successful region and I am looking forward to seeing how well Vision 2020 and local Councils and iwi are progressing the Regional Partnership Plan.

"Like all regions the Hawke's Bay has important issues and opportunities and I am looking forward to working in partnership with regional leaders to help expand business and create jobs in the region," said Jim Anderton.

Hawke's Bay has received $199,688 to develop a strategic regional development plan and build capability for its implementation. The lead organisation is Vision 2020 and the contact person for this is Dr Karen Cooper. Local Councils and iwi are involved.

The next stage will be for the region to apply to Industry New Zealand for up to $2 million for agreed and significant Hawke's Bay economic priorities.

Jim Anderton today announced two Industry New Zealand Business Growth Fund grants of $100,000 each to two successful Hawke's Bay companies.
