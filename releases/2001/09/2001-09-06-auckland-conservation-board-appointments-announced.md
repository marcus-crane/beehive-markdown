Conservation Minister Sandra Lee today announced appointments to the Auckland Conservation Board, effective from the start of this month.

"Conservation Boards are independent bodies that give the Department of Conservation direct imput on local issues, " she said. "They play an important role in matching conservation policies with community needs and provide a way for local people to be part of conservation decisions affecting where they live.

"The government has set aside a record $226.35m to spend on conservation throughout New Zealand during the 2001/02 year," Ms Lee said. "Some of this funding will filter down to Conservancy project work and strategies which will be subject to local Conservation Board oversight."

"I am confident this mix of appointed and re-appointed board members and sitting members will provide strong and sound advice to DOC's Auckland Conservancy.

“Anne Fenn--a scientist--who is one of three re-appointed members has brought to the Auckland Conservation Board a long standing commitment to conservation, evidenced by her involvement with a number of NGOs, in particular the Royal Forest & Bird Protection Society of New Zealand.

“Mel Galbraith is a lecturer in ecology at UNITEC. Mel came to prominence as Chair of the extremely successful Supporters of Tiritiri Matangi (Inc).

"He is a member of the Ornithological Society of NZ and is a member of the current Board. He has made strong contributions in the fields of natural heritage and biodiversity and is a flag bearer for community involvement.

“Laly Haddon, a well known farmer and tourism operator from Pakiri, is a member of the current Board, Chair of the Ngati Wai Trust Board, and Deputy Chair of the Hauraki Gulf Forum.

"He has been an active member of the Board providing wise counsel on a range of conservation issues.

“Margaret Kawharu is a new appointment to the Auckland Conservation Board.

"She is affiliated to Ngati Whatua/Mahurere and is currently Claims Manager of Wai 32, Ngati Whatua o Kaipara ki te Tonga.

"She is highly regarded in the community and brings a wealth of experience and understanding of conservation issues facing the Department in South Kaipara.”
