Communications Minister Paul Swain says the Radiocommunications Regulations 2001 ¡V which will help reduce compliance costs across the industry - have been approved.

The regulations will come in once the Radiocommunications Amendment Act Commencement Order 2001 comes into force on 12 October 2001.

¡§This is the first significant update of the Act since its inception in 1989," Paul Swain said.

"It results from an extensive round of reviews and consultations over a considerable period.¡¨

"In particular, the revised regulations ¡V

„h simplify the licensing of a range of new services and technologies that are now appearing on the market;

„h provide for regulatory harmonisation with Australia of standards for, and approval of, a wide range of radio and electronic products which will be of major benefit to New Zealand¡¦s exporters and importers of radiocommunications equipment;

„h Set out actions that constitute infringement offences, any one of which could compromise the integrity of licensed radiocommunications services, and list the associated infringement fees.

Key provisions of the amended Act are -  
„h use of the Arbitration Act to settle disputes relating to harmful interference between licensed transmissions;  
„h the ability to create a successive spectrum management right and to allocate it prior to the expiry of an existing right;  
„h A strengthened technical certification framework, provision for public access to all licences in the registry, greater flexibility in the technical description of licences, and enhanced provisions for control of electromagnetic compatibility (radio interference) issues.

¡§This move towards regulatory harmonisation with Australia demonstrates the Government¡¦s commitment to pursuing all possible steps that will assist in minimising compliance costs across an industry which services a range of international markets,¡¨ Paul Swain said.

Summary outlines of the changes to the Act and Regulations are available on the Ministry of Economic Development¡¦s Radio Spectrum Management website at:
