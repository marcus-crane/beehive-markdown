Conservation Minister Sandra Lee today announced appointments to the Southland Conservation Board, effective from the start of this month.

"Conservation Boards are independent bodies that give the Department of Conservation direct imput on local issues, " she said. "They play an important role in matching conservation policies with community needs and provide a way for local people to be part of conservation decisions affecting where they live.

"The government has set aside a record $226.35m to spend on conservation throughout New Zealand during the 2001/02 year," Ms Lee said. "Some of this funding will filter down to Conservancy project work and strategies which will be subject to local Conservation Board oversight."

“I am pleased to announce that Roger McNaughton of Woodlands, Jan Riddell of Winton and George Ryan of Bluff have been reappointed to the Board.

"I am confident this mix of re-appointed board members and sitting members will provide strong and sound advice to DOC's Southland Conservancy."

Southland Conservator Lou Sanson said the standard of nominations had once again been high this year and had included people from a range of backgrounds.

He also said it was pleasing to see existing board members put themselves forward for consideration as this ensured continuity on the board.

These three members join seven current members bringing the total board membership to ten.
