Deputy Prime Minister and Industry and Regional Development Minister will visit Hawkes Bay on 13 and 14 September on his 42nd regional visit.

The programme has yet to be finalised but will involve a public meeting, a business leader's breakfast and visits to businesses in the region.

A major goal will be to see how the Regional Partnerships Programme in the region is progressing. Hawkes Bay has received $199,688 to develop a strategic regional development plan and build capability for its implementation. The lead organisation is Vision 2020 and the contact person for this is Dr Karen Cooper, and local Councils, and iwi are involved.

The next stage will be for the region to apply to Industry New Zealand for up to $2 million for agreed and significant Hawkes Bay economic priorities.

"I am looking forward to this visit to Hawkes Bay and learning more about the regional development priorities and issues in the region. The regional partnership programme provides an important opportunity for regional and central government partnerships and I am particularly interested in the progress made by Hawkes Bay representatives in determining the region's priorities," said Jim Anderton.

A meeting with social and community welfare organisations is planned for Thursday the 13th in the afternoon.

The public meeting will be in the Napier Memorial Square Community Rooms, Clive Square at 7 p.m. on Thursday evening.
