Health Minister Annette King says internationally renowned health care expert Dr Donald Berwick will be in New Zealand this week to help health professionals share ideas for improving the quality of health care.

Dr Berwick is visiting New Zealand during Working Toward Quality: Quality in Health Week which starts today and runs till September 24.

Mrs King will host a workshop in Wellington next Monday for District Health Board staff with Dr Berwick on quality management.

"Dr Berwick's visit is a rare chance for the New Zealand health sector to discuss quality improvement with a world expert," Mrs King said.

"I met Dr Berwick last year and was impressed with his ideas. He is an inspirational speaker, and health providers and staff will have the opportunity to learn from international best practice.

"Initiatives in the health sector highlighted during Quality in Health Week and feedback from Dr Berwick will give us an opportunity to do things better, and help each other do better. "

Mrs King said the projects and events during Quality in Health week were just the tip of the iceberg.

"Within the Ministry I have staff working on a Quality Improvement Strategy and on competency assurance for health professionals. Outside the Ministry there's just as much if not more happening."
