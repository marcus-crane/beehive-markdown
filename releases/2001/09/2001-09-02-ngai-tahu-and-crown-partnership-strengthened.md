Education Ministers Trevor Mallard and Parekura Horomia said today's signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with Ngai Tahu signals the government's commitment to a partnership for education development.

Trevor Mallard said the memorandum is an innovative and positive example of how national education policies can be implemented with, instead of upon, a community.

"Ngai Tahu and the Crown want the same thing. We both want to improve student participation and achievement; to lift outcomes for students, families and communities; to have greater engagement in education and to build capability through lifelong learning. The memorandum provides a solid basis for us to work together."

Associate Education Minister Parekura Horomia congratulated Ngai Tahu, saying the tribe identified early on that education was one of its key social and economic development strategies.

"Education is a key that can unlock potential and contribute to the ongoing cultural and economic aspirations of Ngai Tahu. I am pleased that they took the initiative in seeking this partnership with the Ministry of Education. It is something that other iwi have also been working to. The ability of Maori people to be directly involved in education will be an essential element in the future of the education system."

Both Ministers said the signing formalises a relationship that has been developing over the last year, where Ngai Tahu representatives have been working with education agencies to implement the tribe's strategic plan for education development.

"The work has already begun. Initiatives like the appointment of two local iwi/school liasion officers, the development of a partnership funding model, the establishment of Ngai Tahu study centres are concrete examples of the partnership at work."
