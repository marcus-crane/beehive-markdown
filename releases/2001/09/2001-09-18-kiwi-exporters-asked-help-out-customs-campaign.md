Kiwi exporters asked to help out

New Zealand exporters need to help us know where our exports are going and how well we are doing with our balance of payments, says Acting Customs Minister Jim Anderton.

The New Zealand Customs Service has started a campaign this week, asking exporters who are not meeting the deadline for export entries to provide their statistics of what they are exporting, and to where, in a more timely manner.

"The information provided by exporters is used to measure economic performance and is also valuable to companies making investment and marketing decisions.

"This government is interested in helping our export industries grow. We know that high-skill, high-value export industries are the best way to create jobs for New Zealanders. Like any business, the Government needs the best information in order to make the high quality decisions.

"Most companies meet their requirements, but New Zealand Customs is asking companies to ensure they lodge their export entries on time," said Jim Anderton.

Customs requires export entries to help ensure the protection of New Zealand's natural heritage, and to help monitor to ensure international agreements are upheld and to maintain New Zealand's reputation as a trading nation.

Exporters have a legal obligation under the Customs and Excise Act to lodge an entry before goods leave New Zealand, or get a permit to lodge late entries.

The New Zealand Customs Service did a spot check in Auckland last year and found on one day about 18 per cent of consignments had no documentation completed prior to export.

Customs staff are available to advise and help exporters on 0800 428 786.

Under the Customs and Excise Act, exporters can face a fine of up to $5000 for failing to lodge an entry.
