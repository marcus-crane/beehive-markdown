A professor of chemistry and a specialist in the agriculture and food industry have been appointed to the Environmental Risk Management Authority (ERMA), Environment Minister, Marian Hobbs, announced today.

Professor George Clark from the University of Auckland, and Jane Lancaster, well known in the agriculture and food industry, replace Dr Oliver Sutherland and Mr John Maasland whose terms have expired. Dr Lindie Nelson has been re-appointed to the authority for another year.

Ms Hobbs said the appointments plus the introduction on July 2 of a new system for managing hazardous substances provided an opportunity to re-evaluate the make-up of the Authority. Genetic modification and the proposals put forward by the Royal Commission were issues facing the authority.

"The make-up of the new authority is crucial to its success," Marian Hobbs said. "The new members include people with specialised technical knowledge in areas such as molecular biochemistry and agricultural science in addition to knowledge of industry and government policy."

ERMA is an expert body established under the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act. Its primary purpose is to protect people from the risks of hazardous substances and new organisms by assessing, approving or declining applications to import or manufacture new organisms and hazardous substances.

In approving a hazardous substance, ERMA can set comprehensive controls on the use, handling, transport, storage and disposal of the substance controls that everyone must abide by.
