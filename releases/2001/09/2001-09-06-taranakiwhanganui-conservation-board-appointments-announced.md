Conservation Minister Sandra Lee today announced appointments to the Taranaki/Whanganui Conservation Board, effective from the start of this month.

"Conservation Boards are independent bodies that give the Department of Conservation direct imput on local issues, " she said. "They play an important role in matching conservation policies with community needs and provide a way for local people to be part of conservation decisions affecting where they live.

"The government has set aside a record $226.35m to spend on conservation throughout New Zealand during the 2001/02 year," Ms Lee said. "Some of this funding will filter down to Conservancy project work and strategies which will be subject to local Conservation Board oversight."

"I am confident this mix of appointed and re-appointed board members and sitting members will provide strong and sound advice to their DOC Conservancy.

“I am pleased to announce that there are three new appointments, and that two Board members have been reappointed.

These five members join current members, six, bringing the total members to eleven.

The three new members are:  
Mrs Barbara ARNOLD of Palmerston North  
Barbara Arnold has previous conservation board experience, wide-ranging interest in environmental issues and is a keen outdoors person. She has a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Zoology. Barbara has been appointed for a one year term.

Mrs Narayani TIWARI of Palmerston North  
Narayani Tiwari has an active interest in local environmental issues as well as a special interest in environmental management development. She has a postgraduate Diploma in Environmental Management development from Australian National University and Master of Philosophy in Environmental Household Waste Management from Massey University. Her experience in research and academic qualifications will be most useful for the Board. Narayani has been appointed for a one year term.

Ms Annette MAIN of Wanganui  
Annette Main has practical experience in local conservation initiatives, involvement in the local tourism industry as well as local government. She has a very strong personal and professional interest in conservation. Annette has been appointed for a term of three years.

Reappointed members:  
Kevin PHILLIPS of New Plymouth  
Kevin Phillips has iwi affiliation with Ngati Tama and a strong association with the rural community of Taranaki. He has a good knowledge of local and national conservation issues. Kevin has served on the Board for three years and has been reappointed for a further term of three years.

Brian Milham of Wanganui  
Brian Milham is chairperson of the Whanganui Branch of Forest & Bird and very active on local as well as national conservation issues. Brian has served on the Board for one year and has been reappointed for a further term of three years.

Ms Lee thanked the outgoing members, Chairperson Peter Horsley, Diane Ratahi, and Maia Waitai (who resigned in May this year) for their energy and passion as members of the board.

Wanganui conservator Bill Carlin said the outgoing Conservation Board members had worked very hard, and their contributions would be missed. However, he said changes in board membership were essential to ensure others got a chance to have some input into the decision-making process on local conservation issues.

Mr Carlin said the new board had a good mixture of new blood as well as continuity from experienced members.
