Round 9 Enterprise Awards Scheme  
35 Awards totalling $308,601

Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton today announced round 9 of the Industry New Zealand Enterprise Awards.

"Seeing the continuing success of past Enterprise Award companies shows that local business is strong and innovative. With the current uncertain international economic situation we need to celebrate our successes and new business ideas," said Jim Anderton.

The ninth round of Industry New Zealand Enterprise Awards has 35 awards totalling $308,601.

Jim Anderton will visit De'Amalfi Survival in Auckland tomorrow. This company has recently won a second award of $20,000 and now has exports to the United States, Russia, Holland, Germany, Australia and Spain. Jim Anderton visited De'Amalfi Survival in October 2000 when the company won an Enterprise Award in the first round of the scheme.

Jim Anderton will also visit Eager Beaver a toy company that makes kitset castles which received a grant from Industry NZ of $2,700 in round two of the scheme.

This takes the number of recipients who have received grants to 271 since September 2000 when the awards started.

Entrepreneurs or small to medium sized business owners can receive a maximum of $20,000 from an Industry New Zealand Enterprise Award, which can be used to fund up to 50 percent of the cost of a project.

Small businesses and entrepreneurs interested in Enterprise Awards and other services and support from Industry New Zealand can look at the website www.industrynz.govt.nz.
