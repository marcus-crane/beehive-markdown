14 September 2001Media Statement  
Building A Social Housing Strategy

The first steps towards building a long-term social housing strategy are being taken today at a workshop in Wellington.

The workshop brings together community groups, government advisers, developers, tenants, local authorities and politicians, to begin work on mapping out a collective social housing strategy for New Zealand, says the Minister of Housing, the Hon Mark Gosche.

Approximately 140 people are attending the day-long workshop.

“Since this government came to office we have focussed on building effective partnerships in the housing sector, so it is very appropriate to bring everyone together like this to look to the future. ”

“I expect this workshop today to come up with innovative and challenging ideas on how the government can develop and implement a vision for a social housing strategy for New Zealanders.”

The format of the workshop is open, with no predetermined outcomes or issues. It allows those taking part to raise issues as they want. With the support of other participants an issue will then become the subject of a discussion group.

The workshop results will be used in developing a housing strategy due to be completed by the middle of next year.
