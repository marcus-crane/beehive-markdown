Culturally appropriate health services are needed to care for the rapidly increasing number of older Maori, Associate Health Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

Releasing the draft Health of Older People Strategy in Christchurch, Ms Dyson said New Zealand, like most other countries in the world, has an ageing population, and the number of older Maori would increase dramatically in the next 50 years.

"By 2051, the Maori population is projected to grow to almost one million. Maori aged 65 years and over will make up about 13 per cent of that total, compared to 3.5 per cent now. That is a 270 per cent increase."

Ruth Dyson said the draft strategy provided a much-needed policy framework for the health care of older people, and set out a demanding work programme for planners, funders and providers over the next 10 years.

The provision of appropriate health and support services to meet the hauora needs of older Maori and their whanau was one of its aims, she said.

"Currently, there are few Maori providers of services for older Maori, and older Maori tend not to access mainstream services. Under the strategy, the Ministry of Health and District Health Boards will work with local iwi and Maori to develop culturally appropriate services.

"They will fund a range of services to give older Maori a choice of mainstream or Maori providers who are clinically sound, culturally competent and well-coordinated. They will develop national priorities for Maori workforce and provider development, and support health advocacy structures for older Maori."

Ms Dyson said the draft strategy recognised that older Maori were often looked after by whanau, who needed support for the care they provided.

"The ministry and DHBs will work with local iwi and Maori communities to provide appropriate support for whanau, including information and basic training in caring for older people. Easily accessible primary and community health care, and long-term support for older Maori with high or complex care needs are also needed."

Ruth Dyson said the actions to improve the health of older Maori would be developed alongside implementation of the Maori Health Strategy.

She said the overall aims of the draft Health of Older People Strategy were better coordination of health and support services around the needs of older people, a greater emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention, and more emphasis on community-level health care and support so that people could continue to stay in their own homes as they get older.

"By 2010, we want health services and programmes in place that promote the wellbeing of older people, their control over their lives, and their ability to participate in - and contribute to - social, family, whanau and community life."

A number of public meetings will be held around the country to discuss the draft Health of Older People Strategy, including hui in Auckland, Rotorua and Christchurch (see attached timetable).

Written submissions close on 9 November. The final strategy will be released early in 2002, and implementation will be completed by 2010.

Copies of the draft Health of Older People Strategy, which includes a guide to making a submission, are available from the Ministry of Health, PO Box 5013, Wellington or on the website: www.moh.govt.nz
