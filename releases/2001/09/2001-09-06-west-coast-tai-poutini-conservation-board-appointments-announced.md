Conservation Minister Sandra Lee today announced appointments to the West Coast Tai Poutini Conservation Board, effective from the start of this month.

"Conservation Boards are independent bodies that give the Department of Conservation direct imput on local issues, " she said. "They play an important role in matching conservation policies with community needs and provide a way for local people to be part of conservation decisions affecting where they live.

"The government has set aside a record $226.35m to spend on conservation throughout New Zealand during the 2001/02 year," Ms Lee said. "Some of this funding will filter down to Conservancy project work and strategies which will be subject to local Conservation Board oversight."

“I am pleased to announce that Rod Buchanan, Sarah Evans and Terry Scott are new appointments, and that Alex Miller and Rob Brown have been reappointed.

"I am confident this mix of appointed and re-appointed board members and sitting members will provide strong and sound advice to DOC's West Coast Conservancy.

The new Conservation Board members are:  
Rod Buchanan, of Runanga, who is a member of the West Coast branch of the Royal Forest & Bird Protection Society and the West Coast Alpine Club. He has been appointed to the Board for three years  
Sarah Evans, of Greymouth, who has a scientific background in zoology and ecology, which will be very useful to the new Board. She has also been appointed to the Board for three years.  
Terry Scott, of Dunedin, who is the new Ngai Tahu nominee to the Board and is also the Chairperson of Te Runanga o Makaawhio. He has also been appointed to the Board for three years.

The two re-appointed members are:  
Rob Brown, of Christchurch, who brings considerable recreational experience to the Board. He has been reappointed for a further three-year term; and  
Alex Miller, of Franz Josef, who brings considerable conservation experience and a tourism perspective to the Board. He has also been reappointed for a further three-year term

These five members join the seven current members, bringing the total number of Board members to twelve.

Ms Lee thanked the retiring member Helen Rasmussen for her energy and passion as a member of the board.

She also confirmed the transfer of Harley McNabb of Karamea from the West Coast to the Nelson/Marlborough Conservation Board.

“Karamea is the southern gateway to the Kahurangi National Park which falls within the area of jurisdiction of the Nelson/Marlborough board” Ms Lee said. “I believe that it will useful to that board to hear the Karamea perspective and have the benefit of Mr McNabb’s knowledge of the West Coast part of the national park.”

The Department of Conservation's West Coast Conservator, Mike Slater, welcomed the new appointees to the West Coast Tai Poutini Conservation Board.

"I am looking forward to working with the incoming board members who will bring a wide range of skills and experience to the board," Mr Slater said.

Current members of the Board are:  
Kees van Beek of Kawhaka, who brings farming and community experience to the Board.  
Kevin Dash of Atarau, who brings a range of interests to the Board including cave and karst and historical interests.  
Kara Edwards of Greymouth, who is a Ngai Tahu nominee with resource management experience and knowledge of tikanga Maori.
