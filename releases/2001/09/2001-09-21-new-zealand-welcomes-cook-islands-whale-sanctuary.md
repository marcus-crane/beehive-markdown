New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark and Conservation Minister Sandra Lee today welcomed the decision by the Cook Islands to give legal protection to whales within the Cook's Exclusive Economic Zone.

The Cook Islands Cabinet has approved a declaration that the country's EEZ will now serve as a "sanctuary for all whales". The huge sanctuary will provide opportunities for non-lethal scientific research and collaboration, information exchange, education and awareness initiatives.

"New Zealand sees this action by the Cook Islands as being in the best spirit of marine conservation and a valuable means for further development of eco-tourism which will be an increasingly important factor in the economic well-being of the South Pacific," said Miss Clark and Ms Lee.

"The two million square kilometres covered by the Cook Islands whale sanctuary will help ensure the great whales remain a living part of South Pacific marine ecosystems. It is a win-win situation for both the Cook Islands and the great whales," they said.

"New Zealand encourages other Pacific Island countries to consider the benefits of declaring their exclusive economic zones whale sanctuaries. Both New Zealand and Australia already have a similar status for their EEZs through domestic initiatives; in New Zealand's case, through the Marine Mammals Protection Act.

"As Pacific Island countries, we need to look at the alternatives open to us to ensure the protection of the whales that come into the South Pacific to breed from their Antarctic feeding grounds in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary."

Conservation Minister Sandra Lee said she was very grateful for the strong support from the Cook Islands for a joint New Zealand-Australia bid to have the International Whaling Commission create a South Pacific Whale Sanctuary.

"The Cook Islands made an important and influential contribution to the regional meeting to promote whale conservation that was held in Apia, Samoa, in April. That meeting gave New Zealand and Australia a mandate to advance the South Pacific Whale Sanctuary at the IWC meeting held in London in July," Ms Lee said.

"It is clear that the affection New Zealanders have for living whales is also shared by the people of the Cook Islands.

"The future of the South Pacific lies not in the killing of marine mammals but in protecting them as a living part of the natural inheritance we pass on to our children. By protecting the great whales and by ensuring the health of our marine ecosystems generally, we will reap benefits through nature tourism.

"In a world that is increasingly degraded and polluted, we can create a haven for nature and people in the South Pacific by putting conservation and environmental protection top of our agenda," said Ms Lee. "By working together we can extend the protection of whales across much of the South Pacific through our Exclusive Economic Zones."
