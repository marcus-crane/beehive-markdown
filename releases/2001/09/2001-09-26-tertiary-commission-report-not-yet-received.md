The final report of the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission on potential changes to the tertiary education funding system will be delivered to the Government next month, Education Minister Trevor Mallard confirmed today.

Trevor Mallard said he understood that a report in the New Zealand Herald newspaper this morning was based on an earlier draft of the report. The report has not yet been finalised by the Commission or submitted to the Government.

The Government expects to receive the report next month and release it for public consultation in November. Following consideration of submissions, Cabinet will consider how the new tertiary funding system should be structured.

Trevor Mallard reiterated that Government decisions in respect of the report's recommendations would be consistent with Labour and the Alliance's pre-election tertiary education policies.

Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey is out of New Zealand on official business this week visiting China and Japan.
