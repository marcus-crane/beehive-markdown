Conservation Minister Sandra Lee today announced appointments to the Wellington Conservation Board, effective from the start of this month.

"Conservation Boards are independent bodies that give the Department of Conservation direct imput on local issues, " she said. "They play an important role in matching conservation policies with community needs and provide a way for local people to be part of conservation decisions affecting where they live.

"The government has set aside a record $226.35m to spend on conservation throughout New Zealand during the 2001/02 year," Ms Lee said. "Some of this funding will filter down to Conservancy project work and strategies which will be subject to local Conservation Board oversight."

“I am pleased to announce that Te Akapikirangi (known also as 'Aka') Arthur, George Mikaera and Liz Burge have been re-appointed for a further three years.

"I am confident the mix of re-appointed board members and sitting members will continue to provide strong and sound advice to DOC's Wellington Conservancy.

Te Akapikirangi Arthur, of Porirua, has been on the board for three years. He affiliates to Ngati Toa iwi and has extensive links into the community and local government.

George Mikaera, of Masterton, has served five years on the board. He affiliates to Ngati Kahungunu iwi and has extensive knowledge on conservation issues in the Wairarapa.

Liz Burge, of Carteron, has served three years on the board. She has experience working with the Resource Management Act and local government processes and is connected to Rangitane o Wairarapa.

The Department of Conservation's Wellington Conservator Allan Ross welcomed the re-appointments:

“The Wellington Conservancy area includes the Wairarapa and the Kapiti Coast as far as the Manawatu River," he said.

"It is important to have board members drawn from all areas of the conservancy, and also important to have a mix of experience on the Board, so I am pleased to be able to draw on the talents of Aka, George and Liz for a further three years”.

The three join seven other Board members whose terms of appointment extend beyond this year.

The other members are Diane Anderson of Eketahuna, Peter Bygate, Mike Crozier and Mary O’Keefe of Wellington, Bill Carter of Paraparumu, Johanna Rosier of Otaki and Alan Wright who recently moved to Wanganui.
