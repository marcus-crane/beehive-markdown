HEALTH Minister Annette King has today agreed to gift the Templeton Chapel to the Holy Family Community Trust, and has proposed making a financial contribution to the Canterbury District Health Board as compensation for the land.

"The local community has had an interest in this building since the 1960s when community members contributed a large part of the costs of construction. In recent times, the building has been used to provide ecumenical church facilities for people with intellectual disabilities as well as the general public.

"The Crown recognises the significant local funding that went into the Chapel construction and the desire and commitment of the Trust to continue to provide for people with intellectual disabilities.

"With the de-institutionalisation of Templeton Hospital, the Canterbury District Health Board no longer requires the Templeton Centre Chapel.

"As this building has largely been used by people with intellectual disabilities who were cared for at Templeton Hospital, I believe it would be in the best interests of the community to gift this building to the Holy Family Community Trust."

Mrs King said the proposed transfer of property to the Holy Family Community Trust would occur following public notification, completion of a land survey, relevant resource consent being obtained, and the completion of other legal processes required to transfer ownership.

Canterbury District Health Board chairman Syd Bradley said today his board was pleased to have been able to assist the community in acquiring the chapel, particularly because of its association for people with intellectual disabilities.
