The Pacific is not - if it ever was, a tranquil place says Disarmament Minister and Minister in charge of Aid Matt Robson.

He was delivering the keynote speech this morning at the Red Cross seminar in Auckland "Tensions in the pacific; Challenges to Security".

"The theme of the next few days could not be more timely given recent world events. It is important that we reiterate our basic belief in humanity. But even during the worst moments in history, basic standards apply and must be observed by all parties in a conflict".

He stressed the importance of widely ratifying and implementing international humanitarian law and urged all parties present to support The Geneva Convention Of 1949, The Hague Convention and other Treaties.

"These set important standards; that civilians are not legitimate in war, that hostages may not be taken, that children must not be used in armed conflict and that certain weapons like nuclear weapons are illegal".

In our own region we've seen conflict in places like Fiji and the Solomon Islands. We have seen war, but we have also seen recovery in the restoration in peace however shaky.

"Aid targeted to reduce poverty and promote good governance would help towards regional security as would further controls on the trade of small arms".

"The sad reality is that the legal trade remains the originating source of illegal weapons in the South Pacific region. This is the backdrop to most terrorist attacks in the world, says Matt Robson".
