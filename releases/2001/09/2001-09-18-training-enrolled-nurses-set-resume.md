Health Minister Annette King has welcomed the return of the enrolled nurse position to New Zealand's health system.

Speaking at the New Zealand Nurses Organisation annual conference in Wellington recently, Mrs King said training of enrolled nurses looked set to resume next year, with Northland Polytechnic considering offering a new nursing training programme.

"I thank the New Zealand Nurses Organisation for help in trying to get the course established, because I've experienced a lot of past resistance from institutes to establish these courses," Mrs King said.

There had been no enrolled nursing education programmes offered in New Zealand since 1993.

Delegates at the conference voted unanimously to retain the title of enrolled nurse for students that graduate from the re-established second-level nursing training programmes.

Enrolled nurses receive one year’s training and are required to practise under the supervision of a registered nurse or medical practitioner.
