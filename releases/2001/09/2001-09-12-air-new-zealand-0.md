The Board of Air New Zealand will need to make the next decision in light of the Qantas decision not to purchase the assets of the Air New Zealand subsidiary Ansett Airlines, said Finance Minister Michael Cullen.

Dr Cullen said that the Government would use its best endeavours to make sure that Air New Zealand was in full consultation with the Australian Government before it made a final decision.
