Conservation Minister Sandra Lee today announced appointments to the Bay of Plenty Conservation Board, effective from the start of this month.

"Conservation Boards are independent bodies that give the Department of Conservation direct imput on local issues, " she said. "They play an important role in matching conservation policies with community needs and provide a way for local people to be part of conservation decisions affecting where they live.

"The government has set aside a record $226.35m to spend on conservation throughout New Zealand during the 2001/02 year," Ms Lee said. "Some of this funding will filter down to Conservancy project work and strategies which will be subject to local Conservation Board oversight."

"I am pleased to announce the new appointments as Tekarehana Wicks and Heather McKechnie and the reappointments of Gaye Payze and Rea Rangiheuea," Ms Lee said.

"I am confident this mix of newly appointed and re-appointed board members and sitting members will provide strong and sound advice to DOC's Bay of Plenty Conservancy.

Bay of Plenty conservator, Chris Jenkins, said he welcomed the appointments. Both Ms Payze and Ms Rangiheuea had contributed significantly to the board during their previous term and he looked forward to the skills and knowledge the new members would bring.

The two new appointments and two re-appointments bring the total number on the board to 11.

Ms Lee thanked the only retiring member, chair Melanie Moorcroft, for the energy and passion she had shown during her time with the board.
