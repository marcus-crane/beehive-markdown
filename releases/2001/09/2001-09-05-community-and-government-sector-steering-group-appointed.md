ten member Steering Group to work on practical ways of improving the relationships between the community sector and government agencies was announced today by Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Steve Maharey.

The Minister said the Steering Group’s work programme would be based on the recommendations of the Community and Voluntary Sector Working Party, which reported to the Government in April.

“The Community and Voluntary Sector Working Party looked at the reasons why the community sector’s relationship with government was under strain and what might be done about it.

“The Government largely agreed with the Working Party’s recommendations and I have asked for a joint community and government work programme to look at three main areas:  
improving participatory processes around policy development and policy making;  
improving funding and accountability arrangements; and  
strengthening the community sector.

“Threading through each of these work streams will be work to improve public servants understanding of community and voluntary sector organisations.

“The Steering Group will lead the work, monitor progress and report directly to me.

“Dorothy Wilson, who was an excellent chair of the Community and Voluntary Sector Working Party, has agreed to make her expertise and time available for the follow-up work and will chair the Steering Group.

“The other members of the steering group who will be working with Dorothy are:  
Enid Leighton, General Manager, Ngati Awa Social and Health Service from Whakatane;  
Tuari Potiki, Social Development Manager, Ngai Tahu Development Corporation from Christchurch;  
Tina Reid, Executive Director of the New Zealand Federation of Voluntary Welfare Organisations from Wellington;
