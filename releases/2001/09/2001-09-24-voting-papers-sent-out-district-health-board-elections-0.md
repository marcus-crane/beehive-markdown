Health Minister Annette King is urging people to think carefully when voting in the District Health Board elections.

Voting is by postal vote and votes must be returned to the Electoral Officer no later than midday 13 October 2001.

“Health is important to everyone and it’s a community issue. Please use your vote wisely - vote for the candidates you think will do the job well for the community."

Mrs King said each board worked as a team to make decisions on local health and disability services. "Ideally all board members will be capable of understanding a wide range of different issues and debating them, while remaining respectful of the views of other board members."

DHBs are responsible for funding or providing health and disability services, planning, promotion, protection and a range of primary, secondary and tertiary services.

There are 21 DHBs around the country and each has seven elected seats with a further four board members being appointed later by the Minister of Health. More than 1000 candidates are standing for the 147 seats.

“I appreciate the courage it has taken some people to stand for DHBs, and the number of candidates endorses the Government’s wish to increase the public’s voice in health services,” Mrs King said. “I hope people will take time to consider carefully which candidates they wish to support."

To help voters make informed choices, the voting packs will include candidate profiles, giving information about each candidate along with a statement by them of any conflicts of interest.
