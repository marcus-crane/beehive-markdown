Mäori Affairs Minister Hon Parekura Horomia announced the appointment of a highly experienced public service chief executive and a Christchurch historian to the Waitangi Tribunal today.  
Dame Margaret Bazley and Dr Ann Parsonson are new appointments to the Tribunal, while current members Professor Wharehuia Milroy and the Hon Dr Michael Bassett have been reappointed. All appointments are for a three-year term.  
‘I am delighted to be able to appoint people of this calibre to the Waitangi Tribunal. Dame Margaret brings her extensive and wide-ranging knowledge of the machinery of government to the Tribunal, while Dr Parsonson's research and analytical skills will be invaluable as members hear and consider historical and contemporary claims and evidence," said Mr Horomia.  
Dame Margaret was acting as Chief Executive of the Department of Work and Income until the end of this month (Sept 2001). She has also held senior management positions in the Ministry of Social Policy, the Fire Service Commission and the State Services Commission. In recognition of her efforts, Dame Margaret was appointed a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 1999.  
Dr Ann Parsonson, an experienced and reputable historian, is a Senior Lecturer in History at the University of Canterbury and a Senior Fellow in the School of Mäori and Pacific Development at the University of Waikato.  
The Minister of Mäori Affairs thanked the outgoing Tribunal members Pamela Ringwood and Josephine Anderson.  
"Ms Ringwood has been a tribunal member since 1993 and she continues to serve on the Wai 262 Flora and Fauna and the Northern South Island inquiriesy. Ms Anderson has completed one term. During that time, their commitment to the work of the Tribunal has been outstanding, and their influence will continue to be felt’, said Mr Horomia.
