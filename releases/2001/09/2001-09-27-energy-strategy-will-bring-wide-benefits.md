New Zealanders will see economic, social and environmental gains from the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy released today, says Energy Minister Pete Hodgson.

"The benefits of more efficient energy use will include improved economic productivity, healthier communities in warmer, drier homes, lower carbon dioxide emissions, greater economic resilience through more diverse energy supply, and improved transport systems," Mr Hodgson said.

The strategy’s two main targets are a 20 percent improvement in New Zealand’s energy efficiency and an increase of between 19 and 42 percent (25 - 55 petajoules) in energy from renewable sources by 2012.

Five action programmes for government, energy supply, industry, buildings and appliances, and transport will help achieve the strategy targets.

"The strategy promotes practical ways to make energy efficiency, energy conservation and renewable energy mainstream solutions," said Mr Hodgson. "This is a key step in the path to a sustainable energy future for New Zealand.

"Current energy trends are not sustainable. New Zealand is predicted to use 20 percent more energy in 2012 than now, with an increasing reliance on fossil fuel energy sources such as oil, gas and coal. This will push up carbon dioxide emissions to at least 45 percent above 1990 levels by 2012."

The strategy’s aim to increase renewable energy supply by 19 - 42 percent by 2012 will reduce New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions and help protect the environment. A specific target will be determined following further analysis and consultation.

Mr Hodgson says this will require adopting more new renewable sources of energy —such as solar, wind and biomass — which New Zealand has in abundance but has been slow to utilise.

The largely voluntary nature of the action programmes means the strategy’s success requires participation by all New Zealanders. Mr Hodgson said it was encouraging that the vast majority of 339 submissions received on the draft strategy supported its goals.

New funding required for the strategy’s first five years is estimated at about $79 million. A combination of government and private funding will be sought.

A National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy is required by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act 2000. The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority is managing strategy development and implementation in association with the Ministry for the Environment. The strategy will be reviewed within five years.
