Health Minister Annette King says she is determined a National Immunisation Register will be in place next year.

Opening today's New Zealand Immuisation Conference in Auckland, Mrs King said the register was under development and had great potential to overcome many of the problems with the existing immunisation system.

"We must make sure it is a robust and reliable register from the outset, rather than rushed and beset by problems. By developing the register in a gradual and reliable way, we will end up with the high quality system we all want," she said.

"I look forward to the first day health professionals can call and check their new patient's immunisation history, quickly and reliably."

Mrs King attacked those health professionals who tried to dissaude parents from having their children protected.

"This can have disastrous results. We must be on guard against distorted information and misinterpreted research results, which can be used to prey on the concerns parents have.

"Parents need accurate and reliable information and advice, and should not be lied to by those opposed to immunisation.

"Just this week I have had to write to a so-called health magazine because of an article peddling misinformation about immunisation."

Mrs King told the conference that the Government had approved a contract between the Ministry of Health and biotechnology company Chiron Corporation for developing a vaccine specific for New Zealand to help combat the group B meningococcal epidemic.

"This is a major commitment and the availability of a vaccine to help combat this unpredictable and devastating disease will be cause for much relief."

The development of the vaccine will be dependent on the success of clinical trials, and the World Health Organisation has offered to help in the development of these trials.
