Conservation Minister Sandra Lee today announced appointments to the Waikato Conservation Board, effective from the start of this month.

"Conservation Boards are independent bodies that give the Department of Conservation direct imput on local issues, " she said. "They play an important role in matching conservation policies with community needs and provide a way for local people to be part of conservation decisions affecting where they live.

"The government has set aside a record $226.35m to spend on conservation throughout New Zealand during the 2001/02 year," Ms Lee said. "Some of this funding will filter down to Conservancy project work and strategies which will be subject to local Conservation Board oversight."

“I am pleased to announce a new appointment, John Charteris, and that Sandra Goodwin and Hori Awa have both been re-appointed for a second term to the three vacant positions on the board. Their appointments are for three years.

"I am confident this mix of appointed and re-appointed board members and sitting members will provide strong and sound advice to DOC's Waikato Conservancy.

New member:

John Charteris of Taupiri is a retired school science advisor with specialist knowledge in fresh water ecology and marine education. John is on the executive of the Miranda Naturalist Trust, Education Outdoors NZ, North Waikato Tourism Inc and River Action Focus Team (RAFT), Hamilton.
