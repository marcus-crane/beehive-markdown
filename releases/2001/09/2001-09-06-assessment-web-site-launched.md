The Government's plans to help schools test their children more effectively moved a step forward tonight with the launch of an assessment website.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard launched the site in Wellington at a meeting with the National Assessment Advisory Committee. The site will provide a one-stop assessment shop for teachers.

"A few weeks ago I launched the new assessment tools that will help teachers improve teaching and learning through better testing methods," Trevor Mallard said.

"This website provides additional material to support those tools. It will also allow teachers to share their success stories and get ideas from others.

"It is not compulsory for schools to use these assessment resources. But they are excellent and I expect most schools will take them up. It is certainly the Government's responsibility to provide good central materials that schools can adapt to best suit their needs," Trevor Mallard said.

The assessment website can be accessed through the Ministry's online resource centre Te Kete Ipurangi. The site will include links to Assessment Resource Banks developed by the New Zealand Council for Educational Research and literacy and numeracy tests currently being developed by the University of Auckland. It will also include reviews and details of tests that are available for purchase from a range of organisations.

Examples of student work that illustrate quality work in every subject will be added to the site over the next few months. Next year the site will be expanded to include information about assessment for parents.

"The site will provide teachers with the information they need to identify children who aren't achieving as well as they should, and to put them on the right track. It complements wider Government initiatives to reduce disparity before yet another generation of children lose out," Trevor Mallard said.
