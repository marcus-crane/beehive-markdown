The future of Wanganui Regional Community Polytechnic's Rangahaua faculty is being considered separately from the rest of the institution, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said today.

A separate process has been underway to look at the future options for Rangahaua and its Te Rangakura programme, including discussions between iwi and the Ministry of Education.

Mr Maharey said that any new partnership between Wanganui Regional Community Polytechnic and UCOL is unlikely to include Rangahaua.

"Te Rangakura programme is an important national initiative, developed by Maori, to meet the need for trained Maori teachers.

"At this stage iwi have indicated that they want to consider alternatives for the future of Rangahaua outside of a future Wanganui Polytechnic-UCOL arrangement.

"The Ministry of Education will continue to work with iwi to investigate their preferred options.

"It is also important to be clear that current students in Rangahaua courses (including those in the Maori teacher education programme - Te Rangakura) can remain confident that provision will be made to enable them to complete their qualifications," Steve Maharey said.
