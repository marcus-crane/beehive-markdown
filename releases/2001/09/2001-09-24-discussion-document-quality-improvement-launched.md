Health Minister Annette King says system problems or failures, rather than individuals' actions, are often at the root of things going wrong in the health sector.

Launching the National Health Committee’s discussion document on quality improvement today, Safe Systems Supporting Safe Care, Mrs King said responsibility for safety and quality improvement in health rested not only with individuals, but with teams, organisations, national agencies and government.

“While there is some movement away from a focus on blaming individuals, more needs to be done to develop a system-wide culture of quality improvement."

Mrs King said the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000 required her to develop a quality improvement strategy for the health sector as a whole. The NHC’s discussion document is the first stage in that process.

The NHC is now seeking detailed submissions on the discussion paper from a wide range of individuals and organisations in the health sector. "It will consult with key organisations before delivering advice to me at the end of the year. This advice will provide the first stage in the development of the quality improvement strategy for the health sector.”

According to the discussion document, many quality activities have been initiated in the health sector, but in a fragmented and unstructured way.

“New Zealand lacks a coordinated systematic approach to guide quality issues in the health sector,” the document says. Instead, it says, there has been a tendency to blame individuals when things go wrong.

“Problems are not generally caused by one person’s actions, but by a combination of various actions and decisions from the system level to the individual level. By ‘system’, the NHC means the wider environment in which health care is practised. It includes health policy, legislation, political processes, Treaty relationships, and interrelationships between institutions and key players such as consumers and professional organisations.”

While its document has a national focus, the NHC emphasises that the greatest potential for implementing quality improvement is at the local level - with active involvement from health practitioners, consumers, managers and others.

“Significant quality improvement work is already occurring in the sector, and a national approach should build on these efforts,” the document says.

The NHC proposes five dimensions of quality - safety, effectiveness, efficiency, consumer responsiveness and access - and suggests that safety is especially important. The proposed model combines these five dimensions with a four-level approach, individual, team, organisation and system.

A key component of the model is Maori health “which crosses all levels and dimensions”, the document says.

Three priorities for action are identified: the need for a coordinated approach to quality improvement, strong leadership at all levels and greater consumer participation in quality improvement.

The NHC highlights the need for a united consumer voice that takes on a role of representing consumer interests across the board, through a new or existing organisation or through a national network of consumers.
