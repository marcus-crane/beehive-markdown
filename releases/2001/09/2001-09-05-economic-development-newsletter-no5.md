1 Jim Anderton announces - Business assistance and student employment package

On 16 August I announced a programme to help business and students. Called Snap, or the Student Needs Action Programme, the intention is to match up students with relevant skills to businesses to work over summer.

Ideally the students will get work relevant to their study, and employers will get specialist expertise in areas where special skills are needed. These could be web sites projects, marketing, reviews of policies, researching new products or a range of other areas of work.

Employment Minister Steve Maharey and I visited an employer who had hired a student part time. When she finished her study they gave her a full time position. This is the sort of arrangement this Government is promoting which helps both employers and students.

As well as encouraging employers to contact Student Job Search there will be up to 1000 new jobs in regions and industries where there will be piloting of different ways to match up business and students.

Snap will be piloted in Auckland, Hamilton, Gisborne and Invercargill, and there will be a pilot targeted to Maori in Canterbury as well as two industry-specific projects for manufacturing (lower North Island) and tourism (Northland) and two indepth initiatives matching students and employers in South Auckland and Waitakere.

The details of the programme can be obtained by visiting www.snap.govt.nz or ringing Student Job Search. Industry New Zealand and the Ministry of Economic Development are working on the programme with SJS and DWI.

In the next few months I will be inviting employers to identify special projects for which a student can be hired.

2Adult literacy receives $485,000 from economic development

The Minister for Industry and Regional Development Jim Anderton announced a total of $485,125 allocated to adult literacy in the Bay of Plenty, Wanganui/Manawatu and Hawkes Bay.

The projects will run from July 2001 to June 2002 and use local organisations and businesses working together. The aim is to raise the literacy, English language and numeracy skills of the local workforce.

"The skills shortages in regions and industries are occurring at the same time as we have skills shortages. If people can't read they can't take up skilled jobs," said Jim Anderton.

The initiative is being funded out of the Ministry of Economic Development. The programmes have been developed in close contact with Skill New Zealand and the Ministry of Education. It typifies the government's whole of government approach to complex issues and recognises that literacy is an education issue with implications for business and economic growth.

3$1.6m Government support for knowledge joint venture

Ericsson Synergy's New Zealand-based centre for the development of mobile internet applications could receive up to $1.6 million of government funding over the next three years, half of which will come from Industry New Zealand.

Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton, Research, Science and Technology Minister Pete Hodgson and Information Technology and Communications Minister Paul Swain announced the funding on 9 August.

The $1.6 million of funding is made up of $750,000 from Industry New Zealand's Major Investment Fund and possible funding on application of up to $850,000 from existing programmes provided by the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology.

The Major Investment Fund of Industry New Zealand supports significant new investment in New Zealand. It assists New Zealand and overseas investors to overcome barriers and reduce the costs of significant business expansion or setting up major new businesses in New Zealand. The Ericsson Synergy grant is the first from the fund.

4Forestry alcohol and drug dependency barriers to jobs

Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton is welcoming efforts to reduce alcohol and drug misuse in the forestry and wood processing industry.

An initiative has been announced by the East Coast Forestry Industry Group, Alcohol and Drug Free Workplaces Charter. The Charter includes education and rehabilitation. The Group is made up of key forestry companies on the East Coast.

The Charter follows work done on the Tairawhiti Development Taskforce and the Government initiated Wood Processing Industry Steering Group.

There are also union led education programmes to help workers identify their issues and support them in taking action.

"I am pleased that all parts of the wood processing industry are taking the lead on the issue of forestry workers with drug and alcohol dependency," said Jim Anderton.
