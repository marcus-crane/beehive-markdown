The Minister of Tourism Mark Burton will host the Lord Mayor of Brisbane Jim Soorley and his delegation during a visit to Wellington.

"Jim Soorley is aghast at the kiwi bashing that has occurred in Australia over the Ansett issue and has at his own volition decided to bring a high-powered delegation to Wellington to show support for New Zealand," Mark Burton said.

The Lord Mayor's delegation will hold a series of meetings on Monday with Government ministers, the Tourism Industry Association, Tourism New Zealand, Air New Zealand, and attend a dinner at Parliament hosted by the Prime Minister Helen Clark and Tourism Minister Mark Burton.

The delegation is due to arrive at Wellington Airport on an Air New Zealand flight from Brisbane, at 3.15pm on Sunday 30th September.

The delegation will be available for interviews with media at the airport.

A further media conference will be arranged on Monday afternoon.
