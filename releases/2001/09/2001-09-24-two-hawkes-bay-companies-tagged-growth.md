Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton announced two $100,000 grants to successful Hawkes Bay companies to help them make the region stronger.

The Business Growth Fund grants from Industry New Zealand are going to Napier based Rissington Breedline and Napier's Hygiene Designz.

"For our economy to grow and prosper we need our successful companies to grow and create jobs and export income.

"These two Hawke's Bay companies are excellent examples of innovative businesses using high technology to make themselves even better," said Jim Anderton.

The Business Growth Service was set up by the Labour/Alliance Coalition Government as part of Industry New Zealand and helps businesses take a leap to the next stage in their development. The Service offers advice and also can provide up to $100,000 for specified measures that will make a significant difference.

"Rissington Breedlines shows how primary industry can take hold of new technology to make themselves more competitive. This company is a sheep and cattle breeding business and is using DNA technology to tag their animals and increase productivity, and the size of their company.

"Hygiene Designz have looked at their business to see how they can do things better and are launching a new electronic linen hand-towel dispenser with significant export potential. Already they have obtained an international patent.  
Hygiene Designz is also making a significant contribution towards these costs and the company expects to create 35 jobs over the next three years," said Jim Anderton.

"Many New Zealand businesses are innovative with excellent ideas, but many lack capacity and capital to expand and become larger. Grants like this which are matched dollar for dollar by the company, will make significant returns to our economy.

Jim Anderton says the Hawke's Bay has a strong economy and he is looking forward to visiting the region. He has asked local Mayors and councils if he can reschedule a regional visit to the Hawke's Bay to 6 and 7 December.

"I urge all Hawke's Bay companies with innovative ideas that can contribute to our economic growth to contact Industry New Zealand to see how they can play their part in the jobs machine," said Jim Anderton.

The Business Growth Fund is one of the range of measures promised in the Alliance pre election policy "Partnership 2000" which outlined practical ways to create jobs and make the New Zealand economy perform better.

Over the next two years the company expects the number of employees to go from 20 to 30.
