Culturally appropriate health services are needed to care for the rapidly increasing number of older Pacific peoples, Associate Health Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

Releasing the draft Health of Older People Strategy in Christchurch, Ms Dyson said New Zealand, like most other countries in the world, has an ageing population, and the number of older Pacific peoples would increase dramatically in the next 50 years.

"By 2051, Pacific peoples aged 65 years and over are expected to make up 6.6 per cent of the total Pacific population living in New Zealand, compared with 1.3 per cent now. That is an increase of more than 400 per cent."

Ruth Dyson said the draft strategy provided a much-needed policy framework for the health care of older people, and set out a demanding work programme for planners, funders and providers over the next 10 years.

The provision of appropriate health and support services for older Pacific peoples and their families was one of its aims, she said.

"Over the next five years, the Ministry of Health will work with District Health Boards, focusing on the seven DHBs who have the largest Pacific populations in their regions, to meet the health needs of the rapidly increasing number of Pacific elders."

The seven DHBs are Auckland, Counties Manukau, Waitemata, Capital and Coast, Hutt Valley, Canterbury and Waikato.

"This work will be done in consultation with the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs, Pacific health workers and Pacific peoples themselves.

"It will include extending and improving culturally appropriate mainstream health and support services for Pacific elders, developing the Pacific health workforce and Pacific health providers, and focusing on health promotion and primary health care."

Ms Dyson said this work would be done alongside implementation of the Pacific Health and Disability Action Plan.

She said the overall aims of the Health of Older People Strategy were better coordination of health and support services around the needs of older people, a greater emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention, and more emphasis on community-level health care and support so that people could continue to stay in their own homes as they get older.

"By 2010, we want health services and programmes in place that promote the wellbeing of older people, their control over their lives, and their ability to participate in - and contribute to - social, family, whanau and community life."

A number of public meetings are being held around the country to discuss the draft Health of Older People Strategy, including fono in Porirua and Auckland (see attached timetable).

Written submissions close on 9 November. The final strategy will be released early in 2002, and implementation will be completed by 2010.

Copies of the draft Health of Older People Strategy, which includes a guide to making a submission, are available from the Ministry of Health, PO Box 5013, Wellington or on the website: www.moh.govt.nz
