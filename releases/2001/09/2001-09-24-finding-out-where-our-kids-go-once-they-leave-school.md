A new pilot programme launched today aims to answer the questions, 'where do our young people go when they leave school, and which ones need support to ensure that they get access to further education, training, or a job'.

Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey was in Porirua this afternoon to launch the Destinations and Tracking Pilot which is being jointly coordinated by Skill New Zealand and Career Services. He said too many young people fall into a ‘black hole’ once they’re not at school, in training or work. The destinations and tracking pilot programme will help government agencies to ‘get to know’ young people better so that they intervene positively in their lives at the earliest opportunity.

“Helping young people make successful transitions in their lives from schooling, into the worlds of further education and employment is hampered by a lack of information about their aspirations and the barriers to achievement they perceive.

“Household Labour Force Survey results for June show that over 15 percent of people aged 15 to 19 are unemployed. Around 6,000 young people identified themselves as ‘actively seeking work’ but still at school. Given that overall, unemployment has dropped to its lowest point since 1998, these figures are particular cause for concern.

“The Destinations and Tracking pilots being run in Porirua and Christchurch will close the information void on the barriers holding young people back so that more active support policies can be put in place.

“In Porirua the pilot will ask with over 900 senior students from the four local secondary schools about their plans for next year. A further 1,700 students will be surveyed from eight Christchurch secondary schools. CareerPoint (Career Services’ career information and advice freephone service) will follow up with the students next year to ask them what they actually did and provide targeted career information and advice.

“These pilot programmes have been developed in partnership with the Mayors’ Taskforce for Jobs. The Government continues to value the relationship we have with the Taskforce.

“Results from this project will be used in schools to enhance career education and will help to identify new ways to assist young people to move into work or further training. A report on the pilot project is due in June 2002 and consideration will be given to a nationwide expansion once this evaluation has been received,” Steve Maharey said.
