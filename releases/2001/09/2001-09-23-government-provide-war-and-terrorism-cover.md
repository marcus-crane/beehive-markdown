Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today that Air New Zealand will be provided by the Government with a $2 billion indemnity against acts of war and terrorism.

"Insurance companies have withdrawn their war and terrorism cover leaving all international airlines with no cover unless alternative means are found.

"The indemnity will be rolled over at monthly intervals until further notice.

"This action is unrelated to, and does not affect, the general situation that faces Air New Zealand or the Government's response to that situation," Dr Cullen said.
