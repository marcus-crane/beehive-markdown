The Minister of Maori Affairs, Hon Parekura Horomia, says that the Maori Television Service interim directors, just announced by the Electoral college, are high calibre and will bring diverse skills to the board.

The Minister was responding to the Electoral College's announcement that they had appointed Whaimutu Dewes, Hekia Parata, Craig Soper and Joanna Paul to the board of the Maori television service.

"As promised, these appointments were made solely by the Electoral College. I am pleased to see a broad ranges of views and abilities represented by these people and that can only mean good things for Maori television."

Mr Horomia said that the government has been considering nominations for the three Crown-appointed directors over the last month and he expects to announce them after Cabinet next week (17 September).

"I will continue to meet with the Minister of Finance, Hon Dr Michael Cullen, and the Chair of the Electoral College, Hone Harawira, to assist the smooth establishment of the Maori Television Service Board."
