In a speech to the third annual New Zealand CEO Summit in Queenstown today Paul Swain has outlined what the government is dong to help New Zealand become a leader in the knowledge economy.

"One of the most important thing we've done is to reject the old, last century thinking that governments have no role in economic development," Paul Swain said.

"They do. This government has rolled its sleeves up, and is working in partnership with business, tertiary institutions and communities to provide opportunities for all New Zealanders.

"Over the past 22 months we have set a number of initiatives in place.

"These include the Science and Innovation Council, Industry New Zealand, e-business initiatives for exporters through Trade New Zealand, the New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, the government business incubator support programme and the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission.

"There have also been government initiatives in the areas of education, immigration, e-commerce, e-government and telecommunications including work on broadband initiatives.

"It is notable that the government has made a concerted effort to forge linkages and partnerships with the private sector and the community in many of these initiatives. This is not about the government having all the answers. Instead it is about empowering the whole community to make a contribution.

"By working together we can build a better New Zealand - one where all can participate in the knowledge economy game," Paul Swain said.
