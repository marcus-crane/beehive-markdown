New school property funding for secondary schools will give Auckland a $7.3 million boost, says Minister Assisting the Prime Minister with Auckland Issues, Judith Tizard.

The funding to four Auckland schools is part of a new approach to school property that will see millions of additional dollars invested in the Auckland region.

Howick College, Avondale College, Glendowie College and Onehunga High School will receive a combined total of $7.3 million in additional funding this financial year due to the introduction of the new secondary school property guide.

Judith Tizard says she is delighted with the new funding which will see considerable benefits for both schools and the Auckland economy.

"The government is committed to improving the economic infrastructure of Auckland and this is a great example of that commitment," says Judith Tizard. "Not only is it beneficial for the schools concerned but it represents a considerable cash injection into the local economy. It's good news for local builders and contractors as well as for teachers and pupils.

"The benefits for Auckland will continue well into the future. Education is the cornerstone of a knowledge society, so any investment in schools is an investment in the development of excellence."

Education Minister Trevor Mallard says 19 schools around the country will benefit from the funding boost this financial year, with a further 20 schools expected to receive funding next year.
