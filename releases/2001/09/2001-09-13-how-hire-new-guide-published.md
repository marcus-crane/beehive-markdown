How to Hire ? new guide published

Making the experience of job appointments easier and more successful is the aim of a new publication released today.

Minister of Labour Margaret Wilson says the booklet ?Hiring new employees in the Employment Relations Act Environment - A guide for employers: Where to start, pitfalls to avoid, practical examples? will be a valuable tool. It will be available in printed form and on the Employment Relations Service website www.ers.dol.govt.nz.

?It's the second in a series of publications designed to improve workplace relationships by providing ?best practice? guidance,? said Margaret Wilson.

?This publication also responds directly to the call of the Ministerial Panel on Business Compliance Costs for more information to be made available to business on good faith, and the requirements when hiring casual staff.

?The booklet provides useful plain language advice on a range of issues that employers may face during the hiring process, from the time they decide to look for new staff to the time when employment agreements are completed.

"Employers have asked for this sort of "best practice" guide, and we know that many problems in the workplace develop from simple errors at the time of hiring. The first publication in this series, Employment Relationship Problems: What they are, How to prevent them, How to fix them, has been well received. This booklet is also expected to be popular".
