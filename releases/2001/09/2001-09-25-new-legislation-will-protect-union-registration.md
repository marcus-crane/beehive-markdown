Tuesday, 25 September 2001Media Statement

The Minister of Labour says unions and employers affected by the Court of Appeal ruling on union registration can be confident that their actions taken in good faith will be protected by amending legislation.

“I will bring recommendations to Cabinet on Monday for legislation. The outcome will be that unions and employers will be unaffected by the Court of Appeal decision. The legislation will validate all applications and registration decisions made prior to 2 October 2000. Actions taken by unions and employers in the belief that the unions were properly registered will have legal protection.

“It would be quite wrong for unions and employers to have the arrangements they have made in good faith affected by a technicality of registration date. This is why amending legislation will be retrospective.

“In the meantime, the Employment Relations Service of the Department of Labour will assist unions and employers acting in good faith to remedy the situation as it affects them”.
