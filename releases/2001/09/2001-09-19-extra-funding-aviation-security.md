The Government has agreed to give extra funding to the Aviation Security Service to boost their ability to screen domestic air travellers, Transport Minister Mark Gosche said today.

As a result of the terrorist attacks in the United States last week domestic passengers are now being screened at seven New Zealand airports – Auckland, Hamilton, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin and Queenstown, with Rotorua preparing for screening. Defence personnel have been assisting Aviation Security Service staff with the screening since Saturday morning.

Mr Gosche said the extra $3.21 million would allow the Aviation Security Service to buy more x-ray machines, and would also cover the extra costs of the screening until 15 December.

Between now and then the temporary domestic screening provisions would be reviewed and consideration would be given to permanent arrangements, Mr Gosche said.

The screening was going smoothly and was being well received by the public, he said.

"While it is a slight inconvenience people understand that it is very necessary, and many find it reassuring."
