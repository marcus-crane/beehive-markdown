Conservation Minister Sandra Lee today announced appointments to the Chatham Islands Conservation Board, effective from the start of this month.

"Conservation Boards are independent bodies that give the Department of Conservation direct imput on local issues, " she said. "They play an important role in matching conservation policies with community needs and provide a way for local people to be part of conservation decisions affecting where they live.

"The government has set aside a record $226.35m to spend on conservation throughout New Zealand during the 2001/02 year," Ms Lee said. "Some of this funding will filter down to Conservancy project work and strategies which will be subject to local Conservation Board oversight."

"I am confident this mix of re-appointed board members and sitting members will provide strong and sound advice to DOC on the Chatham Islands.

“I am pleased to announce that Phil Seymour, Donna Gregory-Hunt and Antoinette Day have been re-appointed for a further three years," Ms Lee said.

Wellington Conservator, Allan Ross, said that the relationship between the Chatham Islands Conservation Board and the Department was different than that on the mainland.

"DoC staff on the islands, and board members, have a greater inter-action with the community than in the rest of New Zealand,” he said. “This is because so much of the department’s work is with species which do not respect boundaries between private land and public conservation land, and because the community is interested in and well-informed about conservation issues."

These three members join seven other members maintaining the total board membership at ten.

Phil Seymour has been the chairperson of the board for the last two years and has spent three years on the board to date.

Donna Gregory-Hunt and Antoinette Day have both completed just one year on the board having been appointed last year as replacements for resigning members.

Continuing members are Ann Hough, Denis Solomon, Alison Turner and Hohepa Tapara all of Chatham Island, Ken Lanauze and James Moffett of Pitt Island, and Dr. Peter Johnson of Dunedin.
