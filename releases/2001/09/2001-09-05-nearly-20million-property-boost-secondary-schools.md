Nineteen secondary schools around the country will receive a big boost in property funding this financial year following the release today of the new secondary school property guide.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard visited Tawa College in Wellington today to announce the new guide. Tawa College will receive nearly $1 million to bring the school's property up to the standard in the new guide. Eighteen other schools around the country will receive property boosts in this financial year worth, in total, nearly $20 million.

It is expected about a further 20 schools will receive funding next year to address code deficiencies under the new guide.

The new property guide for year 9 - 13 (forms 3 - 7) schools, takes effect immediately, and provides, on average, a 24% increase in entitlement compared to the old property code. The new guide replaces the old code developed some thirty years ago.

It will provide schools with the flexibility to organise their property within their total net entitlement area.

"The Government is committed to a fair property programme for schools which will help them provide opportunity for excellence for their students," Trevor Mallard said.

"The new guide recognises the needs of the modern secondary school and diversity in the sector. We can't afford to have outmoded rules which group all schools under the same setup," Trevor Mallard said.

"Things have changed. The curriculum has been updated. Different schools now want to do different things for their students, and the surroundings have to complement each school's individual needs."

"Under the new guide New Zealand secondary schools will compare very favourably with those overseas.

"Roll growth will mean that the new guide will continue to provide secondary schools with benefits into the future.

"Schools not eligible for increased area through the code deficiency programme will gain by increased modernisation funding. This is being adjusted effective from 1 July 2001."

The primary school property guide was updated in 1999, while the guides for other types of schools (including intermediates, forms 1-7 schools and area schools) are also being reviewed.
