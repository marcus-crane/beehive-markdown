QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER  
Regional Development--Investment  
1\. GRANT GILLON (The Alliance) to the Minister for Industry and Regional Development: What positive responses has he received to Government plans to provide improved services to those living in regional New Zealand by way of new investment?  
Hon. SANDRA LEE (Minister of Conservation), on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Regional Development: One profitable new investment that the Government is providing for regional New Zealanders is a new bank. The Minister has received reports of very positive responses to this plan from the new chairman of the bank, the immediate past-leader of the National Party, Mr Bolger. He said: \`\`Communities of New Zealand feel they are missing out in the \`brave new world', and they want to feel they are important. I believe they're important, and I hope the bank can assist them in feeling that they are important.''  
Grant Gillon: Did the new chairman of the bank give any indication of the importance of the bank to regional communities in areas of New Zealand that the National Party claimed to represent, when Mr Bolger was their leader?  
Hon. SANDRA LEE: I have seen a report from Mr Bolger saying he is concerned that communities felt isolated, ignored, and pushed to one side, and that we as a society have to be conscious of that. He said the bank and New Zealand Post can assist communities to understand that people are concerned about them, too.  
Hon. Bill English: Did the Government show the new chairman all the official papers that say this bank is a dog, and did they show him the business plan that shows that the new bank will open in only nine places around New Zealand where there are not already banks?  
Hon. SANDRA LEE: All the reports show this bank is viable, including the report by Cameron and Company that shows very clearly that, given five different scenarios, in every case the bank would be viable. For the benefit of the National Opposition, I rely on the words of Jim Bolger: \`\`If this bank is not going to work, why would the directors and senior managers of New Zealand Post want it? Why would they want to do something if it was manifestly going to fail? And if the arch-critics believe it was going to fail, why would they just sit back and wait for it to fail?  
Hon. Dover Samuels: Did the new chairman of the bank make any comment about the Government's investment in that bank?  
Hon. SANDRA LEE: The new chairman pointed out that the commercial case for the bank has been made by very professional management staff at New Zealand Post, going back over a number of years. He accepted his appointment only after seeking advice and information, and scrutinising the proposal very closely over an extended period. The former leader of the National Party obviously accepts that it is a very good idea.  
Rodney Hide: Could the Minister explain to the House, and to the people of New Zealand, why elderly people in New Zealand should have any faith in a bank chaired by a man who promised them: \`\`No ifs; no buts; no maybes--the surcharge will go!'', and who then reneged on that promise?  
Hon. SANDRA LEE: Perhaps the question would be better put: can the people of New Zealand have any faith in a political party that supported that man's party when it was in Government, making appalling decisions for the people of New Zealand.  
RODNEY HIDE: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I seek leave to answer the question--  
Mr SPEAKER: No, no. The member knows full well that that is not a point of order. Points of order are points of order. I make an apology to the Green Party; I did not note that this was one of the questions they want to ask a supplementary question on. They are always good enough to indicate which ones they have within their quota, and I intend to call Sue Bradford.  
Sue Bradford: Given Mr Bolger's record in terms of the treatment of unemployed people and beneficiaries in the 1990s, does the Minister really think that Mr Bolger will convey a positive image to the type of customers the Alliance has previously said that it wanted to attract to the bank?  
Hon. SANDRA LEE: The Alliance obviously did not support all the political decisions made by the National Party when it was in Government, including those of Mr Bolger. However, that former Prime Minister of New Zealand has had a long track record of public service, has carefully examined the attributes of this very wise investment, and is keen to see the light and take a lead.
