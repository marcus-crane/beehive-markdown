Pop music in New Zealand is being given an official boost under initiatives announced tonight by the Associate Minister of Education, Marian Hobbs, at the national Rockquest finals in Wellington.

Ministry of Education funding of $1.325 million over four years has been allocated to the Music Industry Commission to promote New Zealand contemporary popular music and to assist with the implementation of the Arts Curriculum which gives renewed focus to performance arts.

Marian Hobbs said one initiative will provide for professional musicians and performers to act as mentors to teachers and students and conduct workshops, seminars and performances in participating schools.

"This will assist teachers and students to grow in their music literacy and develop young songwriters, composers and performers," Marian Hobbs said. "The programme will also help students in Music and Performing Arts meet requirements of the National Certificate of Educational Achievement."

A second initiative is for a School Band Partnering Programme that builds on the strengths of Rockquest.

"Regional finalist bands will be matched with professional bands who will provide support as well as performing at a school concert and share experiences, knowledge and skills," Marian Hobbs said.

Students and teachers can also look forward to the provision of free music education resources including a CD Rom featuring a variety of New Zealand music genres and access to a music DVD/Video package providing a snapshot of New Zealand culture.

"Young groups participating in the rockquest are the future of the NZ music industry. The programmes announced tonight will let them learn directly from musicians who are involved and achieving at local and national levels. The success of these young musicians highlights the increasing vibrancy of the New Zealand music industry and that the Ministry recognises it as a career option," Marian Hobbs said.
