Mäori Affairs Minister, Hon Parekura Horomia said the Government has resolved to begin negotiations with the owners of the Mäori Reserved Lands to address the issue of past rental losses.

As part of the passage of the 1997 reforms to Mäori Reserved Land, Parliament resolved unanimously to address the question of the past rental losses to the owners of this land. “

"For many years the rents they could charge were restricted and 21 year rental review periods meant those rents declined quickly in value during a time of high inflation,” said Mr Horomia.

“I will be working with my colleagues the Minister of Finance and the Minister for Industry and Regional Development to develop options. We hope that a resolution to this long-standing issue can be achieved, said Mr Horomia.

“We have appointed Mr Ray Chappell, who has had a lengthy involvement with this issue, to lead the negotiations from the Government side. Negotiations are expected to begin shortly.

These negotiations are intended to complete the reform process by which the leases of Mäori reserved land are placed on a commercial basis for the first time.

The negotiations will deal with their rental losses suffered by the owner organisations that administer the reserved lands. These organisations include the Wakatu Incorporation, the Mawhera Incorporation, the Paraninihi ki Waitotara Incorporation and the Wellington and Palmerston North Tenths Trusts.
