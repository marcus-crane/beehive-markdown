Anyone who thinks that schools are 'dumbing down' their lessons should take a look at the new "Figure it Out" series of maths books, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

Trevor Mallard visited Jean Batten School in Mangere to launch eight resource books as part of the "Figure it Out" series. The books are aimed at better maths teaching and learning in year six (standard four).

"They're challenging, fun, and relevant to things children are interested in as well as our objectives to improve numeracy levels," Trevor Mallard said.

The books cover number, measurement, geometry, algebra, statistics, basic facts, and problem solving. There is also a theme booklet "Sport" in the new mathematics series that includes activities covering a wide variety of sport and fitness activities like golf, skateboarding, waka ama and the America's Cup. Note: Try some examples on the next page.

"A few years ago, international surveys of maths learning showed that New Zealand had to lift its game. This series is one of the initiatives helping us improve standards across the board," Trevor Mallard said.

"This is a key element of the Literacy and Numeracy strategy. The recent national education monitoring report showed how much our junior school literacy is improving. This series builds on excellent numeracy development in junior classes and brings the excitement to older children.

"Our maths standards will be rising too as teachers use the material in their classrooms as part of the comprehensive new approach".

Trevor Mallard said feedback showed that teachers, pupils, and parents were all impressed with the "Figure It Out" series.

Reach for the Sky Activity (from Sport)

The Feisty Fabrics company make sports uniforms. They have to outfit a basketball team called the Nikau Knights.

Here are the heights of the team members: Stretch - 2.00 metres; Long John - 1.91m; Shorty - 1.75m; Bounce - 1.92m; Hoop - 2.1m; Dribble - 1.8m; Dunk 1.93m; Skyscraper - 2.15m; Giraffe - 2.11m.

1\. Feisty Fabrics have to make a 'one size fits all' set of tops and shorts for the team.

a. Measure your classmates' heights, backs and waist-to-knee lengths to estimate the likely back and waist-to-knee length of each Nikau Knights player.  
b. Work with a classmate to make a variety of graphs to record this data. Discuss which graph you think is most useful for estimating the measurements of the Nikau Knights players.

2.Discuss with your classmate whether you would use the mode, the median, or the mean to decide how long to make the tops and shorts.

Finding a Way (from Problem Solving)

Every morning that she makes her bed, Aroha earns 5 cents pocket money. Every morning that she forgets, her parents take away 20 cents from her pocket money. At the end of the first month, Aroha has a balance of only 30 cents. How many days were in that month?

Snap (from Problem Solving)

Melanie dropped a rubber ball off the top of the 27-metre-high building. Each time the ball landed, it bounced two-thirds of the height of the previous bounce. So the first bounce was two-thirds of 27 metres. How high was the fourth bounce?
