Former Prime Minister and New Zealand's current ambassador in Washington, Jim Bolger, has been appointed to the Board of New Zealand Post Ltd.

The Minister for State-Owned Enterprises Mark Burton confirmed the appointment today.

"Board appointments are not usually commented on by shareholding ministers," Mark Burton said.

"However, Michael Cullen and I acknowledge that there is a high level of public interest in New Zealand Post.

"We are delighted that such a prominent New Zealander has agreed to serve on the Board of New Zealand Post Ltd," Mark Burton said.

"Jim Bolger brings a range of skills and a great deal of experience which will be of enormous benefit to one of our largest state-owned companies.

"Shareholding Ministers anticipate that next year he will follow Ross Armstrong as the chair of New Zealand Post.

"We are in no doubt of Jim Bolger's ability to offer strong leadership," Mark Burton said.
