Financial statements of the Government  
for the Year Ended 30 June 2001

The Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand for the year ended 30 June 2001 were released by the Treasury today. The key results were as follows:

Year ended 30 June 2001  
$ millionActualBEFU ForecastVariance  
Operating balance1,409641768  
OBERAC2,1071,650457  
Net worth11,46310,581882  
Net Crown debt19,97120,432(461)

The $1.4 billion surplus was $768 million higher than projected in the 2001 Budget.  
The major components of the $768 million variance were:  
· taxation revenue which was $252 million above forecast mainly due to net other persons tax ($116 million) and Goods and Services Tax ($84 million) being ahead of forecast;  
· expenses which were $94 million below forecast mainly due to valuation movements including a lower than forecast GSF unfunded liability revaluation ($298 million) which was partially offset by a higher than forecast National Provident Fund revaluation ($206 million).  
· SOE/CE surplus, which was $383 million above forecast mainly due to a decrease in the ACC outstanding claims liability ($287 million). The remaining variance of $96 million was spread throughout the SOEs and Crown entities.  
The OBERAC strips out revaluations and accounting policy changes (including ACC, GSF and NPF valuations discussed above) to provide a measure of underlying financial stewardship. The improvement in the OBERAC was mainly due to the improved tax revenue and SOE/CE surplus.  
The improvement in Net worth was $882 million largely due to the flow-on effects of the improved operating balance  
Net Crown debt was $461 million lower than forecast mainly due to:  
· the cash flow impacts of the improved operating balance ($281 million)  
· lower than forecast purchase of physical assets ($87 million)  
· lower than forecast capital injections to hospitals ($60 million).  
Net Crown debt was 18.1% of GDP at 30 June, compared to a forecast of 18.5%.
