State Services Minister Trevor Mallard has this afternoon hit out at the open cheque book industrial relations policy of the National Party.

Trevor Mallard said National seems to be suggesting that the answer to every industrial negotiations is to pay up at the first hint of industrial action.

"In three Parliamentary questions today - involving corrections, health, and education - National Party MPs pushed for more money to meet industrial demands. The country can not afford for us to cave in to all demands as National desires.

"This Government has kept its word and is addressing the legacy of many years of conflict and neglect that dominated the approach to state sector employment in the 1990s.

"Rebuilding a rewarding state sector career structure needs more than short term fixes. It involves training and development, staffing levels, effective workplace partnerships, competitive pay rates and good employer policies.

"This cannot be done over night and most state sector workers recognise this. We are working constructively for the longer term which is something beyond the comprehension of most National Party MPs," Trevor Mallard.
