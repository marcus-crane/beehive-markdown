It's official - Pitt Island School is the country's most isolated.

In the South Island, the title goes to Jacob's River School while in the North Island, it's Te Hapua in the Far North.

The Government today announced details of the new Targeted Funding for Isolation system. It uses an Isolation Index to determine which schools are eligible for funding to recognise their isolation. It replaces Targeted Rural Funding.

"It is a fairer system that more accurately reflects a school's relative isolation. Every school is given an isolation index rating rather than just the crude 'in or out' system that currently operates.

"The Government will put $6.8 million into the isolation funding. It is not a significant increase, but it is being distributed more equitably.

"The change means an increase in the number of schools eligible. Nearly 250 new schools will in future qualify for the funding because of their distance from core population centres. However, some of the schools currently receiving targeted rural funding will no longer be eligible, while others will have this element of their funding reduced. In total there will be 578 schools eligible for targeted funding for isolation next year.

"Many of these schools that have been brought into the scheme are on the East Coast of the North Island, or on the West Coast of the South Island. Until now, they have not been classified as isolated.

Trevor Mallard said the Isolation Index recognised that a school's operating costs increased in relation to its distance from centres of 5,000, 20,000 and 100,000 people.

A school within easy reach of a population centre of at least 5,000 people could access basic service people such as an electrician or a plumber. When the population centre was over 20,000 people, a school could generally expect access to some professional development and financial services. However, schools near a centre of 100,000 people had the advantage of a full range of the services they needed to deliver the curriculum, including information and communications technology services and a complete complement of professional development services.

"The problem with the current criteria is that they don't recognise any relative degree of isolation, such as whether a school is 25 minutes' drive from Christchurch or two hours from even the smallest service centre. The new Index will provide a fairer measure of isolation and will be a step forward in determining relative remoteness."

"A bit of extra cash helps make it easier for isolated schools to obtain the goods and services that are more readily accessible to other schools. Other commitments to help isolated schools include nationally co-ordinated advisory services to support principals and teachers. Having to pay to access such services is beyond the budget of most small isolated schools," Trevor Mallard said.

Information on how individual schools may be affected by the change is included in letters being sent this week with the indicative operational funding entitlements.  
There is also transitional funding available to help many schools losing funds. Small, isolated schools losing funds will also be entitled to a supplementary grant to further smooth the transition to TFI.
