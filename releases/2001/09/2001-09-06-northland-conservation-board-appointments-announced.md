Conservation Minister Sandra Lee today announced appointments to the Northland Conservation Board, effective from the start of this month.

"Conservation Boards are independent bodies that give the Department of Conservation direct imput on local issues, " she said. "They play an important role in matching conservation policies with community needs and provide a way for local people to be part of conservation decisions affecting where they live.

"The government has set aside a record $226.35m to spend on conservation throughout New Zealand during the 2001/02 year," Ms Lee said. "Some of this funding will filter down to Conservancy project work and strategies which will be subject to local Conservation Board oversight."

"I am confident this mix of appointed and re-appointed board members and sitting members will provide strong and sound advice to DOC's Northland Conservancy.

“I am pleased to announce that Fiona Bannister and Jane Allan are the new appointments, while Maxine Shortland and Geoff Wightman have been re-appointed.

New members:  
Jane Allan, currently President/Chair of the Tohoraha Maori Women’s Welfare League, is joining the Board from Pukenui in the Far North for a three-year term. Describing herself as a home maker and facilitator, she has a firm commitment to conservation. Her strong iwi affiliations in Northland will add value to the networking abilities of the Board.

Fiona Bannister, a para-legal from Kaikohe, member of the Ngawha Geo Power Station Liaison Committee, is joining the Board for a three-year term. She has a science background and affiliations with Ngapuhi and other Maori tribes.

Re-appointed members:  
Maxine Shortland from Russell has been with the Board since September 1998, during which time her personal passion for conservation issues combined with her involvement as a community board member and her strong Maori networking links have enhanced the advocacy component of conservation work.

Geoff Whiteman, farmer, nursery-man and woodworker from Kaikohe, who has been an accomplished, “hands on” practical conservationist for many years, joined the Board last year and returns for a full three-year term, providing valuable support in advancing conservation outcomes, both practically and philosophically.

These 4 members join six current members, bringing the total members to 10.

Ms Lee thanked the retiring member, Richard Alspach, for his energy and passion as a member of the Board.

Current members are:  
Kevin Evans, an ostrich farmer from Ruawai, who is an active member of a variety of organisations and societies involved in species and habitat protection, with a particular passion for the endangered Brown Teal  
Kerikeri resident Atareiria Hei Hei, whose keen interest in conservation issues culminated in her currently completing a Bachelor of Applied Science with double Major in natural resource management degree at Massey University.  
the present chairperson of the Board since 1999, Derek Keene, an engineer by profession, who has been involved in local government in Whangarei for the past twenty years.  
eco-tourism operator Lewis Ritchie from Whangarei, a published author of numerous reports, papers and articles focussing on fisheries and marine conservation  
Georgina Stewart from Whangarei with strong Iwi affiliations, an active member of Forest & Bird Protection Society and secondary school teacher, proficient in te reo Maori me ona tikanga
