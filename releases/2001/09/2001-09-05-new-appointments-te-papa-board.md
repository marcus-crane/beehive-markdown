Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that Mark Solomon and Josie Karanga have been appointed to the Museum of New Zealand board.

The two new appointments replace Rikirangi Gage and Professor Mason Durie, who are both stepping down after their terms expired recently.

"Mark Solomon and Josie Karanga bring valuable skills to the board of the museum.

"Mark Solomon is the chair of Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu and has a great deal of expertise as a leader and manager. In a broader sense, he has a good deal of experience in the community in his involvement in sports and whanau committees.

"Josie Karanga, of Palmerston North, is a strategic planning facilitator with governance bodies of Maori organisations. She also has a professional background in teaching with involvement in the Kohanga Reo and Kura Kaupapa sectors.

"I would like to thank Rikirangi Gage and Professor Mason Durie for the contribution to the museum during their terms on the board," Helen Clark said.

Mark Solomon and Josie Karanga have each been appointed for three years terms which expire on 31 July 2004.
