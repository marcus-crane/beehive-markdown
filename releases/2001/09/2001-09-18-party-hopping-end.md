Associate Justice Minister Margaret Wilson today introduced a Supplementary Order Paper to give effect to government plans to end party hopping.

The proposals have the support of the government and New Zealand First and have already been outlined by the Prime Minister.

Under the Electoral (Integrity) Bill now before Parliament, MPs who write to the Speaker advising that they have resigned from their parties must leave Parliament.

The Government Supplementary Order Paper ensures that any MP who leaves his or her party or otherwise acts in a way that distorts the proportionality of political party representation in Parliament will cease to be a Member of Parliament.

"This law means that the intentions of the electorate of more than two million voters cannot be undermined for years by the actions of individuals. This will build public confidence in the stability of the New Zealand parliamentary system. The people's choice must be respected," said Margaret Wilson.
