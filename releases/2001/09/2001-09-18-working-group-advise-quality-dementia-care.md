A working group has been established to advise the Ministry of Health on improving the safety and quality of care for people with dementia in residential, respite and day services.

The group will hold its first meeting in Wellington tomorrow, Wednesday, 19 September.

Associate Minister of Health Ruth Dyson said the working group had been set up following concerns about the quality of some dementia care services.

"Older people with dementia are very vulnerable, and it is essential they receive the best possible care and support," Ms Dyson said.

Dr Hazel Lewis has been appointed as project manager of the group, which is made up of service providers, health professionals and other representatives from the aged care sector.

The group's terms of reference will be finalised at tomorrow's meeting. However, issues to be discussed include:  
staff training and skills;  
providing a safe and appropriate environment for people with dementia;  
involving family members in the planning and provision of residents' care; and  
use of medication and restraint procedures.

The group's final report is expected by the end of the year.
