Matt Robson launched his own web site today. The address is www.robsononline.co.nz .

"The site is intended to be a place were people can find out what's happening in the areas of law and order, courts, disarmament and overseas aid, and other portfolio areas.

"It is also an informal venue to discuss issues and current thinking. I'd like to think people will visit it regularly just to see what's going on.

"Content will change weekly. There will be a weekly poll, a chat room and much more," Matt Robson said.

Today Foreign Affairs Minister, Phil Goff and Minister in charge of Aid, Matt Robson announced a new semi-autonomous body for the delivery of New Zealand aid, separate from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
