Conservation Minister Sandra Lee today announced appointments to the Nelson-Marlborough Conservation Board, effective from the start of this month.

"Conservation Boards are independent bodies that give the Department of Conservation direct imput on local issues, " she said. "They play an important role in matching conservation policies with community needs and provide a way for local people to be part of conservation decisions affecting where they live.

"The government has set aside a record $226.35m to spend on conservation throughout New Zealand during the 2001/02 year," Ms Lee said. "Some of this funding will filter down to Conservancy project work and strategies which will be subject to local Conservation Board oversight."

"I am confident this mix of appointed and re-appointed board members and sitting members will provide strong and sound advice to DOC's Nelson-Marlborough Conservancy.

"Three are new appointments, and two members have been reappointed. "

New members:

Bill Gilbertson, a Nelson builder, is formerly from the West Coast and served for six years on the West Coast Conservation Board (1990-1996). He also served on the West Coast Park and Reserves Board for six years (1984-1990) and has had a long association with the Royal Forest and Bird Society including a period as national Deputy President.

Harley McNabb, of Karamea, has been appointed for a one-year term to complete the balance of his three-year appointment to the West Coast/Tai Poutini Conservation Board. Mr McNabb, a semi-retired dairy farmer, provides representation for the Karamea region on the Nelson/Marlborough board which has responsibility for Kahurangi National Park.

Glenice Paine, of Picton, is the Resource Management Officer for Te Atiawa Trust and has good knowledge of the region’s coastal marine area. She has affiliations with iwi including Te Atiawa and Ngai Tahu.

Reappointed members:

Robin Manson, a Takaka diary farmer, is the current board chairman and has been on the board for three years.

Graeme Coates, of Blenheim, is currently the board’s deputy chairman. He is a company manager with links to the marine farming industry and has been on the board since 1998.

"Two Ngai Tahu nominees to the board have also been appointed. "

Maurice Manawatu, of Kaikoura, has been reappointed and Darcia Solomon, also of Kaikoura, has rejoined the board to replace Wiremu “Bill” Solomon who died earlier this year.

Mrs Solomon had previously been on the board for 10 years before retiring from the position last year.

All these members have been appointed for a three-year term except for Mr McNabb whose previous three-year appointment expires in 12 months’ time.

These seven members join five current members bringing the total members to 12.

Ms Lee thanked the retiring member Robyn Reid for her energy and passion as a board member.

Current members of the board are Colin McNab, Edwin Pitts, and Kath Hemi, all of Blenheim, and Andy Dennis and Ropata Taylor, both of Nelson.
