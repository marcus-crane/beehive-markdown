18 September 2001Media Statement  
Reducing Vehicle Emissions  
Most imported vehicles will now be required to meet international vehicle emission standards, Transport Minister Mark Gosche announced today.

Under the proposal, out for public consultation today, imported vehicles made since 1990 could be registered here only if manufactured in compliance with the emissions standards of either Japan, the United States, the European Union or Australia.

“Vehicle emissions are a major source of health problems including asthma, heart disease and bronchitis” Mr Gosche said.

"This new rule is part of the answer to those problems. While many imports currently coming into New Zealand already meet these standards, others are made to much lower standards and some have no emissions standards applied at all during manufacture. This proposal will ensure that New Zealand doesn't become the dumping ground for vehicles that are not up to scratch environmentally."

The new rule will apply to all imports – new and used - including trucks. It will build on the New Zealand motor vehicle industry’s voluntary agreement that requires only new cars to comply with the relevant emissions standards.

Submissions close on 30 November and the rule is expected to come into force on May 1 next year. Vehicles already registered then will not be affected.

"This will be the first time that standards for vehicle emissions have been set in regulation. It is effectively putting a line in the sand by saying that nothing less than these standards will be acceptable. That gives us a strong foundation to build on in future."

"The rule isn't the whole answer though. The problems associated with vehicle emissions need an integrated package of solutions to fix them."

Other measures currently underway to address the effects of emissions include:

·the "10 second rule" for smoky vehicles which from earlier this month can result in fines for vehicles belching smoke;

·the introduction of more stringent border checks and improved safety standards to improve the quality of second hand vehicles imported into New Zealand. The government has consulted the public on these proposals recently and they are likely to come into effect by mid-2002.

·The Ministry of Transport is now working with air quality and health experts from around the country to study the New Zealand implications of international information on the health implications of vehicle emissions. The results of this work will feed directly into the current government review of the vehicle fuel specifications, and into future transport policy.

“We will also be looking again at other ways to address vehicle emissions that until now have not been considered cost-effective. These may extend from simply finding ways of identifying the worst offenders to an emissions level check in an expanded WoF/CoF check, and could include requiring regular in-service maintenance.”

Does New Zealand have existing vehicle emissions standards?

At present, there are no specific legal requirements setting out vehicle construction standards for exhaust emissions in New Zealand transport law, regulations or rules.

However, as of March this year, improved regulations have been implemented that are designed to address the issue of excessively smoky vehicles on the road. This regulation has been referred to as the "10 second rule". The 10 second rule does not address vehicle construction standards - it focuses on improving vehicle operation.

What standards will the proposed rule cover?

The proposed rule incorporates emissions standards applicable in Japan, Australia, United States (Federal standards) and the European Union (EU/UN-ECE). Most of New Zealand’s imported fleet comes from these jurisdictions, with Japan being the predominant source of both light and heavy, new and used vehicles.

What does this rule propose?

Under this rule a motor vehicle would be registered in New Zealand only if it complies, or is deemed to comply on the date of manufacture, with emissions standards applicable in one of the four jurisdictions listed above. A vehicle will also comply if it can be ‘type approved’ (ie. it is one of an approved model range) for one of those four jurisdictions.

Vehicle certifiers would have to obtain evidence that one of the following two tests had been met:  
·compliance with a listed standard  
·type approval for release in one of the four jurisdictions.

In the absence of clear evidence showing a vehicle meets a specific emission standard at the time of manufacture, the certifier could consider evidence of ‘homologation’ or type approval. If the vehicle type (model) manufactured for that year was given type approval for release in one of those four jurisdictions, it could be assumed to meet applicable standards in that jurisdiction. This would be taken as evidence of meeting the requirements of the Emissions Rule.

Why is this proposed rule needed?

New Zealand must keep pace with global developments in emissions control.

In 1997 the New Zealand motor industry adopted a voluntary agreement requiring all new imported cars to comply with emissions standards in their country of origin.

The draft rule will formalise and build on this agreement. It will ensure that all future new and used light and heavy vehicles coming into New Zealand are manufactured to international exhaust emissions standards.

Why hasn’t New Zealand created its own emissions standards?

New Zealand emissions standards are not necessary because:

·Improvements in emission and engine technologies are being driven by overseas standards and environmental obligations. Where they apply, these deliver air quality improvements and will continue to do so.

·New Zealand is an importer of vehicle technology, and new vehicles entering the fleet increasingly reflect international emissions specifications.

·New Zealand is a very small market and adopting stringent standards here would have little impact on the speed of technological change from vehicle manufactures to limit emissions. It could, however, have major impacts on whether or not vehicles are supplied to the New Zealand market, and on the cost of those vehicles.

·The trend is towards a global standards regime based on European standards.

New Zealand has adopted a ‘smorgasbord’ policy approach to vehicle standards. In many areas relating to motor vehicle safety, we accept the standards of Australia, the European Community, Japan and the United States. Our main supply markets for vehicles and vehicle parts are those countries which recognise and apply the standards from these four jurisdictions.

What is the statutory basis for the rule?

The Land Transport Act 1998 which provides for the Minister of Transport to produce Land Transport Rules which govern safety or licensing of vehicles.

Section 155(a) of that Act states that rules may set out standards and requirements concerning vehicle emissions and environmental requirements. In developing rules the Minister must consider the risks to land transport safety, alignment with world best practice and benefits and costs.

Has the rule been consulted on before?

In 1997 the Vehicle Fleet Emissions Control Strategy (VFECS) addressed vehicle emissions and their contribution to New Zealand’s air quality. VFECS was developed in consultation with government departments, transport and road controlling authorities, air quality scientists and managers, the vehicle and fuel industry, environmental groups and the public.

In 1998 the Government published its Vehicle Fleet Emissions Control Strategy – Final Report and submissions relating specifically to this proposal were received in the following year.

Most submissions supported the concept. The main area of concern was the potential impact on older vehicles and classic cars. This rule would not penalise these groups because it only applies to vehicles built from 1990. Classic and vintage vehicles do not fall into this category. (See also the question on page 4 - Will the rule apply to vehicles of all ages imported into New Zealand?)

What is the procedure for developing the proposed rule?

Submissions received on the public consultation (yellow) draft will be summarised and considered by the Ministry of Transport. The rule will then be finalised for presentation to the Minister of Transport and Cabinet for approval.

When is the proposed rule likely to come into force?

The proposed Vehicle Emissions rule is due to come into force on 1 May 2002.

How do I have my say and join the consultation process?

We welcome your interest and involvement in the rule making process. To make comments on the proposed rule, please read the page entitled ‘Information on Submissions’ in the overview document that can be accessed on the Internet at www.transport.govt.nz.

The deadline for submissions is 30 November 2001.

What impact will this proposed rule have on the Warrant of Fitness (WoF) and Certificate of Fitness (CoF) regimes?

The rule would not affect vehicles already registered in New Zealand. Continuing compliance with the vehicle’s original construction standard would not be required by the proposed rule.

What classes of vehicle are affected?

The proposed rule would apply to both new and used light and heavy motor vehicles when they first enter the New Zealand fleet. The primary focus of the rule is on petrol and diesel-fuelled vehicles.

The proposed rule would cover emission systems in:  
·passenger cars  
·forward-control and off-road passenger vehicles  
·buses and goods service vehicles.

Are there any exemptions?

It is proposed that New Zealand Defence Force vehicles, motorcycles, mopeds, traction engines, mechanically propelled rollers, tractors, and machines for farm or roading operations would not have to comply with the proposed rule.

This is because these vehicles are either special purpose vehicles or lack appropriate standards for their vehicle type. As well, they make up an insignificant proportion of the fleet.

What if there are no standards for a vehicle?

If relevant emissions standards in one of the four jurisdictions for a particular class of vehicle does not exist, or if a vehicle was manufactured before an emission standard took effect in its country of manufacture, that vehicle would not have to comply with a vehicle emissions standard. If that vehicle meets ‘type approval’ in one of the four jurisdictions it will meet the requirements of the proposed rule.

Will the rule apply to vehicles of all ages imported into New Zealand?

Only vehicles manufactured from 1990 would have to comply with the proposed Emissions Rule.

The rule would not apply to vehicles manufactured before 1990 although emissions standards have been in force in some jurisdictions since the early 1970s.

In the early 1990s standards for particulate matter PM10 (a carcinogenic) were added to all jurisdictions emissions standards, making the standards more comprehensive.

The number of vehicles currently imported to New Zealand that were constructed before 1990 is very small (around 3% of imports). Excluding these vehicles from the proposed Emissions Rule means that classic and vintage car enthusiasts will not have to seek a special exemption.

How will consumers know if the vehicle meets the standards?

Vehicles must be certified to relevant standards before they can be registered here. If a vehicle is first registered in New Zealand after this rule come into force, it will meet the requirements of this rule.

Vehicles registered before this date may have been constructed to a relevant standard but do not need to be checked for compliance with this rule.

Will there be penalties for non-compliance?

Certifiers are responsible for ensuring that vehicles entering New Zealand meet the requirements set out in the proposed Emissions Rule. It is proposed that Schedule 1 of the Land Transport (Offences and Penalties) Regulations 1999 be amended. This would make it an offence against the Land Transport Act 1998 not to comply with the requirements of the proposed rule. The proposed maximum infringement fee would be $500.

Because of the links between the proposed rule and the Vehicle Standards Compliance Rule \[2002], new penalties affecting vehicle owners would not be required. A penalty for operating a vehicle that is not registered already exists in section 5(2) of the Transport (Vehicle and Driver Registration and Licensing Act) 1986. This states that a person who uses any motor vehicle or permits any motor vehicle to be used that is not registered commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding $1000.
