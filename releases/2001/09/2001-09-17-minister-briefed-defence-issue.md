The Minister of Defence Mark Burton says an internal issue at Defence Headquarters in Wellington is being handled in an appropriate manner.

"I was notified late last week and this morning received a fuller briefing from the Chief of Defence Force Carey Adamson," Mark Burton said.

"This matter relates to command and document management issues – both of these clearly fall within the responsibility of the CDF.

"CDF has advised me that he instigated an investigation last Thursday. This is being carried out by the Inspector-General, who is in charge of the care and handling of all documents in Defence.

"I am fully satisfied that this is the appropriate course of action for CDF to follow.

"Rather than wait for the outcome of the investigation, Opposition MPs will no doubt level all sorts of accusations. That is unfortunate.

"It is not appropriate for me to make any further comment on this matter," Mark Burton said.
