Prime Minister Helen Clark confirmed today that the meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government (CHOGM) to be held in Brisbane from 6 to 9 October has been postponed because many Commonwealth leaders are unable to attend.

"The Queen was to tour New Zealand after her visit to Australia. The timing of the Royal Tour was organised in conjunction with the meeting of CHOGM. On this basis I am advising the Palace that the New Zealand Government is happy to reschedule the Queen's tour here for a future date.

"The postponement of CHOGM is disappointing for the Australian hosts and Commonwealth members. Considerable effort over many months has gone into organising what promised to be a productive meeting, with big issues to discuss.  
"The terrorist attacks in the US, however, mean that many leaders have pressing problems to address at this time, on both the international and domestic fronts. Almost every nation has stood up to be counted in the international effort against terrorism, and nations are assessing the impact of recent events on their own economies and societies.  
"I understand that discussions are currently underway on whether the CHOGM meeting and the Royal tour can be rescheduled for early next year," Helen Clark said.
