The Cabinet Policy Committee discussed proposals relating to Air New Zealand.

The government is concerned to ensure that any actions it takes or decisions it makes are in the best interests of Air New Zealand. The situation surrounding Air New Zealand is somewhat fluid. In those circumstances the government is not in a position to make final decisions.

There will be no further comment.
