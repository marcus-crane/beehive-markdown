20 September 2001Media Release

Anderton welcomes the light fantastic  
Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton today announced that Auckland lighting company Selecon NZ Ltd has received $100,000 from Industry New Zealand's Business Growth Fund to increase export sales.

The funds will be used to develop a distribution network, manage planned growth and secure patents for a new lighting system.

"This is a major investment in an innovative New Zealand company which will generate increased export sales, a stronger local business sector and ultimately jobs," said Jim Anderton.

"Many New Zealand businesses are innovative with excellent ideas, but they lack capacity and capital to expand and become larger. Grants like this which are matched dollar for dollar by the company, will make significant returns to our economy.

"I urge all New Zealand companies with innovative ideas that can contribute to our economic growth to contact Industry New Zealand to see how they can play their part in the jobs machine," said Jim Anderton.

Selecon NZ Ltd has lit up Harrods, the Sydney Opera House and New York's Museum of Modern Art.

The Business Growth Fund is one of the range of measures promised in the Alliance pre election policy "Partnership 2000" which outlined practical ways to create jobs and make the New Zealand economy perform better.
