Regional Development Jim Anderton and Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia today announced an Industry New Zealand Business Growth grant of $100,000 that will contribute to plans for an extra 300 jobs created by boosting forest planting on the East Coast.

The grant to forest management company, Ngati Porou Whanui Forests Ltd will assist a joint venture with Hansol NZ Ltd to plant an extra 10,000 hectares of Ngati Porou marginal land.

Jim Anderton said the Business Growth Service and Fund offers specialist expertise, information and support for firms with high growth and is an integral part of the Labour/Alliance Coalition Government's industry and regional growth programme.

"This service was designed to help individual businesses and groups of businesss which can be sectors, clusters or iwi based groupings. Forestry is one of New Zealand's greatest opportunities and we need to do everything we can to capitalise on forestry to create jobs and build stronger regional economies," said Jim Anderton.

Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said he supports any strategic alliances that develop Maori resources, particularly under-utilised resources, for the betterment of the community.

"Ngati Porou Whanui Forest Ltd is a local company set up to benefit local people. It is the commercial vehicle that allows landowners to enter into forestry, without risking their land. This joint venture that the Government is supporting is great news because it will create training and employment opportunities almost immediately and inject $3-5 million into the largely Maori community," said Mr Horomia.

The project will initiate commercial forestry ventures, provide sustainable economic development, sustainable employment, regional development, control of soil erosion, plus conservation and enhancement of existing indigenous forests.

The Business Growth Fund is one of the range of measures promised in the Alliance pre election policy "Partnership 2000" which outlined practical ways to create jobs and make the New Zealand economy perform better.
