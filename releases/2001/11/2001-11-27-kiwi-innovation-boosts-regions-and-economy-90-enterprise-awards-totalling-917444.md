Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton today announced 90 Industry New Zealand Enterprise Awards totalling $917,444 at the Regional Development Conference in Rotorua.

"The interest in the regional development conference shows how strong our economy is at the moment, particularly in the regions," said Jim Anderton.

“Our economy is driven by regional businesses and industries and these Industry New Zealand Enterprise Awards show how strong innovation and enterprise is across all of New Zealand.”

“New Zealanders are the most innovative and enterprising people in the world. A recent survey ranked New Zealanders second in the world for entrepreneurial activity behind Mexico. Maori ranked as highly entrepreneurial,” said Jim Anderton.

These awards take the number of recipients who have received grants to 361 since September 2000.

Entrepreneurs or small to medium sized business owners can receive a maximum of $20,000 from an Industry New Zealand Enterprise Award, which can be used to fund up to 50 percent of the cost of a project.

Small businesses and entrepreneurs interested in Enterprise Awards and other services and support from Industry New Zealand can look at the website www.industrynz.govt.nz.
