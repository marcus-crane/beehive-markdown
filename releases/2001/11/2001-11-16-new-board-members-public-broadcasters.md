New board members for Radio New Zealand Ltd and Television New Zealand Ltd have been announced by Broadcasting Minister Marian Hobbs.

Joining the Radio New Zealand board are Upper Moutere winemaker and former RNZ journalist, Judy Finn and Alison Timms former acting Chief Executive of the NZ Fire Service.

The appointments are for three years and are new board positions. They will increase membership to seven once a third appointment is made to replace Richard Raynor who completed his term.

"We are taking the opportunity to enhance the skills base of the RNZ board," Marian Hobbs said. "Judy Finn's diverse background as a former director of TVNZ, Tourism Nelson and the NZ Wine Guild plus her broadcasting knowledge will add value.

"Alison Timms' senior management positions in the public service has given her an excellent understanding of the the relationship between central government, the entities it owns and the delivery of services to its constituents. This will be particularly useful to the RNZ board as it implements its charter."

The new member of the TVNZ Board is Sarah Reeves, an Auckland lawyer. She replaces Vivien Bridgwater who has completed her term.

Sarah Reeves, of Te Atiawa/Puketapu affiliation, is being appointed for an initial 12-month period while ministers consider the future board requirements of TVNZ as a crown company.

"Sarah Reeves brings to the board sound commercial law skills and an appreciation of business financing and administration," Marian Hobbs said.
