Cabinet has authorised the setting up of a ministerial committee to work with the Minister of Conservation on coordinating government responses on the potential Ruapehu lahar issue.  
The Committee comprises Conservation Minister Sandra Lee, Civil Defence and Police Minister George Hawkins, Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia and Defence Minister Mark Burton.  
"Public safety has always been a prime consideration in decision-making on this issue," said Ms Lee. "If the Ruapehu Crater Lake continues filling at the current rate, a lahar is expected to occur sometime between late 2002 and the end of 2005."  
"While the volcanic nature of New Zealand is part of what makes this country special, the downside is that lahars and eruptions are natural occurrences that can be managed but not controlled, just as we can not control nature. However we do have an enormous range of technology and information to help us predict, prepare and minimise risk to public safety. Lahars do occur from time to time on Ruapehu, and what we are putting in place will help address all potential lahar incidents in the future."  
Ms Lee said the Committee would not only help coordinate planned responses to a lahar but also provide advice on the need, if any, for actions such as intervention at the crater rim which has been sought by some interested parties but opposed by others, and it will continue to monitor work on new warning systems as their installation proceeds. The Minister of Conservation is expected to decide by the end of November whether there should be crater rim intervention.  
"The advice from other Ministers, along with the considerable other information I have already received, will help ensure that future decisions I am required to make under the National Parks Act on mitigating a potential lahar are as well informed as is possible," Ms Lee said.  
Last year, the Conservation Minister approved the installation of an alarm system to provide advance warning of a lahar. The Minister also decided DOC should proceed with the construction of a bund (stop bank) on the lower slopes of the mountain to reduce any likelihood of the lahar leaving the Whangaehu River and flowing into the Tongariro River.  
Ms Lee said emergency response planning is "well advanced", involving a number of agencies including the Police, local authorities and DOC.  
A major exercise of the alarm system and the response is scheduled for April 2002.
