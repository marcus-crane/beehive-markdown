Appointment of Crown Solicitor for Tasman

Attorney-General Margaret Wilson, has announced the appointment of Mr Glen Marshall as Crown Solicitor for Tasman. The appointment encompasses the warrants for Crown Solicitor at Nelson and at Blenheim which had previously been held within the Crown Law Office.  
Crown Solicitors are legal practitioners (generally in private practice) whose main responsibility is to conduct the prosecution of jury trials in the High Court and District Courts for the Crown. They present cases in Court on the basis of the evidence gathered by the Police for the committal process. They do not act for defendants or accused. Crown Solicitors also give independent advice to the Police on prosecutions and may give advice or make representations on government department prosecutions. Crown Solicitors also have partners and employees who do some of their work.  
Mr Marshall graduated from Canterbury University and was admitted to the bar at the Supreme Court in Nelson in 1980. He was initially employed with Vautier Connery and Partners in Motueka but later moved to Hamilton, first with Charles Fletcher and later with Tanner, Fitzgerald and Getty.  
In 1986 Mr Marshall went into practice as a barrister sole and in 1994 was appointed a member of the Hamilton Crown Prosecutors Panel. He is currently with the firm of Almao & Kellaway as a Crown Prosecutor. He is to join the partnership of Pitt & Moore in Nelson.  
Mr Marshall’s appointment takes effect on 1 February 2002
