Education Minister Trevor Mallard today released the final report from the Early Childhood Education Strategic Plan Working Group.

The working group was established by the Minister in August 2000 to advise the Government about the development of a Strategic Plan for early childhood education.

“The early childhood sector has grown rapidly in the last 10 years. It was time to reflect on where the sector was at and develop a road map to guide the future direction of early childhood education in New Zealand,” Trevor Mallard said.

“The report proposes comprehensive changes for the ECE sector.

“It complements the Government key aim to increase participation in quality early childhood education.

“Investment in education at an early age is a vital aspect of the Government’s push to provide all New Zealanders with opportunities for excellence.

“The Government will fully consider all the recommendations in the report, and use it as the basis of the Government’s Strategic Plan for Early Childhood Education planned for publication next year. The response will be incorporated into next year’s Budget process.

“Members of the working group have shown energy and passion in putting this report together. I would like to thank the chair Dr Anne Meade and members of the working group for their work over the last year,” Trevor Mallard said.
