St John’s latest community project will provide an invaluable lifeline for many older New Zealanders, Senior Citizens Minister Lianne Dalziel said today.

Lianne Dalziel launched the “Caring Caller” community project at a function in Christchurch today. Caring Caller, a daily telephone contact service, is new to Christchurch.

“This is an excellent service for Christchurch, and it should come as no surprise that St John is behind it. What makes this so wonderful is the fact that not only does it support older people living alone, it is available to people of all ages, and it is free.

“The service provides not only a daily safeguard against emergency situations, but also for many older people it can help preven them from feeling isolated. Firm friendships, albeit over the phone, can be established with Caring Callers.

“I certainly commend St John for extending this service to Christchurch and I encourage anyone interested in sparing a few minutes a day, to sign up as a Caring Caller.”
