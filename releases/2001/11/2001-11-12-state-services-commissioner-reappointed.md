Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today the appointment of Michael Wintringham as State Services Commissioner for a further term of two years from May 2002, and the appointment of Tony Hartevelt as Deputy State Services Commissioner for a five-year term.

“I invited Mr Wintringham to continue in the office for a further term to complete the changes in the State Services Commission he has been leading.

“He is a highly experienced and very able public servant who was first appointed State Services Commissioner in 1997.

“Mr Wintringham has provided significant leadership in the rebuilding of the public service values and standards.

“Over the next two years Mr Wintringham will complete a number of major projects, including the e-government programme and public service senior management development.

“It is important, particularly as we head into an election year, that the public service is led by a person who understands the delicate balance between being responsive to the requirements of the government of the day, and guarding the political neutrality of the public service. I am therefore very pleased that Mr Wintringham agreed to the further two-year term.

“As Deputy State Services Commissioner Tony Hartevelt plays an important supporting role to the State Services Commissioner. Mr Hartevelt’s work experience within the wider state and private sectors complements Mr Wintringham’s mainly public service background.

“Mr Hartevelt’s career has included financial and general management experience in the private sector, and over 14 years of consulting for Pricewaterhouse Coopers Ltd,” Helen Clark said.
