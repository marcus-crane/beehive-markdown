Jim and Carole Anderton have worked with Women’s Service Club Zonta to create a new rose garden at the historic Vogel House.

The Zonta Club of the Hutt area, celebrated their 25th anniversary today by opening the new garden. Rose plants came from all 32 New Zealand Zonta Clubs and they have been planted them in the grounds of Vogel House. The new Zonta Rose Garden is expected to be a feature of the landscaping of the gardens in years to come.

Zonta is a worldwide service organisation of executives in business and the professions working together to advance the status of women.

In the Hutt area Zonta provides tertiary awards to young women, is active in helping young women in public affairs, and has an annual woman of the year award.

The Zonta Rose Garden is another improvement to the public grounds of Vogel House organised by landscape gardener Carole Anderton.

Vogel House is now available to the public for weddings and functions.
