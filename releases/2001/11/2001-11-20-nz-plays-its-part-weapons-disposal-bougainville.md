The first batch of fifteen secure containers from New Zealand for weapons disposal will arrive in Bougainville this week, Foreign Affairs Minister Phil Goff said.

“As many as 200 containers may be required and the New Zealand government has allocated $50,000 for their purchase.

“The challenge now lies with the Bougainvilleans – particularly ex-combatants – to show their commitment to the Weapons Disposal Plan as expressed in the Bougainville Peace Agreement.

“I also welcome the news that the Papua New Guinea Cabinet has endorsed Constitutional amendments required to give legal effect to the provisions for autonomy and referendum in the Peace Agreement.

“I commend the efforts of the Papua New Guinea Minister of Bougainville Affairs, Moi Avei, the Bougainville leaders and others who have worked hard to help make this progress.

“This is a further step forward in the development of the peace process since the signing of the agreement, which I witnessed in Arawa on August 30,” Mr Goff said.

The PNG Cabinet endorsement paves the way for Parliament to be recalled this week to discuss the Peace Agreement with relevant Bills to be introduced on December 14.
