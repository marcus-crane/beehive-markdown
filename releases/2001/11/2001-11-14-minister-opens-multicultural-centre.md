Hamilton’s strength in support services for new migrant and refugee communities should be mirrored across all regions, Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel said today.

Speaking at the official opening of the Hamilton Multicultural Services Centre, Lianne Dalziel paid tribute to staff and workers associated with the Refugee and Migrant Service, the Interpreting Service and the Home Tutors Scheme.

“As workers within these services, you not only provide a valuable service for your community, but you are an important first point of contact for many new migrants and resettled refugees in this region.

“I’ve often said that the Labour-Alliance government believes that settlement outcomes are the true measure of the quality of immigration policy, not merely the number of migrants attracted to live in New Zealand.

“If we lose interest in migrants the minute they arrive, then the benefits of migration will not be shared by migrants and the communities within which they settle – which is the key to success. And Hamilton’s rich diversity in its ethnic communities is a wonderful example of the key to that success.

“Hamilton already boasts some excellent achievements in the way it embraces the strengths within its ethnic communities. The strength of support services here for new migrants and refugees is one I would like mirrored across all regions around the country where we have significant migrant and refugee populations. Hamilton is ahead of Auckland in that regard.”

Lianne Dalziel congratulated everyone associated with the Centre and said it was a shining example of effective support services for new migrants and refugees.
