Training Opportunities and Youth Training programmes are helping Maori improve their future prospects, according to an audit report released today by Maori Affairs Minister Hon Parekura Horomia and Associate Minister of Education Steve Maharey.

Training Opportunities and Youth Training programmes provide skills and training to long term unemployed people or those with low or no qualifications.

Mr Horomia said the effectiveness audit, conducted by Te Puni Kokiri, confirmed Mäori had access to, and benefited from, participation in the programmes.

“This audit report has been reassuring and worthwhile. The programmes are opening doors for people who have fallen out of the education system early and are finding it hard to get ahead. We need to assist people to get back into the education system or into the job scene, so that they can give themselves and their whanau a decent life.”

It is a point endorsed by the Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education) Steve Maharey.

“The report shows that Training Opportunities and Youth Training programmes are giving Maori trainees the chance to develop skills and gain credits towards qualifications, which will then help them get jobs or move into further education.

Mr Horomia said while many Maori are making full use of the programmes, there’s still room for improvement.

“The report suggests adjusting contracts and developing services with programme providers to allow them to work with trainees that have multiple barriers, be they educational, financial or personal.”

Recommendations from the audit report will be considered by the Ministerial group currently reviewing the Training Opportunities and Youth Training policies.  
Recommendations

1\. Skill New Zealand and the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) expand the current outcomes approach in contracting regimes to include a range of outcomes that acknowledge trainee preparedness to move into further education, training and employment.  
2\. Support for the ongoing development the sharing of information about successful practices.  
3\. Longer-term contracts are entered into with committed and successful providers to give training organisations more security and allow long-term planning by providers.  
4\. Regional employers, industry groups and iwi organisations be invited as a matter of course to participate in Skill New Zealand’s annual planning round for commissioning and purchasing of Training Opportunities and Youth Training courses.
