New Zealand has followed the United Nations’ lifting of sanctions against Sudan, Foreign Affairs Minister Phil Goff announced today.

“The Security Council acknowledges the steps taken by Sudan to end its support for terrorism and New Zealand is pleased to be able to support the removal of sanctions,” he said.

New Zealand followed the United Nations Security Council’s imposition of sanctions against Sudan in 1996, after it refused to extradite three Egyptians accused of participating in an attempt to kill Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in 1995.

The restrictions required New Zealand to place travel restrictions on members and officials of the Sudanese Government and armed forces, not convene conferences in Sudan and limit certain aircraft travel connected to Sudan.
