A new CD-Rom highlighting hazards on the farm and safe work practices was launched by ACC Minister Lianne Dalziel in Christchurch today.

The CD, put together by ACC and health and safety management consulting company INTAZ, was launched at the Canterbury A & P Show. It will be mailed to 56,000 employers as part of ACC’s drive to reduce injuries from accidents on the farm.

“ACC has developed robust injury prevention initiatives that are deliberately designed to attract the attention of the New Zealand public. These initiatives are directed across the spectrum of all our communities – on the sports field, in the workplace, around the home, and on our roads.

“Thinksafe” is designed to make us all think twice – we might have grown up with the expression “accidents happen” but the bottom line is that most injuries are preventable.”

Lianne Dalziel said that as agriculture was a vital part of New Zealand’s economic well-being, people who worked in the industry were a valuable resource. Seven people died in the nine months to March 2001 and 1581 people were seriously injured enough to need time off work. That compared with the construction sector, which recorded two fatalities and 1530 serious injuries in the same period.

“Farmers are particularly affected by injury, not only because of the loss of income, but also because of difficulties with finding replacement labour. In addition to coping with the actual cost for replacement farm labour, a worker must be found who is familiar with the farm and current farm practices.

“I hope this CD goes some way to helping farmers and their families keep safe and injury free on the farm. As much as I would like to ban accidents, it’s only people who can prevent them – and what better reason than for your personal safety, your family’s security and New Zealand’s economic development.

“I hope this CD acts as a useful reminder of the WorkSmart steps we can all take on the farm.”
