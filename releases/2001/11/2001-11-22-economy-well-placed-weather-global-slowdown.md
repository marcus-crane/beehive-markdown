Finance Minister Michael Cullen said the latest National Bank Regional Trends survey was yet more evidence that New Zealand was well-placed to weather the effects of a global slowdown.

“It shows continuing growth across most regions in the September quarter, and nationwide growth in the September year of 3.4 percent.

“As a trading nation, New Zealand cannot help but be affected by a deterioration in the international outlook. But the strong start to the year will give the economy the resilience and momentum to cope with the downturn, and to take early advantage of a world recovery,” Dr Cullen said.
