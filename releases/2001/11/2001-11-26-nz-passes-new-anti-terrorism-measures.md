Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced that Cabinet today approved Regulations providing tougher measures against specified terrorist organisations.

The new regulations allow New Zealand to meet its commitment to implementing the United Nations anti-terrorism measures outlined in resolution 1373, which are obligatory on all member States.

The Regulations have been passed under the United Nations Act 1946. They are an interim measure until the passing of the Terrorism (Bombings and Financing) Bill expected to be early next year, and will expire at that time or no later than 30 June 2002.

“The United Nations Sanctions (Terrorism Suppression and Afghanistan) Regulations 2001 build on regulations already in place to comply with earlier UN resolutions on Afghanistan.

“The original regulations prohibit dealing in property belonging to, or sending funds to entities designated as terrorists by the United Nations.These new regulations:  
·extend prohibitions to ‘the provision of financial and other related services’ to such entities.  
·create a duty to report suspicions that property belongs to such an entity to the Police  
·create several new criminal offences  
\- collecting funds for use by specified entities  
\-recruitment to organisations to which the regulations apply  
\-participation in any such specified entity.

“The latest regulations set out a list of organisations and individuals designated as terrorists.

“Any new lists issued by the United Nations during the life of the Regulations will be added automatically.

“It is important that New Zealand responds quickly to its international obligations as a member of the United Nations.

“New Zealand is due to report by 27 December 2001 to the UN Security Council’s Counter Terrorism Committee on how it is implementing the resolution. The United Kingdom, Canada and Australia have also made regulations under their corresponding UN Statutes, pending the passage of more comprehensive anti-terrorism legislation.

“The public has until Friday (30 November) to make submissions on the Terrorism Bill. The Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Select Committee hopes to report back to Parliament on the Bill by 1 March 2002.

“The legislation will provide tougher penalties but will also provide clear safeguards to ensure that the measures in the regulations and legislation are directed to terrorist organisations rather than domestic dissident groups.

“While this process is being completed, New Zealand has a duty to comply with Resolution 1373. This will be achieved through these Regulations.

“I note that overwhelmingly New Zealanders support the passing of tougher measures to freeze the assets of suspected terrorist groups. The NBR poll last Friday showed 79% supporting such Government measures and 14% against,” Mr Goff said.
