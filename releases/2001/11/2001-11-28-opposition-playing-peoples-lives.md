November 28 2001Media Statement

National’s opposition to road safety enforcement legislation could put lives at risk, Transport Minister Mark Gosche said today.

Mr Gosche was commenting on National’s stand on the Land Transport (Road Safety Enforcement) Amendment Bill that had its first reading in Parliament this afternoon.

“It’s disgusting that they are playing politics over something so crucial. This legislation is essential to the integrity of the breath testing and speed camera regimes that are at the core of our road safety strategy.

“The holiday season is a vital time of year for enforcing drink driving and speeding offences. Last year 16 people lost their lives and another 235 were seriously injured between December 24 and January 3. Speed was a factor in 22% of those crashes, and alcohol was a factor in 24%. We want this Bill passed by Christmas. As soon as it is passed the speed cameras could be back on the next day.”

“One of the main reasons for this legislation is drafting mistakes made during their time in government. The least National could now do is help put their own mistakes right.”

“The police have their work cut out for them every Christmas. If this legislation is not passed that job will be made much harder this holiday season.”
