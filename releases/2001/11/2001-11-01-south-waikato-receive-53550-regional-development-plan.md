South Waikato will receive $53,550 (including GST) to develop a regional plan through Industry New Zealand’s Regional Partnership Programme, Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton announced today.

This announcement along with one for Nelson/Tasman takes the regions developing strategies to 23 and the amount allocated by Industry New Zealand for the Regional Partnership programme to $2,666,867.

Jim Anderton today welcomed South Waikato’s commitment to developing the local region, “I saw the strength and the opportunities in South Waikato at the end of August when I met with the South Waikato District Council and local businesses.

"The commitment and enthusiasm that local people have for their regions is being turned into sustainable businesses and real jobs through the regional partnerships programme. I am pleased to see South Waikato involved," said Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton.

"I know that in both regions the partnerships will have significant benefit to local people through the Regional Partnerships Programme.

"The ideas that each plan needs will come from local groups, iwi and individuals and then these can be developed into ten year plans," said Jim Anderton.

This will be the last announcement one before the Government’s Regional Development Conference in Rotorua on 29 and 30 November.

Nelson Tasman will also receive $100,000 (including GST) to further develop and refine the production of a regional economic development strategy.

The partnership grants can be up to $100,000 for regional plans and up to $100,000 for making sure the plans can be implemented (capability building). Funding of up to $2 million per region is available to contribute to major regional initiatives that come out of the strategies developed in the first two stages.
