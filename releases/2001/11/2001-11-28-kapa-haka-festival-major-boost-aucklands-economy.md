New Zealand’s major biennial festival of kapa haka is expected to boost Auckland’s economy by $20 million, says the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister with Auckland Issues, Judith Tizard.

The Aotearoa Traditional Mâori Performing Arts Society Festival, Kapa Haka 2002, takes place in Auckland for the first time in twenty years. It will be hosted by Ngati Whatua O Orakei at Bastion Point during the weekend of February 22-24.

“An audience of 100,000 people is expected at the event,” says Judith Tizard. “When we also take into account all the kapa haka groups who will be coming to compete, this will not only be a wonderful exibition of Mâori culture, but will also be a huge injection into Auckland’s economy.”

The Kapa Haka festival, launched tonight in Auckland, has been held every two years since 1972 and celebrates excellence in traditional Mâori performing arts.

“The Aotearoa Traditional Mâori Performing Arts Society has achieved a huge amount in the thirty years this festival has been running,” says Judith Tizard. “The festival sets a very demanding standard and highlights the diversity of traditional and contemporary Mâori performing arts.

“As well as pulling together the best kapa haka groups every two years, the festival creates ongoing opportunities. Reigning kapa haka champions Te Matârae I Orehu spent much of this year touring the successful Ihi FrENZy production around the country with the Royal New Zealand Ballet.

“The 2002 Kapa Haka Festival is an exhilarating addition to Auckland’s summer calendar, which also includes the Volvo Ocean Race. It’s vital that Auckland businesses, city councils, tourist operators and community groups make the most of the opportunities created by these events.”

Judith Tizard’s Labour parliamentary colleague and Ngati Whatua kaumatua Joe Hawke extended a nationwide invitation to the festival. “Ngati Whatua o Orakei are indeed greatly honoured to be hosting Kapa Haka 2002, and we welcome all throughout Aotearoa to this brilliant occasion. Nau mai koutou, haere mai."
