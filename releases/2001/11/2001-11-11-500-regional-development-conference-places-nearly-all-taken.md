“People wanting to go to the Regional Development Conference on 28 and 29 November in Rotorua need to book now,” said Industry and Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton today at the Alliance Conference in Auckland.

“I said we were looking for 500 delegates and already we have 466 delegates and there are still three weeks to go.

“Although we will take as many delegates as we can, it looks like we will need to close registrations and people will miss out,” said Jim Anderton.

The conference – “Regional Development - A Springboard for Growth” – features key local and some international speakers and provides an opportunity to share creative ideas on regional development.

Delegates will also be able to talk to central Government about their priorities and issues.

"I have been on 44 regional visits across New Zealand and it is clear those involved in regional development have a lot to teach each other, and they want an opportunity to network and share their experience and ideas.

“As with all things that New Zealanders are involved in, regional development throughout New Zealand features some truly innovative and creative initiatives.

"Strong regional economies will strengthen our national economy and help to provide sustainable, high income employment for all New Zealanders,” said Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton told the Alliance Conference today.
