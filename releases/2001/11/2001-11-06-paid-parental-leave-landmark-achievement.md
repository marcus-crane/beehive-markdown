Alliance leader Jim Anderton says today’s Government announcement of a paid parental leave scheme is a landmark achievement for the Alliance in Government.

“The Alliance put the issue of paid parental leave firmly on the political agenda as far back as 1996, and Laila Harre has fought very hard to keep it there.

“Achieving twelve weeks paid parental leave in this term in Government has been a priority for the Alliance.

“It is a tribute to the constructive, stable and co-operative nature of this coalition that an agreement on paid parental leave has been achieved.

“The Alliance policy of twelve weeks leave brings New Zealand into line with minimum international standards. It will make a significant difference for thousands of young families every year.

“A fresh set of policy goals for the Alliance will be announced at our conference this weekend,” Jim Anderton said.
