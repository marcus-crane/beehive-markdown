People don’t have to be old to benefit from the Golden Age Lifestyle Expo which was opened in Auckland today by Senior Citizens Minister Lianne Dalziel.

The Expo which runs until Sunday is being held at the New Zealand Expo Centre.

“Like the Government’s Positive Ageing Strategy, this Expo is about encouraging people of all ages to think positively about the years in retirement and older age.

“There’s a lot of value in the motto that the Expo has borrowed from Abraham Lincoln: ‘And in the end, it's not the years in your life. It's the life in your years’.

“The Golden Age Lifestyle Expo is a wonderful example of New Zealanders - people, businesses, and community organisations – celebrating life in all years and all ages. It’s also a wonderful example of the community embracing the concept of Positive Ageing,” Lianne Dalziel said.

The Minister congratulated everyone involved in the Expo and urged people to find time to visit the event.

“The Expo covers everything from dental services to Australian outback safaris. It can’t get much more diverse than that.”
