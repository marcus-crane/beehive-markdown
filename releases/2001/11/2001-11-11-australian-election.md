Prime Minister Helen Clark today congratulated Australian Prime Minister John Howard on his third successive election victory.

Helen Clark said that John Howard is a good friend of New Zealand and she looked forward to continuing to work with him on the ties which bind our two countries.

“New Zealand’s relationship with Australia is very close. Our economies are closely integrated and many of our families have trans-Tasman links, Our two nations work closely on trade, foreign policy, intelligence and defence issues.

“I have met with John Howard on many occasions as Prime Minister and before that as Leader of the Opposition, and value greatly his personal commitment to the ANZAC relationship.”

Helen Clark also praised Australian Labor Party Leader Kim Beazley for his strong campaign in difficult circumstances.

“I know that Kim Beazley would also have been a Prime Minister committed to a strong trans-Tasman relationship. In this election campaign, however, the issues just did not run his way. His concession speech last evening was exceptionally gracious and will win him enormous respect.”

Helen Clark said she looked forward to meeting John Howard again at the annual bilateral talks between the New Zealand and Australian Prime Ministers early in the new year, and at the CHOGM meeting in Brisbane in March.
