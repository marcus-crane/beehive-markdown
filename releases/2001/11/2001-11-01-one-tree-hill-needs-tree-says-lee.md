Conservation Minister Sandra Lee is saddened by suggestions today that the tree on One Tree Hill may not be replaced.  
"One Tree Hill is an Auckland icon. I can't think of a better symbol for Auckland than an appropriate native tree to replace the pine that was lost.  
"A tree on One Tree Hill is an investment in Auckland's identity, an expression of pride in our city, and a reminder that in a densely developed large city, nature is still important.  
"As an Auckland-based MP, I hope political figures in Auckland will continue working together to replace the tree," Sandra Lee said.

"I think that I shall never see  
A billboard lovely as a tree  
Indeed unless the billboards fall  
I'll never see a tree at all!"
