Foreign Minister Phil Goff has welcomed the fact that the trial of the alleged killer of Private Leonard Manning has got underway in the Central Jakarta District Court.

Yacobus Bere faces murder charges relating to the death of Private Manning on July 24, 2000 near the East Timor border with West Timor.

“The indictment read out in the court confirmed that the prosecutor is charging Yacobus Bere with both first degree murder (murder with intent and premeditation) and second degree murder (murder with intent only).

“The court has adjourned the trial to Tuesday 13 November. At this next hearing the defence is expected to respond to the charges against their client.

“New Zealand High Commission staff are attending the trial and report the first session of the trial was conducted in a calm, business-like manner.

“The New Zealand Government reiterates the expectation that justice be done in this matter.

“Our sympathy and thoughts are with Private Manning’s family during this difficult time,” Mr Goff said.
