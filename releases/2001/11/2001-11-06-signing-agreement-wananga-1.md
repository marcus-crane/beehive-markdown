Education Minister Trevor Mallard and Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia today signed an agreement with Te Awamutu-based Te Whare Wananga o Aotearoa following a Waitangi Tribunal report on capital works funding for wananga.

The Ministers said the settlement was significant in that it was recognition that wananga were an integral part of the state tertiary education system.

“However, because wananga were formally established much later than other tertiary institutions, they did not receive the same government assistance early in their existence,” Trevor Mallard said.

“Today’s agreement is about rectifying that so that wananga are on a more even keel with other tertiary institutions.”

The agreement is a full and final settlement with Te Wananga o Aotearoa  
of all of the recommendations from the Waitangi Tribunal’s 1999 report. Agreements are also being developed with Te Whare Wananga o Awanuiarangi and Te Whare Wananga o Raukawa.

Today’s settlement package totals $40 million over 3 years with a suspensory loan facility for three years post 2003. The settlement is contingent upon agreed outcomes in student growth, student retention and infrastructure development that have been agreed in the negotiations between Te Wananga o Aotearoa and the Crown

Parekura Horomia said the agreement was recognition of the place wananga had in the New Zealand tertiary education system.

“The Government believes that wananga are an important part of our state education system. It is important that they be given the support to offer high quality education.

“We regard today’s settlement as an important investment in continued high quality education at Te Whare Wananga o Aotearoa,” Parekura Horomia said.
