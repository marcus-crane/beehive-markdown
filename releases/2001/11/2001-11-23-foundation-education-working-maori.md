Publications launched today by Maori Affairs Minister, Hon Parekura Horomia, show that Skill New Zealand foundation education and vocational training programmes are working for Maori.

Launching the publications – ‘Sharing for Success’ and ‘Making Learning Happen’ – Mr Horomia said not much is known about the areas of education and training where Maori learners are doing well.

“I am delighted to launch Skill New Zealand’s publications. They critically assess and provide information and examples of successful education initiatives for Maori,” Mr Horomia said.

Mr Horomia said that both publications provide strategies and techniques for foundation education and vocational training and were developed as a resource and practical guide for tutors to use.

He said as resource tools they deepen the pool of information on foundation and vocational education, increase understanding of the sector, and promote awareness of the issues that the sector faces.

‘Sharing for Success’  
‘Sharing for Success’ reinforces the value of sharing stories and information. The publication makes it very clear that it is only when we begin to share that we can critically evaluate what is working and why.

“‘Sharing for Success’ reinforces the message of collaboration. Maori and non-Maori can work together to facilitate better results for Maori in education and employment,” Mr Horomia said.

‘Sharing for Success’ was developed as a resource to share insights with those working with Maori learners in foundation education and vocational training. This is the area of the tertiary sector where many programmes administered by Skill New Zealand are targeted. For many Maori these programmes provide a real opportunity for involvement and achievement in tertiary education.

‘Making Learning Happen’  
‘Making Learning Happen’ promotes best practices in the sector and reiterates the importance of quality tutors and quality provision.  
It considers the experience of tutors from around the country and translates those experiences into practical strategies and techniques that the foundation and vocational education sector can use.

‘Making Learning Happen’ explores the practices that work. It finds that the key to success lies in triggering understanding or a sense of purpose within the learner and finds that getting them to the point of understanding typically involves:

\- a commitment to the future of the learner. Tutors must be able to convey an attitude that they have the learners best interests at heart, as well as their belief in the learners fundamental value as people; and

\- accentuating the positive in what learners do in a realistic, but affirming way that in turn re-kindles the learners’ belief in themselves as people and as learners.
