A new gallery at the Otago Museum which celebrates the natural and human history of the region has received a funding boost from the Minister of Tourism.

Mark Burton has approved a grant of $62,125 from the Tourism Facilities Grant programme for the new Southern Land, Southern People Gallery at Otago Museum.

A cheque was presented to the museum today, on behalf of the Minister, by Dunedin North MP Pete Hodgson.

"The new gallery will enhance Otago Museum's reputation as a tourist destination," Mark Burton said.

"It will give both overseas visitors and New Zealanders a greater understanding of the natural and cultural heritage of the Otago region, and do it in an exciting and relevant way.

"This project draws together the Government's commitment to appropriate support for the tourism industry and activities which celebrate our heritage. The Government is proud to be in partnership with the Otago Museum to further develop this initiative," Mark Burton said.
