Health Minister Annette King today launched an information poster, developed by the Australia New Zealand Food Authority, to help consumers understand new food labelling as it is phased in by December next year.

At the launch In Wellington, Mrs King said: “Diet-related disease, such as heart disease, obesity and adult onset diabetes, is increasing in our society. More and more people want information at their fingertips when shopping for food so that they can make healthy choices for themselves and their family.”

Mrs King said that last December Australian health ministers had agreed that nutrition panels should be on all packaged foods so that consumers could see the amount of energy (kilojoules), protein, total fat, saturated fats, total carbohydrate, sugars and sodium in each food.

“The poster will be sent to family doctors, health professionals and retail outlets. I want to thank the New Zealand Nutrition Foundation and the New Zealand Dietetics Association for assistance they gave ANZFA in developing and distributing the poster, and there has been excellent cooperation too from food retailers and manufacturers, including the Grocery Manufacturers Association.

“As well as giving nutritional information, the poster gives us other important information, such as the percentage labelling of key ingredients, so we will know exactly how much meat is in our meat pie or strawberry in our pot of yoghurt. The labels will be good news for people with allergies or intolerances to foods. The main foods, food ingredients or components of them, such as nuts, seafood, fish, milk, gluten, eggs and soybeans, that can cause severe adverse reactions in some people must be declared on the label, however small the amount.“

New Zealand Nutrition Foundation CEO Ms Bronwen Hannay stressed at the launch the importance of a balanced diet. “The new labelling, especially nutrition information panels, means consumers can make good choices. I also urge people to get the latest nutritional advice from their doctor or an accredited practicing dietitian.”
