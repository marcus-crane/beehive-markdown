An open letter from Prime Minister Helen Clark to the people of Japan will be published in major Japanese daily newspapers this week.

The letter, a reassurance measure initiated by Tourism New Zealand, will have a potential audience of nearly seven million people.

“Japan is an important tourism market for New Zealand. It is our third largest visitor market, and one of the largest contributors to our tourism foreign exchange earnings,” Helen Clark said.

“But Japan is also a risk-averse and security conscious nation, and has consequently experienced an adverse reaction to recent global events.

“This has had a dramatic effect on Japanese visitor numbers in New Zealand. The most recent international visitor arrival figures showed a 20 per cent drop in visitor arrivals from Japan to New Zealand for the month of October 2001, compared to October last year.

“The letter is an attempt to reinforce that New Zealand is a peaceful country where Japanese visitors are very welcome.

“The objective is to create a positive and reassuring image about our security, which is important to Japanese,” Helen Clark said.

The letter will appear as a full-page advertisement in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper in Tokyo and Osaka, Chunichi Shimbun in Nagoya and Nishi-nihon Shimbun in Fukuoka later this week. It will also be produced as a large poster for the New Zealand stand at the Japan Association of Travel Agents Travel Mart - the largest trade show in Asia which is being held this week.

New Zealand – a peaceful country

Warm greetings to everyone in Japan from the people of New Zealand.

New Zealand places great emphasis on maintaining peace and safety.

Unfortunately since the traumatic events in the United States in September, people are hesitating before travelling overseas. Even visitors from Japan to New Zealand, known as the safest country in the world, have decreased.

Daily life here however remains peaceful. Visitors from all over the world are able to enjoy unimpeded travel in New Zealand and are still being greeted with a warm welcome by all New Zealanders.

New Zealanders are proud of our pure air and clear water, our rich and abundant nature and our unique Pacific cultures, including that of the Maori people. As you are well aware, New Zealand is a country in the Southern Pacific Ocean. New Zealand is 70% the size of Japan, with a population of 3.8 million, approximately the same population as the Shizuoka Prefecture.

Japan is an extremely important partner for New Zealand, economically, socially and culturally. This partnership is becoming increasingly important for both Japan and New Zealand, in particular concerning trade as well as tourism and educational exchanges.

We hope you will take the opportunity to visit our beautiful country and experience the peaceful and serene experience that is 100% Pure New Zealand.

Yours sincerely

Rt Hon Helen Clark  
Prime Minister of New Zealand
