Nelson/Tasman will receive $100,000 (including GST) to develop a regional plan through Industry New Zealand’s Regional Partnership Programme, Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton announced today.

This announcement along with one for South Waikato takes the regions developing strategies to 23 and the amount allocated by Industry New Zealand for the Regional Partnership programme to $2,666,867.

Jim Anderton today welcomed Nelson/Tasman commitment to developing the local region, “Nelson/Tasman has a dynamic local economy with strengths in tourism, arts and creative industries. Work is already underway and I was pleased to announce the launch of ‘Nelson’s story’ a cultural tourism business development guide developed in Nelson on 10 October”.

“Past Government’s have left local economies out of the national economy loop for years and this Government is here to work with Nelson/Tasman to develop the strengths of its own region.”

"The commitment and enthusiasm that local people have for their regions is being turned into sustainable businesses and real jobs through the Regional Partnerships Programme. I am pleased to see Nelson/Tasman involved," said Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton.

This will be the last partnership announcement before the Government’s Regional Development Conference in Rotorua on 29 and 30 November.

South Waikato will also receive $53,550 (including GST) to further develop and refine the production of a regional economic development strategy.

The partnership grants can be up to $100,000 for regional plans and up to $100,000 for making sure the plans can be implemented (capability building). Funding of up to $2 million per region is available to contribute to major regional initiatives that come out of the strategies developed in the first two stages.
