Jim Anderton, Minister of Customs, today announced the appointment of a Customs Officer to assist East Coast, Manawatu, Hawke’s Bay and Taupo businesses which are importing and exporting.

Damien Nepata will be the Customs FrontLine Officer for the Tairawhiti, Hawke’s Bay, Manawatu, and Taupo regions.

FrontLine was launched earlier this year and creates partnerships between Customs and individual businesses to:  
·Detect prohibited goods and illegal activity  
·Facilitate the movement of legitimate goods  
·Promote community development through International trade

“Frontline means getting Customs Officers out from behind the desks into the workshops and warehouses of New Zealand businesses.

“Customs recognises that to keep trade flowing while still identifying and managing risks, it needs to be involved with businesses long before goods reach the port or airport.

“Local businesses can work with Damien to find out how their company can benefit from a partnership with Customs,” Jim Anderton said.

Damien Nepata joined Customs two years ago in Napier, and since then has worked as an Inspections Officer and in the Intelligence department in Auckland. His first task will be to get to know the businesses in his region and establish contact and determine how FrontLine can be of assistance to them.

The other very important aspect of FrontLine is involving businesses in helping Customs identify suspicious shipments or activities.

“We need as many eyes and ears as possible assisting in protecting NZ from illicit drugs, and other activities such as people smuggling and terrorism,” said Jim Anderton.
