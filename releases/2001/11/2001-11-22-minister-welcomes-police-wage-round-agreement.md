Police Minister George Hawkins says he is very encouraged that agreement has been reached on the proposed terms of the 2001 Police Wage Round settlement.

Police and the Police Association have reached agreement on the proposed terms, which now await ratification by Police Association and PSA members.

The proposed settlement will give police a two percent increase from 1 December this year and a further one percent from 1 December 2002. The term of the agreement is from 1 December 2001 to 30 June 2003.

“This year’s early settlement is an excellent achievement, particularly compared to some of the more contentious and drawn out wage negotiations in recent years. It is a credit to the Police, Police Association and PSA, who have worked constructively to create a fair and timely outcome.

“With wage issues resolved, police can focus on continuing to win the war again crime – and that’s great news for New Zealanders,” said Mr Hawkins.
