News of Infrastructure Auckland’s grant of $40 million towards the North Shore Bus Rapid Transit system has been welcomed by the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister with Auckland Issues, Judith Tizard.

“Every frustrated Aucklander who sits on the northern motorway waiting to get to Auckland or further south will be celebrating tonight.”

The cost of the North Shore Busway is expected to total $176 million. North Shore City Council applied to Infrastructure Auckland for $46 million towards the $56 million cost of five bus stations along the route with car park and passenger drop off facilities.

“While I recognise that this is not the full amount asked for by the North Shore, it’s a really good start that will enable people to properly connect up to the busway along the route,” said Judith Tizard, who is also the Associate Minister of Transport.

“I am very pleased to see Infrastructure Auckland engaging positively in the solutions to Auckland’s traffic problems.

“Every Aucklander knows what the solutions are. It’s up to those who have the funds and the expertise, but because it is no one organisation’s responsibility, it has been difficult in the past to get each organisation to take responsibility.

“Now each group is realising the particular part it has to play in completing Auckland’s transport jigsaw. As the funder of ‘public good infrastructure’, Infrastructure Auckland has a vital role in the delivery of these major projects, because in the first instance few of them are clearly commercial.”

Judith Tizard said today’s news builds on Transport Minister Mark Gosche’s Monday announcement of a Transfund New Zealand grant of $10.64 million for the design of a priority bus lane on the eastern side of the northern motorway, allowing design work of the entire bus lane to be completed.

The North Shore Busway is expected to be operational in 2005 and aims to dramatically reduce bus travel times during rush hours and double passenger transport patronage over the next ten years.
