Jim Anderton told the Alliance Conference he is committed to developing a campaign to support New Zealand made products and services.

“New Zealand is one of the most innovative and entrepreneurial countries in the world and we need to make the most of our strengths,” said Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton today.

“I have asked the Ministry of Economic Development and Industry New Zealand to see what we can do to support a made in New Zealand campaign and promote the innovative work of New Zealanders.

“I want to launch a major campaign early next year that ties in with existing programmes and promotes our innovation and entrepreneurship, both in New Zealand and overseas,” said Jim Anderton.
