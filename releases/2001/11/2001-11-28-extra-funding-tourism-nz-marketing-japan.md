Tourism Minister Mark Burton announced today that the government had allocated a further $2 million to Tourism New Zealand for a major marketing campaign aimed at boosting the number of Japanese tourists visiting New Zealand.

Mark Burton made the announcement from Japan, where he is meeting with senior government and tourism industry officials, and visiting the JATA Travel Mart in Tokyo, where New Zealand has a significant presence.

“Latest projections indicate that the terrorist attacks of 11 September and their aftermath will lead to a significant decline in the number of Japanese tourists visiting New Zealand,” Mark Burton said.

“Over the next four months, up to 21,000 fewer Japanese are expected to visit New Zealand compared with the same period last year, amounting to a total potential loss in export earnings of $97 million.

“Today’s announcement of extra funding for Tourism New Zealand, and associated initiatives by travel wholesalers and Air New Zealand, is about reversing this expected decline and protecting a crucial market sector of the New Zealand tourism industry.

“With a further $2 million available to Tourism New Zealand, it will open the way for private sector support from Japanese travel wholesalers of around $5 million for promotional activity, with a further $5.5 million equivalent contribution from Air New Zealand in the form of airfare reductions. My discussions with senior Japanese industry leaders over the last two days have indicated clearly that there is a desire and willingness to join New Zealand in such a partnership.

“Tourism New Zealand’s campaign will be run in major daily newspapers using the popular and successful 100% Pure New Zealand campaign, aimed at wholesalers and others, and will be New Zealand’s largest ever partnered campaign in Japan.

“This package of initiatives aims to recover about 8,000 of the lost visitors from Japan, with a value to the New Zealand economy of over $37 million in foreign exchange earnings.

“In the weeks since 11 September Tourism New Zealand has already made strenuous efforts to reallocate funding and defer projects in other markets in order to stem the projected losses from the decline in Japanese tourism to New Zealand.

“It is now apparent, however, that a more substantial promotional initiative is required in Japan before opportunities are lost.

“The Prime Minister’s open letter to the people of Japan, assuring them that New Zealand is a safe place to travel, and published in Japanese newspapers today, signals our determination to safeguard this vital tourist market.

“Today’s announcement is the next step, and given the expected payoff in tourist numbers and revenue represents excellent value for money,” Mark Burton said.
