Thursday, 15 November 2001Media Statement

Ms Susan Bathgate has advised me that she will take leave from her role as a member of the Employment Relations Authority from 22 November for 2 weeks. This will give her time to arrange for the reassignment of her case commitments.

The Solicitor-General has informed me that Mr John Upton QC has been retained to provide advice on this matter and it is expected that the advice will be available by the end of the month. I expect to make a decision on it before the end of the 2 week period of Ms Bathgate’s leave.

Unless entirely new and significant matters arise I will be making no further comment before advice from the independent counsel is received.
