A bumper Ruapehu ski season is reflected in the latest accommodation figures from Statistics New Zealand, much to the delight of Tourism Minister and local Member of Parliament, Mark Burton.

"The Ruapehu District faced some tough times during the eruption-disrupted ski seasons of the late 1990's," Mark Burton said. "But our locals are resilient and the region has this year benefited from excellent winter weather.

"A breakdown of the accommodation figures from Statistics New Zealand indicates that visitor numbers in the Ruapehu District have reached record levels. This is great news for the whole region.

"In August, Ruapehu District guest nights exceeded 40,000 for the first time ever, at 41,441. September was even better, with 44,591 guest nights recorded.

"Those figures are 18% and 14% ahead of the same months last year. And the number of visitors has almost tripled compared to the disastrous 1998 season.

"I am confident that the Ruapehu District can build on this year's outstanding ski season and firmly put the 'dark' times of the 90's behind us," Mark Burton said.
