The Government has not agreed to the aerial spraying of all of west Auckland to eradicate painted apple moth, acting Biosecurity Minister Marian Hobbs said today.

Commenting on a story in the New Zealand Herald Marian Hobbs said the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry gave ministers four options for the next stage in eradicating the pest. The government agreed to limited target spraying which was MAF’s preferred option.

The Cabinet will receive a report on the programme by the end of June 2002, or by March 31if effective control of the pest is not achieved.

Any decision on further measures would need Cabinet approval and would involve further community consultation.

The Minister also denied the existence of “secret” documents. The Cabinet Committee paper referred to had been released on request.
