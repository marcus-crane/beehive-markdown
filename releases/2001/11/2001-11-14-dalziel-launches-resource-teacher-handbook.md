A new handbook for resource teachers supporting schools and students with special needs was launched by Associate Education Minister Lianne Dalziel in Hamilton today.

The handbook has been designed as a reference resource for teachers working within the RTLB (Resource Teachers: Learning Behaviour) initiative, to assist them in their work with schools and students with learning and behaviour difficulties. The manual is being distributed to every school, RTLB, and cluster around the country.

Speaking at the launch at Fairfield College, Lianne Dalziel acknowledged that as pioneers of the RTLB concept, Waikato principals and RTLB became unofficial advisors to other clusters around the country, which is why Hamilton was chosen for the launch.

“This handbook has been eagerly awaited by RTLB and clusters alike, and I am confident that they will find its contents extremely useful as they continue to work with students, teachers, schools and families,” Lianne Dalziel said.

The RTLB initiative was clearly valued by clusters and Lianne Dalziel pointed to Massey University research which showed that schools had indicated that their greatest satisfaction with Special Education 2000 initiatives came from the RTLB programme.

“One of the features of the RTLB initiative was government funding for tertiary training which this government has extended to an additional 40 newly appointed RTLB each year up to the year 2004.

“Many of the RTLB did not reduce their workloads when undergoing the training despite the enormous commitment the training entailed and many have furthered their study and professional development since!”
