November 16 2001Media Statement

The Government will commission a study of the market power of New Zealand’s shipping ports, Commerce Minister Paul Swain and Transport Minister Mark Gosche announced today.

The study is a response to concerns most recently raised in the report of the Shipping Industry Review. The review recommended that the Government ask the Commerce Commission to investigate alleged anti-competitive practices and monopoly pricing by port companies.

The Ministers said the study would give the Government an overview of the ports’ market power issue and the information necessary to make an informed decision about the merits of a Commerce Commission inquiry or other possible courses of action. The study would not involve an in-depth analysis of individual ports’ financial performance.

“The study will include consultation with the industry. Comment and information will be sought from ports, port users and other key stakeholders such as unions,” Mr Swain said.

The study will be carried out by an independent consultant jointly contracted by the Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of Transport. The consultant will report directly to Ministers.

It is expected the study will start towards the end of November and take three or four months.
