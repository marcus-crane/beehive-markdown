Health Minister Annette King says she is delighted with the quality of the people she is appointing as chairs of the first elected District Health Boards.

The 21 new boards, with seven elected members and up to four appointed by the Minister, begin meeting from next month.

Mrs King announced the chairs today, and will announce deputy chairs and other appointees in the next few weeks.

“Twelve of the 21 chairs are continuing in their existing roles, and will provide important continuity and experience,” Mrs King said. “As well, two other chairs, Wayne Brown, who will take over as chair of Auckland DHB, and Rick Bettle have had experience chairing other district health boards.

“Of the seven chairs who haven’t previously chaired a DHB, five had previous experience serving on DHBs. Only two appointees are completely new to DHBs, but Stewart Edward (Lakes) and Kay McKelvie (Waitemata) have a strong health or governance background.”

Mrs King thanked those former chairs who had retired or not been reappointed for their past services. “As well, three chairs, Ian Wilson (Waikato), Wayne Brown (Tairawhiti) and Douglas Matheson (Wairarapa) will serve only transitional periods as chairs of those boards. I will eventually be appointing new chairs to all three boards, but it is important to retain their experience in the short term.”

Mrs King said she would be using other appointees to DHB boards to ensure as adequate as possible a balance of gender, ethnicity, age and skills within each board.
