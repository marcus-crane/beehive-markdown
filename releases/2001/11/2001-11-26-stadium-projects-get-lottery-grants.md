Lottery grants of $1.25 million each have been approved for both Christchurch’s Jade Stadium and “Pacific”, the multi-purpose community events centre to be built in Manukau City, Minister responsible for Community and Voluntary Sector and Lottery Grants Board Chair Steve Maharey announced today.

“Jade Stadium has a very important place in the hearts of the people of Canterbury and the wider South Island. I am delighted the Lottery Grants Board has decided to support its major redevelopment.

“Events at the Stadium make a huge contribution to the on-going development of sport in Canterbury at all levels and the Stadium is recognised as a major component of the community’s leisure infrastructure.

“The improvements to the stadium are also critical to Christchurch’s economic health, for without them, international rugby, cricket and other events would have almost certainly by-passed the city.”

Mr Maharey said the Pacific development will also have economic spin-offs.

“Not only will it provide for the recreational, visual and performing arts, and cultural needs of the communities of Manukau, its scale and design is such it will attract national and international attention making it a magnet for tourist activity,” he said.

In other decisions, a $400,000 grant was approved for the new Ronald McDonald House being built in Christchurch, Steve Maharey said.
