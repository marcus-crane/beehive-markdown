Acting Minister of Defence Phil Goff has asked New Zealand First leader Winston Peters and ACT MP Owen Jennings to substantiate allegations made regarding New Zealand First MP Ron Mark’s military files.

“Mr Peters claimed in today’s New Zealand Herald that he has information that showed Major-General Maurice Dodson has passed material about Mr Mark to Government members.

“And in the House today, Mr Jennings alleged the army’s PR firm's staff had threatened Mr Mark with the release of personal details from his army file.

“These are serious allegations and I ask Mr Jennings and Mr Peters to substantiate these claims.

“If they can be substantiated I will act on them immediately. However a failure to deliver on these allegations by the members would suggest this is simply politicking and that they have no foundation.

“It is a classic case of people who make serious allegations needing to put up or shut up,” Mr Goff said.
