The Government has increased the size of individual scholarships available for next year’s Prime Minister’s Sport Scholarships, Sports Fitness and Leisure Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

The change means athletes receiving scholarships will get their full tertiary fees paid - rather than to a set limit as it was this year.

The Prime Minister’s Scholarships are a government initiative established this year. Their aim is to assist young athletes wanting to pursue academic studies alongside their sporting careers.

The Government has committed $9 million over a 3-year period to the programme, as well as $16 million to the establishment of the New Zealand Academy of Sport.

“This year already, 289 athletes have received the financial support needed to balance tertiary study and their elite level sport development. That’s likely to increase to more than 500 next year. The Government is committed to helping New Zealanders achieve excellence. The scholarship programme is a practical way of supporting young New Zealanders who have the potential to be our sporting greats,” Trevor Mallard said.

“As well as help with fees, athletes are also entitled to an allowance if studying more than part time. Next year both carded and non-carded athletes, at all levels, will benefit from a $1000 increase in these living allowances. The allowances range from $6000 for a level one carded athlete, to $1000 for a carded athlete on level four.

Scholarships are available to athletes who are either currently carded by their national sport organisation and accessing services linked to the New Zealand Academy of Sport or athletes from non-carded sports who are prioritised by their national sport organisation.

Non-carded athletes, wishing to apply, should contact their national sport organisation before the due date.

Scholarships are available for athletes wishing to study at tertiary level within a range of New Zealand institutions, including universities, polytechnics, colleges of education and nationally recognised apprenticeship schemes.

“The opportunity to support more young athletes next year is a great development for this programme. Any young person with the drive to succeed should grasp the opportunity with both hands,” Trevor Mallard said.

Athletes applying for next year’s scholarships need to do so by 1 December.

Those who know they are eligible are encouraged to contact their New Zealand Academy of Sport center. If uncertain, they can contact their National Sport Organisation, or visit the Academy website at www.nzas.org.nz.
