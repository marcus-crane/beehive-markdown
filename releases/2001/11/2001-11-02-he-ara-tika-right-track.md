A thousand Maori secondary students will take part in a new mentoring initiative that will be officially launched by Associate Education Minister Parekura Horomia at Horowhenua College today (Friday 2 November).

He Ara Tika is about building the self-esteem and sense of identity of young Maori, with the ultimate aim of encouraging the students to succeed at school or go on to further education.

Mr Horomia said he is very pleased with the cooperative and community-based focus of the new mentoring scheme.

“He Ara Tika is a project between students and their families, schools and established Maori organisations. The community organisations will recruit, train and support volunteers to work with students, either one to one or in small groups.“

Mr Horomia said He Ara Tika is about ensuring young people are guided along the right path for themselves.“Mentoring is a very natural thing for Maori.

"It is reflected in many of our values such as ‘tiaki’, ‘manaaki’ and ‘tuakana-teina’. The mentors will be mostly volunteers who come from the wider Maori community, older and experienced people who have a passion and a vision to help young Maori to make the most of their educational opportunities.”

Next year, the programme will see 17 Maori providers, working with 340 mentors, working with 1000 Maori students in 105 secondary schools or kura kaupapa Maori. “The work of the mentors depend on the needs of the students. It is essential that they trust and respect each other. Mentors will help set goals, which could be academic and personal.”

Mr Horomia said he is pleased that the Ministry of Education is working on a performance management programme to assess both the students and the mentors.

“We need to know what’s working, what isn’t, and any improvements that need to be made. The programme will track key student data such as participation, retention and achievement, as well as enhanced student self-esteem. ”
