“A vital report on the future of Antarctica,” is how Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton described a report he released yesterday at Parliament entitled ‘Ross Sea Region - a state of the environment report for the Ross Sea Region in Antarctica.’

“This report will form the basis of decisions for Antarctica on: sustainability for fishing; protection of whales; expanding tourism; and global climate change.

“It will provide a scientific basis for future management of the region by pulling together information on the state of the region’s natural, physical and historic features, and values.

“New Zealand needs to continue to monitor the human activities that have led to changes in the Antarctic and possible threats for the future, such as over- fishing, whaling, tourism, and global climate change.

“I congratulate Antarctica New Zealand, as well as New Zealand and international scientists who have contributed towards the Report. It is an excellent piece of work on what is an important and unique region,” said Jim Anderton.

Collecting and publishing information about the Ross Sea Region State of the Environment was announced in 1997, and has been managed by Antarctica New Zealand.

International Interest in the project is high as the report summarises current knowledge of the Ross Sea region.
