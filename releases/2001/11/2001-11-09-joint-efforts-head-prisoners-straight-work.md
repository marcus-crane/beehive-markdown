Another piece in the jigsaw of an effective prison system is in place after Minister of Corrections Matt Robson launched the Straight for Work guidebook today.

The booklet gives practical advice on switching from crime to work.

Ex-offender job promoters Fresh Start created Straight for Work.

"Fresh Start demonstrate how we can work together to help offenders grab one of the main lifelines to a new life - a job.

"A job is probably the best rehabilitative tool of all. Straight for Work will be invaluable for former offenders."

Nearly half of the prisoners released in the 1998/1999 year had been reconvicted within 12 months. Almost thirty per cent had been reimprisoned.

Fresh Start works with ex-inmates who commit to:  
\* Not reoffending  
\* Remaining drug-free  
\* Fully disclosing convictions to employers

"Tackling reoffending is a major front in our battle to reduce crime and reversing the spiralling rise in our prison population.

"Keeping ex-inmates out of trouble will boost community safety by heading off the harm they could otherwise wreak in our homes, streets and businesses.

"It will also enable us to steer resources away from prison-building, towards more rehabilitation programmes behind bars. And eventually it will free up money to create truly safe communities - through spending on education, housing and employment."

"Replacing crime with work is crucial and organisations such as Fresh Start make a vital contribution.

"Support for this is widely-based. At the recent business forum I was approached by employers who backed the Labour Alliance Coalition's efforts to build an effective Corrections system.

"They want to help ex-inmates into jobs. We will work alongside them to deepen the pool of useful employment for those leaving prison.

"That will enhance the Department's work with inmates in prisons."

During 1998/99 inmates spent 4.7 million hours build a work ethic and marketable skills in a range of initiatives including:

\* Private sector placements from compost to computer assembly  
\* Prison maintenance  
\* Land-based work on farms and in forests  
\* Community services including flood relief and track clearing

"I applaud the work Fresh Start does to pick up the ball when inmates are released. And I am hugely encouraged to see our business community also keen to play their part.

"Together, we can get the job done."
