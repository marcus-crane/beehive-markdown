Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott will visit New Zealand from 30 November to 4 December.

John Prescott will meet ministers in Wellington on Monday. He will make calls on Helen Clark and Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton, and attend a cabinet luncheon. He will also call on the Leader of the Opposition.  
Helen Clark said that in his current role as First Minister of State, Mr Prescott has a key role in a project aimed at improving the co-ordination of British government activity.  
“I am looking forward to discussing this with him, as the New Zealand government is also working to improve co-ordination between state agencies.  
“Mr Prescott has also been closely involved with negotiations over the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. He will be giving an address in Wellington on climate change and the Kyoto Protocol, as well as discussing the issues with ministers and officials.  
“On Saturday Mr Prescott will visit the GBR Challenge America’s Cup base at the Viaduct Basin in Auckland.  
“On Sunday he will address the New Zealand Labour Party’s annual conference, which is being held on Auckland’s North Shore.  
“John Prescott is a good friend to New Zealand, which he has visited frequently since the early 1950s. He was last here in 1997, when he also met ministers on environmental issues,” Helen Clark said.
