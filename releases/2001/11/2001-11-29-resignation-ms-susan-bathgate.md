Resignation of Ms Susan Bathgate

Labour Minister Margaret Wilson said today she had received the resignation of Ms Susan Bathgate from the Employment Relations Authority.

Margaret Wilson said that Susan Bathgate had stated in her letter of resignation that the political attacks have reached the point where they hamper her ongoing effectiveness as a member of the Employment Relations Authority.

“She expressed concern that the attacks would endanger the ongoing effectiveness of the authority.

“I have accepted Ms Bathgate’s resignation, but asked her to complete any outstanding matters before she leaves the position.

“Ms Bathgate’s resignation means there is now no purpose in my further consideration of whether or not there should be a formal inquiry.

“Ms Bathgate will continue to hold her warrant on the Complaints Review Tribunal. The warrant will continue until the tribunal is disestablished on 31 December.

“Ms Bathgate will continue to hold her warrant as a member of the Social Security Appeal Authority,” Margaret Wilson said.
