A new programme to assist job seekers to develop a career in the arts and creative industries was launched in Auckland today by Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey and Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard.

Pathways to Arts and Cultural Employment (PACE) is a new Work and Income programme for job seekers who list their preferred career choice within the arts and creative industries. (More information: www.winz.govt.nz/find\_a\_job/arts\_culture.html)

“PACE does two very important things,” Steve Maharey said today. “Firstly, it identifies the vital role that Work and Income plays in supporting artists and creative clients to develop their careers, and fully equips case managers with a customised service for these clients. Secondly, it allows artists and cultural workers to register ‘art’ as their first career choice.”

“PACE recognises that art is real work,” said Judith Tizard. “It builds on the commitment made in Labour’s Uniquely New Zealand policy to make a career in the arts and creative industries a viable option.”

Under the PACE programme, job seekers and case managers will have access to information about assistance and funding available for arts and cultural workers available nationwide and in their region. The information will be used to compile personalised Job Seeker Agreements which defines the support beneficiaries can expect from Work and Income to help them get a job, and the obligations they must fulfil to receive a benefit.

“PACE continues the shift that Work and Income has been making from a ‘one size fits all’ approach to a regionally-focused, flexible service where case managers work one-on-one with clients giving them the skills they need to move into a job and to stay there.

“The PACE programme starts on Monday and will build across the country. Regional Commissioners will be working closely with the cultural sector in their communities to refine the support that can made available locally,” said Steve Maharey.

In some regions, notably Dunedin, Nelson and central Auckland, Work and Income and arts organisations have already formed relationships to offer specialised assistance to budding artists, such as the Dunedin Arts Employment Service (a partnership between Dunedin Work & Income and The Higher Trust), and the Arts Work Project in Auckland (a partnership between Work & Income, Creative New Zealand, Auckland City Council, Auckland New Ventures, Artists’ Alliance and the Community Employment Group).

Steve Maharey and Judith Tizard launched PACE at Kingsland Central, a studio and showroom in Auckland, where the exhibition “Show Up” showcases the eclectic works of artists, architects, designers, sculptors, fashion designers and other cultural workers who have participated in the Arts Work professional development programme, New Space. They met with two emerging artists, Sparrow Phillips and Paulus McKinnon, who have been helped by Work and Income NZ to develop a sustainable career in the arts. Paulus was last week named by the National Business Review as an artist for collectors to invest in.

Judith Tizard said PACE builds on the investment the Government made in New Zealand’s arts and culture sector last year with the Cultural Recovery Package.

“The Government is committed to ensuring that our individual artists are supported as well as our major arts institutions. For many artists, income can often be the breaking-point issue over whether or not to continue with art. That’s not a decision any emerging artist should have to make. PACE will help them to develop the skills they need to become full-time artists.”

Steve Maharey said he is pleased that Work and Income is part of a cross-Government approach to developing the creative sector, which includes increased support for Creative New Zealand and the Film and Music Commissions, arts participation in Modern Apprenticeships and the Incubator Development Unit.

From Monday, PACE postcards will be available in all Work and Income offices promoting the assistance that can now be provided to people wanting to develop a career in the creative industries. A PACE resource pack, comprising nationwide and region-specific information about the support available, will also be available to clients and case managers from Monday.

PACE - Frequently Asked Questions(FAQs)

1.What are ‘cultural workers’?

As well as ‘artists’ who are often thought of as those involved in creating original works, this term also incorporates practitioners involved in arts administration, preservation, tuition production and curation. It would also include those working in the design sectors.

All cultural workers are being given access to the provisions of PACE in line with the Government’s commitment to supporting all aspects of the arts and creative industries.

2.How does PACE build on Labour’s Uniquely New Zealand policy?

The development of PACE follows a commitment in Labour’s Uniquely New Zealand manifesto to better support developing artists who demonstrate ability and an intent to follow an arts-based career. It recognises that arts practitioners were uncomfortable with being singled out for special treatment and therefore customises services already offered by Work and Income NZ to be specifically responsive to cultural workers.

The Government has brought about a shift of focus within Work and Income NZ. The resulting change in the way that case workers now address the employment goals of clients, combined with the resources developed to support the delivery of PACE, will address many of the issues that lay behind the development of Uniquely New Zealand. The Government will closely monitor the effectiveness of PACE.

The Arts and Culture Policy of the Alliance also pledged to explore a range of options for supporting artists to “get away from the notion that starving in garrets … is good for artists”. The Alliance policy pledges to ensure “that social support structures are built around \[artists’] activities by making sure that they have the facilities they need”.

3.Does PACE exempt cultural workers from Work and Income NZ’s work-test requirements?

No, cultural workers will still have to meet the legislated work-test requirements which includes being willing and able to take up paid employment. However, cultural workers will be referred to jobs that match their skills and employment goals.

Importantly though, PACE also recognises that a majority of cultural workers generate their own work and income opportunities. With PACE, case workers will work with arts practitioners to identify these opportunities and how to progress them. The agreed steps that the cultural worker will undertake to realise these opportunities in their Job Seeker Agreement. While the cultural worker is undertaking these steps and progressing their career development they will be considered to be meeting their work-test requirements.

4\. What is a Job Seeker Agreement?

Job Seeker Agreements are agreements between unemployment beneficiaries and Work and Income NZ. They set out the what will be required to assist job seekers to move into paid employment, and the support that they can expect from Work and Income NZ to achieve this. Job Seeker Agreements are negotiated between job seekers and their case manager and are individually tailored to take into account the particular needs of the job seekers and the opportunities which exist in their communities/preferred career.

5.Can established arts practitioners access the provisions of PACE?

To access PACE a person must qualify to be registered as unemployed with Work and Income NZ. They must also be able meet the work-test requirements including being willing and able to take up paid employment.
