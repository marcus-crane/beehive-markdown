The Labour-Alliance Government is well down the track of rebuilding New Zealand as the great place to be a child that it once was, says Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey.

Steve Maharey was joined by Commissioner for Children Roger McClay, Save the Children Fund NZ Executive President Martyh Turner, and school children at Parliament today to launch the Fund publication, Children’s Rights: A Second Chance. The publication was to be have been launced at a special United Natios General Assembly on Children in New York in September but this was post-poned following the terrorist attacks.

Steve Maharey said work by the Government to develop an Agenda for Children, and other initiatives, would pay real dividends for children and would ensure their voices are heard when decisions that affect them are being made.

“The Government is committed to improving the lives of all young New Zealanders. Particularly those suffering the effects of poverty, violence and inequality.

“Children’s Rights: A Second Chance challenges the nations of the world to do better by their children and young people. We have already stated our commitment to building a better place for children in our society.

"Work begun by the Labour-Alliance Government in this regard includes:

\* developing an Agenda for Children setting out our vision for children, drawing on more than 3500 submissions made by New Zealand children;

\* increasing the powers and resources of the Commissioner for Children to raise the profile of human rights for children and give them a more effective advocate; and,

\* providing significant additional funding for Child, Youth and Family to enable them to provide professional services to children and families in crisis and to support organisations working to build strong communities.

“More remains to be done, but we have made a good start,” Steve Maharey said.
