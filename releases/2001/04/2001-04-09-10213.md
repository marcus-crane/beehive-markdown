The Minister of Maori Affairs the Hon Parekura Horomia has reiterated his position on allocation of the Maori Fisheries assets as stated at the Ohu Kaimoana annual hui on Saturday.

"I said on Saturday and I repeat, that allocation needs to happen. It needs to be sooner than later. I also said that the details of allocation and how it happens is the responsibility of the Commission.

"I did not say that the Commission should consider holding on to nearly $1 billion of Maori fisheries assets as reported in the Dominion this morning."

The Minister was concerned that the misreporting of his statement has already caused concern to some parties.

"I have had to contact the Treaty Tribes Coalition this afternoon to clarify my position on allocation and to assure them that my position has not changed," said Mr Horomia.

"Fortunately most media have accurately reported what I said on this issue."
