Ceremonies marking the Treaty Settlement of the Pouakani people take place today.

The Pouakani people and representatives of the government, the opposition and the Office of Treaty Settlements gather today at Mokai marae near the Pureora forest in the central North Island.

The Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, Margaret Wilson says the celebrations bring to an end a grievance pursued through the courts throughout the 20th century. Hearings at the Waitangi Tribunal began in 1989, and the Tribunal report was published in 1993.

"Today's events will give us all a chance to remember all those who have contributed to this settlement, especially those who have passed away," said Ms Wilson. "But now the past can be left in the past. We look ahead to the new and constructive relationship possible between the Crown and Pouakani descendants in the years to come".
