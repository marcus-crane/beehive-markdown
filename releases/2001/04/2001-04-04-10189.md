The Minister of Broadcasting, Marian Hobbs, says the alliance finalised today by TVNZ andTelstraSaturn is welcome progress towards TVNZ being able to offer digital television services to the public.

"The detail surrounding TVNZ's decision to sign contracts with TelstraSaturn was an operational matter for the Board but I appreciate the fact that both parties have kept me informed as they worked their way towards this result," Marian Hobbs said.

"It is a more cost-effective and efficient means for TVNZ to develop its digital strategy than the proposal we were confronted with on becoming the government."
