An Order prohibiting imports of trout has been extended three months to July 7, the Minister for the Environment, Marian Hobbs, said today.

The extension is to allow time for some aspects of the Conservation (Protection of Trout as a Non-commercial Species) Amendment Bill to be resolved.

The Order was extended last year for 9 months and this further extension is necessary to allow further consideration of the Bill, Marian Hobbs said.

"We would have preferred to have completed our work" she added, "but the issues are difficult so we are allowing ourselves more time."

The Order prohibits the importation of trout flesh except for private consignments of less than 10 kg that are not intended for sale. Specific exceptions are also allowed with the consent of the Minister of Conservation.

The Order was first introduced by the previous Government in 1998 because of public concerns about the impacts of trade in trout flesh on the sustainability of the North Island trout resource. Until then imports of trout flesh were not permitted because no import health standard had been developed, a situation which changed in 1998.
