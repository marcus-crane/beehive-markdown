Wood processing Industry strategy meeting

Wednesday 11 April  
Vogel House

The Wood Processing Industry Steering Group has its second major meeting tomorrow, Wednesday 11 April, at Vogel House.

Minister for Industry and Regional Development Jim Anderton said this meeting will recommend actions to Government on solving the forestry skill shortage and on an industry research science and technology as well as investment strategy.

Since the first meeting industry representatives have made comment on commercial issues they face and there have been discussions with Government about the barriers identified at the earlier meeting two months ago.

"I have sought the industry's support and input on what this Labour Alliance Government needs to do to create more jobs and boost this industry and we are well on the way to recommending solutions," said Jim Anderton.

The first meeting was 25 January. Further meetings are intended this year.
