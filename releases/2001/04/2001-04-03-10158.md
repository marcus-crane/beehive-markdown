"Internet shopping will become safer for consumers because of the new eMarketing Standards Authority which will have web retailers meeting higher standards of returns and guarantees, and providing privacy safeguards," said Jim Anderton, Acting Consumer Affairs Minister launching the new Authority.

The eMarketing Standards Authority is an initiative of the Direct Marketing Association and the Advertising Standards Authority and supported by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs.

"Consumers will be able to have more faith in the growing e-retailing industry as the new Authority has a code which its members will be asked to adhere to," said Jim Anderton.

"An improvement in standards is essential. Government cannot do this alone. It requires partnerships and industry involvement," said Jim Anderton.

"Only three weeks ago I released findings from a survey of internet shopping sites that showed that many New Zealand web retailers are not providing enough information to safeguard consumer rights," said Jim Anderton.

"This new Authority is an important part of the solution to these problems that the Ministry of Consumer Affairs has identified," said Jim Anderton.

The eMSA will advise customers on how to resolve disputes with any of its members.

The strategy is consistent with the Government's e-commerce strategy which sets out to develop consumer confidence by addressing security, privacy and consumer protection concerns.

"New Zealanders judge the performance of government and of the economy based on things like the price and availability of goods, and how well our rights have been safeguarded. This means that regulation and protection for consumers in all areas of commerce is essential," said Jim Anderton.
