The Minister for the Environment, Marian Hobbs, says she needs to consider the points made by the Maori Affairs Select Committee on Lake Omapere before making an official response.

But she has visited the lake and been fully briefed by the Trustees, the Northland Regional Council, the National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research and the Ministry for the Environment.

"I have asked the Ministry to work with Trustees and the regional council to come up with a long-term solution," she said.

"I now understand that the lake may not 'turn over' this summer as predicted, and this provides an opportunity to look at management options before next summer.

"I agree that the state of this lake is a cause for much sadness for the Ngapuhi and the people of Northland.

"With a very limited budget the Ministry for the Environment cannot pay for all the environmental damage created throughout New Zealand. But we can work with regional and territorial councils and other ministries to seek a solution."
