Prime Minister Helen Clark and Veterans' Affairs Minister Mark Burton today announced measures to improve services and support for New Zealand war veterans.

"For some years there has been slow progress on addressing the needs and concerns of veterans. Today we are doing something about that.

"Today's announcements recognise their special needs and restore a sense of fairness.

"The announcements cover:  
„h Better health treatment for veterans and their families  
„h A one-stop-shop service in the Office of Veterans' Affairs for the provision of health and other services to veterans  
„h Ex gratia payments to ex-POWs and other internees held by Japan  
„h New legislation which gives formal recognition to the special status of veterans  
„h Provision for veterans of working age to be in employment without losing their pensions.

"The government is presenting a co-ordinated package which gives veterans the treatment and recognition they are entitled to.

"The government is consulting on the issue of further medallic recognition to veterans with service since World War Two," Helen Clark and Mark Burton said.
