"Roger Sowry and Bob Simcock's claims that the Government is making low income people's lives worse off are wrong and dishonest," said Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton today.

"No one is worse off as a result of the CPI increase to NZ Superannuation.

"The Labour Alliance Coalition Government has simply ensured that around 1300 Superannuitants whose income would have passed over the eligibility threshold can keep their community services cards.

"No one else is affected, no one is losing eligibility.

"The Labour Alliance Coalition Government, is now reviewing the Community Services Card and looking at better ways to provide health care to those least able to afford it. The problems we are facing with the card show some of the problems there are with branding some people as 'poor' by issuing cards and targeting.

"Anyone such as Green Sue Bradford or National's Bob Simcock who wants to spend an extra $15 million on applying the Community Services Card who don't get it now should say how they we would pay for it. What other services would Ms Bradford and Mr Simcock cut to increase Community Services card eligibility to people who are not eligible currently?

"The National Party in Government reduced benefits, let superannuation and the minimum wage decline in value, and had an employment contract regime that hurt the lowest paid. It is hypocritical for the National Party to weep crocodile tears, especially when no low income person is worse off," said Jim Anderton.
