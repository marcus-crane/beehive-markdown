"People in Canterbury will be able to make up for being away from the head offices of government departments through easier access to government services through the internet", said Deputy Prime Minister and MP for Wigram Jim Anderton.

Jim Anderton was welcoming the Labour Alliance Coalition Governments e-government's plan announced this morning.

The strategy - titled government.nz@your.service - was released by Prime Minister Helen Clark and State Services Minister Trevor Mallard this morning. It sets out a plan to work towards New Zealand being a world leader in e-government with priorities of convenience, satisfaction, integration, efficiency and participation.

"One of our advantages is New Zealanders' quick adaption to new technology and new ways of doing things. The government can help lead the way by making sure we take advantage of new information opportunities.

"We will make government information and services easily accessible electronically through steps in the e-government strategy," said Jim Anderton.

The e-government strategy is available at: www.e-government.govt.nz.
