The Minister of Police, George Hawkins, is pleased with the Police Commissioner's decision to recognise senior constables with the addition of a chevron (white "v") to their epaulettes. The change was announced on Friday by the Police Commissioner, Rob Robinson. It takes effect from 1 June and will mean that, for the first time, senior constables are distinguishable from ordinary constables. Mr Hawkins said the change was something he had been encouraging since he was appointed Minister of Police. "As I have travelled around New Zealand and spoken with police, I have realised that it is impossible to distinguish a senior constable from a constable at first sight. Achieving the designation of senior constable is no mean feat - it requires at least fourteen years in the Police and I think a visual recognition of that status is long overdue." "This is an excellent step, giving recognition where it is due" said Mr Hawkins.
