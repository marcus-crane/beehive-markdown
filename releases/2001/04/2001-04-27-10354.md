ACIL Consulting, in association with Farrier Swier Consulting, have been commissioned to assist the Government's review of the New Zealand gas sector.

Minister of Energy Pete Hodgson announced the review and its terms of reference in March. Tenders were sought from independent consultancies in April.

The review will assess the overall efficiency of the gas sector and the current regulatory environment. It will also cover issues relating to gas take-or-pay contracts, including their effect on the efficiency of gas use.

Mr Hodgson said the Government had decided to use a consultancy to ensure it got international quality advice on the technically complex issues in the gas sector.

ACIL and Farrier Swier will approach key industry participants to obtain information and hear their views.

"After ACIL has reported, I will publicly release a discussion paper seeking submissions from the public and interested parties," Mr Hodgson said.

Following this consultation, policy options are expected to be considered by the Government later in 2001.
