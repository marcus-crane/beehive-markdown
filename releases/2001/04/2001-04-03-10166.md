The Minister of Broadcasting, Marian Hobbs, has dismissed Opposition claims that the government is exploring a range of taxes to fund public broadcasting .

"When the previous government abolished the broadcasting fee we in Opposition promised to investigate funding alternatives," Ms Hobbs said. "Among options suggested were a levy on advertising, cinema tickets and videos which have been used overseas. We found such measures would not raise the required finance and would cripple the very creative industries we were trying to boost. Therefore we rejected them.

"Several months ago I informed the advertising industry that the notion of a levy on advertising was not a goer and Katherine Rich, if she had been in contact with that industry, would know that.

"There are a number of inter-related papers covering form, function and funding of broadcasting that are close to resolution. They certainly do not involve the imposition of taxes or levies."
