"An excellent start to addressing barriers to developing our manufacturing industry", is how Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton described the first meeting of the Government initiated Manufacturing Industry Sector Steering Group held today.

"Members of the industry are committed to creating jobs and doing the best to improve New Zealand's economy," said Jim Anderton.

Over 20 sector and government representatives met at Vogel House in constructive discussions.  
The agenda included presentations on the manufacturing industry and its issues, as well as discussion on what role government might play in addressing these issues.

Issues identified at the meeting included infrastructural costs and compliance costs. These issues will now be pursued as the agenda of this industry steering group.

"This Manufacturing Industry Sector Steering Group is part of Labour Alliance Coalition Government's strategic development programme to maximise the economic potential of each sector and minimise roadblocks to development," said Jim Anderton.

"The industry development programme fits alongside the Business Forums that have been run in Auckland, Hamilton, and Christchurch," said Jim Anderton.

The programme uses the 'whole of government' approach of having industry sector representatives and relevant government agencies meeting co-operatively, and follows the successful work of the Wood Processing Industry Steering Group.

"The Government is actively identifying job-rich, high-skill, high-value export industries with the potential for growth, such as manufacturing," said Jim Anderton.

Other industries that will be addressed include, apparel and textile, tourism, Creative arts, especially music and film and knowledge industries such as ICT and bio-technology.
