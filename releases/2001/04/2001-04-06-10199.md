Conservation Minister Sandra Lee is calling for nominations to fill casual vacancies on New Zealand's 14-conservation boards.

The vacancies have occurred because between two and four members of the respective boards are ending their current three year terms. The deadline for nominations is 7 May.

"Conservation boards provide the public with an opportunity to contribute to the conservation and protection of New Zealand’s natural and historic heritage," Ms Lee said.

"These boards represent the long term public interest, including the interest of tangata whenua, in conservation. They are closely involved with planning of conservation initiatives in their area, and policy development which affects the management of public conservation areas," she said.

"I encourage people with suitable skills and an interest in conservation in New Zealand to apply for a position. The work that board members do is essential in terms of providing valuable community input," Ms Lee said.
