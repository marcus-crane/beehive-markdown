Labour and the Alliance have agreed that provision will be made for Paid Parental Leave in this year's budget, Women's Affairs Minister Laila Harré confirmed today.

She said the coalition partners were discussing policy details so it would be premature to speculate on the final shape of the scheme.

"There is agreement between Labour and the Alliance that Paid Parental Leave will feature in the 2001/2002 budget.

"We have always said that we will only reach an agreement if we can be sure it will provide adequate support for new mothers and their babies. We have made extremely good progress so far."
