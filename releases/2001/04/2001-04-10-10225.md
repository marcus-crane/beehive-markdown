The Minister of Police, George Hawkins said today that Tony Ryall should congratulate New Zealand Police on the encouraging crime statistics released yesterday.

The statistics show that recorded crime is at a 10 year low and the proportion of crimes resolved at a 12 year high.

George Hawkins said New Zealanders should breathe a sigh of relief that the Police were not forced to try and fight crime under a government including Mr Ryall. Before the last election the National Party made it clear that they would slash the Police budget by $24 million dollars.

"You can't take funds off Police and expect results - this Government has already injected over $100 million into Policing since we came to office and we are seeing the fruits of that investment.

Already we have seen:  
An 18 year low in recorded burglaries;  
The best burglary resolution rates in 12 years;  
Improved burglary response times after the Government insisted that burglaries be attended to within 24 hours.

The latest statistics tell us that Police have also achieved:  
A 10 year low in recorded crime;  
The best crime resolution rates for 12 years;  
Over 3000 fewer liquor-related offences - a drop of 68%, which shows that Police are taking a tougher line on such "entry-level" offences.

"Together with Police, this Government is keeping its promise to get tough on crime" said George Hawkins "that is great news for law-abiding New Zealanders and bad news for crooks."
