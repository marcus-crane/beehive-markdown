The Ministry of Social Policy and the State Services Commission have been directed to prepare structural and organisational options for the new Ministry of Social Development for discussion with the new Chief Executive once he or she is appointed.

Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey says that the decision to refocus the Department of Work and income into a Ministry of Social Development is a timely one.

"This decision is part of a wider review of the effectiveness and efficiency of structures within the public service. It is about getting better alignment between the policy and operational arms, it is about a focus on outcomes, and it is about a strategic and whole of government approach."

"As my colleague Trevor Mallard has noted, this is not about the kinds of restructuring we saw under the previous Government, it is not about re-branding, or staff having to re-apply for their jobs. It is about the effective delivery of policy to Government, and services to the public."

" I am committed to a much enhanced strategic social policy function with a whole of government role. There are a number of structural and organisational possibilities that need to be considered on how the vital strategic social policy function sits within the new arrangements."

"Both the Department of Work and Income and the Ministry of Social Policy have come along way over the past 12 months. This announcement should be seen as an opportunity to build on those gains."
