The Minister of Police, George Hawkins, has welcomed the announcement today of proposed changes to the structure of the Police Executive. The Commissioner of Police, Rob Robinson, announced the proposals today, which include reintroduction of the rank of Assistant Commissioner. Four new Assistant Commissioners will be appointed, including an Assistant Commissioner Northern and an Assistant Commissioner Southern who will each be responsible for co ordinating and managing a set of Police Districts. The proposed changes would see the Police Executive reduced from its current 24 members to 12 members, by September this year. Mr Hawkins has been pushing for change to the Police Executive since Rob Robinson was appointed as Police Commissioner last year. "I am pleased that the Commissioner has been responsive on that issue" said Mr Hawkins. "He has done the work necessary to make police management more efficient". Mr Hawkins said he is looking forward to seeing how the new streamlined operation will perform once details have been finalised."
