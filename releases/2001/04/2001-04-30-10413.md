The Minister of Police, George Hawkins, has confirmed that he will discuss the Police Employment Rehabilitation Fund ("PERF") Scheme with the Commissioner of Police, Rob Robinson, this afternoon.

The PERF Scheme provides a lump sum payment upon exit from the Police, by Police who are medically or psychologically unfit for duty. The scheme is funded through employee and employer contributions.

The Police Minister's concerns have been raised by revelations that a Mangakino constable convicted of rape has applied to benefit under the PERF scheme.

"The PERF Scheme is designed to help those who are physically or psychologically unfit for duty. It was never designed to benefit those who have been put behind bars" said Mr Hawkins.

"The people who need help are the victims of crimes not the perpetrators of crime".
