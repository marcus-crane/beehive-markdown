Corrections Minister Anne Tolley and Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith say there will be great benefits for the Canterbury rebuild, following the official opening of the Rolleston Working Prison Construction Yard by Prime Minister John Key.

A partnership between Corrections and Housing New Zealand will see prisoners and community offenders’ refurbish 150 earthquake-damaged red zones houses over the next five years.

More than 400 offenders will gain training in construction skills such as carpentry, plastering, painting and decorating, and roofing and joinery.

“I’m delighted that prisoners and community offenders will be contributing to the Canterbury rebuild, while learning important skills which will also be of benefit to the region post-sentence. We also know that offenders with employment and skills training are less likely to reoffend, which means fewer victims of crime,” Mrs Tolley says.

“This is another important step in making Rolleston a full working prison, with prisoners spending 40 hours a week actively engaged in education, training and employment,” she says.

“This innovative partnership between Housing and Corrections is about simultaneously rebuilding homes and lives. Rather than demolishing damaged homes, we are going to repair and refit them so they can be re-used,” Dr Smith says.

“This partnership will see 30 homes refurbished each year over the five year programme at a cost of around $20,000 each. Once repaired the homes will be relocated to Housing New Zealand properties in Canterbury,” he says.

“The housing challenge in Christchurch is huge and requires that we take action on every possible front. This new initiative is part of the $1.6 billion investment in Housing New Zealand that involves 700 new homes and the repair of 5,000 damaged houses. The Government, through the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, is also providing the Canterbury Earthquake Temporary Accommodation Service, temporary housing villages and partnering with the private sector to provide workers’ accommodation. These are in addition to our support to get the private sector rebuild moving with fast-tracked plan changes and support to fix Christchurch’s building regulation problems,” he says.

“This unique project is an exciting part of the rebuild in that it is recycling existing homes, saving money and helping equip prisoners with the skills they need to rebuild their lives once their sentences are complete,” he says.
