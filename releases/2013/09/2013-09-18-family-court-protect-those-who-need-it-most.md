Justice Minister Judith Collins says the most significant changes to New Zealand’s Family Court in thirty years are one step closer to becoming law.

Ms Collins says the Family Court Proceedings Reform Bill, which passed its Committee of the Whole House reading in Parliament today, puts children and vulnerable people first.

“This Bill aims to ensure a modern, accessible and sustainable family justice system – a system that supports children and vulnerable people who most need the Family Court’s protection,” Ms Collins says. 

“Our reforms support people to more quickly resolve disputes out of court where appropriate. They will ensure the court focuses on the most vulnerable and the most serious matters.”

Ms Collins says the Bill also brings much needed clarity to court processes and rules – users will have more certainty and it will be easier for them to understand and navigate the court system.

“The new Family Dispute Resolution (FDR) service will reduce the stress on children and families by avoiding the conflict, delays and expense that court processes can involve,” Ms Collins says.

“Improved information, a simplified three-track court system, and easy-to-use forms will be introduced to reduce the need for a lawyer’s involvement in routine matters. A Judge will still be able to appoint a lawyer for a child if there are concerns for the child’s safety, and the appointment is necessary.”

Ms Collins says if we can keep people out of the Family Court, except where they should be in the Family Court, we are going to have more time for those matters that we should be dealing with.

The Bill is expected to have its Third Reading in Parliament later this year.
