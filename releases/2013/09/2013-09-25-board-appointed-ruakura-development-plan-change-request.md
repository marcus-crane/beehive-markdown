Environment Minister Amy Adams has today announced the members of an independent Board of Inquiry to consider the Ruakura Development Plan Change Request.

Last month, Ms Adams referred the request to a Board of Inquiry, following the Environmental Protection Authority’s recommendation that the plan change is part of a proposal of national significance.

The plan change is for new planning policies and rules to enable mixed-use development at Ruakura near Hamilton. This includes an inland port, industrial activities, commercial uses, medium-density housing and an integrated network of green space.

The Board of Inquiry will be chaired by Environment Court Judge Melanie Harland. The other Board members are Environment Commissioner Jim Hodges, planning consultant Jenny Hudson and engineer Gerry Te Kapa Coates.

Judge Harland was admitted to the Bar in 1985 and is experienced in criminal, civil, resource management and public law.

She was appointed as a fulltime Environment Judge in September 2009.

Mr Hodges was appointed as an Environment Commissioner in July 2013, and has about 40 years’ experience as a professional engineer, in both civil and environmental engineering including infrastructure development.

He has engineering expertise in water supply, wastewater, stormwater, site development, and industrial projects.

Mr Harland has been actively involved in statutory plan preparation, including the Auckland Region Three Waters Strategic Plan; the Auckland Regional Plan: Air, Land and Water; the New Zealand Coastal Policy Statement; the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management; and the National Infrastructure Plan.

Ms Hudson is an accredited independent hearings commissioner and resource management consultant with significant planning experience.

She has experience in commercial, residential, roading, district plan policy and utility projects. This has included private plan change applications for land use changes, Notices of Requirement and resource consent applications for mixed use developments.

Mr Te Kapa Coates is an experienced engineer with a specialist background in electrical engineering.

He has worked across a wide range of fields including energy, transport policy and infrastructure development as a consultant, advisor and decision-maker.

Mr Te Kapa Coates has acted in a large number of governance roles including as a board member for Land Transport New Zealand and the NZ Centre for Advanced Engineering, as chair of the NZ Wind Energy Association and Marine Energy Deployment Fund Evaluation Panel, as well as his current role as director of Waihao Holdings Limited.
