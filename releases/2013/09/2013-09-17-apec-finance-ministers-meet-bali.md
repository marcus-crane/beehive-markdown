Associate Minister of Finance Jonathan Coleman is attending this week’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) annual meeting of Finance Ministers.

“It is important that APEC Finance Ministers come together to discuss the key economic development issues facing the Asia-Pacific region,” says Dr Coleman.

"New Zealand actively engages with our regional partners. APEC provides a crucial forum where nations can discuss issues, share new ideas and build common approaches.

“Sustainable economic development, increased trade and investment, and economic cooperation and integration are key pillars to developing prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region.

“New Zealand is well placed to benefit from that prosperity, with growing numbers of consumers wanting access to the goods and services we produce.”

Dr Coleman will hold a number of bilateral meetings with his counterparts from a range of countries.

The annual APEC meeting of Finance Ministers takes place in Bali on 20 September 2013. This year’s meeting will include sessions on the macro-economic outlook, supporting open trade, investment in infrastructure to enhance growth and development, and inclusiveness in accessing financial services.

APEC, a forum of 21 nations from the Asia-Pacific region, aims to promote free trade and economic cooperation in the region. The APEC economies comprise around 53% of global GDP and 44% of world trade.
