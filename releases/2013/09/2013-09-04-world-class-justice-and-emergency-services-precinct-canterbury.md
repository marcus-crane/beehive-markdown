Justice Minister Judith Collins today announced the release of the expressions of interest tender for the main contractor for the Christchurch Justice and Emergency Services Precinct.

“The Government’s investment in a project of this scale, which is likely to be in the hundreds of millions, will be a huge boost to Canterbury’s recovery,” Ms Collins says.

“The release of the request for expressions of interest will be much anticipated and welcome news to the construction sector.”

The Precinct marks a bringing together of all justice and emergency response agencies in one location. It will house courtrooms, Police, Corrections and a purpose-built, state of the art Emergency Operations Centre.

Ms Collins says, when finished, the Precinct will be one of the largest multi-agency government co-location projects in New Zealand history.  

“The Precinct will return justice and emergency services to Christchurch’s central business district, not just to their pre-earthquake state, but to a position of innovation, collaboration and new ways of working together.”

The project will deliver 40,000 square metres of space and at its peak will employ over 400 construction personnel. It is estimated 2000 people will work at the Precinct or use its services every day.

The preferred contractor will be appointed by the Ministry of Justice by the end of the year. Work is scheduled to begin on site in February 2014.
