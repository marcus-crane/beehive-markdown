ACC Minister Judith Collins is welcoming the Motorcycle Safety Advisory Council’s plans for several projects over the coming months to reduce the injury rate of motorcyclists.

Ms Collins met with Chair of the Motorcycle Safety Advisory Council Mark Gilbert recently to discuss the Council’s upcoming projects.

“I’m pleased the Council will commence several large scale projects over the next 18 months to benefit motorcycle owners,” Ms Collins says.

The projects will include research into optimal lighting configurations for motorcycles and road engineering projects.

“It’s important the Council continues its work with ACC to bring down the injury rate for motorcyclists which will ultimately have the flow on effect of reduced levies for motorcycle owners.”

Ministry of Transport figures show motorcyclists are 20 times more at risk of being involved in a fatal or serious crash than car drivers per kilometre driven.

The costs of injuries to motorcycle and moped riders have increased significantly since 2002.

On average, ACC receives 3.8 times as many claims per 10,000 motorcycles as cars, and each claim will cost 3.1 times as much over its life than claims for occupants of cars.

Ms Collins acknowledges and thanks Council Chair Mark Gilbert and ACC for their continued commitment to reducing injury rates.
