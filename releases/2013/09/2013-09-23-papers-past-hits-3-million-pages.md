National Library’s digital drive today celebrates the online publication of the three millionth newspaper page on Papers Past says Internal Affairs Minister Chris Tremain.

“From the gold rush frenzy of Central Otago to the trenches of Gallipoli, Papers Past allows anyone to revisit our history at the click of a mouse. Information on our ancestors’ lives from birth to grave, and every news-worthy step in between, can be found with a simple search,” says Mr Tremain.

“It’s become an essential resource for academics, family historians, school students, casual readers and newspaper columnists. For example, short-listed Booker Prize author, Eleanor Catton acknowledges her use of Papers Past in the forward to *The Luminaries*.

Papers Past is the National Library’s online collection of digitised New Zealand newspapers and periodicals, incorporating 83 separate titles dating from 1839 to1945. It has become one of the leading research resources in New Zealand, with well over 100,000 page views every day.

”Much of the original content digitised on Papers Past is held by the Alexander Turnbull Library but one of the most impressive aspects of the programme has been the partnerships forged with local libraries, historical societies and regional newspapers to preserve in perpetuity their historic papers.”

The latest batch of newspapers to be digitised and bring up the three millionth page on Papers Past are: *Timaru Herald* (1901-1920), *Mt Ida Chronicle* (1869-1926), *Oamaru Mail* (1876-1920) and *King Country Chronicle* (1906-1920).
