Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew has congratulated New Zealand’s district health boards for all pledging to support the national patient safety campaign *Open for better care*.

“I launched the *Open* campaign to reduce harm from falls, surgery, healthcare associated infections and medication in May, and I am very pleased that all DHBs have now formally given their support to the campaign by signing the pledge certificate,” Mrs Goodhew said.

*Open for better care* is being led and coordinated by the Health Quality & Safety Commission and rolled out regionally and locally by DHBs and other health providers.  It will run until mid-2015.

“The Government is committed to making our health system safer and reducing harm to patients,” said Mrs Goodhew. 

“DHBs are already doing a lot of things to improve quality and safety but there’s no room for complacency.  We know from the reports we get each year that patients are still being harmed in the course of receiving health care, sometimes with serious or long-term consequences.

“I’m looking forward to seeing a number of real changes and improvements come out of the *Open* campaign.”
